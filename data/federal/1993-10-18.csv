2,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I wish to inform the House that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) will be absent from question time today and for the remainder of the week. In his absence, questions should be addressed to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is also absent from question time today and tomorrow. In his absence, questions should be addressed to the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee). NA",11

4,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. I refer the minister to media reports and to a statement by Mr Rick Farley of the National Farmers Federation that he had been categorically assured by six ministers and the Prime Minister that pastoral leases would extinguish native title. Was the minister one of those ministers who gave Mr Farley that assurance, and does he stand by that assurance?",11
5,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. These matters are currently before cabinet and, as everyone in this chamber would understand, it is not appropriate for me to go into the detail of those issues. Native Title",11
6,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question also relates to proposed native title legislation. Has the Prime Minister seen media reports that the proposed native title legislation will force coexistence with native title on the holders of pastoral leases and will interfere with the public's right to enjoy beaches and recreational areas? Can the Prime Minister inform the House of· the government's intention in relation to these matters?,11
7,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen a fair bit of comment over the last 24 hours in relation to both of these questions. It is, by and large, premised on a misunderstanding and a failure to comprehend many of the issues which are germane to the subject. Cabinet will be considering, over the course of this week, questions relating to the native title bill, including these questions of pastoral leases. I think the misunderstanding primarily occurs from the basis that the only leases affected here are leases which are invalid-not valid leases. These are not the thousands of valid leases of before 1975. I noticed some journalist· today ran these numbers of 50,000 leases. That is not true. It is only leases that are invalid by virtue of the Racial Discrimination Act or, in the unlikely event, those before 1975 that may be invalid. As far as we understand, in the category 1975 to 1993, there are only 11 leases. The question of rights arises from the Commonwealth legislation permitting the validity. The Commonwealth legislation can apply only to those leases which are invalid, that is, invalid by virtue of the Racial Discrimination Act. Valid leases which have been issued by states before the Racial Discrimination Act came into force are of course simply valid leases within which the Commonwealth does not have an issue. In other words, the vast majority of pastoral leases in the country which we believe have been validly issued are not affected by the proposed bill at all. But there may be a few pastoral leases which have been issued since 1975 over previous vacant Crown land and which could conceivably be invalid because of the Racial Discrimination Act or because requirements were not met , when the leases were issued. There is also the possibility of some leases issued before 1975 being invalid. The invalidity in these cases would be on grounds unconnected with the Racial Discrimination Act, which was not then in force-the point I made a moment ago-but connected to some other rights as yet unidentified in law flowing from the existence of native title. My advice is that the chance of such rights existing and leading to the invalidity of leases is extremely small, but this small possibility remains. The bill will provide: Any leases which might be found to be invalid in any circumstances connected with the existence of native title can be validated by the government that issued themthey will be totally validand .all rights connected with them will be totally valid and will always take precedence over any native title rights. I will amplify the point. When these leases are .validated they are valid. They are valid for the whole range of the interests and rights which a pastoralist would be accorded under the lease. The only question here is whether 9r not there are any residual native title rights. That is not co-ownership, as some people have tried to express it; it is a coexistence of rights. The rights of a pastoralist to enter into an economic use for the land, say, for mining, are exactly the same rights as would be proposed under such an arrangement and as would have existed in. any of the past years were the leases to be valid. In other words, the rights of the pastoralist take primacy because it is a valid lease. I can also say that furthermore the validation will be up front. Mr Howard interjecting",11
8,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are a couple of simple concepts there you ought to be able to get across. Dr Hewson interjecting,12
9,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On this I am not confused, dear boy, I can tell you. The only one without a policy here is you. Furthermore, validation will be up front. There is no question of having to go to court to prove validity; nor will there be any need to prove whether any residual native title does or does not exist before validation takes place. Validation is up front. The Commonwealth will give a state the right by virtue of its legislation to validate a lease, and the lessee does not need to prove whether any residual native title rights exist or not. Finally, such legislation would provide that any leases validated under these provisions are capable of renewal when they expire without needing to go through the right of negotiation process. So there is an up-front validation. They are all valid, and so too are the renewal rights, and they do not need to go through a validation process. The only question then at issue is whether in validating these leases we should go so far as to extinguish native title completely and forever or whether we should leave the relationship between lease rights and native title to the common law, which will be the case for all the valid leases which are completely 'unaffected by this legislation. I will amplify that point. All the thousands of valid leases entered into over the years can be litigated in the courts under the common law. An Aboriginal person or persons can say, 'We have residual rights on these leases' and they can argue them before the common law. On the 11 leases we are talking about in question-and maybe a few others before 1975,the question here is: should these leases enjoy the same status as all the other thousands of leases right back to settlement or whenever they were issued? Of course, as an argument in terms of legal consistency, they should. Certainly the Aboriginal people argue that they should. I am advised that on the basis of the Mabo decision at common law pastoral leases extinguish native title to the extent of any inconsistency. That is, they do not extinguish absolutely, they extinguish to the extent of any inconsistency. If an Aboriginal person has the right to argue whether his or her rights run in terms of native title rights in a certain direction on a valid pastoral lease, why should he or she not be able to argue the same case for leases made between 1975 and 1993 and validated by this parliament? The Aboriginal representatives have asked that where we have validated a pastoral lease they should be able to go to court to find out whether any residual native title exists. That matter will be considered by my colleagues in cabinet over the course of today or later this week. Let me just refer to the High Court decision again because I think it is worth going back to some of the primary areas of the law. On page 3 of the judgment per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and MCHugh it says: The acquisition of sovereignty exposed native title to extinguishment by a valid exercise of sovereign power inconsistent with the continued right to enjoy nati ve title. That is, the exercise of sovereign power exposed native title to extinguishment where it was inconsistent with a continued right to enjoy native title. They went on further to say, per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and MCHugh: Where the crown has validly alienated land by granting an interest that is wholly or partially inconsistent with a continuing right to enjoy native title, the title is extinguished to the extent of the inconsistency. Not extinguished for ever and always, with absolutely no rights at all. What they are saying is: ... wholly or partially inconsistent with a continuing right to enjoy native title, the title is extinguished to the extent of the inconsistency. They go on to say: Where the crown has validly and effectively appropriated land to itselfthis is not simply a grant of interest in land over someone else's land but where the crown has validly and effectively appropriated land to itselfand the appropriation is wholly or partially inconsistent with a continuing right to enjoy native the title is extinguished to the extent of the inconsistency. The first quote, to the extent of the inconsistency; the second to the extent of the inconsistency; and the third to the extent of the inconsistency. Let us get this in perspective. What the Commonwealth is simply saying is this: all leases validly issued in the years gone by, thousands of them, have nothing to do with the Racial Discrimination Act, they are valid exercises of the states powers and they are valid leases. Mr Tim Fischer-But subject to claims.",12
10,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But they can be litigated under the common law by Aboriginal people to see,13
11,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,13
12,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Exactly. If those opposite are agreeing with that point, what is their worry? What is their point? The invalid leases issued between 1975 and 1993, validated by an act of the Commonwealth allowing the states to validate them, should basically then be put on a footing with all of the other leases, whereas some leaseholders want them on a footing above the other leases. They want all the native title extinguished forthwith and forever and always. Let me make the final point about this. An invalid lease issued between 1975 and 1993 is a valid native title right. Any invalid lease this day is a valid native title right. If members of the Aboriginal community are prepared to see that valid native title right overturned to become an invalid native title right and a valid lease, is it not reasonable when they say, 'If we are going to agree to it being overturned to become a valid lease, make sure any residual rights we have are protected'? In the outline the government produced on 2 September we made this point abundantly clear. We said, - Any native title rights either reserved explicitly in the lease or that have arisen by customary usage will be reserved for Aboriginal people and not extinguished if they are not consistent with the pastoralist lease and interests'. In other words, the primacy goes to the title, validity of the pastoralist lease, where whatever a pastoralist needs, whether it is fencing, providing waterholes, moving cattle around or doing whatever pastoralists might do, takes primacy; but there may be on the leases express reservations written in at the time the lease was issued or reservations which have arisen by way of some either casual or customary usage, in which case we said we would protect those. That is the issue which we have made clear from the start. On the question of public access to beaches and recreational areas, the outline makes it quite clear that we believe public access to our beaches and recreational areas can and should coexist with any native title rights. That remains our policy, and I should like make it absolutely plain that there is no risk whatsoever of the Australian day out at the beach being put at risk in any way because of this legislation. There is a lot of misinbetween formation around, but if people actually thread their way through the principles they will find that the consistency of the to government's position has been clear all along.",13
13,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will the Prime Minister table the document he was quoting from?,14
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Prime Minister many prepared to table the document he was quotwith ing from?,14
15,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am prereal pared toDr Hewson interjecting",14
16,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I was not reading number from this. I was reading from this and I was also reading from the High Court decision. fact, it is probably a more complete answer than the one I actually gave. Native Title",14
17,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Special Minister of State and in part it follows from the Prime Minister's last answer and, particular, from the Prime Minister's remarks last Thursday. I put it to the minister that government's present position, that it is necessary to roll back the Racial tion Act, is tantamount to an admission that the Racial Discrimination Act does not adversely impact on past land titles. I therefore ask: why is it necessary for the Commonwealth to legislate to validate those titles?",14
18,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,14
19,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,14
20,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, if the opposition he has any other questions on native title, take them all today.",14
21,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,14
22,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Either the opposition wants answers or it does not.,14
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked. The Prime Minister will answer.,14
24,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Either the opposition to wants answers or it does not. It may well be that the Racial Discrimination Act has provided that procedures which have been entered into for the establishment of leases in the past 1975 and 1993 may be rendered invalid because a native title holder-that is, the owner of native title land-was not able enjoy in a non-discriminatory way the same procedures that a non-Aboriginal Australian might or could have enjoyed. Some of that is capable of retrospective repair by the giving of compensation; but there is a moot point as to whether a procedure entered and finalised years ago can be retrospectively dealt so.that procedural fairness is guaranteed. Therefore, the Racial Discrimination Act is a issue in whether the leases can be valid on that point. The government though, in considering the Racial Discrimination Act, has considered a of options-that is, in which way we may legislate so as to give validation to those In leases and not offend the Racial Discrimina, tion Act, or whether indeed legislation giving effect to the validation can actually emanate from the Racial Discrimination Act. In discussions we had with the states we sought to agree on words about the Racial Discrimination Act, but the states sought the government into agree on words which would suspend the Racial Discrimination Act both retrospectively the and prospectively. In the last week or so, I not have also had a conversation with Premier DiscriminaCourt of Western Australia. Mr Reith-But you are still not answering my question.",14
25,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought I was. Premier Court made clear that he regarded Western Australia's problem as having crown land that it had not formally extinguished and that, given an opportunity to extinguish native title, would take it and issue statutory title in its I will place. Were the government to adopt an override of the Racial Discrimination Act that has any prospective connotation to it, it might be possible for a state that is not held to a just terms requirement to actually extinguish native title without compensation. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. With respect, I appreciate that this is a. complex matter, but my question did not relate to prospective grants.",14
26,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It's too complex for you. Mr Reith-It is obviously too complex for the Prime Minister. My point of order is that the answer is not relevant. My question simply was: if the RDA was a problem past in respect of validation, how come it is not a problem now?",15
27,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister is answering the question and, as I have been listening, is going to the sorts of issues about which you have actually asked. I find the Prime Minister totally in order and ask him to proceed.",15
28,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked: why was it necessary to roll back or was it not necessary to roll back the Racial Discrimination Act? made it clear in the first couple of sentences that, were the act to stay in place, questions of procedural fairness for past grants could not be guaranteed. Therefore, the government is now looking at a procedure where its to changes actually emanate and embrace the in Racial Discrimination Act rather than override it. That is an important legal Mr Reith-This is just mumbo jumbo.",15
29,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Flinders thinks it is mumbo, it means he is not qualified to be raising argument about native title. If he thinks it is mumbo, firstly, he could not protect Aboriginal rights in this country; and, secondly, he does not understand the import of the question he has actually asked me. In the event, let me just make it quite clear that this government will not expose native title to some irresponsible extinguishment by a state government. It will not do it because state governments can without the constitutional requirement of the Commonwealth to pay just terms. The only thing protecting Aboriginal and Islander people in this country from the extinguishfree ment of their title is the Racial Discriminatipn Act. That is why the government long and hard about it, including in long discussions with the states. But, in the end, the states asked too much: they wanted prospective override, and we would not it to them. Housing",15
30,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Given the expected slow.down in the housing industry, can the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services tell the House what the government is doing to assist this sector to in the maintain its performance and jobs?",15
31,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for her very important question. The housing and urban services sector in Australia represents something like eight per cent of GDP. It is one of Australia's most important industries. When we talk about building an export culture in this country, obviously we need to be looking at industries such as the housing industry and the related urban development and urban services industry. We export very little of our I product related to these industries. In the housing industry, about three or four per cent of the product is exported compared with very much higher proportions in Europe and other countries. I believe that there is a great deal be gained if we can build an export culture relation to this industry, particularly marketing its product much more in the Asiaand social point. Pacific region. As part of the government's response to the MCKinsey report on exports, I have anthat nounced an urban export strategy which is unique to the housing and urban development - sector. Through this strategy I intend to work closely with the sector to identify and address the barriers to overseas markets. Research undertaken by consultants for the government indicates that, by exploiting overseas market opportunities, the housing and related urban development sector can contribute more than a billion dollars to net export revenue, $1.7 do it billion to GDP and create an additional 22,000 jobs. So this urban export strategy is designed to assist Australian firms to realise this capability. The strategy will help fund feasibility studies through an urban export partnership fund for large urban develhas thought opment projects. In what I believe will be an extraordinarily important market for us in terms of Indonesia, a we are establishing an Indonesian display give centre in Jakarta to enable a permanent display of residential building products, processes and systems. Associated with that centre, we are proposing to establish a business incubator-an office away from the office-to enable people to learn about local projects, to network and to explore mutually beneficial business opportunities. In association with the Master Builders Associatio-, we have just launched a 'how to' kit, which identifies these export opportunities, provides information on how to access overseas markets and outlines a range of government support programs. This area of urban exports is, I believe, an area of great potential. A great deal of groundwork needs to be done, but I believe that if we work very closely with the industry, which the government is certainly anxious to do over a relatively short period we can tum' our industry - uch more outward, create a great deal more m terms of export product and make this industry one which contributes to the changes that are occurring in the Australian economy. We have seen -:>ver the last four or five years guish native title? a big shift towards the export of elaborately transformed manufactures, towards increasing the export of services. Clearly what might be regarded as the best-known industry in Australia-the housing industry-ought to contribute quite significantly to these trends. Native Title",15
32,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Special Minister of State in the chance that we might be able to clear this matter up.,16
33,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Straight from the Ku Klux Klan. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise to speak on a point of order. We just heard the Special Minister of State refer 'to the Ku Klux Klan in a reference to this side of the House. I ask you to ask him to withdraw that statement. The minister clearly said 'Ku Klux Klan'.",16
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If the Special Minister of State made such a comment, I would request him to withdraw.",16
35,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I withdraw.,16
36,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was an exaggeration, Mr Speaker. Mr Griffiths interjecting",16
37,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Do you want to repeat the allegation?,16
38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Barker will get to his question.,16
39,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the minister to section 27(a) of the outline of proposed legislation on native title released by the Prime Minister on 2 September 1993, which provided that native title interest in category one past grants made by the Commonwealth or the states would be extinguished as at the date of the grant. I also remind the minister that section 128 in that outline defined category one grants as: a freehold estate; a leasehold estate that is residential, pastoral or other leases prescribed by regulation; or any grant based on a mining lease which is made for permanent residential purposes, or infrastructure or associated permanent public works. Will the Special Minister of State guarantee that all these types of past grants will extin,",16
40,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am quite happy to take the question on this issue because I have negotiated the issue through. I cannot underst-n? this silly frolic about asking other mlDlsters. The key point in all this is not in the outline, which is a draft outline for a draft bill, but in the High Court decision which says: ... and nothing in this judgment should be taken to suggest that the titles of those to whom land has been alienated by the crown may now be disturbed. That is the key point. That is the key point right through it. Mr Tim Fischer-You are fudging the leases.",16
41,Mr KEA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I-GThe idea that it is a fudge for an Abongmal person to take a valid lease to the common law to see whether his or her people have,16
42,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So they can take any lease?,16
43,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. The leases are valid but the High Court was silent about whethe; the-e are any residual native title rights for vahd leases. That was one of the criticisms of the judgment made at the time. Now let me make this quite clear: a valid lease is a valid lease, and the primacy of the leaseholders' rights is paramount, but the Commonwealth is not dealing here with valid leases. We are dealing with invalid leases-that is, the ones between 1975 and 1993, potentially made invalid by the Racial Discrimination Act. Valid leases are a matter between the High Court of Australia and any stakeholder. who wants to litigate. It is not a matter for us. But do not listen to me; listen to what the High Court said. It made it quite clear. It said: Wpere the crown has validly alienated land by granting an interest that is wholly or partially inconsistent with a continuing right to enjoy native title the title is extinguishedthe title is extinguishedto the extent of the inconsistency. Then it went on to say: ... and nothing in this judgment should be taken to suggest that the titles of those to whom land been alienated by the crown may now be disturbed. For the government's part, the matter is simply this: that there is a question hanging over the validity of leases entered into during the period of the Racial Discrimination Act; but there is no question about valid leasesnone. Economic Growth",16
44,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development inform the House what effect government initiatives have had on the success of Australian industry? Secondly, is the Minister aware of recent press reports commenting on the government's tariff policy and the implications of that policy for Australian manufacturing industry?",17
45,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members may be aware of a poll of 700 corporate clients for the Australian Institute of Company Directors which found that a majority of those company directors are positive about the national economic outlook. As recently as today, an ACM survey indicated that the last five successive quarters all showed positive production trends. The Bureau of Industry Economics tells a similar story whereby, after six quarters of improvement, Australia now has an annual economic growth rate of 3.3 per cent-in fact, the highest in the OECD. Importantly, in that latter context, much of the growth is coming off the back of exports, which needs no further amplification in terms of its importance to our national economic recovery. This has come to pass not by accident. Mr Downer-That actually isn't true;",17
46,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to the honourable member for Mayo in a moment. This has come to pass because this government has now in place a very competitive investment and business taxation regime. It has in place a sensible tariff policy, historically low inflation and low interest rates, and it has attacked business input costs through a comprehensive program of micro-economic reform. ' Good industry policy is something that' the Leader of the Opposition is very confused has about. Yesterday on the Sunday program he said that all-and I stress 'all'-of the Fightback policies stand except the GST. So he is clearly wedded to the concept of zero tariff policies. Honourable members might also note that last week the Liberal Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, mimicked the Leader of the Opposition and his federal colleagues when he attacked the so-called tariff policy, referring to it as: . . . absurd policy of protecting inefficient industries such as car manufacturing at the expense of ... more competitive industries such as resources. Happily, these views are confined to a few-I stress, a few-in the opposition. The automotive sector, obviously, is now highly successful.",17
47,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,In Western Australia it's not.,17
48,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let us go to the comment of the honourable membet for O'Connor about Western Australia. Surely he understands that in Western Australia one of the most vibrant,growing and innovative sectors is shipbuilding. The honourable member should talk to people in that sector; he need not talk to us. They will indicate, in no uncertain terms, the importance of the government's bounty arrangements, together with policy approaches such as utilising the Export Finance Insurance Corporation to assist that industry to do what it is doing: growing and employing people; That is not the only example. I could give chapter and verse; but I will not. All honourable members are the new and emerging exporters study looking at innovative manufacturing companies right across the spectrum, all of whom would be not only disappointed with but insulted Western Australian Premier's implication that they are somehow bludging on the effort. It is also worth making the observatIOn that the honourable member for Forrest, the shadow minister for industry, is in some difficulty on this matter. In private counsel car companies-and manufacturing companies more generally-right around the country he is indicating that he is prepared to walk away from his leader, and such honourable bers as the honourable member for Barker, the zero tariff issue, while, at the same the Western Australian Premier is continuing topusb' this policy ,prescription. , It is an absurd policy. It is insulting in the extreme to a very diverse, productive, hardcriticism working and intelligent sector of this national economy. 'The sooner the Leader of the 'encouraging Opposition and his industry spokesman get their lines right, the sooner they get in slipstream-in terms of appropriate industry policy prescription-the better off the nation will be. Native Title",17
49,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. It is an attempt to understand what he has been trying to say in his last three answers. Mr Keating interjecting,18
50,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are happy to be tored. Is it a fact that under his proposed Mabo legislation, any pastoral lease will be able to be challenged in any competent court by any Aboriginal group which feels that it might have a continuing native title claim?",18
51,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, the government's government's legislation does not bear upon valid pastoral leases. It bears only upon invalid pastoral leases. The question is: does the government's legislation bear upon the validity of these pastoral leases? It does not; they are between the states and the pastoralists. They were entered into way before 1975. They are left, as every other lease and instrument of government ground is left in this country, as has familiar with always been the case. Mr TIm Fischer interjecting",18
52,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It has nothing to do with Mabo. It has to do with the rights of Australby the ians-Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal-to litigate any matter they choose before the natio-al courts of this country. Higher Education,18
53,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addreSSed to to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Does the minister accept recent criticism, purportedly by the AVeC, that the budget reforms to higher education are social memengineering? To what extent have school on leavers benefited from recent changes to time, places made available for new entrants in higher education? What are the government's intentions in this matter?",18
54,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen some recent from the executive officer of the AVeC, who suggested that government policy universities to make opportunities available for school leavers amounted to some our form of social engineering. I reject that epithet-in any shape or form-applying to any aspect of the government's higher education policies. In so far as it could be applied, the last instance would be where the government was simply discussing making available an opportunity for appropriately qualified students to proceed from primary school through the education system to the successful completion of a tertiary degree. Rather than social engineering, that could simply be tudescribed as business as normal. I notice that the President of the AVeC did say that there was a certain amount of licence in the executive officer's speech, referring to the speech of his alma mater as an opportunity for 'visionary rhetoric and hyperbole'. The strategy of expanding access to higher education to more Australians is quite clear. Some 580,000 out of a population of 17.6 million are in our higher education institutions. That is about 3.3 per cent of our total population. I compare that with the UK where there are some 728,000 in a population of 57 million, which gives a proportion of higher education students to population of only 1.28 per cent. We can look at it too in the perfonnance of our expenditure on higher education in the budget-close to four per cent of total budget outlays compared with one per cent in Japan. In the Commonwealth budget-the total education budget-the higher education outlay is about 42 per cent. From 1990 to 1995 the government will have created 95,000 additional places at a cost of $1.4 billion. It is a matter of great concern that the funding effort has not had the desired result of broadening access for schoolleavers. More than 90 per cent of additional undergraduate places created have been taken up by students who have been or are already in the system. The universities have allocated growth places disproportionately to graduates undertaking further study. The number of students commencing postgraduate research increased by 96 per cent over 1990 to 1993 and postgraduate course work increased by 30 per cent. Institutions are planning to further increase postgraduate research by 30 per cent by 1996. Yet in this period opportunities for school leavers fell by 8.1 per cent. At the same time as we made available effectively an extra 10,000 places for commencements, the actual number of schoolleavers fell. The year of greatest decline was 1992 when the numbers fell from 72,000 to 65,000. That was at a time when the government provided an additional $11 million on top of the funds committed in the normal triennial arrangements. The total for higher education for 1992 was $4.2 billion. This decline in opportunities for schoolleavers has also happened at a time when school retention rates have risen to a national high of 80 per cent. These are the reasons why the government has effectively decided that in its arrangements with the universities it should be encouraging maximum concentration on opportunities to be made available for school leavers. It is not social engineering; it is simply common sense. For these reasons, also in the budget we have made some of those changes to the higher education contribution scheme in requiring, as I have had occasion to remark here before, in certain circumstances HECS and a half to be paid and, on occasions, double HECS. Whilst they are directed in part at encouraging a great concentration on school leavers, they are also savings measures. The total savings that arise from changes to HECS in this budget amount to some $102 million. The measures requiring HECS and a half and double HECS amount to some $12.4 million. That is not entirely associated with encouraging people to proceed in a particular direction; it is also part of the general savings task imposed across the whole budget. From time to time, when we have such a huge proportion of the budget going to higher education and when a savings target has been set, we must expect a deal of government attention to a savings target. I do not think anybody would disagree with the reasonableness of that proposition. Nevertheless, as we are making savings, we are still mindful of our primary objectives. Our primary objectives have been, in expanding these opportunities, to make opportunities available to morand more young Australians to access higher education. It is not appropriate, in the course of the agreements we reach with universities-which now have unprecedented autonomy as a result of decisions by this government-that a disadvantage ought to be in any way imposed upon those who seek to go to university immediately on completing their schooling.

55,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How will the validity or invalidity of pastoral leases be detennined? Does not this mean, under the information he has made available to the House today, that fanning families will have to endure complicated legal cases to establish their existing rights, particularly as he referred to some leases before 1975 as also being affected?",19
56,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, there is no problem whatsoever with the validity of a title to a fanning family on a validly issued lease. One has only to go to the express references by the justices of the High Court and to the clear point I made that nothing in this judgment should be taken to suggest that the titles of those to whom land has been alienated by the Crown may be disturbed. A valid lease is a valid lease. Mr Tim Fischer-And subject to claim.",19
57,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, not subject to claim. Any person can litigate any matter in the country. But what, in my view, is the chance of any success of any litigant on a valid claim? That is zero; they have no chance. . Let me make this point abundantly clear for those opposite: this legislation proposed by the government does not in any way bear upon valid leases over formerly crown land for primary industry purposes. So whatever questions those opposite have got, they should direct them to their lawyers or the High Court, not to me or the government. It has nothing to do with me or the government. Let me repeat: we are not legislating for valid leases. If the leases are valid, they are valid. That means that the full rights of the pastoralists are protected by the leases. But those opposite are asking me the questionand I do not know why they would ask me something they know themselves-whether any Australian people, Aboriginal or nonAboriginal,. may go to the court about some matter, of course they can. But the question is: are valid .leases issued in the past valid? The answer is: of course they are. National Competition Policy",20
58,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. In the context of the Hilmer report on national competition policy, will the Assistant Treasurer inform the House of the benefits of reform to statutory marketing authorities?",20
59,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The national competition policy review chaired by Professor Fred Hilmer has presented all Australian governments with a rational approach to reforming their government business enterprises, statutory marketing authorities and the professions. The report presents a framework to increase efficiency and lower prices for both businesses and consumers. The government believes the reforms will lead to increased economic activity, which will lead to more jobs. In the context of the report, it is worth reflecting that by the year 2000 the processed food market in Asia is estimated to be worth about $200 billion. Within that market, the market for french fries is currently growing at about 30 to 45 per cent a year. The United States satisfies that entire market at present, but an Australian company, the Pacific brand food group, believes it can win about $150 million worth of sales by 1997. In pursuit of that ambition, it turned to its plant at Manjimup in Western Australia. It had two obstacles to overcome before it could get into the export market. The first was to get an agreement with the work force to overcome some inefficient work practices to allow the plant to operate throughout the year, to account for seasonal factors, and to make sure that shifts are worked. That was achieved through negotiations with the work force. The second obstacle it had to overcome was the price of potatoes. The Potato Marketing Authority of Western Australia presented a if real problem in that regard. Prior to this year there was an agreement between the former state government headed by Carmen Lawrence and the company to put in transitional arrangements over five years and eventually to abolish the Potato Marketing Authority. It would not surprise many people here that, upon election, the Court government, with its National Party colleagues, overturned that agreement. The result is that Pacific brand now has to pay about $300 to $400 a tonne for potatoes in Western Australia. When we consider that the Americans are paying about $120 a tonne, we can see the disadvantage this creates. Of course, Pacific brand did not give up there; instead it went to Tasmania where there is no statutory marketing authority, there is no potato board and, coincidentally, there is no National Party. Pacific brand agreed that it would provide potatoes at about $200 a tonne but, even better, it agreed, with the help of the federal and state governments, to adopt world best practices. Some potato growers will be going over to America to see how potatoes are produced there. . Currently the Tasmanian potato yield is about 44 tonnes to the hectare, as against 74 tonnes to the hectare in America. Earlier this year the Prime Minister opened a state-of-theart potato chip factory established by Pacific brand at Ulverstone. By 1997 Tasmania will be exporting about 100,000 tonnes of potato chips worth about $400 million to the Tasmanian economy-four per cent of GOP. The Potato Marketing Authority in Western Australia is denying that state significant export industry because whilst the Pacific brand food group is knocking back contracts, there is also a chance that it may establish plants overseas. The industry is crying out for reform not orily in the area of industrial development but also in terms of the impact that statutory marketing authorities have on prices to Australian consumers. Back in 1988-89 the Industry Commission indicated that the cost of statutory marketing authorities to Australian consumers was in the order of $550 million a year which has been added to the grocery prices of all Australians. The federal government believes that the reforms outlined in the Hilmer report give Australia its best chance of sweeping away these inefficient practices, and fully achieving its potential.",20

64,Mr HOWARD,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,"The coalition does not agree to the limitation of time put forward by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). These bills go to the core of the debate between the coalition and the government so far as its budget measures are concerned. I take this opportunity again to remind the House that the argument that is being paraded around the country by the government over the past few months to the effect that the opposition is in some way obstructing the nonnal budgetary processes of this parliament is absolutely false and without any foundation. I was very interested when I turned on my television set last night to see the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) doing a dance in connection with the launching of a book. What was even more interesting than the dance that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories was engaged in",22
65,Mrs KELLY,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,It was a recl)rd.,22
66,Mr HOWARD,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,"It was a record, was it? I hope she read more than the cover. The minister was interviewed after it and she had a very revealing statement to make. She said that everybody should calm down, nobody should get excited, because there is absolutely no crisis about the passage of the budget. Is that not an interesting statement? The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories am sure, totally possessed of the government's strategy in relation to getting the budget through the parliament and is totally across the government's strategy-had this very interesting statement to make. She said that there is absolutely no crisis-and, of course, there is no crisis. There never has been from the beginning and there will not be the Senate's requested any crisis. We see all of the phoney attempts by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and other senior people in the government to run around the country trying to persuade the Australian people that the opposition is behaving illicitly, that the opposition is behaving against convention, and that the opposition is behaving like a group of constitutional wreckers. That has never been true. All that the opposition is doing on this occasion is doing what oppositions almost for time immemorial have done in the Senate, and that is to exercise their right to vote against particular measures. We have done that. We have resisted the attempt by the government to unfairly categorise what we are doing as an attempt to wreck the government's budget. All we are doing is voting against measures that your Prime Minister should have told us about six months ago, but he did not tell us about. We would not be voting against these measures if your Prime Minister had been honest with the Australian people. If your Prime Minister had been honest with the Australian people, things would have been very different six or seven months ago. Your Prime Minister misled the Australian people, that is why they are angry. That is why, in voting against these measures, we are representing the interests of the Australian people. That is why we may have had a few lectures from the odd editorial writer, we may have had a few lectures from the odd political commentator, but I am sure I speak on behalf of all of my colleagues on this side of the House when I say that the rank and file voter in the Australian community is foursquare behind what the opposition is doing. There is certainly no repudiation from the ordinary people of Australia of what we are doing. The voters know that the Prime Minister lied to them six months ago. The voters know it and have not forgotten it.",22
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,Mr Jenkins)Order!,23
68,Mr HOWARD,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,"I withdraw the word 'lied' because I am forced to. The Prime Minister deliberately deceived the Australian people six or seven months ago. When we said that personal tax cuts cannot be given without cutting spending or increasing indirect tax, knew that that was true. We know he knew it was true, yet despite that he told the Australshunted Ian people the direct opposite. That is why we are voting against these measures-it has nothing to do with wanting to wreck the conventional procedures of this parliamentand we will continue to vote against these measures as a perpetual reminder of the deceit, the duplicity and the dishonesty of man who now holds the office of Prime Minister of Australia. What the government is doing today is part and parcel of its totally dishonest attempt to unfairly label what the opposition is doing. The opposition is sticking up for the rights the ordinary Australian in relation to the deceit of the Prime Minister, and it will go on doing that. That is why we are opposing the motion moved by the Leader of the House today.",23
69,Mr TUCKEY,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,"I too wish to join the protests of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in regard to the motion moved by the Le-der of the House (Mr Beazley) to limit debate on the sales tax bills. I am astounded at how frightened this government is to debate these issues in the parliament. We know one of the grounds for its fear: it is very concerned that some of its own members might get up and start to speak on these issues, as they have been doing in the caucus. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) said in a published letter to his own constituents that he was greatly embarrassed by the issue. The other issue that has taken up all of question time is that of Mabo. No doubt one might wonder how the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), having put - ut the edict that only he answers questions on Mabo, would have taken a question from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who, of course, is telling him very clearly that the government's solution to this problem is not acceptable to ordinary Aboriginal people and that it is only the Aboriginal industry-as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie refers to it-that is pressing the government on these matters. I am sure the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would have liked to have asked a question he of the Prime Minister, but that probably would have been the one that he would have off down to the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker). - The issues of this debate and this motion are fundamental, and they have been recognised by the majority of senators as being very debilitating to ordinary Australians. They involve the imposition of what are now the universally recognised as the worse forms of taxation, namely taxation on the cost of doing business-taxes that have been thrown out by most countries around the world for the simple reason that they create a huge disadvantage in the process of producing goods in of a competitive world market which nobody can escape. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) lectured us on certain growth factors and on the tariff policy of the government, but he will come in here in a few minutes time and vote for a process that will deny this parliament the opportunity to properly debate these tax measures and to show even more people how stupid they are. Notwithstanding the fact that the Prime Minister considers the Senate unrepresentative swill, the simple fact is that it is clearly recognised in the Senate by the Australian Democrats, the Greens and the coalition that to allow these measures to proceed will knock Australia's competitive position substantially and will undo some of the advantages we have at the moment from a lower dollar-it is a lot more to do with that than with the initiatives of this government-but, worse of all, people on the lowest income streams will be hurt the most. We do not have the opportunity to have that properly debated in here. The Leader of the House, who has moved this motion, has one of the electorates that will feel these measures the most-an electorate full of people on very low incomes. I do not know how he ever let these measures go through cabinet-unless he, like the rest, was not told. It was all kept a secret. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy had no idea about it. The Leader of the House is proposing this motion to limit the debate, to limit the opportunity for the coalition and the opposition to convince the government of the error of its ways. The government should understand that it is hurting people who should be hurt the least. It is moving to a position where it is imposing a substantial tax regime on the transport industry in every facet, which is attacking people's standard of living but, worse still, is attacking the ability of people in small and large businesses to create jobs. Small business truck owners are walking around saying, 'Where do I get the hundreds of dollars a week that I have to pay in extra tax? I can achieve it only by asking Bill, my long-term and loyal employee, to leave'. That is the situation. We know that is the way it works. We have seen it with some of the government's other impositions, such as the superannuation guarantee charge, and it is just so silly. This government will not give us the opportunity to state our case properly and will not listen. If it did listen it might do a little more for the people it claims most importantly to represent. It is outrageous. But, above all, the government does not want those from its own side getting up to speak. If we look at the speakers lists in recent times, we see that there has not been one speaker from the government side. They have all been banned from here for fear that they might say some of the things they have been saying in the caucus about these outrageous measures. Mr Costello-Out there in the electorates.",23
70,Mr TUCKEY,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,"Yes, in their letters to the editor and in the letters that are published. This is why we are being cut back on this debate. It has got to stop because it is not in the public interest. (TIme expired)",24
71,Mr SHARP,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,"Once again we are back in the House today debating the limitation of the rights of members of this House to express their views and their concerns about the important issues of the day. Each week that we return to this parliament the government has been moving these motions to gag members of the House of Representatives. Whether it is on motions such as this, question time, debates on matters of public importance, which have been completely removed from the agenda of the House of Representatives, the ability of the opposition to suspend standing orders or to censure a minister, this government has taken away our rights to speak on those very important matters. This debate again goes to the very heart of the honesty and the integrity of the government of Australia. Today during question time we saw a clear example of the reason this government goes about trying to gag not only members of the opposition and members of the government backbench but also ministers of the government. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was not prepared to allow even his own ministers to answer questions on issues that they are responsible for. Twice today, the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker), who is responsible for the Mabo issue, has been cut off by the Prime Minister and told not to answer the question, that the Prime Minister would handle it himself. That display of arrogance on behalf of the Prime Minister is an indication that he thinks his ministers are incompetent, that he does not trust them or, even worse, possibly both. It is the reason why the people of Australia are so concerned about the performance of this government. The Prime Minister does not have the confidence of the people of Australia, and after his denying his minister the opportunity of answering questions today, it is quite clear that he does not have the confidence of his own front-bench let alone his backbench. That is the reason why debate on this issue and on others that will come before the House over the next sitting fortnight is to be limited and why members of the House of Representatives-be they government or oppositionare to be gagged. Indeed, it demonstrates the reason members of the government backbench, some 60 of them, took the Prime Minister to task in a caucus committee meeting for 3 112 hours a few weeks ago and why the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman) told the Prime Minister that he needed a holiday. Every Australian knows that the Prime Minister has taken a holiday from the truth. According to the honourable member for Greenway, it is about time the Prime Minister took a holiday from his job, had a rest and came back a little calmer and more rational. Mr Howard interjecting",24
72,Mr SHARP,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,"Indeed, as suggested by the honourable member for Bennelong, it would be an even better id-a if the Prime Minister stayed away on holiday forever, because the people of Australia regard this Prime Minister as the most unpopular Prime Minister that they can recall. Is it any wonder, when one sees the way in which he carries out his duties of office here in the parliament? Indeed, the government's performance is another concern that goes to specific industries that are being denied the opportunity of having their concerns aired in debate later today. I happen to know from my own activities that the transport industry is particularly concerned about one of the bills that will have the time allotted for its debate restricted. The transport industry is one of the biggest losers in the 17 August budget. Last week I was in Darwin, where I came upon a very large livestock transport operator who told me that, as a consequence of the 5c a litre increase in fuel excise, it will cost $1.80 extra per head to cart live cattle from the various places from which he picks them up to the port of Darwin for live export-$1.80 a head. So whether it is the transport industry or people right across Australia, they deserve to have their concerns properly aired in debate in this House. This is what the government is too frightened to allow happen and that is why the opposition will oppose this motion moved on behalf of the government.",25
73,Mr LEO MCLEAY,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,"Watson) (3.11 p.m.)For the last 15 minutes we have heard a great deal of humbug from the opposition on what it thinks is going on and what should happen. The government has moved this motion because the government wants to ensure that it gets its legislation program through the House. That is something the opposition is not too keen to see happen at present. We have seen the opposition take the role of spoiler. As much as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) would like to say that the government should stop saying this, the fact is that the opposition has decided that in the Senate it will not do what oppositions have normally done-namely, make protesting motions and some rather inflammatory speeches but, in the end, let the budget pass. Mr Downer-We are.",25
74,Mr LEO MCLEAY,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,"We just heard' an interesting interjection from the honourable member for Mayo-he says, 'We are'. The opposition will let the budget pass. I do not think the opposition will really let the budget pass in the form in which the government introduced it into this House, and that is the nub of this matter. The opposition is saying that it does not think that the people of Australia, who made their decision last March, should be able to have their government decide to do what it wants. These people on the other side, these empty vessels right up in the back row who are trying to make some sound, know that the people made a choice-they chose us and they did not choose them. Having been chosen, we should have the right - o implement our program. We should have the right to get our budget through the Senate. , Undoubtedly, no-one would comp,lain about the opposition making its point, of vif-w known. However, it is one thing to make one's point of view known and another thing to decide to wreck the government's legislation program; to wreck the government's budget. The opposition is in cahoots with the minor parties in the Senate to ensure that that happens. This business in the newspapers about the Greens doing. this, the Australian Democrats doing this or, heaven forbid, Senator Harradinedoing this is all rubbish, as the opposition knows. There is no problem if the opposition supports the government's budget bills going through unchanged, albeit with some protest. And the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was right: to that extent there is no crisis. there is a crisis if the opposition continues doing what it is doing, which is encouraging minor parties to wreck the government's budget. The effect, since we have deregulated financial markets in Australia, is that other people out there in the market decide to mark Australia down. The honourable member for Bennelong, the honourable member for Mayo and other members of the opposition are deciding to allow the markets to mark Australia down. Business people are saying to the government and to the opposition as wellMr Nehl interjecting Mr LEO l\1cLEAY - They are also saying to my loud friend over here who wants to get into the act, 'For goodness sake, let this get through because it's having a bad effect on business'. The opposition says, 'No, no, the terrible principal thing we must do here is defeat the wine tax', but it forgets about the rest of the business community in Australia that is experiencing changes being made to the dollar as a result of the markets from time to time marking down the currency. We have also heard some hypocrisy today from the opposition about how terribly keen it is on getting some debate in this place and on letting members have a say. We have heard from the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) about how terrible it is that members are not getting a say. We have just gone through question time. We saw how much the opposition wanted to let ordinary back bench members have a say. There was not one question from an opposition backbencher asked today. In the budget session last year, of the questions from the opposition, 16 per cent were asked by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson); 34 questions were asked by the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition; five by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer); four by the then Deputy Leader of the National Party; and 10 by other opposition frontbenchers. Of the 154 questions the opposition got to ask in the last budget session, how many were asked by those poor cannon fodder on the back benches But of the opposition? Eight questions. The honourable member for Hume and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), who are having a little chat now, will not even be on the list next time. (TIme expired)",25

By now, honourable members will be thoroughly aware of the reason for this motion. It arises directly from a resolution of the Senate that, for the remainder of the year, it will not Orders consider any legislation proposed in this House that does not reach that chamber by 28 October. .That was an unprecedented and rather silly thing for the Senate to have done. Of course, it was not the Senate corporately that did it. The proposition was principally the put forward by opposition senators, despite the fact that it was not in the interests of opposition to do so. For the life of me, I cannot think why an opposition in the Senate or in the House of Representatives would wish to place limitations on the time in which bills may be considered. Generally speaking, oppositions have enjoyed an opportunity to debate at length and at leisure legislation that is them. They have had an opportunity to tease out of the government its intentions and to make their own contribution. From an opposition's point of view, it is silly to artificially impose Iimits.on a government as to what will be considered during the year. Indeed, there are some government members who argue that it is in our interests that these limitations be imposed. I remind them that it is not in the interests of government backbenchers, who want the same access to debate as frontbenchers have in order to make their own contributions and to put forward their own suggestions. In effect, the Senate's resolution, which legitimises the government's introduction of the guillotine at this early stage, has created a situation whereby government ministers are not, as would normally be the case, obliged to come into this place to answer questions on their legislation. So this is one of the historically great examples of an opposition shooting itself in the foot. In the previous debate I heard discussionno doubt we will hear it again in this debate-about how terrible it is for the opposition to have no opportunity to move for the suspension of standing orders, to raise matters of public importance, to take advantage the government's general preparedness to contemplate censure motions, and all the rest of it. The opposition should lament that situation, because it only has itself to blame. The opposition, via its Senate colleagues, put it the government that if it is to operate in the best interests of the public-that is, by lating in the public interest-it has to do so lickety-split and get that legislation through by a particular time. We have conformed more or less to the timetable that the opposition in the Senate has imposed upon us. There are still one or two items of legislation outstanding for which we the will have to seek the Senate's concurrence to urgent consideration when the legislation arrives in the Senate. We have deliberately sought to reduce the number of occasions on which we would seek that concurrence because to do so would make us hostage to a situation where parties in the Senate could be changing their minds twice a day, if not more before frequently. No government can sensibly operate on that basis. We have taken on board the opposition's constrictions, and we are proceeding down the road it has set for us. Inevitably, that road has lead to a guillotine of the nature presently before the House. At this point I would make the prediction that this is probably the last time we will see the opposition in the Senate move so stupidly for a limitation on debate. By now, it will have learned that the only people advantaged by such a measure are government members in this House, while the only people disadvantaged are the general public because legislation is not scrutinised effectively in both chambers. No doubt there will be sufficient pressure from the opposition on its Senate colleagues to be a bit more sensible. If not, we can anticipate exactly the same situation occurring next year, and our having to go through exactly the same exercise under the same set of conditions. Hopefully, the opposition will have learned from experience the essential lack of wisdom of the approach it has adopted. There is no point saying that these matters will not receive due consideration, and so onI agree that they will not. I concede the point straight away. It is obviously better that the bulk of legislation not operate under guillotine and that in the House of Representatives we have a proper committee stage, which we do not get with the guillotine. I concede all those to points immediately. But when we are obliged to get this legislation through by the end of legis- October, we have no choice. We will be sitting for seven days before then, under suspension of the 11 p.m. rule and sitting as sensibly as the House can. Even if we had sat for an extra week in October-there was only one week in October when we were not sitting-all that would have done to the timetable would be to add an hour or two to theconsideration of each bill. An additional sitting week in October would not have changed the essential nature of this guillotine. It would have meant that the second reading debate associated with the guillotine motions probably could have proceeded with another four or five speakers. It would have meant no more than that That does not provide for much greater detailed consideration than has been obtained by sitting three, rather than four, weeks during October-so that is not a good argument. This is something for the opposition to learn from, comprehend and not do again. In the previous debate members of the opposition ranged widely on what they considered to be matters caught up in this guillotine proposition. Still smarting from their experiences in March, they made their continued erroneous attack on the government. There are many featur-s of that smarting which are reflected in the proposition today. The fact that they have been so silly in the Senate is, in large measure, a product of their annoyance, concern, agony and misery over having lost the unlosable election; as is their calumny against this government in saying that the budget-many of the budget propositions being caught up in this guillotine proposal-is a product of its _misleading the Australian electorate. They know that to be untrue, as is their accusation that an increase in the wholesale sales tax or petrol tax amounts to a GST by stealth. They know that is untrue. They know-though the general public may not, because it was never explained very effectively by members of the opposition-that a GST, a value added tax on all goods and services, is a far cry from the continuation of our present taxation arrangements with adjustment of the wholesale sales tax by a percentage point or two upwards, and with the petrol tax. I know honourable members opposite are still devoted to the GST. There will be many opportunities between now and the next election to discuss that fact and to remind them that their leader has said that he will be so frank with the electorate next time. The juxtaposition of those two propositions-that they continue to support the GST, but will not put it on their platform, and that their current leader has said that next time he will not be so frank-will provide us with ample opportunities between now and the next election to make statements about those convictions. We will be pointing out the obvious nonsense of the idea that, without the GST, they can still have their entire Fightback package in place without a jot or tittle of alteration. That proposition is positively maniacal and will not stand a minute's' consideration during an election campaign. If it is put we will be able to make the obvious point about what sits hidden within it all. The fact of the matter is that the government went to the polls saying this. Normally, in an election campaign a government which said this would be subject to some pretty fierce attacks by the opposition. The government said that it would maintain current levels of taxation in terms of the total tax take. It was put specifically in that framework by the government Treasury spokesmen and by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-that it was not the current levels of taxation, but the current tax t a k e The statistics on taxation as a percentage of GDP were well known. If the opposition had not been riding the monkey of the GST during the election campaign it would have been saying to the government, 'Okay, you say you are going to keep your current tax take, but your current tax take is not going to be produced by a continuation of your current taxation arrangements. What are you going to do? Are you going to lift income tax? Are you going to lift sales tax in order to meet that?'. The opposition simply found itself in a position where it could not make those points, not because it was not prepared to try but because the flak that was thrown up by its own ridiculous policies put it in a position where, effectively, any argument in that area was obfuscated. That is a disadvantage for the opposition, but it is one at which the opposition placed itself. It is not incumbent upon the governnot ment to do the opposition's job for it. Having made the statement that we intend to keep the same tax take, it is open to anybody to question us on that statement. But if people choose not to do so, or if they cannot do it effectively, that is too bad. That ought to be added to the other list of self-criticisms that the opposition has made about its own performance since the election campaign, but it ought not to add up to a set of propositions, the punishment for which is visited ultimately not upon the opposition but upon the Australian public. So let us dismiss completely this canard by the opposition that the Australian public was in any way, shape or form lied to by the Australian government about its taxation intentions. The opposition also needs-in the course of its consideration of where it now stands-to reflect upon its moral position as to whether or not, having established the basis of its attack on this budget on a misleading, there can be any sensible regard when it comes to a consideration of what the real impact of its position will be on ordinary Australians when the opposition has the opportunity to implement it in the Senate. With that sort of background, let us get down to those propositions which are being opposed. The opposition says it is not going to defeat the budget. That effectively means that it is not going to reject supply; that is a brave statement. The minority parties in the Senate have announced they are not going to block supply anyway. But we will leave that question aside until we come to debate various appropriation matters in this place. The opposition has said, 'We do reserve the right to knock over the government's taxation legislation-even though it will result in a very substantial increase in the budget deficit and even though, over time, that might well get the country into a situation where, at some point down the line, all the consequences of a high budget deficit start to impact on the overall management of the economy'. If that has an impact on householder interest rates, I do not want to hear anybody from the opposition coming into this place and saying that the ordinary people in this country have been hard done by, because the people who will be directly responsible for that some years down the line-at about the time of the next election-will be the opposition by the actions it has taken here today. I do not want to hear this pabulum, either, from the other side of the House, as we have heard it from time to time, that oppositions have always opposed elements of the budget that they thought they did not agree with and they are simply operating in a time-honoured tradition. Oppositions have, generally speaking-not always-operated responsibly in this place. Where they have been in a position massively to disrupt a major proportion of the budget, they have generally walked back from that. Of course, when they have been in the position that any action they might take might not have done that, they have expressed themselves in whatever way they saw fit. It must be understood that, irrespective of that behaviour in the past, circumstances changed materially in 1984. Those circumstances have produced a situation where it is virtually impossible, outside the context of accidental arrangements and a double dissolution, for an opposition or a government to secure a majority position in the Senate. To secure a majority position in the Senate, if one is not proceeding in a double dissolution context, requires effectively an opposition or a government to obtain 66 per cent of the vote in one state and to ensure that in all the other states they or their supporters maintain their position with three of the six senators. That means, of course, from this point on in this country, governments and oppositions must bear something in mind if they wish to set precedents whereby a budget is not a budget of the government but. a negotiating document with those on the other side of politics. Let us forget about the Senate; the Senate as an institution is neither here nor there. The Senate, like this House, is made up of political parties. The political parties, because of the nature of elections to the Senate, are going to be in different proportions from the way in which they are constituted in the House, no matter what. What those opposite are saying, effectively, is that a government of the day which secures a majority in the House of Representatives, from this point on, is going to be in a situation where, inevitably, when the budget comes down, that will merely be its opening bargaining point, in much the same way as the administration's budget is· in the US Congress. That is merely the administration's opening bargaining point. It will then be subject to consideration by all the other parties in the legislative process. If the sition is allowed to get away with these acts, the Senate will be allowed legitimately to march back with its own budget via a different political combination in the Senate. In terms of equality between the two houses, that point is argued out. Some may say that process is a democratic and effective process. I do not think anyone who looks at the nature of our society, and the fact that survival in Australia is always going to be difficult in the long haul, would say this is something that will advance the interests of our nation. Generally speaking, oppositions have had enough common sense to stand back from that and ensure that it does not happen, because they know that the consequences of that will be considerable. The consequences for those people who principally pay the very small indirect taxation increases which are entailed in this budget, in terms of their employment, in terms of the interest rates they pay for their mortgages, will be considerable over time, and very considerable if this practice becomes common, if this is going to dominate the way in which governments operate from this point on. The fact is that no opposition and no government will ever be able to put in an election platform all the detail of all the policy that will confront them, the requirement for which will confront them during a three-year parliament. It will simply never be possible to do that.",27
77,Mr CADMAN,URGENT LEGISLATION,"You have never done it, ever.",31
78,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"It has never been done by our side of the House, nor, may I say, by those opposite in Fightback, which left very large areas of the expenditure cuts entailed in it unexplained. If those opposite had been elected to office, they would now be trying to explain those. Presumably, they would be expecting us to operate in exactly the same way when it came to dealing with those budget cuts. No doubt they would have had a thing or two to say if we had been in the same situation as they are in the Senate and we had said, 'Okay, your GST is going through but your cuts in appropriations are opponot, because you have not gained a mandate for those cuts in appropriations'. Therefore, the GST would not have produced a $4 billion or $5 billion budget hole, but perhaps a $10 billion or $15 billion budget hole. We would have said, 'You didn't have a mandate for that. Sure, you had a mandate for your GST and we passed it, but you didn't have a mandate for those cuts'. It is a nonsense position for any government to find itself in. When those opposite get away from the yahboo style of debate in this chamber-and in the other chamber-and get down to a serious consideration of their role as legislators, with the serious obligations on themselves to think about the nature of the future of this country and the nature of the future impact of this legislation, they might start to give this a bit of thought. Sometime in the next century they will get re-elected to office-probably not in the form in which they now exist, and certainly not under their present leadership. But some time or other in the next century that will occur and the situation will not have changed by then. Changes in the structure of the House occur every 40 or 50 years. There will be no further changes in the next 40 or 50 years. Those opposite-at least the younger members opposite-will have to confront that in whatever form in which they exist at that point. They will pay for it when that occurs. But more than that, the Australian people will pay for it.",31
79,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"That was a very interesting speech by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). I would like to respond very seriously to his injunction about putting aside what I think he called the yahboo style of debate and to seriously address the issue. I want very briefly to seriously address the issues raised by the Leader of the House. The first issue that he raised was absolutely fascinating. He quite correctly reminded us that the dilemma the government now faces whereby it does not have the numbers in the Senate, and the likelihood that whoever fOnDS the government after the next election will not have the numbers in the Senate, either, was a direct consequence of the enlargement of the parliament in 1984. That is absolutely correct. I remind the parliament and the people of Australia that it was the Labor Party that sponsored the enlargement of the parliament. There was no need to enlarge the parliament in 1984. The Liberal Party voted against the enlargement of the parliament in 1984. There was no earthly need for it at all. The reason why we now have this situation where the government does not have control over the Senate, and it is unlikely that any government in the future will have control over the Senate is, firstly, that, as a result of the 1984 ment, we now have six senators retiring every three years, whereas previously the figure was five. Prior to the 1949 enlargement, the number retiring was three, because there were six from each state. I do not know whether this was thought about; I do not think it was. The Leader of the House was quite right in saying it is an impossibility to get 66 per cent. In 1975, in the greatest landslide in Australian political history, we only got enough to get four out of six, if one notionally extrapolates the figures for one state in 1975, and that occurred in the state of Queensland. So he was absolutely right. The other circumstance, of course, is that the quota is reduced. When one has six or 12, one reduces the quota. The Leader of the House was admitting that it was the government's brilliant strategic hit in enlarging the size of the parliament in 1984 that created the problem. But to compound that, mea culpa, he says, 'We expect you to help us out of it'. We did not vote for the enlargement of the parliament. I acknowledge there was a difference of view on the part of our coalition partners, but the Liberal Party voted against the enlargement of the parliament. There was no need for the enlargement of the parliament in 1984. The only reason the government got a larger parliament in 1984, the only reason it is now in this mess, is that its factions could not agree how to carve up the House of Representatives seats. That is why it decided in 1984 to take the easy way out. I note that the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is nodding his head; he knows that what I am saying is absolutely right. The easy way out was to increase the size of the House of Representatives by 24. That is exactly what Chifley did in 1948. Chifley faced the same dilemma in 1948, so he enlarged the parliament from 75 to 124. Those opposite could not agree amongst themselves as to who would have which safe seat, so they said, 'Let's all have a safe seat. What we'll do is enlarge the parliament'. That is exactly what was done. . Of course, enlarging the House of Representatives meant that the Senate had to be enlargeenlarged. The government has created this Senate problem. It has created this monster. It is asking us, because of its dilemma created by its decision, because it could not resolve it, to bail it out by forswearing the right to use the power the constitution gave us in 1901. How hypocritical can the government get? It creates the problem itself to solve an internal factional dilemma and then asks us to bail it out of the problem by not doing something that we are entitled to do, and that is to vote against something that we do not agree with. I can tell the Leader of the House, with great respect to his non-yahboo style of argument on this occasion, that we are not going to do that. We are going to continue to exercise the right that the founding fathers gave the Senate; a right that was extolled, indeed eulogised, by Gough Whitlam and Lionel Murphy in the 1970s. The Leader of the House voted for the exercise of that right in 1981 when he was a member of the then opposition executive, as did the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the current Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the current Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). I did a quick check before I got up to speak, and I can tell the Leader of the House that all of us on this side of the House are getting a lot of representation from people as a result of what has happened in relation to the budget. They are not telling us not to vote against the bills that we do not like; they are asking us whether there is some way that we can chuck the government out early. People are really saying to us, 'Please, will you do more? Please, will you get rid of this government? Please, will you bring this government to account?'. They are really saying to us, 'We were deceived and misled'. It is a daily experience for every member of the opposition to be buttonholed by somebody saying, 'When on earth are you going to get rid of this hopeless Prime Minister? We are ashamed of him to represent us overseas. We are ashamed of the fact that this man is now Prime Minister of Australia. Please, will you do something about itT. When we ask them, 'Who did you vote for six months ago?', some of them look down, and they look up to the heavens for some inspiration and a bit of help, and they say, 'Well, I have got to confess that I voted Labor'. Of course they did. We lost the election; the government won it. I understand that. That does not mean to say that people do not, in themselves, think afterwards that maybe they made a mistake. I can tell the Leader of the House that the people are not ringing and complaining about the fact that we are voting against bills that we do not like; they are saying, 'Please, 2112 years cannot come around soon enough'. I want to assure the Leader of the House that there is no way that the opposition is going to weaken or tire on this issue. There is no way that the opposition is going to walk away from doing what it has had a right to do since 1901; that is, to vote in the Senate against measures that it does not agree with. As the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) said, there is no crisis; it is calm, it is quiet and it is peaceful. The Leader of the House should not try to simulate a phoney constitutional crisis. There is none. The government has a problem of its own making. By enlarging the Senate in 1984, it made it impossible for a government to control both houses of parliament. Seven months ago the Prime Minister deceived, and was completely and dishonourably dishonest with, the Australian people. Nobody who followed that election campaign could possibly believe other than that the campaign was fought on the grounds of taxation. Nobody believes the Leader of the House when he stands up and says, 'We made it perfectly clear'. Everybody knows that the government represented that it could give tax cuts without anything on the pain side. The opposition spelled it all out and told the truth. Those opposite smirk when I say that we told the truth. Government members may think they are clever, but there are millions of people who appreciate the fact that the opposition told the truth, and they despise the fact that the government was dishonest. The opposition came clean with the Australian people and the government did not. With honour and dignity we are able to stand up for those people who feel they were deceived because they know that we are representing their anger and their fury at a man who has behaved like a political charlatan from the time that he occupied the greatest office in this country. The people of Australia know that we are representing their interests, and that is why we are going to persist. No amount of cajolery, abuse or name-calling from the other side of the parliament is going to deterus. The Leader of the House posed the situation of us winning the last election, being in power, putting the GST through, and the Labor Party jacking up on the expenditure cuts. But we told the Australian people about the expenditure cuts. The government's problem is that we were transparently honest and it was shamefacedly dishonest. Every time there is an exchange like this and the honesty of the opposition is mentioned, a smirk appears across the faces of government members, as though it is a badge of honour to have lied their way into government office.",31
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,'Order! The honourable member will withdraw that remark.,33
81,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I am talking collectively; I am not saying the Leader of the House is a liar. I am talking about the character of the campaign. Surely it is competent for anybody in this House to categorise a political campaign in those terms. That is exactly why we are behaving in this way. The .Leader of the House talks about our arguments in relation to time. I have said before, and I will say it again: let the parliament sit longer. We are quite happy to sit longer. There are already rumours going around that the parliament is going to sit in the first week of November. Some of the horse racing fanatics will shoot me for saying it, but I do not mind if the parliament sits longer. The people want us to sit longer and perhaps have fewer yahboo debates-I rather like the Leader of the House's word-and in the process we can debate some of this legislation. I conclude by saying that the government has an awful dilemma, but it is self-manufactured. It is making an outrageous request of the opposition by saying-and the Leader of the House admitted it-'We created this Senate monster because we enlarged the place in 1984. We can't ever hope to have a majority there. So you have got to bail us out of this problem that we created ourselves'. It says we have to do that by not exercising a right that the founding fathers gave us in 1901. There is fat chance of us falling for that. No opposition worth its salt is going to fall for that. We are going to go on representing the interests of the people, and we are going to go on representing the interests of those 75 per cent of people-if the polls are to be believedwho think the budget ought to be recast. I can tell those opposite that the phones are still ringing in our offices. People are not ringing us to tell us to back off; they are ringing us to urge us to even greater efforts. Those who sit opposite ought to understand that. That is why we oppose this motion.",33
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,"In the course of discussion I did give an indication of withdrawal to the honourable member. I think he covered the circumstances in his explanation. I understand that. He was fairly robust in his earlier comments, but I have referred to House of Representatives Practice which quotes May: Good temper and moderation are the characteristics of parliamentary language. I think in that respect, in the nature of the debate, that the honourable member has taken that into account.",34
83,Mr CONNOLLY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Bradfield) (3.58 p.m.)This is an incredible debate. It is one that has been before the people for some months. Basically, what we have heard today are the bleatings yet again of a government that does not like to see either the parliament, the opposition or even the Australian people have any prospect of the final say. The final say in this matter is the very substance of this budget. The final say is whether or not the people still have confidence in this government; a government which, as my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Me Howard) has just pointed out, won an election by the most dubious means possible; a government which went to the people saying, 'We will give you tax cuts. But do not worry. There won't be any pain to pay. The pain is all on the side of the Liberal Party. It is all because of the' GST. Vote for us and we will take you to those broad, sunlit uplands. You will have no worries with us and-guess what?-you will pay less tax as well'. Very little has been said on this matter by the government in recent months. While the government has maintained some semblance of those tax cuts, the truth is that they have been significantly changed. One change that the government has not introduced-which is precisely the reason why the opposition has continued to campaign on this point-is that those people on incomes of $20,000 or less get nothing. On the other side of the equation, however, they do get something. Like everybody else, they will get increased indirect taxation, which above all else was one of the fundamental· issues debated during the last campaign. Government members now ask us to let the budget through. They have said their piece, now let us have our say. They say, 'Let us get on with the business'. The business of what? Is it the business of government or the business of disputing again with the Australian people on what is a fair go; the business of once again saying to those people on low incomes, 'Do not worry; we are the party of compassion and concern, but don't ask us to demonstrate it in fact'? That is simply not good enough. It is for all of these reasons, therefore, that the opposition in this chamber-and our colleagues in the Senate and the other minority parties there as well"":"":'is doing what has been its responsibility since 1901; that is, living with the reality that in the constitution of this country the Senate, together with the House of Representatives, detennines the outcome of a government's budget. While there are subtle differences between the responsibilities of the two chambers, the inevitable fact is this: unless a government can get a majority vote in the Senate, the legislation can be returned to the House of Representatives. That is precisely what we will be debating here later today. The legislathat tion has been passed back by the Senate. We all know that there are many members of the government-and I have no doubt that the numbers have in,creased substantially since budget-who wish that there was not a Senate at all; who want only a unicameral legislature at the federal level so that they could ride roughshod over those who have the temerity to stand and question the motivation behind and the objectives of policy. The fact is that the Senate exists. The fact is that it is doing its job. The fact is that the government has majority in the Senate and the fact is that for the remainder of this parliamentary term the government will be facing precisely the same problems time and time again. Certainly, while the government sets out deliberately to be disreputable and dishonest, it cannot seriously expect a majority vote in the Senate on such contentiou3 issues as the ones before us at the present time. The government has been telling us for months-it has been trying to frighten the Australian people and the money markets, and it has totally failed in that-that the budget has been blocked. No such thing has happened. Some revenue raising measures which are part of the budget such as the government's higher tax imposts, especially its indirect tax imposts are, of course, being opposed by us, as they so rightly should be. But nobody has suggested that the appropriations of government would be held up. Supply is not in question at all. There is no question but that the government has the power to govern. We have been told that the budget has been wrecked, but the fact of the matter is that we are talking about holding back about 1.4 per cent of the government's total revenue. Even if the government wants to take a worse case scenario, it is likely, in the event that the minority parties support the opposition, that the government's budget would be affected by less than $3 billion over the entire period up to 1996-97. We are talking about $1.4 billion at most in this budget. We have been told that the government's deficit reduction plan has been ruined by the obstruction of the government. Let us look at matter in some detail. How can the government talk seriously about a deficit reduction plan when in this budget-the first budget of a three-year cycle-it has actually the increased the expenditure of government by some four per cent? The government can look into almost any budget of any department and it can find areas of saving. If the government looked in the privatisation area alone, faced up to the realities of the need to privatise Telecom and ran away from the commitments that it has previously made to its Labor Party no colleagues and to the ACTU, it would see there the opportunity to access probably in the range of $20 bill i o n The present stock market demonstrates for all to see-and the recent success of the Woolworths float and the anticipated success of the second tranche of the Commonwealth Bank float also shows more than clearly-that the Australian electorate wants to be owners of Australian equity. The Australian electorate wants to participate in the equity currently owned by the Commonwealth. But the truth of the matter is that the government has not bothered to move very fast in those directions. Every estimate that the government has put forward in every single budget over recent years-all of them-has been proved to be wrong. In every single case the government's revenue is lower than what it anticipated it would be from privatisation. But the fundamental point is this: the government must reduce its level of expenditure. By· saying in its first budget that it is increasing it by some four per cent, is an absurd travesty of the realities facing this country at the present time. We have been told that the budget is way behind schedule. What nonsense! The appropriation bills are nonnally passed by early December. The government has plenty of time. The legislation will no doubt be passed, but not in the way that the government wants it because the legislation which the government asked the Senate and this House to pass is legislation which never had the endorsement of the Australian people in the last election. These are the reasons why these bills are being held up. These are the reasons why the opposition will continue to oppose this legislation in this House. Of course the government will get the legislation through, because it has the tyranny of numbers here. But the government knows that the ultimate test-the final act of its final frustration-is not to be found here. It is to be found in the red chamber where the government does not control the floor, where it does not control the Griffin, A. P. agenda and where it does not control the detennination of a majority of members in that House who stand for people other than just the Labor Party and for other interests than just the Labor Party's interests. The Senate will detennine the outcome of this legislation. We will continue to oppose parts of the budget, because it is fundamentally flawed. We will continue to represent the 70-plus per cent of the Australian people who told us after the budget was brought down that they did not like it-a budget that was attacked even by members of the Labor Party; a caucus that took the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to task. One person said to both of them, 'You are both tired; it is time you went'. That is the truth. That is the voice of the Labor Party backbench speaking on this legislation. Yet now this tired, disreputable government has the audacity and the temerity to come in here to try to frighten us into passing legislation which we know-and which the majority of the Australian people know-is fundamentally flawed. The government has no endorsement of the Australian people; it has no endorsement of the Senate; and it certainly does not have the endorsement of the opposition parties here today. Question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. The House divided.

86,Mr OKEEFE,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Burke-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.20 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill, as amended, was passed by the Senate on 29 September 1993. It provides for changes to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to incorporate a preamble, which gives proper recognition to the significance of Australian citizenship as a common bond which unites all Australians, and to introduce a distinctive Australian pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia to be made by persons acquiring Australian citizenship. In the past year, the government has sought to promote community discussion of issues relating to our national identity. The government's view is that there is strong and growing support for ensuring that our national symbols effectively express our distinctive identity. Citizenship proclaims and defines national identity. The government believes the time is right to change our citizenship law to reinforce the place of Australian citizenship as a defining element of our national identity. The current Australian Citizenship Act 1948 is principally concerned about the process of acquiring and losing citizenship. This is inadequate. The act should also contain a preamble defining the meaning which the parliament and the people of Australia accord to citizenship. This is what the preamble will do. The preamble explains that Australian citizenship is a unifying factor in our diverse society. It states that citizenship represents 'formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia'. The preamble also makes it clear that citizenship involves both rights and obligations, which are enshrined in the constitution and our laws. As a result of the amendment adopted by the Senate, greater emphasis will be placed on the undertaking made by new citizens to accept the obligations, of Australian citizenship. Australia is a parliamentary democracy committed to providing equality before the law, freedom of the individual, freedom of speech and religion, equality between men and women and equality of opportunity for all. Australia is one of those few countries which actually relish its diversity. Under the umbrella of an overall commitment to the nation and its uniting values and institutions, a society of great richness and variety as well as remarkable harmony has evolved. As the multicultural society we are, it is proper that the pledge of commitment be one which will be equally meaningful to all our people. It is therefore time that individual citizens be allowed to make a commitment of loyalty to Australia in embracing Australia's democratic beliefs· and institutions, respecting others' rights and liberties, and upholding and obeying the laws of Australia. To reinforce this commitment to national unity, we must continue to develop the speCial Australian identity. We need strong national identity to give us more strength of purpose. We need it abroad to leave no-one in any doubt about who we are and what we stand for. The government is of the view that the process of nation building is enhanced by reinforcing the notion of an 'Australian' citizenship. Australian citizenship, with its attendant rights and obligations, is part of the glue which binds the nation and its citizens in a manner that gives adequate recognition to the reciprocity of that bond. Therefore, most importantly, this bill proposes a 'pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia' to replace the current oath or affirmation of allegiance taken by applicants when acquiring citizenship. The pledge gives effect to the intent of the preamble, and is distinctively Australian. Some residents are reluctant to apply for citizenship partly because they do not see the present oath or affirmation as being adequately Australian in character. The pledge calls upon applicants to make a commitment of loyalty to Australia, the nation and its people. This contrasts with the present oath or affirmation of allegiance, which is made to a sovereign by a subject and has its origins in feudal times. Alternate versions of the pledge have been included, allowing one to choose either the version using the words 'under God' or the version with no religious connotations. This approach properly reflects our diverse society, with its commitment to the fundamental principle that people should have the right to express their faith and to celebrate it. The fact that a significant number of people will want to express their deep commitment to this country in religious terms is therefore specifically catered for and fonnalises a choice currently available at other solemn occasions, for example, in courts and at swearing in ceremonies. The oath or affirmation of allegiance has evolved over the years, reflecting changed community concerns, since it was first introduced in 1949. The pledge captures the current way in which the Australian people view their national identity. It also reflects sense of national identity that can be readily identified with by citizens of Australia, not just applicants for citizenship. The pledge is specifically designed for use at citizenship ceremonies, to enable new citizens to affirm their commitment to Australia but it is also quite appropriate for use on public or formal occasions and in schools. To ensure the concepts in the preamble and the pledge are widely understood, and to promote the pledge to potential new citizens and its wider use in the community, the government has provided some modest funding for an information program involving advertising, posters in schools and other venues as well as the provision of a quality printed pledge, as a memento of the citizenship ceremony. In dealing with this amendment, I wish to refer briefly to the High Court decision relating to the Wills by-election. That decision clearly has very important implications for those Australian citizens who are dual citizens and their ability to fully enjoy the rights of other Australian citizens. The government has already made clear that it intends to pursue these issues with the opposition with a view to changing the current constitution requirements for eligibility for parliament. In our view Australian citizenship should be sufficient qualification. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. NA NA Consideration resumed from 7 October. Second Reading",37
87,Mr GEAR,AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 to extend the development allowance to projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspect of projects in the print media. These amendments re-open the application period for projects in the motor vehicle industry and a the print media that were previously excluded from the development allowance. The amendments reflect commitments made during the election campaign. While extending the eligibility of the dev-' elopment allowance to such projects, these amendments also ensure that projects relating to these two industries must meet competitiveness tests in relation to work practices and input pricing. As the law currently stands, these tests could be waived where the project sponsor is able to show that, prior to 1 January 1993, there was substantial commitment to completion of the project. That is, these amendments would provide that, irrespective of whether there was substantial commitment to completion before 1 January 1993, to be eligible for the development allowance projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspect of projects in the print media would have to meet the competitiveness tests. When this bill was debated in the Senate, an opposition amendment was passed inserting section 6 into the bill which "",ould remove the $50 million threshold test from projects in the motor vehicle industry and the print media. The government is opposed to that amendment, and will be moving an amendment to re-insert the $50 million threshold. All the other present criteria for eligibility for the development allowance would need to be met by projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspect of projects in the print media industry. I now 1993 tum to a more detailed discussion of these amendments. Additional Projects This bill defines additional projects to be eligible for the development allowance. In particular, projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspects of projects in the print media are proposed to become eligible for the development allowance. Industry Definitions The bill adopts a wide definition of the motor vehicle industry to include the manufacture of vehicles and components. The bill also defines printing production to include the printing unit and ancillary facilities. It is intended that the printing unit would include the facilities that control and operate the air conditioning plant in the building that houses the printing facility. This is a technical requirement of modern printing facilities. Additionally, the printing unit would typically include the system that manages the collection and disposal of waste material, as well as the system that determines the rate of ink flows, the speed of the presses, and the rostering of printing staff. However, it is not the intention to include any facility involved in the journalistic or editorial aspects of newspaper production. Timing of Applications The bill proposes amendments to reopen the application period for projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspects of projects in the print media until either 30 September 1993 or until 28 days after this act receives the royal assent, whichever is the later. This will ensure the affected businesses have sufficient time to lodge their applications. Criteria for Granting Application Lastly, as noted earlier, the bill proposes amendments to specify that, in order to be eligible for the development allowance, projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspects of projects in the print media must meet the competitiveness tests in relation to work practices and input pricing, irrespective of whether there was substantial commitment to completion before 1 January 1993. Opposition Amendment The opposition amendment in the Senate inserted section 6 into this bill. This section would make eligible all expenditure on plant and equipment in the motor vehicle industry and the print production facilities of the print media, no matter how small, provided the other criteria were met and the expenditure related to a 'project'. This would significantly complicate the task of administering the scheme as a project is defined, in part, by whether expenditure passes the $50 million threshold test. The broad project definition-a discrete productive facility-becomes less clear without the threshold, particularly for upgrades and expansions. The opposition argued that the existing allowance discriminates against small projects in favour of large projects. This precisely its policy intent. The allowance was introduced as a part of the One Nation statement as a targeted incentive to encourage large and internationally competitive projects to help get the economy moving again. By removing the $50 million threshold for projects in the motor vehicle industry and the print production facilities in the print media, the bias would be moved from large versus small projects, to small projects in these two industries as against small projects in other industries. There does not appear to be any good reason why small projects in these sectors should be favoured over small projects in all other sectors. I would also like to make the point that big companies undertake small projects, as well as large ones. For example, it is likely that major motor vehicle companies will have plant upgrades and extensions to existing facilities that could be defined as projects which fall below the $50 million threshold. This would all have a cost to the budget. In summary, the opposition amendment interferes with a fundamental design feature of the development allowance-the threshold. This significantly complicates the administration of the development allowance for no good purpose, would be an additional cost to the budget-in many cases for projects that had already been commenced-and reduces the degree of targeting in the assistance provided. Against this, the amendment offers few benefits. Accordingly, the government will be moving an amendment to this bill to delete section 6. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Somlyay) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Consideration resumed from 7 October. Second Reading",39
88,Dr THEOPHANOUS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (4.34 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill makes amendments to a number of acts within the health, housing, local government and community services portfolio. The amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and are aimed at rectifying a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen. Part 2 of this bill contains a measure making it an offence to furnish false or misleading information in support of applications for certain approvals under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954, as well as in support of submissions which may be made contesting an intent to revoke certain approvals. Generally, these applications relate to Commonwealth financial assistance, while the submissions relate to the proposed revocation of a person's approval as a suitable person to operate a service in receipt of Commonwealth subsidy. As a deterrent, the measure also provides a substantial penalty for the offence. Until now, there have been no specific offences or penalties under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 and reliance has been placed on the general offences under the Crimes Act 1914. The possible application of the general offences in the Crimes Act 1914 relating to providing false or misleading information to obtain a 'benefit' to applications and submissions under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 has been called into question. A recent amendment to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 provides that it is a condition of receipt of recurrent funding that an organisation operating, or intending to operate a hostel, ntust be approved as an approved operator. Such approval is granted only where, on the basis of information provided by way of application to the minister, the minister is satisfied that an applicant is suitable to be an operator of hostels. The department relies heavily on the accuracy of information provided to the minister and to other departmental decision makers to ensure the integrity of decisions in relation to matters of eligibility, relative merit and the suitability of persons to provide quality, efficient and compassionate care to frail aged people. This proposed amendment to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 removes any doubts over whether the provision of false and misleading information in applications and submissions made under the act are criminal offences. This measure aims to deter that minority element whose actions to date do not demonstrate a commitment to these objectives. Part 3 of the bill corrects two drafting errors in the National Health Act 1953 that were introduced by the passage of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment (No.2) Act 1992. The first amendment relates to the placing of section 99AB in the appropriate division of part VII of the National Health Act. Section 99AB relates to the payment of advances for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. It should be located in division 3 of the act. At the present time it is inappropriately located in division 4 of the act which relates to members of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. The second amendment relates to the replacing of the term 'in-patient' which previously existed in the National Health Act with the term 'person'. This was achieved by thepassage of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment (No.2) Act 1992. The replacement of the term 'in-patient' with the term 'person' in paragraph (da) of the definition of 'basic private table' or 'basic table' in subsection 4(1) of the act resulted in an amendment having been made which referred to a term that had not been introduced into the act at the time that the amendment came into effect. To overcome this problem a further amendment was required. Part 4 of the bill amends the Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Act 1992. That act introduced some consequential amendments to the provisions of the National Health Act 1953 relating to the changed title of members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the qualifications of persons who could be appointed as the chairperson of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. The proposed amendment makes it clear that the chairperson of the Pharmaceutical Remuneration Tribunal is to be either a senior deputy president or a deputy president of the Australon Ian Industrial Relations Tribunal. Part 5 of the bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973. The amendments in this part correct anomalies arising from the passage of the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Act (No.2) 1991. These amendments are of a minor technical nature and do not have any substantive effect. Clause 16 of the bill does, however, create an exception to the secrecy provision contained in section 130 of the Health Insurance Act 1973. Departmental officers frequently receive requests for information relating to public and private hospitals in Australia. The details which are often sought include the name and address of the hospitals, their bed capacities, the nature of the medical services provided, et cetera. Most information acquired in the performance of duties under the Health Insurance Act is protected from disclosure by the secrecy provision. This results in an absurdity arising in the situation where the 'protected' information is already legitimately out in the public domain. In the present situation the names and addresses of hospitals are to be found in telephone directories. To have a restriction on the ability of officers to disclose such information which is of assistance to members of the public appears to be absurd. Similarly, to restrict officers from providing details such as the number of beds available in a hospital, the kinds of services provided, et cetera, appear to serve no valid purpose as such information is already in the public domain from other sources. The proposed amendment is intended to make it clear that an authorised officer is able to release such information to members of the public on request. Part 6 of the bill amends the National Health Act 1953 by renumbering several provisions and removing references to repealed and redundant provisions. The bill also contains a measure which provides that records which are required to be kept under section 61 of the National Health Act 1953 to enable claims for Commonwealth benefit to be verified must be kept for seven years. There has, until this amendment, been no time limit the keeping of such records by proprietors. Claims for benefit are verified by examination of nursing home records by teams of Commonwealth officers. With expenditure of all nursing homes for each financial year from 1986-87 onwards subject to validation and acquittal, government resource constraints will mean that it may be some time before a nursing home's expenditure in relation to a given financial year is able to be validated. Because of this delay, the necessary records are often found to be incomplete or missing altogether. The proposed amendment introduces a statutory minimum retention period of seven years, which is equivalent to the period for which corporate records are required to be kept under taxation law, commencing from the end of the financial year to which the records relate. Currently, whilst the act broadly provides that records must be kept to enable verification of claims, this amendment will make this requirement explicit while limiting the time within which the Commonwealth must satisfy itself of a claim and take any necessary acquittal action. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Somlyay) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration in committee of the whole House forthwith. Senate s amendmentAt end of bill, page 4, add the following Part: ""PART 6-AMENDMENTS RELATING TO NA NA NA Object of Part ""13. The object of this Part is to allow shares in the Commonwealth Bank to be held by a banking entity that is a depositary under an American Depositary Receipts scheme. Limitation of shareholdings in Commonwealth Bank ""14. Section lOA of the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972 is amended: (a) by inserting after subsection (2) the following subsection: '(2A) Subject to the regulations, the reference in subsection (1) to an interest in share does not include a reference to an interest that a banking entity has only because the banking entity is a depositary under a scheme known as an American Depositary Receipts scheme.'; (b) by adding at the end of paragraph (3)(b) 'or (2A)'."".",41
89,Mr GEAR,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"I move: That the amendment be agreed to. Among other things, the amendment will allow shares in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to be held by a banking entity: for example, the Bank of New York. That is a depository under an American depository receipt, or ADR, scheme. Currently,under section lOA of the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972, there is a general prohibition on bank holdings of shares in the CBA. The amendment will permit the sale of CBA shares in the US via an American depository receipt scheme. Specifically, US investors, including institutional investors, who are otherwise prohibited from investing in foreign shares, will be able to make indirect investments in the CBA through their holdings of ADRs issued by a United States bank, thus widening the range of investors able to participate in the sale of the Commonwealth shares in the CBA. An ADR offering in the USA is an important part of the CBA sale program. It will help to maximise demand and possibly price. ADRs are used widely by Australian firms, including the three other major banks, tapping the US market. This technical amendment is consistent with the existing exemptions within the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972 for banks SCHEMES which hold bank shares in a trustee capacity and does not alter the general intent of that act to restrict interest that other banks may hold in the Commonwealth Bank.",43
90,Mr ROCHER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"The opposition has no serious objection to what is proposed. We are prompted to comment that this amendment makes provision for foreign ownership of the Commonwealth Bank, which seems to sit awkwardly with Labor Party rhetoric in its approach over recent years to the sale of equity in the Commonwealth Bank. Mr Chairman, I am sure you can a voting remember that in 1990 the Labor Party was vociferously opposed to any sale of any part of the Commonwealth Bank. Within a matter of months of that election, it approved the . sale of a certain percentage of the shares in the Commonwealth Bank. That represented one of those all too common stunning backflips by Labor which we have come to expect. . This amendment, in addition to the main provision of the bill to further reduce public ownership of the Commonwealth Bank, takes the argument a little further in that it facilitates foreign ownership, and specifically ownership in the United States, of shares up to a maximum of five per cent by any single entity in the US. That would seem to me to be contrary to Labor Party thinking as well as its rhetoric over recent years. The sale of this second tranche of shares in the Commonwealth Bank merely adds to the enormity of the change of direction of the Australian Labor Party, following successive elections, in its approach to ownership of the Commonwealth Bank, which for so many years Labor considered sacrosanct. I suggest that the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), who is in attendance, at the time would have very strongly opposed this measure, although her wishes do not seem to have been observed on this occasion, as they have not on so many others. There are others in the Labor Party who must feel betrayed by the major subject matter of the bill and in particular this amendment, for this amendment proposes to allow the sale of shares of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in the United States. The vehicle chosen is what is known as the American depository receipt scheme. ADRs are, as I understand it, the province of financial institualso tions, that is, United States banks, which act as the holder of up to a five per cent shareholding in the CBA. This amendment will facilitate those banks in the United States farming out - ome of that shareholding to other United States entities or citizens. We are assured by the government that US investors, who would otherwise be prohibited from investing in foreign shares of this sort, will be able to make indirect investments in the Commonwealth Bank through the ADRs. The depository banks will remain the registered Qwners. We are also assured by the government that regulations will effectively guard against any malpractice, although it is not clear to me how they might achieve that. I say that, given that it is the depository banks themselves which farm out as much of that five per cent holding as they might decide. Assuming there is more than one depository bank, we could very wel1 find that an investing entity in the United States could accumulate more than five per cent of the shareholding by dealing with more than one depository bank. It does not seem to me that there is any mechanism available to the Commonwealth to make sure that does not happen and to oversee those shareholdings. Perhaps it is not considered to be sufficient of a problem. If it is not, perhaps we should not have the five per cent minimum there anyway, or perhaps there is a mechanism which has not been disclosed by the minister or by the government. The general provision restricting any person, as defined under the act, to owning more than five per cent of the voting shares of the CBA is, we are told, extended to banks that are depositories under the American depository receipt scheme. I repeat: I do not know how we can exercise oversight and assure that the government's stated objective of keeping maximum shareholdings to no more than five per cent is accurately met. I repeat the point I started with: this is part of a betrayal. It is a betrayal of Labor voters mainly and, to a large extent, those in the left wing of the Labor Party. They are not only seeing nearly 50 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank dissipated to meet recurrent expenditure, but the proceeds are not even being used to reduce debt but to meet ongoing expenditure. The funds generated will not be available in subsequent years to meet that ongoing expenditure, which will have to be financed by other means. So they are being betrayed, firstly, by the sale of nearly 50 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, this being the second increment. They are being further let down because they would not have known, I am sure-the majority would not have known, anywaythat foreign ownership and United States ownership might be as high as five per cent, held by a number of different United States banks, that that shareholding of those different United States banks can be dissipated amongst investors, and that a single investor could conceivably accumulate much more than five per cent over a period. I am not sure we have the wherewithal to detect that should it happen. Amendment agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted.

91,Mr ROCHER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"The amendments brought to us by the Senate are a manifestation of the legislative incompetence of the government. Mr Chairman, you will recall that they came to us under circumstances which we found totally acceptable. We forewarned of the need for the coalition to take certain action and to adopt a certain position in the Senate. We have, indeed, done exactly that. Now we see an entirely predictable set of amendments back before the committee and I must say that I find the circumstances reprehensible. My friend the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) wants to speak at length and, given that the guillotine is in place, I shall out of courtesy curtail my remarks.",45
92,Mr DOWNER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"On these bills the coalition is determined to retain the position that it has held since 19 August. Our position is that we do not support increases in sales tax at this time, and we take that position on three different bases. First of all, the government has no mandate to increase indirect taxes at all, let alone in this way. During the last election campaign and before, every Labor member of parliament and, of course, above all the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), ran around this country saying that Labor could deliver to the Australian public income .lax cuts, but they would not have to resort to increases in indirect taxes to finance it. Now we have minister after minister, not least the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), coming to the dispatch box in this chamber and saying that they have to get these bills through in order to balance their books, or at least come close to balancing their books; that, if these bills not go through, they. will not be able to finance the income tax cuts. In this country that sort of hypocrisy and deceit ought to finish. No longer should the public have to put up with that type of behaviour from a major political party. We will continue to argue that these measures of betrayal should not pass through this parliament. The second point we have made is that the sales tax increases and the other measures are regressive. It is low income people who will bear the disproportionate burden of these tax increases. The Labor Party, which professes to show concern for low income Australians and which claims that a greater proportion of those people vote Labor at election time, is imposing these higher taxes at the expense of low income people. Millionaires in Toorak, the eastern suburbs of Sydney or Walkerville in Adelaide will not worry about increases in sales tax on cutlery, crockery, toothpaste, toothbrushes and so on. These increases will not worry those people. The people who will worry about the increases are the battlers in Australia, people the members of the Labor Party profess to represent. But government members scurry into this parliament and tum their backs on and betray those people. These bills are a betrayal of those people who, for many years, have put their faith in the Labor Party. After this act of betrayal they will never do so again. The third reason we oppose this measure, and will continue to oppose this measure, is that it is nonsensical. In a country with mass unemployment, around one million people out of work, what is the sense in increasing costs to business and increasing. the costs of our exports, thereby denying people jobs? Coupled with the increases in the fuel excise, these measures will cost this country something like 50,000 jobs. That comes from a party, by the way, which campaigned during the last election-as you, Mr Chairman, will remember-on the slogan, 'Jobs, not GST'. But what is this measure? This tax increase is more pernicious than the GST. Coupled with payroll tax and the fuel excise, by 199697 this tax will raise the same amount of do revenue as the GST would have raised but there are no rebates for business and exports are not exempted. Coupled with the increase in the fuel excise, this increase in sales taxes will cost jobs. We will be sustaining our strong opposition to these vicious, regressive and nonsensical measures which the Labor Party is trying to push through this parliathe ment. The budget strategy has been one of the great shambles of the last 10 years of Labor government, and that is saying something. is an ill-conceived strategy because it does not address any of our national problems: it its budget. does, not encourage investment; it does not encourage savings; it does not encourage jobs; and it does not help low in,come earners. completely fails to address any of the national problems that we face. Having introduced this regressive and deceitful budget, the government embarked a strategy of spooking, the Senate into porting it. First of all, the government went out and said that the budget was non-negoticoncede able. In the process of arguing that it non-ntfgotiable, it did something that I think is particularly unpatriotic and deceitful. government's senior ministers tried lise financial markets by saying that any opposition to this budget would simply bring the dollar down, push up interest rates, destabilise bond markets and create havoc for made Australia. Those ministers knew that was not true, and events have shown that it was true. In the last week or so the dollar has actually risen. Ms MCHugh-Don't shout.",45
93,Mr DOWNER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"The honourable member latest should listen because at the last election went around her electorate deceiving people. The honourable member never raised her voice on behalf of her constituents against these regressive measures. Not once did honourable member raise her voice. The tralians. honourable member does not care. I hope that she will go back to those people and tell them that she does not care about the higher indibluffing rect taxes that they have to pay. I hope honourable member has the decency to do that, but 1 do not suppose that she will. is just playing a political game. She will tell them that everything the Labor Party does is perfect. The fact is that senior ministers tried destabilise financial markets in order to spook the Senate into supporting these measures. They then tried to create a climate of crisis Australia by claiming that the coalition and other parties in the Senate were blocking the budget. We have never said that we would block the budget. We have never said that we would block supply. We have said that we It will oppose 1.4 per cent of this budget and that the government can have 98.6 per cent of Then the government claimed that conventions were being broken. Despjte the fact that It on 160 or so occasions since 1950 the Labor Party has voted against tax and other financial measures in budgets, this time it decided that nobody was allowed to vote against anything on the Labor Party, put up. What rot! The consupvention argument eventually foundered when the Minister, for Finance (Mr Willis) had to that in 1981 he had run a different was argument of convenience from the argument now being run today. In the midst of all that The the Prime Minister decided he would close to destabi- down question time. The government is still in' a terrible mess. Its budget is far from clear. As far as the sales , tax measures are concerned, the Greens have it clear that they will support the coalition in opposing the second round of increasnot es in the sales tax from 1 July 1995. On behalf of low income Australians, the people who are certainly forgotten by the Labor Party, we welcome their support. Indeed, the thing that I have heard is that the she Greens are considering opposing all of the increases in sales tax-that is, they are considering opposing these bills altogetherunless the government comes up with a better the compensation package for low income AusThe Cabinet has decided that it will stare down the Greens ,and try to call their bluff. We will wait to see whether they are or whether these regressive measures the will be defeated altogether in the end. The government has tried to blackmail the She wine industry into accepting a shoddy deal which still represents a vicious increase in tax on wine. It will not only damage the industry, but it will damage consumers' pockets as to well. Did the Labor Party go into the last election promising to increase the wine tax to 31 or 32 per cent, or even to 26 per cent? Of in course it did not; it said nothing about that. , The government is now in a state of tunnoil in regard to credit unions. The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which includes three Labor senators, has rejected the government's proposal to impose company tax on credit unions as it is of the view that small credit unions should be exempt. So there is still along way to go with this budget. The Labor Party has created its own monster. It has deceived the electorate, and that has led to a very determined response. The Labor Party has imposed regressive measures, and the coalition is standing up not only for integrity but for low income Australians against the viciousness and deceit of these types of tax measures. We will continue our opposition no matter what the threats from the Labor Party may be. We will not cave into empty threats, we will not be bullied and cajoled; we will stand up for Australians. (TIme expired)  pleased to speak in support of the Sales Tax (Deficit Reduction) Bill. I would say that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) would not recognise integrity if he fell over it.",46
94,The CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"The honourable member might withdraw.  people listening to the debate, which of course there were not, they would really have had to pinch themselves to work out what was being said. I recall during the last election-I must say that the opposition lost an unlosable election-that the opposition was advocating a goods and services tax which, in many instances; represented 15 per cent being placed on a whole manner of goods and services that hitherto had been tax-free. The issue we are debating is the increase the wholesale sales tax by a mere one per cent. It strikes me as very odd that the honourable member for Mayo is protesting so vehemently and strongly that somehow the government has misled or not informed the Australian people. In the government's statements during the election we did not make a pledge that there would be no increases in taxation; we said there would be no new taxes. Notwithstanding tax increases in this budget, the overall level of taxation does not rise-it is still lower-as a result of these measures. We ought not lose sight of that very important point. We hear honourable members in this chamber waxing lyrical about the imposition of a tax on the wine industry. Of spirits, beer and wine, wine is the most lightly taxed. I could run a respectable case that the beer drinking workers in my electorate-some of whom drink wine, but predominantly they drink beer-are cross-subsidising wine. Taking it one step further, the opposition would have us believe that beer drinkers owe some sort of community service obligation to the wine industry. That is most incredible. To suggest that hordes of fellow Australians are somehow going to be disadvantaged because of the increase in the wine tax is absolutely preposterous. Good luck to people who imbibe wine - I enjoy a drop of wine and, I might add, beer-but to suggest that one industry should receive preferential treatment is grossly unfair and smacks of sectionalism of the worse kind. Along with the increases being proposed is an Industry Commission review of the wine industry. I have little faith in an Industry Commission review of anything. But let us assume that there is a legitimate and sound review of the wine industry. It will show that this industry not only has performed well but also has an exceptionally rosy, strong and bright future. The honourable member for Mayo, in referring to the integrity he assumed for the opposition, advised that it would continue to obstruct this budget. I think it is rather sad that the opposition, having lost the unlosable election, cannot take stock of itself and work out just what its policy direction ought to be. in If it has assumed a direction since the election, it is one of destroying our conventions and processes and of being an opposition that opposes for the sake of it. Never before, certainly in my nine years in this place, have I seen an opposition behave in the Senate the way this current opposition has. There is a fundamental principle of democracy that conservative governments, Lahar governments, governments of whatever ilk, deserve to have their budgets passed substantially. It is quite clear that in this instance will not be the case. The opposition has sought to frustrate the government at every tum. It has mattered little whom the opposition needed to get into bed with to achieve. its grubby ends. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has pointed out, this is a very dangerous precedent to be setting and a very dangerous democratic principle to be overturning. I trust that the opposition never reaps the harvest of the seeds it has sown with its current actions. I take exception to a couple of the points made by the honourable member for Mayo. He said that the government's suggestion that interest rates-because of the lack of the passage of the budget-might need to be increased and that there would be a run on the dollar would be proved false. To the contrary, it has been proved to be true. After the budget the dollar did fall. The Governor of the Reserve Bank expressed concern that, with the uncertainty surrounding the budget, interest rates might need to be increased. That would have been a tragedy. Now it has been seen that the substantial package of the budget will be passed-in particular with these bills now being debated in this chamber having every prospect of being passed-the markets, being mature and able to divine these things, have determined that there is not instability. The majority of the government's proposals will pass and the cause for panic has lessened. Consequently, the dollar is rising and the possibility of an interest rate rise-because of the opposition's attempt at destruction of the budget-has passed. We have also seen the share market rise very strongly. Some people may say that we are rounding the comer in terms of economic recovery and that a degree of optimism is building in the community, based on a· variety of sound statistics that suggest the recovery, which is already under way, is gathering pace and will quicken over the next 12 to 18 months. All of us, at least on this side of the chamber, welcome such news. But to suggest that there was no price to be paid if the opposition's mealy-mouthed, destructive tactics had succeeded is absolutely false. I reject the contenit tion made in this chamber by the honourable member for Mayo. It is also the case that, whilst governments need to place taxes on a variety of goods, as we have-not the 15 per cent GST that the opposition proposed-these fund a number of worthwhile objectives and government expenditures. I do not need to run through all the great initiatives announced during the election campaign and the budget, but these increases will fund child care, assistance for the aged, assistance for ·low income earners, the new dental program and a whole raft of other measures. We ought to object when an opposition suggests that the deficit must be lowered but takes every measure in this chamber and in the Senate to ensure that the deficit is not lowered but increased. Some would argue, quite rightly, that this is hypocrisy in the extreme. I support the measures before the chamber. MrROCHER (Curtin) (5.18 p.m.)-I will deal briefly with a few of the points that the  attempted to make. He referred to the alleged undertaking by the government not to introduce new taxes after the most recent election. I point out to the honourable member that if these taxes were not new impositions it would not have been necessary to subdivide the bills, as the government was obliged to do. The reason we have debated separate bills, and amendments to some of those bills, is that in imposing new taxation a single bill would have been in breach of section 53 of the constitution, which provides that the imposition of a tax shall be dealt with in a separate bill and that each and every increase in a tax shall be dealt with in a separate bill. The preamble refers to the imposition of new taxes. The reason we are talking about these bills is that they impose new taxation. The honourable member for Chifley went on to say that never in his time in the parliament has he known the Senate to behave as it is doing now. Forgetting the implication that something extraordinary has happened, I suggest the reason for that is that he has not been here long enough. He certainly was not here when Gough Whitlam, then the Leader of the Opposition, undertook to destroy the then coalition government's budget- 'destroy' was the word he used-and, as a consequence, to destroy the then coalition government. If the honourable member has· not previously observed the Senate behaving and acting as it is now, it is because he has not been here long enough. He certainly. was not here in 1901 when the very first budget was presented to the Australian people. That budget was referred back to the House of Representatives by the Senate on no less than three occasions. There are a lot of furphies flying around about this. The first is the complete falsehood that the budget is being blocked. Nothing could be further from the truth. The appropriation bills are going through. We do not intend to vote against them; nor do we intend to attempt to amend them. Some revenue raising matters accompanying the budget are attracting the attention of the opposition. We havespelt that out virtually from day one when the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) brought down his budget. But I make it known that we have not denied the government a supply of money. It will not be prevented in any way from continuing to govern by any action we take in relation to this budget. . Another claim is that the budget has been sabotaged. If all the coalition's preferences are adopted by the Senate-and that is far from likely-the minimum amount of revenue at risk is $1.4 billion which, coincidentally, is about 1.4 per cent of the revenue raising contemplated under this budget. How can the budget be wrecked by the elimination of 1.4 per cent of revenue-raising measures proposed? It is well known that the coalition will not get its way on' all of the proposes to oppose. The deficit reduction plan is said by the honourable member for Chifley and be at risk. The honourable member says that, as parties who claim to seek a lower deficit, what we propose is inconsistent, incompatible, or would prevent a deficit reduction plan being put in place by cutting expenditure and by other measures. That is nonsense. By draw 1996-97, on the most favourable projections for growth· that can be reasonably contemplated-that is, about four per cent over the years until 1996-97-this government will still need to cut in the vicinity of $6.8 billion from expenditure unless it proposes to increase taxes further. A more reasonable growth rate figure will mean that somehow it will have to find savings in expenditure far in excess of $6.8 billion. There we have another lie which is peddled around the place. The government could split the two rounds of wholesale sales tax increases into two bills if it is worried about the defeat of that particular measure in the Senate. In that way it could be reasonably sure of being able to deal with the measures defeated as early as June next year; whereas, because of the stupid position it has put itself into now per favour of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), it could lose all of its legislation. We have heard this nonsense about parliamentary convention and the Senate being obliged to pass budget measures untouched. I have already dealt with that to some extent. It is an outright falsehood. This, and the points I have made earlier, are all part not of this l-a-w-Iaw technique adopted by Labor but of the l-a-w-lie and win technique adopted at the most recent election. The - ovemment says that the Senate is holding up taxes. I remember a couple of weeks ago that the Treasurer was out peddling that lie",47

We have a series of l-a-w techniques, and honourable members can take their choice as to which one I refer to. But what we hear by way of argument in connection with the blocking of the budgetthat is, the coalition's behaviour, and the attitude of the Senate towards the budget-is based on Goebbels-like propaganda, repeated time and time again, in the hope that enough people in the gallery will pick it up and run with it. (TIme expired)",50
109,Mr ROBERT BROWN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"There have been some appalling comments made about the position that the opposition has adopted.,-particularIy in its role in the Senate-in connection with the whole question of this year's budget. It does not really matter very much how the opposition would seek to dress up the position that it has adopted. If we are not particularly we are going to finish up in a similar situation to that which prevails in the United States where it is necessary, in order that the processes be completed, for all types of deals, arrangements, understandings, commitments and agreements to be made between various within Congress before the budget is finally determined. I do not think that anyone could claim that all budgets finalised in the United States are very sensible economic documents. If they were, the United States would not be intent on seeking to achieve over the next few years a reduction in its budget deficit to something like five per cent of GDP, when we are seeking to reduce our budget deficit to one per cent of GDP. In fact, the impact of that cumulative deficit has been such as to not only cause serious instability and serious economic difficulties in the United States, but to extend those difficulties outside the boundaries of the United States to the rest of the world, particularly the Western world. I want to make reference to some of the observations made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) during his contribution this debate. He attempted to prove that the taxation provisions in these bills were new taxes by claiming that section 55 of the constitution makes the point that, in connection with the imposition of· new taxation, separate items of legislation are necessary for those provisions to be introduced. Of course, that is not the case. In fact, section 55 of the constitution simply refers to legislation which is designed to impose taxation. It is very convenient to slip in that word 'new' in order to prove that these are new taxation provisions. They are nothing of the kind. What the provisions of this legislation attempt to do is not to impose new taxation but clearly to adjust the rates of taxation to pre-existing arrangements. They are not new taxation provisions. Mr Deputy Chairrilan, as you know, as all members of this chamber know, as all members of the Senate know, and as those in the wider community know, there was considerable dispute, considerable controversy and difference of opinion concerning whether or not it was necessary for us to split that budget bill into a number of separate bills, as the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the government have chosen to do. The honourable member for Curtin also made the claim that the budget is not being blocked. He referred to some elements about which the opposition had expressed concern as simply 'revenue raising measures'. I suppose there is some degree of pedantry there- 'revenue raising measures'. I suppose if one knocks back enough revenue raising measures, one certainly blocks the budget. There has never been a claim made on our behalf that the capacity of the government to govern, to secure supply, would be in any way challenged or threatened. What we have been concerned about is that the strategy, the attitude, the tactics which have been adopted by the opposition have been such, and could be such, as to cause very significant changes to the general strategy adopted by the government in connection with the budget when it was being prepared and when it was first introduced. The honourable member for Curtin went on to say that the revenue threatened is only about 1.4 per cent of budget revenue. I have heard a fair amount of this. coming from opposition members. What they have attempted to do, of course, is to diminish the significance of the actions they have taken. For what other reason would they claim that this represents only 1.4 per cent of total budget revenue? In fact, what it would represent, if that revenue were lost as a result of their opposition, would be an increase in the deficit of about 10 per cent. Mr Deputy Chairman, if you were also to look at the amount of discretionary expenditure contained within the budget-of course, that is not 100 per cent, because public servants have to be paid, and all of those government programs where no discretion is available have to be continued-that 1.4 per cent of total revenue becomes a much more substantial proportion of discretionary government expenditure. That is, what makes it significant. To attempt to understate the significance of that indicates at least a nition on the part of the opposition that to cause a serious challenge to the integrity of a government's budget is a serious decision to take, and those are serious issues to pursue. The opposition should not continue to attempt to understate it. The fact is that 1.4 per cent of total government revenue is a very significant proportion of total discretionary expenditure on the part of government, and 1.4 per cent of total revenue would represent a very significant increase in the size of the budget deficit. The honourable member for Curtin went on to say that to achieve the deficit reduction that the government proposes, it would be necessary to cut expenditure by $6 billion between now and 1996-97 and that that cut in expenditure of $6 billion was based on a four per cent growth estimate. Without necessarily disputing those figures, certainly, to bring down the forecast budget deficit this year of about $15 112 billion to one per cent of GOP by 1996-97 would require a reduction in government expenditure of $6 billion or an increase in government revenue of $6 billion to bring it back to about the $9 billion it would need to be if it were to represent one per cent of GOP. While the opposition, by the position it has adopted, has clearly recognised the legitimacy of that approach, it has done everything it could to thwart it. That does not indicate to me in any wayan opposition which is attempting to do anything other than disrupt the parliament, to disrupt the procedures of the parliament, to disrupt the management capacity of the government, to attack the general budget strategy, to talk down the economy, as it necessarily has done in the process of adopting this strategy and this approach, and, of course, to disturb financial markets as well. It does not reflect very well on opposition members. They know the importance of maintaining confidence in financial markets. They know the importance of doing that, particularly in the context of a deregulated economy which this government, a Labor government, has been responsible for bringing about. To see the whole of that situation being threatened as a result of the position recogbeing adopted by opposition members, as I say, serves them very poorly and reflects very little credit on their concern. Opposition members have also claimed on other occasions, Mr Deputy Chairman, as you know, that their attempt to block revenue items, taxation items, in this budget is very similar to what occurred in 1981 when the then Labor opposition took measures to oppose revenue items. That total revenue, I believe, on that occasion represented something like $150 million. What they are seeking to do is to threaten revenue items equal $1,400 million. Of course, if one adds to that as well the import of the position they have adopted, it means that within a matter of a few years they would be threatening the total budget revenue to the extent of about $3,000 million-a long way from the $150 million that was at issue in the early 1980s. There is also the question of the commitment that the present government made before the last election. Let us be clear about that. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other spokesmen for the government said those tax cuts that were being promised at that time by the coalition would be provided by Labor when in government, but without a GST. That was the promise and we have provided those tax cuts. We have provided those tax cuts without a GST. So people who keep repeating the claim and talk about a Goebbeis-like approach are the very ones who are practising that approach. (TIme expired)",50
110,Mr ANDREW,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"In his normal eloquent way, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has attempted, in one way or another, to blackguard the opposition for i.ts stand and to defend the government. That is scarcely surprising, but I thought his speech largely came unstuck when, in the latter part of his speech, he said, 'Yes, in 1981 we did do something similar, but it was defensible because the sum of money was relatively less'. In other words, from his perspective, what happens to the budget is entirely defensible, but whether or not it can be excused depends on the sum of money involved. Where are we to draw this line? The opposition is here defending the rights of Australians to be told at a poll what will happen to them. We are defending the rights of Australians not to be levied with tax measures of which they were given no indication when the government went to the election in March this year. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has made the point that if the government delivered all that the opposition sought the budget would be affected by 1.4 per cent, or $1.4 billion. The honourable member for Charlton indicated that $170 million was okay to over 12 years ago but that this sum is too large and cannot be contemplated. I represent electors who are directly concerned about a government expenditure of less than the $150 million mentioned by the honourable member for Charlton. Those electors are directly concerned by a tax collection initiative that generates only $70 million. From that point the Treasurer (Mr Daw-ns) has been totally non-negotiable. Let us have no nonsense in this chamber about the opposition in some way thwarting the will of the government. Mr Chairman, do you know who is actually causing this delay? The Treasurer! The Treasurer is simply unable to accept the will of the parliament. Let us take an issue like the wine tax. In the view of the honourable member for Charlton, the opposition and the Greens have combined to thwart the will of the government over an inappropriate tax in the sum of $70 million. But the parliament's view is that it is inappropriate for the Treasurer to collect this $70 million, and that should have been the end of it. That should have been the point at which the Treasurer said, 'I hear what the parliament is saying, and I amend the budget appropriately'. Because the Treasurer petulantly will not accept the will of the parliament, this debate goes on and on at the expense of the wine industry. Let us have no nonsense about the opposition causing this delay. The Treasurer is the one who has refused to accept the will of the parliament. Much has been made in this committee stage about the opposition being obstructionist. I flatly deny and refute any such argument. The government is choosing not to hear what the parliament is saying. Much has been made of the fact that, going into the March election, the opposition proposed a goods and services tax. I do not think the opposition should be apologetic for having said to the people of Australia, 'This is what we will do if we are the government'. We told the people what we were going to do, but they chose not to endorse our package. We laid our cards on the table. How does that compare with the government's performance? How does that compare with this budget and its various tax measures that were in no way anticipated by the people of Australia? As if the misrepresentation that occurred prior to March was not enough, look at what happened in the parliament today. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) came in and, in response to a dear dorothy dix question, continued to peddle the total misrepresentation about the opposition's tariffs policy. He continued to talk about zero tariffs when there was never any such proposal in the Fightback package. He did it shamelessly, perpetuating the same sort of nonsense that the government produced prior to March which managed to get them onto the government benches and which meant that it was responsible for a budget that has rightly been ridiculed right around the nation . The honourable member for Chifley was very anxious to defend the very wine tax that I am opposing, and he was anxious to defend it on the grounds of tax - quity. This would be the only nation in the world where tax equity on alcoholic beverages is measured in dollar terms. Take a look at the Europeans. The Europeans are some of our major competitors in the production of wines and spiritsparticularly wines-and they make no apology for the fact that the tax regime that they levy on their wine industry is far different from the tax regime that they levy on their beer and spirits industries. Why? The answer is that there is no comparison in the lead time between the brewing of beer and the maturing of wine. There is no comparison in the lead time between providing the hops and the barley for beer and providing the grapes to produce wine. The Europeans have a certain pride in their wine industry. In many ways they see it as indicating the involvement of their communities in the production of wine. The Europeans recognise that there ought to be a distinct tax differential between the way in which imposts are applied on the wine industry and on the beer and spirits industries. That plea has been totally unheeded by this government and the Treasurer, even after the parliament had indicated that the proposed tax regime was totally inappropriate. Is that tax equity, Mr Chairman? All the media focus has been on the inequity of lifting the wine tax by 55 per cent. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) and the honourable member for Charlton to tell me how they can defend a similar package, as part of this budget, that lifts the tax on de-alcoholised wines by 110 per cent. It has largely been lost in the smoke of the wine tax, but if wine growers around Australia are indignant about a 55 per cent tax hike on alcoholic wines how can it be defensible to put a 110 per cent tax hike on de-alcoholised wines, the alcohol content of which beverages is generally below 0.5 per cent? That is what the government proposes to do, and it expects the opposition to turn a blind eye to it. We think there are a few amendmen- that would make this a better and more equitable budget, and they are the sorts of amendments that we are proposing. I ask the honourable member for Charlton to consider the fact that the wine industry, lauded by the government as a model for future industry growth, has a target to export wine valued at $1 billion by the year 2000. The 31 per cent tax originally proposed would mean that by the year 2000 that industry, having possibly reached its target of $1 billion worth of exports, would have paid $2 billion in tax. The honourable member for Charlton could quite rightly say that I should consider the government's recognition on 15 October that it was prepared to look at this again and bring the tax back to 26 per cent-not to the 20 per cent that used to prevail. Even with a tax of 26 per cent, the industry would have paid $1 billion worth of tax by the year 2000 for generating $1 billion worth of export. That is hardly an exercise in equity. It is hardly a defensible taxation measure. It is one of the measures that we find so frustrating. Time will not allow me to chase into the other sales tax impacts, but suffice it to say that on this side of the chamber· we are standing up for a fairer budget. Our course is not to frustrate the course of the government but to deliver to the. people of Australia a budget that has the measure of equity about it that they might have anticipated following the March poll.",52
111,Mr WAKELIN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"I come from regional Australia. Whilst this charade that the government is inflicting upon us is dragging on day by day, we should think a little bit about the people that we to represent. We still have one million people unemployed; we still have commodity prices, particularly in the agricultural sector, at almost all time lows; we have many people facing drought; and we have many people facing the day-today excesses of this government. This government seems to be absolutely incapable of recognising the damage that it does to our export industries. The electorate of Grey produces about 50 per cent of South Australia's exports. I do not think even this government would claim to have a mandate to further disadvantage those export industries. I was interested in the comments of the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). I see he has left the chamber now. He talked in all those wonderful, glowing phrases that experienced parliamentarians are able to present to this place when they try to defend the indefensible. He talked about the various interests that were blocking this budget. I suspect one of the strongest interests in this parliament that blocked or changed some of the more excessive things in the budget of August was the caucus itself. It was the caucus and the interest of its members in holding their seats which changed many of the more extreme measures. The honourable member for Charlton talked about the integrity of the budget. If ever there was a word misused in this parliament in this context, it is the word 'integrity'. He talked about the disruption of the parliament and said that the government had the power to have this budget passed many weeks ago. The article in the Australian Financial Review today by Christine Wallace-no doubt much read by many of us:-sums up the issue so clearly. I refer to point 8 of the article, which states: The tax Bill impasse is undermining investor confidence. This was mentioned by the honourable member for Charlton. Let us look at it. It states: On August 18 ... the AlI Ordinaries Index finished at 1894.7, the $A closed at US67,45c, and TWI 49.3 and 90-day bills were 4.77 per cent. This is the damage that this has done to the economy. Let us look at the all ordinaries of are trying last Friday. The article states: ... the All Ordinaries finished at 2074.1, the $A at US66.29c and TWI 48.8, and 90-day bills were 4.78 per cent. As Christine Wallace says: This is not a picture of shattered investor confidence. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in an answer in question time the other day, there has been a $85 billion improvement in the capitalisation share market. This stand by the coalition parties is about fairness. It is about fairness to those people who elected those of us who are on this side of the parliament. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said earlier today, most of the calls that we get to our offices are about wanting to get rid of this lot or wanting to get rid of the government. So I come back to the practical effect every day on ordinary people. Has this government grabbed the votes, got the power and said, 'How do we get it next time'? It has no vision, no thought for the future. Government members say, 'Let's get the power, let's get the trappings of office and let's just do our will'. They do not think for a bit about those people that they are supposed to be representing. I come back to where I started-with the one million people who are unemployed, those small businesses still struggling out of recession, those employees wondering whether they will have a job next year and those young people who are looking for opportunities. There is only one place the young people can get employment, and that is from opportunities within business. That is what we should be about; that is what this Australian parliament should be about. It should not be about listening to governments justifying these miserable little measures that they keep bringing backwards and forwards all time. Governments should lead; governments should show some vision. I come back to the export industries. I have not heard, in the time that I have been in this place,. anything about the great export industries of this country. I have heard a fair bit about the wool industry and the attempt to get it through this very difficult period, but I the government make no comment about the damage that its policies have done to costs and the way it handled the reserve price scheme. I hear nothing of that. These great export industries of this country are going to provide the opportunities through this decade and into the next· century, and that includes tourism. What did we do to the tourist industry in regional Australia? We added the fuel excise, not to mention the wholesales sales tax. In conclusion, I say to the government that it has the capacity with relatively simple measures to get this budget over and done with. It has already been stated that it is a minuscule amount that the debate is about. It is a minuscule amount in the overall context, so I say to the government: get on with it, stop playing politics with it and let us get on with running this country to the best benefit of every Australian.",54
112,Ms WORTH,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"It is a pleasure for me to debate this budget because I feel about it quite passionately. Mr Deputy Chairman, I note that you are joined in the chamber today by only one of your colleagues from the government. It reminds me of that night when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) replied to the budget and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could not tum up. It does not surprise me that there are no members of the government from marginal seats defending this budget, because they would have to be getting exactly the same feedback in their electorates as I. I say to those one or two journalists who, over the weekend, fell for the trick of taking the publicity pumped out of the Prime Minister's office about it being time to pass the budget and to stop messing around, that I have not had one phone call or person give that message to my electorate office. But I can tell honourable members that there have been hundreds of letters telling me to give the government some stick and to not let the government do this to them. Most of those complaints come from the people who earn the least in my electorate. They are the people who driv- old cars and will pay more for their petrol. That makes a lot of difference to them, hear and they are going to be much worse off. In particular, 4,400 single parent families will lose as much as 22c a week, even if they are not having that odd glass of wine. This is after these great tax cuts that are l-a-w. I refer to the 17,800 families with children-low income earners-who will find that their marginal gain of $1.36 a week will be eroded by bracket creep and inflation. Then there are the 3,600 self-employed people. Those in the lowest 20 per cent income group will lose $1.19, but those in the top 10 per cent will make $19.75 weekly. These are Treasury's own figures. How about the pensioners and the self-funded retirees who come into this 20 per cent income group at the lowest level? They are going to be worse off. So it is no wonder that there are few government members in this chamber and it is no wonder that there is nobody from a marginal seat to defend the budget. Mr Andrew-None from South Australia either.",55
113,Ms WORTH,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"No, as has been said by someone known to most of them, the budget is indefensible. Mr Downer-Martin Ferguson.",55
114,Ms WORTH,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,That is right; Martin Ferguson said it was indefensible.,55
115,Mr CADMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,Michael Easson.,55
116,Ms WORTH,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Michael Easson said it was indefensible, or certainly something very similar. The Prime Minister thinks that, if he goes on saying things long enough and influences journalists to write them up, we will get on with business and there will not be any more fuss about passing this budget. We will not do that because, recognising that we are in opposition, we are going to take notice of those who keep contacting our offices and say, 'Give them some stick'. It is our obligation to be standing up for those people that we are here to represent. This budget was brought in at a time when there were nearly one million Australians out of work, and there were certainly more than one million underemployed. The budget has changed just three times in the past two months, but it is still no closer to solution. As other speakers have said, what we are complaining about makes up only 1.4 per cent of revenue but, on principle, we must complain and complain loudly. Coming from South Australia and having many wine outlets in the electorate of Adelaide, I am compelled to mention the wine tax. I refer to an editorial ""in the Adelaide Advertiser last Friday. The headline was ' Mr Dawkins' sour little Victory'. It states: If the so-called compromise wine tax does go through, there will be no credit for the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins. It was a mean and bad tax to begin with. The Treasurer's response to the wave of opposition to it has been mean-spirited. As a consequence of his blunder, sales have slumped 30 per cent in recent weeks. The editorial continues: But it is not only Mr Dawkins who has emerged so badly from this shabby business. Where were all SA's federal Labor parliamentahonesty rians? They know this is the wine State. Yet their only discernible contribution to its fortunes since the Budget has been as consumers. There is also to be an Industry Commission inquiry. Why? Just about every conceivable detail of the wine industry's economics, from production through to retail sales, has been quantified minute detail. They are readily available to the most casual inquirer. Winemakers and grape growers may feel they have accomplished something. This newspaper thinks they remain victims, treated with insulting arrogance by a government which should be to help them. The wine industry has, had some victory, but I think it has been forced into a compromise with a gun at its head on the basis that to be seriously wounded was better than to be dead. That is what this tax would have done to our industry which those of us in South Australia have extreme pride in. This leads me to comment that federal Labor has absolutely abandoned state Labor, which has been there making a mess of South Australia for the last 10 years. The federal government will not want to be seen to be associated with that campaign, because when the Premier has the courage to call an election the state government will go down badly, knowing that it has been deserted by its federal colleagues not caring about a wine industry which is important to South Australia, not caring about those people on low incomes and students who will have· to pay more for their petrol, and not cariqg about the people on the lower 20 per cent income of our population who will be so much worse ,oK "" This is an appalling budget. I believe it is our duty to stand up for those people who are being so badly affected. I chastise those who have argued that we are being disruptive in the Senate, a democratically elected bodynot unrepresentative swill, as claimed by the Prime Minister. I certainly hope that others will stand and argue on this issue, because it is important.",55
117,Mr CADMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"This is a despicable budget and a despicable government. The opposition chose, in its and forthrightness, to say to the Australian people that there are four measures we absolutely reject in this budget, four measures that were never announced to the Australian people, and in fact four measures that were covered by the carte blanche statein ment during the election campaign of both the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that there would be no increase in taxes; that there would be no new taxes. The coalition stands against the breaking of the government's word by the government. The four measures are: the increased there tax on unused annual leave; the general increase in wholesale sales taxes-need I say that it is a 12112 per cent increase in wholesale sales taxes; an increase in sales tax on wine; and an increase in excise and duty on petroleum products-all things that will seriously damage the Australian economy and the ability of Australia to recover. I can quote the Prime Minister lime after time. An article in the Telegraph Mirror of 6 October refers to the night of the election win of the Australian Labor Party on 13 March and quotes the Prime Minister. It states: ""The people of Australia have taken us on trust, and we'll return that trust, he said. ""And we care about those people out there, particularly the unemployed"". He went on: ""I can assure you the Government will now be redoubling its efforts to be as good a Government as you hope and expect; to .be as conscientious with this mandate as we can be"". What a statement to make on the night of the win! Then at the first opportunity-the budget-he broke that commitment and that understanding with the Australian people. The Prime Minister said, 'We have heard, and we understood. We know we have a narrow margin of majority and the Australian people really think that on balance they can trust us more than they can trust this nebulous proposition the opposition has put forward with the goods and services tax'. What did he do on the first possible opportunity, much to the,chagrin and disgust of his own party? At every opportunity the caucus has been attacking the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for breaking the trust with the Australian people. It is understandable why the caucus should feel that way. It is understandable that 75 per cent of Australians want the budget chucked out and the government to start all over again. They took the Prime Minister at his word when he said: The people of 'Australia have taken us on trust, and we'll return that trust. Some trust from this government! Some trust from this Prime Minister! He went on to say on the night of the election win, 'We will take care of those people out there, particularly the unemployed'. But there will be no new programs, and unemployment will continue right through this year at its current unprecedented high levels. The government has not done a thing about unemployment in this budget. In fact, the projected figures show that the year will finish as it started, with the same level of unemployment as we have now. So much for the promise of the Prime Minister! Some trust! Some commitment! The Prime Minister has met a coalition which is prepared to stand up against himand thank goodness for some of those Independent senators who are also prepared to force the government to live by its word. On 13 March· the Prime Minister went on to assure the Australian people by saying: I can assure you the Government will now be redoubling its efforts to be as good a Government as you hope and expect; to be as conscientious with this mandate as we can be. Immediately after making. that statement the Prime Minister and the government launched into things that were never predicted by the Australian people. The Prime Minister launched this budget which was about raising taxes, taxes which were unexpected and which have been introduced in legislation going by such names as deficit reduction bills. Goodness me, what a sleight of hand! 'Deficit reduction bill' is a way of saying that it is a tax increase bill. After election night the Prime Minister immediately launched into the republic issue and Mabo, and now we have the problems of the budget. The Australian people were not expecting any of this, nor was it enunciated or spelt out to them. The Prime Minister continues day after day to look for new issues to distract the Australian people, but they remember exactly what the government said during the election campaign and they remember the statements of the Prime Minister on election night when he made his commitment to the Australian people that they could take him on trust. The Prime Minister has looked at a number of areas where the government can make an impact on the Australian people. On 8 October he told the parliament that he takes full credit for the $84 billion increase in market capitalisation in the past 11 months. On the one hand, he is condemning the opposition for its stand of principle in the Senate and, on the other hand, he says this is wrecking Australia. Then he takes credit for the increased capitalisation that the Australian economy is showing; A newspaper article of 8 October quoted the Prime Minister as follows: ""The economy is lifting and the country' is growing. We are seeing that reflected also in today's September labour force numbers and of course in the all ordinaries index on the stock market;"" he said. ""This country is off and moving. Eight days ago he said that the economy was taking off, and yet today and in the last few days he has bagged the coalition for wrecking the economy. The Prime Minister is so inconsistent in all his statements that the Australian people have come to accept this inconsistency. That is why they do not take him on trust or at his word. The fact of the matter is the budget is not being blocked by the coalition. The coalition has a right to call for amendments to legislation, and that is what is happening. The budget is not being wrecked. The minimal amount of $140 million of joint agreement between the parties over there in the Senate is hardly a world shattering amount of money. We say that the maximum amount of $1.4 billion should be knocked out of the budget, which is only 1.4 percent of the total revenue raised by the government. That is all it is; it is a trilling amount. So the budget is not being wrecked. The government says the deficit cut plan will be ruined if the Senate does not give in. That is garbage also. Journalists, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been trying to run these lines over the last few days about the increases they have made in the wholesale sales tax, the damage the increase in petrol excis- will have to the Australian community, the change in the wine sales tax and the increased tax on unused annual leave, which I think is the most despicable tax of the lot. The government says that the Senate is holding up the tax cuts. That is not true. The tax cuts are not due yet. There is over a month to go before the tax cuts are due, so they are not being held up by anybody. They can be passed , within hours of their due time and still the Australian people will get their tax cuts. Another statement that is being made by the government is that, by parliamentary convention, the Senate passes the budget untouched. That is also rubbish, a furphy and a lie which is being perpetrated by members of the government and the government at large. That is not true. All budgets are debated, amended, adjusted and looked into by the Senate and the House of Representatives. The government says that the budget is way behind schedule, which is sheer bunkum. It is a furphy spread by government and friends of the government in the media. The purpose of spreading that furphy is to put pressure on the Greens and on the coalition to change what we are doing-standing up for principle. The government also said that Labor's loss of Senate control at the last election has caused the problem. That is not necessarily the case either because governments of all types have had problems in the Senate getting the detail of a budget through. Finally, the government spreads the lie that the tax bill impasse is undermining investor confidence. Only the government is undermining investor ,confidence in Australia today. The Prime Minister makes gross statements that everything is under control and then he launches into Mabo, the republic and the budget. He takes a joy in controversial matters which leads to lack of confidence, to a lack of trust and to the Australian people being uncertain about where the leadership of Australia is taking them. The PrilIli{ Minister and, the government have created the uncertainty. (TIme expired)",56
118,Mr CLEELAND,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"I have great pleasure in accepting the challenge of several honourable members on the other side to the extent that no marginal member of the government has been prepared to come into this chamber to debate the Sales Tax (Customs) (Deficit Reduction) Bill. Let me firstly suggest to the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) that if he has trouble wiping his chin from the dribbles he has just dropped I am happy to lend him a handkerchief. It is nice to know that in the years I have not been here those opposite have not improved at all. In this debate we have ranged over the republic, international economics and Mabo. It has been a debate about anything but what is before this chamber. I am happy to join members of the opposition in such a wide ranging, unlimited debate which they have now set. I will now speak about what I think is happening. The Australian Labor Party is a very proud, historic party in this country. It is a pluralist party and represents large sections of the Australian community. We are not like the opposition. We are not dictated to from the top. The Australian Labor Party, when it brings down a budget, is prepared to have it debated within the party structures. Members of the opposition, on the other hand, end up with Fightback, which was not debated within their party structures. We now know, after the disaster that befell them in March of this year, that Fightback was not agreed to by many of their backbenchers-so they now say. We can doubt that, having had the benefit of hindsight. The Australian Labor Party is not like that. It is not a top-heavy party and does not allow itself to be dictated to by academic economists, QCs and their ilk who come into this place without any broad based public experience and tell the Australian public and, more importantly, their party, what to do. Let us not kid ourselves about any degree of honesty or integrity in the way the opposition conducts its affairs in setting policy. Those opposite now know, and I think they will all agree, that their policies in Fightback were a political disaster. They are still trying to get rid of it. Yet they have the temerity to come into this chamber and say that we as the Labor Party, we as the government and we as the caucus do things differently and that they disagree with us. It is no secret that I and many caucus members have had a lot of concerns about the bUdget. But we are not like those opposite. We took those concerns within the caucus processes and we forced changes. To the credit of the government and the ministers, they accepted those changes. They accepted the wide ranging debate that occurred because they are part of a pluralist party. They understand that there are differing views in our society and our community and it is right and proper that we go through these processes in the formulation of policy. Members of the opposition should not come into this place and say to us as a party and a government that our processes in determining policy are wrong. They should not kid themselves. If they are prepared to sit back and let academic economists give them Fightback, I will clap my hands and say, 'Let's go for the next election'. If that is the way they want to set their policies, let them do it. But they should not come in here and say to us that the way we debate and' formulate policy is wrong. I would rather be on this side of the chamber any day of the week and be involved in a party that is prepared to stand up, debate and draw its conclusions the way we do it. We have the courage of our convictions and we have got guts as backbenchers and members to stand up and say it. We are not like those opposite who, after the election, run around saying to the media that they did not agree with Fightback. What a wank! That is the best way to describe it. Where was the courage of opposition backbenchers before the election? Where were they all? Digging big holes andlliding in them. They now come into this place and say that we should not have arguments within our caucus and we should not tell our ministers they are not doing the wrong thing when they are. They should all hang their heads in shame. I must confess that shame has never been a criterion of the opposition and probably never will be. Those opposite have not changed much in the last three years. They are the same as when I left this place in 1990. Let us look at some of the nonsense that has been spoken today. The honourable member for Mitchell suggested that evidence that the Australian economy is on the improve is wrong. I suppose that is typical. Members of the opposition always have this propensity to ignore the evidence. It does not matter how it is laid in front of them or who gives it to them-be it BIS, Syntec or any of the financial reporting firms from the private sector in Australia, which have clearly stated in the newspapers in more recent months that the Australian economy is probably leading the world. It has at least two to 21f2 per cent growth, trading sector exports are up around 16 per cent and innation is low. In Europe two weeks ago Mercedes-Benz announced the sacking of 40,000 workers; in France two weeks ago the French government announced the sacking of 16,500 French public servants; and two weeks ago Saab and Renault announced a major merger-more jobs to go. There is 12 per cent unemployment in France before the 16,500 public servant jobs are gone. The average rate of unemployment in Europe is 8.5 per cent; it is 20 per cent in Spain and 20 per cent in Portugal. There are sectors of unemployment of well over 20 per cent in many parts of Europe. If we look at Manchester and Liverpool we see what Margaret Thatcher left the British people. That is opposition policy at work .in England-the Thatcher policies, the Friedman theories, the monetarists, the new right. The opposition did it in England and in Manchester today there are third generation British workers who have never had a job. Grandfather, father and son have never had a job and are most unlikely to ever get a job. That is the Thatcher legacy of Britain. That is members of the opposition wanted to do in Fightback, and that is what they are wanting to do in this country today. They never learn. They talk about world best practice but they never define what that is. Do they say that world best practice is an Asian wage? Is that what they say when they talk about level playing fields and world best practice? Is it world best practice for an Australian family to be employed on the average Asian wage? Is it world best practice in Europe where the banks close on a Monday? Is it world best practice in Europe where most shops close at lunchtime? Is the European common agricultural policy world best practice? Is EEP world best practice? What do opposition members mean when they talk in this chamber about world best practice? What do they mean when they talk about level playing fields? What do they mean when they tell Australian workers that they should adopt world best practice? Which world best practice are they referring to? Whose world best practice are they referring to? This has been an absolute nonsense debate by an opposition that even today does not have a policy. On the one hand, the opposition tells us that the GST is out but, on the other hand, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) tells us that the $10 billion cuts promised to the Australian people in Fightback have not been abolished. If opposition members want to find out what happens under that sort of policy, they should go across the border to Victoria. On Friday it was announced that 15 schools within my federal electoral boundaries would close. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) would do well to have a close look at this matter because all those schools are located in rural areas. The honourable member's colleagues in the Victorian Liberal Party are ripping the guts out of rural Victoria by closing train lines, rural schools and ripping into councils. On Friday three district nurses located in rural areas received their termination notices. Country hospitals have been cut to blazes. The honourable member's colleagues in Victoria are applying the opposition's Fightback policies to rural what people and ripping the guts out of rural Victoria. Opposition members talk about world best practice and express concern for rural people. They should go and ask Jeff Kennett what he is doing to rural people in Victoria. Opposition members should go and ask the National Party of Australia branch members what they think of their Liberal colleagues. In fact, one of the people who campaigned for Pat MCNamara has announced that he will give it away-he has left the National Party in absolute disgust. So opposition members have a lot to learn. They have to come good and tell the Australian people what the Liberal Party really still has in Fightback. They should not come into this chamber and attack a party which represents pluralist Australia, which has courage and has backbenchers that are prepared to stand up and say what is wrong and fight for what they believe is right. Opposition members are a pack of cowards.",58
119,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS," The contribution by the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) was absolutely amazing-in 10 minutes of debate, sales tax was not mentioned once. The moral bankruptcy of the Australian Labor Party is demonstrated by the fact that it could find only one member from its backbench to come in here during this whole debate. Yet during the contribution by that honourable member, he did not mention sales tax once. I thought, Mr Scott, that you might have chastised him just a little to bring him back to the subject. If an Australian company acted like the Labor Party by indicating that its charter was to put proper policies in place and claiming a mandate for integrity and honesty, the liquidators would be called in tomorrow and that company would be out of business within one week. Yet the Australian parliamentary system tolerates the introduction of bills such as the Sales Tax (Customs) (Deficit Reduction) Bill and cognate bills for which the government has no mandate. Indeed, the bills have received little consideration and express no feel for the Australian economy. Before the honourable member for MCEwen leaves the chamber, I must say that I had no problem with Fightback, except in one area. That problem was in no way associated with the GST nor the complete removal of the sales tax from Australia's taxation system. I had no problem for the very good reason that sales tax is a pernicious tax on the Australian business sector because it prevents that sector from being competitive with outside influences. The truth of that statement can be seen in the growth of foreign debt and our national debt over that period of time. That confirms what we all know: Australia is fast becoming bankrupt on the back of these outdated sales taxes and other pernicious indirect taxes. I thought the honourable member for MCEwen was remaining in the chamber. It should be recorded that he has left the chamber. The only government backbencher who has been prepared to come into the chamber has now gone, without having mentioned one thing about sales tax in his contribution to the debate. These bills have been before us and have rightly been rejected by the Senate. The government had no mandate to impose this tax. The government talks about free and frank discussion, but let us look at that claim. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) drew the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) along to a caucus meeting and barrelled them over the lack of consultation beforehand. As I understand it, that was the first time that government backbenchers were able to debate the matter. The honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman) actually said that the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) should both be retired and given a holiday. I agree with the honourable member. While the comments by the honourable member for Greenway were not a deep insight into what is happening around this country, the honourable member was absolutely right. The problem is that the government front-bench does not listen to the backbench in that respect. If you, Mr Scott, had insisted on this matter, you might have been the Minister for Finance today. I am damned sure that, as a Queenslander, Mr Scott, you would not have given us this load of hogwash that we have had ever since these bills were introduced. I take up the point raised by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman): it is absolute hogwash in its purest form to name this legislation a 'deficit reduction' bill. Australia's deficit will keep increasing. When we reach this mythical date of 1996, when this government's term in office will have expired and we will be into the term of another government, the budget deficit will be 1.2 per cent of GDP. The GDP is not a measure of the problems that the budget is causing Australia. Prior to this budget, the national debt was something like $90 billion. Distributed amongst all Australian taxpayers, that debt is a hell of a burden for taxpayers to overcome. The government calls this legislation 'deficit reduction' when the deficit will actually increase. Taxes are increasing in such a way that they will have a full impact on those people on lower incomes and on Australian businesses. Yet there is no relief from any countermeasure. Again, this budget does not address that problem. There are many things wrong with a: sales tax. Not only does sales tax increase business costs, it also has a detrimental effect on our export competitiveness. In the area I represent, sales tax has a greater detrimental effect than in capital cities because of the freight component. Over recent weeks, I have had a lot of representations not only from the wineries because that is the first area affected by the sales tax, which will increase substanremoved tially, but also from people involved in tax reduction. second-hand machinery sales who have told me that this sales tax is affecting them badly. This debate has been allowed to develop such a way that I want to point out an article by Christine Wallace that appeared in today's Australian Financial Review. When I was which is: asked to speak on these bills, I was in the Labor's course of writing to congratulate one of the few journalists perceptive enough to put this budget and its aftermath in proper perspective. She argues that there are 10 myths, one being that the budget is being blocked. It is not being blocked; supply is being blocked. The way is open for the lost government to accept the Senate amendments that separate the difficult parts from the that have approval. The second myth is that the budget is being wrecked. Christine Wallace writes that, ultimately, $140 million will be left in revchamber. enue. This cannot be regarded as wrecking a budget that has revenues in the vicinity $100 billion plus. In that context, $140 million is infinitesimal. The third myth is that the deficit-cut will be ruined if the Senate does not give in. That is not the case at all. I repeat: this budget will not affect the deficit reduction until it tackles, wholeheartedly, the question of expenditure, and it will not do that putting more taxes in place. The fourth myth is that, by parliamentary convention, the Senate passes the budget untouched. That is not the case at all. From the Whitlam-Murphy years, through the proved 1980s, the budget has never been sacrosanct. That precedent has never existed. I am fended that, with this budget, there should a precedent which establishes that a governhere. ment collects taxes only after the agreement of both Houses. At the moment we have the ridiculous situation of a couple of months worth of collections of both fuel excise and sales tax that is not being gathered. The sixth myth is that the budget is way behind schedule. That is not the case at all; it is right on target. In fact, it would be more on target if the government separated the bills right from the outset, as was suggested, and the link between these bills and the In every respect, there is a lot to commend the comments of Christine Wallace on page in 4 of the Australian Financial Review. I believe they are right on target. She goes on to mention quite a few other things, one of loss of Senate control at the last election her on being has caused the problem. The government of the day has not been in control of the Senate ever since, under the auspices ·of the Labor Party, we raised the number of senators representing each state not from 10 to 12. Of course, the government has the nexus and it will never be replaced. It is interesting that the government has a ones mandate in this place but has no mandate in the Senate. The people of Australia elected 36 coalition members to the Senate against 30 Labor members, despite the result in this One of the safeguards of our constitution demands that the Senate, if there is no of mandate to be followed and if there is an inconsistency in the taxing arrangements, should regard the matter with grave concern plan and that it should make the corrections. I say again that the government is in disarrayon this matter. I do not know what number budget this is, but it must be close to mark 6 or mark 7. It has never been known by and has never taken place before in the federation of Australia. We have all the backbenchers sulking around in their rooms, apparently trying to be reached by the whip, but they are oui of focus and, as has been by this budget, out of touch with the Australian people. I also would hang my head ofin shame if I were a Labor member in this be chamber. We have only two Labor members One is here compulsorily as the Deputy Chairman and the other is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table.

121,Mr TUCKEY,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"O'Connor) (8.00 p.m.)The situation has not changed very much with these particular amendments, some of which are to be supported by the government. I suggest that in the future we might make it a little less difficult for honourable members wishing to address very specific bills. It has always struck me that we have had a situation where the amendments coming in on one line, as they do, require a tremendous amount of research in thumbing through one bill after another to find out the exact issues that are undertaken. But, generally, we are very much aware of what the situation is because these bills all relate to sales tax. Sales tax primarily is an issue where the government has, as it did with the other taxes such as the fuel excise, introduced a regime of indirect taxation that in my view has nothing whatsoever to do with the position that it put up in One Nation and the position that it took to the election. In the election campaign, the public were first reminded that the coalition parties were quite honestly representing a reform of the tax system to do away with the sales tax. The wholesales sales tax is recognised throughout the world as being a very inefficient and debilitating form of taxation that strikes too hard at the competitive structures of industry. Notwithstanding efforts made by governments to remove the tax and to give exemptions, it is impossible to do that in any totality and the tax flows through. It was common knowledge-and, in fact, they were Treasury figures that established it-that our motor industry is disadvantaged to the tune of about $800 per motor car by the flow on effect of the various indirect tax regimes th-lt apply around Australia; that is, payroll tax, sales tax and fuel tax, in particumeasures lar. This is a disadvantage which I do not think our industry needs. It makes a bit of a mockery of some of the words of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) who today boasted about the tariff policy differences between the two parties. Quite clearly, there is very little difference, if any. Yet we proposed during the election campaign that $800 be removed from the cost of manufacturing a car in Australia. That must be a huge advantage to manufacturers whether they are competing on the local market or whether they are competing, as some are now attempting to do, on overseas markets. The whole issue is that these sorts of taxes build into the costs of Australian business. I am anticipating a speaker from Victoria to follow me very shortly. Victoria is the home of manufacturing within Australia in many ways. I think it is certainly recognised in that way, and it is the state most vulnerable to import competition. We are past the days when the import barriers, frequently quotas, were there to protect local industry. They are gone. They quite clearly had to go, and nobody is arguing about that. Both sides of politics recognise the need to get to a negligible tariff regime. There is really argument only at the margin. The simple fact is that these people cannot compete. Victoria has suffered more than any other state from this burden of indirect taxes that filter through to costs. People cannot identify them exactly. People cannot do anything but absorb them, and ab-orb profit margins that flowthrough with them. I frequently give the example of a payroll tax put on a car, commencing in the iron.ore mine and the coalmine. Of course, at every stage a profit margin is added by the direct recipient of the tax and on all taxes paid by predecessors in the manufacturing or development chain. We are again being asked by the government to do something about that matter and to send back a message to the Senate that the government has to have the taxes as they are. I oppose that very strongly. It is the wrong way to tax but, worse, it is a government asking the parliament to approve of tax so close to an election when during that election campaign no mention whatsoever was made to the Australian people to allow them to cast their decision on how they wanted the taxation to go. The people clearly took a simple decision: no more taxes. That is what the Labor Party offered the people of Australia, and that is what they expect the parliament to now deliver. We will, therefore, support the Senate wholeheartedly in all of its moves. I think in this regard we have a few other things to take a look at in some of these measures. I had a little chart made out; it is fairly simple. We are talking about measures in terms of sales tax spanning right up to 1995-96. It is possible that there will be an election between now and then. Whilst the government has presented this as some sort of deficit reduction strategy which has to be put into l-a-w-and one might wonder why the government thinks it can convince the international monetary authorities that the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating) putting anything into l-a-w has any special significance-the Australian people have seen how sign.ificarit his l-a-w tax cuts were. I do not think putting these measures into l-a-w now will give any confidence to the international community in terms of the government's desire to reduce its budget deficit. Only time will tell whether the government can do that, even with these measures. If the government would also still like us believe that the economy is due for some sort of upturn, why are we debating measures that will be introduced in future budget years in this parliament? Why are we debating these measures now? Why does the government not indicate through its budget speech that it has these measures in mind, put the community on notice, introduce them in the revenue year and let them be debated at that time in the context of the state of the economy? Why should the Senate and this chamber be expected to put these measures forward and give them approval now? My own view is that fuel will be increased by 2c a litre in August 1994. I know that is not the direct subject of these measures. Sales tax will go up by one per cent on 1 July 1995 and wine tax will go up a further one per cent at that time. These measures should be dealt with. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has already told us that he will have budgets delivered in June. I think that is the correct measure. On the other hand, that also removes the need to introduce revenue measures ahead of a particular budget, because they can be introduced at the appropriate time without any loss of revenue as occurs now with the budget being brought down late in August. There is no need for this measure. In fact, I think it is a political trick. It would be pretty good for the government if it could get away with it. Basically the government wants to get all of its nasties over in the first year of government. Considering the volatility of petrol prices in the market placetoday, what is 2c a litre when the price will fluctuate lOc or 15c in a week? The government wants these tax increases to be hidden away. It is taxation by stealth. Good government should at all times put itself in the position of being honest with the people and reminding them of the taxes that it intends to introduce from time to time. Having failed to tell them about these taxes during the election campaign, the government is now trying to create a situation where it proposes and introduces taxes that in terms of the cost to the community will not be implemented for up to two years. I find that situation quite despicable. In the remaining couple of minutes I want to to talk about the wine tax and correct a few issues. I think the media may generally have some understanding of where the wine tax is going as far as the views of Western Australians are concerned, but I heard again quite a bit on the radio this morning about individuals purporting to represent winegrowers when most of the so-called organisations have very small memberships. These people are not spokesmen for the entire industry. I am advised today from one particular caller that Western Australian winegrowers, particularly in the Margaret River region, are still a hundred per cent opposed to' any change in the sales tax on wine. They do not agree with the two per cent increase that some of their colleagues agreed to under huge pressure from a few at a meeting in Mount Barker in my electorate on the weekend. It is time that the government understood this. It is time for the Greens, who have shown considerable fortitude in standing up against this government with its bUllying and its threats, to make decisions they perceive to be in the interests of the people who put their trust in them. It is about time we had some members of parliament who thought that that was a fundamental responsibility of members of parliament. When these bills go back to the Senate I hope that the Greens will stick to their position because I can tell them that they are representing the views of most of the winegrowers who live in the south-west area of Western Australia and the southern areas of my electorate.

122,Mr CHYNOWETH,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS," There has been a lot of talk during this debate on the Sales Tax (Customs)(Deficit Reduction) Bill and cognate bills dealing with who said what about tax before the last election. Today the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said that the Australian Labor Party's campaign was a campaign of lies. Let me say that the Liberal Party's campaign in Victoria, under the stewardship of one Jeffrey Kennett, was certainly a campaign based on lies. He said that there would be no job losses and no new taxes, but 30,000 people have lost their jobs and Victoda now has a $100 poll tax that is imposed on the millionaire as well as the poorest",65
123,Mr TUCKEY,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Mr Chairman, I raise a point of order. Whilst I accept that there is some scope in dealing with these matters, it is resasonable to suggest that the subject remain related to this parliament and not to the state of Victoria.",65
124,The CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Order! I hope that the honourable member for Dunkley will now return to the intent of the three bills on which, even though we are in committee, we have allowed general discussion.",65
125,Mr CHYNOWETH,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"I have been listening closely to this debate, and in the last speech before the evening break the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) mentioned Victoria quite profusely. I think it is unfair that I be cut short whilst honourable members opposite can range over Mabo, the republic and all sorts of topics. It is my democratic right to be able to speak in this chamber on taxation matters, especially as they affect the people of Victoria. As we are talking about tax, I point out that increased indirect taxation has meant that train fares have gone up, and that water and electricity charges have gone up. The wine tax",65
126,The CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Order! Whilst the honourable member for Dunkley has put a very persuasive argument on the basis of the contributions of other honourable members to this debate, I remind honourable members that we are in committee and that we are strictly debating a reference by the Senate for consideration of amendments. Whilst we have allowed a rather general debate on these sales tax bills in the context of the federal budget, it would be in order for honourable members to contain their remarks to the three bills.",65
127,Mr CHYNOWETH,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"I am trying, Mr Chairman, I can assure you. However, when I think of Victoria it really upsets me. The reason these three bills came back from the Senate for amendment is the intransigence of Liberal senators and their National Party cohorts. To get something through the Senate takes 38 votes, and 36 votes of the total are controlled by the conservative parties. Because of their spite after losing the last election, members of the Liberal and National parties cannot help themselves-they have to try to block everything the government puts up. I am quite certain that, if I were to put to the Senate a motion in support of motherhood and apple pie, those opposite would oppose it. That is the sort of mood they are in. Earlier the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) was talking about bullying. He certainly knows about that. One only has to see him in action here at question time. In relation to the wine tax, I should mention a famous wine area in Victoria. The Premier of Victoria actually had to",65
128,Mr TUCKEY,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Come on, now.",65
129,Mr CHYNOWETH,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"This is in relation to wine. tax, and it is very pertinent to this particular bill. Mr Kennett had to apply for a licence to sell wine. This is the first time",65
130,Mr TUCKEY,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"I repeat my point of order, Mr Chairman, on the matter of relevance in debate as compared with relevance in question time. I am not asking the honourable member to be as specific as standing orders require, which would be to direct himself purely to the amendments. I do not think that is necessary. However, I do ask the honourable member to deal with the matters before the parliament-namely, the amendments to the government's sales tax legislation as listed here for debate-and to desist from trying to raise artificial issues on the Victorian parliaacross ment.",65
131,The CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Order! Whilst I understand that the honourable member for Dunkley feels provoked by matters Victorian, he will try to contain his remarks to the three sales tax bills before the committee.",66
132,Mr CHYNOWETH,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"One of these sales tax bills affects many articles which will in turn affect many people in Victoria. They will certainly affect many people in the electorate of Dunkley. The wine tax has been mentioned, and that prompts me to recall that last Friday night when my wife and I went out for tea-we do not often have an opportunity to do that I went to the local bottle shop to get some wine. I thought I would like a bottle of Margaret River wine-I really appreciate Vasse Felix and that type of thing-but I could not buy any of the wine made locally on the Mornington Peninsula because the shelves were bare. Why were they bare? They were bare because the wholesalers are not selling it and the retailers are not buying it. And why is that? It is because of your pigheadedness in relation to this particular bill. Because the bill is not going through, you are actually causing many retailers in my electorate to lose money. No-one is buying any wine from Margaret River and you cannot get any wine from Margaret River because of the fact the winegrowers do not know what will happen. Why do they not know what will happen? They do not know because of what you are doing here this evening.",66
133,The CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Order! The honourable member should be very careful with his use of 'you'. He is talking through the chair, and I presume that the 'you' he is talking about are other members of the committee.",66
134,Mr CHYNOWETH,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Mr Chairman, I would not direct that sort of comment to you personally. It is directed at the Liberal Party and the National Party. Sometimes honourable members opposite come up with some things that are good. I cannot recall any off the top of my head, but now and again they come up with ideas that I am quite certain would be acceptable on this side of the chamber. However, in the six months that I have been back here I have not heard one; I have only come this sort of blocking tactic from those opposite. These sales tax bills will raise a certain amount of money for the government. That money is needed to assist in funding tax cuts for average income earners, those in the middle income area, the majority of people in my electorate. Because these tax cuts cannot come through, they are the. people who are suffering at the moment. Those tax cuts were supposed to be introduced towards the end of this month. However, because of what is happening in the Senate-aided and abetted by people like the honourable member for O'Connor and his National Party cohorts-the bills are not getting through the Senate. People in my electorate are being dramatically affected by the delay in regard to these sales tax cuts. If the tax cuts were actually given to the people of Dunkley, that money would be spent in the shops right now. That money would all be going into the Victorian economy. I can tell honourable members that Victoria needs it. We have people leaving the state in droves. I think 1,000 people a week are getting out because of the policies of the Kennett government. They have to go somewhere, so they are trying to get as far away as possible. However, that money is not being spent in our shops as it is still being held up by those opposite. The retailers down my way want every cent that they can get. I know that the honourable member for MCEwen will agree that those opposite are actually helping to ruin small businesses in my electorate because they are not letting this tax cut through. People are not being allowed that extra $10 a week to spend. As I said, every week millions of dollars are not going into our economy because of the bloody-mindedness of those opposite. That is as simply as I can put it. The effect on Dunkley must be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Frankston, Chelsea and even Mount Eliza shopkeepers need a bit now and again. They have huge rents to pay and those opposite are stopping that money. Anything that comes from the Senate these days is tainted with the views of the Liberal Party and the National Party. They impose their views on the rest of the Senate, simply because of their numbers. I remind everyone that 36 votes in the Senate belong to the conservatives-the Nationals and Liberals-and another two votes determine whether a bill gets through. So it is not the Greens or the Australian Democrats who slow things up; it is the Liberal and National parties. They should be exposed for what they are-bad losers. (TIme expired)",66
135,Mr KATTER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"In the Sales Tax (Customs) (Deficit Reduction) Bill and cognate bills that have come back from the Senate today, the wholesale sales tax is the most relevant point. Whilst I was no great fan of the proposed goods and services tax, as this chamber would well know, I could always see the logic in the fact that the a person consumed, the more tax that person would pay. Surely that was a more logical way of levying tax than a simple add-on, such as through a wholesale sales tax, which increases the cost of production. With a wholesale sales tax, whilst we are increasing the cost of consumer goods, we are also increasing the cost of production. The cost of production is most r-levimt to the wine tax that is also being discussed here tonight. A lot of grapes are grown in my area and, hopefully, the area will b- going into increased wine production. We have a small amount at the moment and are well placed to go into far great-r wine production. Not only does the. farm sector have its burden increased dramatically by increases in wholesale sales tax, but our own industries, such as the wine industry, are being crucified by taxation. The situation is becoming very grim. To show just how grim the situation is for agriculture, we can make this comparison. The average price of water in California-one of our major competitors in the wine industry-is $3.90 a megalitre and it is carried an average of 300 or 400 kilometres. In Queensland-I cannot speak for the other states-the average cost of water is $29 a megalitre, almost a thousand per cent higher than the cost in California. Farmers in California have enjoyed interest rates of four per cent on average. The average burden over the past six years for the farming sector here would be pretty close to 19 per cent. Even allowing for the diesel rebateMr Chynoweth- Mr Chairman, I take a point of order. I remind you of the matter of relevance. Victoria is a lot closer than California. Could you ask the honourable member to return to the legislation?",67
136,The CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,The honourable member was making his remarks in the context of the wine industry.,67
137,Mr KATTER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Most certainly I was. I was talking about the comparative cost structures in both countries and the tax burdens that both countries carry in the wine industry. To continue with the cost structures carried by the wine industry in Australia, our growers pay 42c a litre for diesel. I am using diesel as more an example, as opposed to petrol. Petrol would be 60c a litre. In California, diesel costs 25c a litre. Urea-nitrogenous fertiliser-costs $203 a tonne there and $395 here. So there is a 100 per cent greater cost burden in fertilisers; a nearly 100 per cent extra cost burden for fuel; interest, one of the biggest components in any farming costs, has over 100 per cent difference; and there is a 1,000 per cent difference for water.· How in heaven's name can our farmers be expected to compete in the international marketplace with these sorts of cost burdens and handicaps? At least the GST had logic in it. It cut the cost of production and the cost burden for our industry; in this case, the wine cost industry. But the government's game plan seems to be constantly adding an extra burden to the cost of production, not only of wine but of all our farm commodities. With the wholesale sales tax exactly the same process of logic is applied. Those opposite seem to think that the camel that carries this country can carry any sort of burden and that there is no such thing as the straw that breaks .the camel's back. It would appear that they do not believe in that saying. At present in agriculture, including the wine industry, the back most certainly is breaking. It is breaking not only because of the addition of these cost burdens, which are so enormously unreasonable; but also because a number of big corporations have come into the wine industry marketplace, effectively producing an oligopoly, as the economists call it-I would prefer to say monopoly. There are a few buyers and a very large number of sellers. In that situation the farmers are at an enormous disadvantage. Tonight we have seen the addition of an extra cost of production on the wine industry. That is not only a disincentive to Australian consumers, but the government is standing aside and completely ignoring the situation which has arisen in the wine industry. There are probably half a dozen at the outsideeffectively in the wine industry only twopurchasers who are farmers. In that situation farmers will not get anything like a fair deal. We see this in all areas of agriculture at present. North Queensland has been turned upside down because two of our major sugar mills have had takeover offers from Tate and Lyle, which yet again will produce a monopoly in the marketplace, as exists in the wine industry today. It is probably a little worse because this company is an overseas company. Such companies have contacts overseas which enable them to move quickly in the marketplace. They know what is happening in Europe a hell of a lot faster than the average farmer does. They take advantage of the farmers' lack of knowledge in these areasknowledge that these companies have. So the farmer is at an enormous disadvantage because of the monopolistic practices and mechanisms that have arisen in each of these industries and that have been left to run unchecked by this government. In the last 10 years there has been the greatest centralisation of ownership of the means of production in each of the agricultural industries that has ever occurred in the history of Australia. There is an extra cost burden in a series of cost burdens that range from 100 to 1,000 per cent in comparison with our competitors in California-I cannot speak about Europe as I do not have those figures here tonight. I can certainly speak with authority about the figures from California, one of the biggest producing areas in the entire world-and very much our competitor. I suppose it is not a big point, but the tax is a disincentive for consumption in Australia. Most of our marketing of agricultural products can be given some stability if we have a large home market. At least then we can get a stable price on the home market. We may not be able to get a stable price on the world market-although I argue vehemently that in such areas as wool we can; it is only because of the stupidity and incompetence of this government in giving it away that we cannot. I accept the argument, in the main, which says that we must accept world prices in agriculture for the part that is marketed overseas. But we do not have to do that for the part that is marketed here. Another fact I have not mentioned this evening is that farm labour costs in California are $4 an hour. Mr Chynoweth-They are all slaves from Mexico.",67
138,Mr KATTER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"The honourable member mentions wetbacks from Mexico. That is not correct. Undoubtedly it influences the price of labour in the United States but there is an industrial award, as exists in this country. It says that the rate is $4. Mr Chynoweth interjecting",68
139,Mr KATTER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"I take the interjection of the honourable member, and I say to him that the wetbacks are paid a hell of a lot less than $4 an hour. I have never spoken against our industrial awards in my life, and I do not intend to in the future. I am very proud that this country has industrial awards that say that we can pay a farm labourer $10 an hour. But we cannot do that and compete on the world market, so we cannot have our cake and eat it. Either we have to work at slave wage levels-which I am most-certainly adamantly opposed to-or we have to put up a protecti ve mechanism to stop the product from California coming into Australia. We cannot have it both ways; yet we have had a government in power in Australia for the last decade that has done just that. We have seen agricultural industry after agricultural industry roll over and be destroyed, and there are plenty more to come yet. In fact, on the latest report that we have, half the wool growers in wine Queensland will be gone by 1995. That is yet another nail in the coffin of the Australian economy. I say this to the chamber: for heaven's sake, look at the cost of production. (TIme expired)",68

Mr CLEELAND-The second part of this ?ilI deals with the anti-inflation process, so it IS a strong budget outcome. 1I have had personal disagreements with the budget, and that is no secret, but on this side of the chamber we can accommodate that. We do not go along with the system adopted by those opposite where their leader proposes something and they, like little Iambs, go and follow him to the slaughter. The government has debates where members like me can stand up and say, 'I do not accept these things', and we may change it. We would not have gone to the.election with a Fightback package. We would have said, 'No way', and changed it. - ut, like Iambs to the slaughter, those opposIte lack courage and went off to the election following Fightback. Obviously, those on the opposition backbench will not stand up to their leaders. 1 had some concerns about this budget. 1 expressed those concerns, and many of the problems that I saw have been changed. To the credit of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the government, they listened to the concerns put by the backbench and put those changes in the budget. We now have a responsible budget. Let us not deny the fact that the money markets around Australia are saying to those opposite that they have got to get behind the government and pass the budget. They are saying very clearly to those opposite that, if the uncertainty of the budget goes on, the money market will respond. You are now being typical of the species you arepoliticians opposed to the budget just for the sake of it.",70
157,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Order! The honourable member for MCEwen might realise that he should be directing his remarks through the chair. When he says 'you' he is referring to the chair, not the members of the opposition. If he wishes to refer to other members of the chamber, he should do it accordingly.",71

But the money markets will eventually say to them, 'Cave in, pass the budget'. They can go ahead and play games with the two little Greens over there if they wish. They have always been spoilers as a party. They are showing that spoiling nature now. It will get them nowhere. I hope they use some common sense, stop making the sorts of stupid comments that some of those opposite have made in this debate tonight, and get back to the budgetary sales tax measures which are the important elements of this debate.",71
161,Mr DOWNER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"The sort of contribution we have just heard from the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) does make the public cynical about politics and politicians, as I am sure the small number of enthusiastic and hardy watchers of this debate in the gallery would confirm.",71
162,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,The honourable member might get to the amendments that he wishes to speak to. Mr Chynoweth interjecting,71
163,Mr DOWNER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"To say that in supporting these amendments which have been brought down from the Senate the coalition is somehow creating concern in money markets, which I think the previous speaker and the honourable member who has interjected mentioned, shows that they know nothing about money markets. I do not even think they would know where to find a money market. The fact is that to say this would somehow destabilise money marketsMr Cleeland- Mr Deputy Chairman, I raise a point of order. The honourable gentleman has suggested I told lies when I said I have been meeting with people from the money markets-that I do not know where they are. .",71
164,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,Order! I do not think that was the case.,71
165,Mr DOWNER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,Let me say something else about the money markets.,71
166,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"No, you might get to the amendments, too.",71
167,Mr DOWNER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,This relates to the amendments.,71
168,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"If it relates to the amendments, you can continue.",71
169,Mr DOWNER,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"The honourable member claimed that by supporting the amendments we are somehow destabilising money markets, when the simple fact is that the Australian dollar's decline has been due to the decline in commodity prices internationally. In the last few days there has actually been a strengthening of the position of the Australian dollar, at the time the Senate defeated Labor's vicious increases in sales tax and presented that defeat in the fonn of these amendments which are before us. So I can assure the honourable member, who does not know anything about them, that the money markets have responded quite positively. To suggest that by supponing these amendments from the Senate we are somehow opposing tax cuts brings the whole political process into disrepute. When a vote was taken in this chamber and in the Senate on the tax cuts, we supported the bringing forward of the tax cuts in both cases. Those on the other side of this chamber may decide to abandon the bringing forward-I do not think they would even know about this-of one tranche of the tax cuts. By the way, they have abandoned five-eighths of the tax cuts altogether; I bet they do not tell their constituents about that. We supported the bringing forward of those tax cuts. If those opposite decide to abandon that, that is their choice, not ours, because voted for the bringing forward of those tax cuts, which was a decent thing for us to do. I have circulated some amendments with regard to the legislation which we are considering tonight. In the case of the Sales Tax (Customs) (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the requested amendments be made"". I foreshadow that I will move a similar amendment in relation to the Sales Tax (Excise) (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Sales Tax (General) (Deficit Reduction) Bill. These amendments ensure that the request of the Senate that the second round of increases in sales tax does not go ahead be acceded to by this chamber. We support the Senate's request on the grounds that increases in sales tax are regressive. It is not only the opposition which has made this claim; the Greens have made it as well. Of course, they have no formal or constitutional links with the Liberal Party or the National Party. They have supported this argument, as has the government's Prismod model and any other independent analysis that has been done of this budget. This is a regressive budget that attacks low income Australians. All members of the Labor Party ought to hang their heads in shame. They should support these Senate amendments which are being supported by the coalition. The third and fourth Senate amendments remove altogether the increase in the tax on wine. We strongly support those two amendments. They are terrific amendments. I am glad to see from the motion of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) that the Labor Party, ever so briefly, is supporting the coalition's amendments regarding the wine tax. I know that at the end of this debate the Labor Party will introduce yet another tax, this time on the wine industry, to increase the tax by six per cent. But the Labor Party is Australia's tax and spend party. It loves spending money and enjoys taxing people. All we will get from the Labor Party for the next 2 11z years until the next election is a reiteration of the theme 'tax and spend'. The only brief respite is that the Labor we Party is going to support the second and third amendments. I congratulate it on that momentary, transient flicker of common sense which I know will be extinguished before the evening ends. I hope the committee will support the coalition's amendments to support the Senate in its stand for Australians. That is what the Senate is doing-standing up for Australians. I would have thought this chamber would join the Senate in standing up for this country.",71
170,Mr SHARP,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). Indeed, he has moved a very timely amendment because the Senate amendments that we are considering tonight try to do something to overcome the incredibly stupid and horrific impact that the government's budget of 17 August has had on Australia's economy. Whichever way one looks at it, the increased taxes that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) brought down in his budget are going to impact very badly on Australia's ability to create income and jobs. One of the worse affected sectors in the Australian economy that has been hit right below the water line by the increases in taxes is the transport industry. It has been hit very hard by the increase in excise of 5c a litre that will go on top of the existing taxes on diesel fuel and unleaded fuel and the increase in excise of 7c a litre on leaded fuel. The transport industry is vital to the overall cost of everything that is produced in Australia today. It is vital to our ability to export products and to compete against other nations for our fair share of the international marketplace. Seventy-five per cent of our total transport task is .carried out by the road transport industry. Yet the road transport industry is going to suffer tremendously because of the increase in excise announced by the Treasurer in his budget speech. The 5c a litre which has been added to the cost of diesel fuel for the road transport industry will cost the average truck operator $6,400 a year in additional fuel costs. When one adds the sales tax increases, one finds that the average truck will cost an extra $2,400 a year to operate. So if one adds the $6,400 worth of extra fuel costs to the $2,400 worth of extra sales tax increases, one can see that road transport operators will be struggling to survive as a result of these excise increases-and those figures are just the extra costs for one truck. I happened to be in the Northern Territory last week and I spoke to one of the largest livestock transport operators in the territory. He happens to cart livestock from all over the Northern Territory and Queensland to the port of Darwin for export into the Asian market. It is one of the fastest growing industries in the Northern Territory. The net consequence of increasing the tax on fuel by 5c a litre for him means that carrying livestock to the port of Darwin for export adds another $1.80 to the cost of exporting those livestock-$1.80 a head each time he exports one of those cattle. That is just one example. The road transport industry gives an overall picture of the net effect that this will have the average Australian. About $3 extra per supermarket trolley each week will be the additional cost to the average Australian because of the increase in fuel excise. That increase trickles its way right through to Australian, to every workplace and to every place that we produce goods for export or for domestic consumption. The road transport industry deserves to have a fair go. Since this government came into power 10 112 years ago, it has increased taxes on fuel from 6c a litre to now 31c a litre for diesel and unleaded fuel, and 33c a litre for leaded fuels. This government has gone from 6c a litre tax on our fuel to 33c a litre. The net consequence of that is that Australia's ability to compete in the international marketplace has been reduced. The net consequence of that is that we lose national income. The consequence of that is that we lose jobs in Australia. That is why the amendments that have been moved by the honourable member for Mayo deserve to be supported. In addition to the road transport industry being hit very hard, the Australian coastal shipping industry has also been affected very badly by the increase in fuel excise brought down in the budget. The coastal shipping industry uses a different type of fuel from that used by the road transport and rail industries. It uses stuff called bunker; it is commonly called, or perhaps more correctly called, fuel oil. Fuel oil, up until the budget night, had an excise of 5.5c a litre on it. After the budget night, the excise on fuel oil for the Australian coastal shipping industry went to lO.5c per litre-in effect, a doubling of the excise paid on the oil that the Australian coastal shipping industry uses. That translates to an additional cost of $360,000 per ship per year. That is a greater cost than has been achieved through shipping reform over the last few years. As a result of this government's efforts,- despite shipping reform that has been pushed and much of it initiated by the industry itself, the industry is going backwards because of this one decision on budget night to double the excise on fuel oil. Not only does the Australian shipping industry use a great deal of diesel; so too do on Australia's railways. Take, for example, the State Rail Authority in New South Wales. The impact of increasing the tax on diesel means that the State Rail Authority will have additional costs of $9.1 million per annum. every The Commonwealth's own national railway will have additional costs of $2 112 million per annum. The Victorian rail system will have additional costs of around $4 million per annum. All of these additional costs have to be borne by somebody. They are not borne by those organisations themselves, because ultimately they must pass them on. The people they pass them onto are the industries that use them and the people who use ,them. So the net consequence of the government raising the excise, be it on fuel oil for the Australian coastal shipping industry, diesel for the railway industry or diesel for the road transport industry, is that all of us suffer, it in an increase in our cost of living or a decrease in our ability to export and to create jobs. That is why the coalition is opposing so vigorously in this place and in the Senate the government's decision to increase the excise on fuel. We hope that if the Democrats and the Greens cannot support that overall decision to oppose the excise on fuel, they will at least recognise that the commercial sector of transport is exempted. I propose to the Greens and the Democrats that they look at exempting Australia's shipping industry from the increase in excise, that they look to exempting Australia's railway industries from the increase in excise, and that they look towards exempting Australia's road transport industry from the increase in excise. They can do that knowing that in the process they are helping Australia's business community to remain competitive and that they are helping to create jobs by ensuring that we can be competitive and can earn national income. They are also doing their bit to help the environment.",72
171,The CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,I might just remind the honourable member for Hume that he should be sticking to the sales tax amendment bill.,74
172,Mr SHARP,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Certainly, Mr Chairman. But certainly in the process of doing it through ensuring that they support the amendmentwhich has been moved by the honourable member for Mayo, and which has been supported consistently by the coalition in both this chamber and in the Senate-they are doing their bit to support the environment, because diesel has no lead in it. Diesel is 25 per cent more powerful than petrol and, therefore, its use is more beneficial for the environment. I propose to the Greens and the Democrats that in the process of supporting the amendment and the coalition's decision to oppose the increase in excise on fuel, they are helping to create jobs in Australia and helping to make sure that Australia can hold its competitive place in the international marketplace. (TIme expired)",74
173,Mr COSTELLO,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"Higgins) (8.57 p.m.)The Senate has requested the House of Representatives to do two things. It has requested it, essentially, to forgo a proposal to increase be the wholesale sales tax from July 1995, and it has requested it to forgo an increase in the wine tax. The fact is that if this chamber were responsive to the Australian people, if this chamber were concerned about the state of the Australian economy, if this chamber were concerned about the effect that its decisions are having on the tax system of Australia, it would be agreeing to those requests. It would be agreeing to those requests that have been properly made by the Senate and put to this chamber for consideration. It would be sitting down taking into account all of the effects of its decision, and it would be acceding to that request. Indeed, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has moved an amendment to the effect that the House hears the request of the Australian Senate and agrees to it. I speak in favour of that motion-that we do agree to that request, that we do put aside the misguided wine tax that this government has so set its heart upon, and that we do set aside those increases in wholesale sales tax due to take effect in July 1995, which are unwarranted, for which this government has no mandate whatsoever, and for which there is no economic necessity. As the honourable member for Mayo pointed out when he moved his amendment-and I speak to his amendment as well as to the Senate requests that are before the committee at this stage-the government now looks as if it will agree to some of the requests of the Senate. It now looks as if it has given away its misguided attempt to increase the wine tax. It now looks as if its decision is to take the wine tax from where it currently stands, a tax on the wholesale value of wine at 20 per cent, to 31 per cent and eventually to 32 per cent. Let us make it absolutely clear. The government's original proposal was to take the wholesale sales tax rate on wine froin 20 per cent to 31 per cent, which was a massive increase in the amount that wine would be taxed in this country. When the proposal got to the Senate and the winegrowers of Australia had a look at it and made submissions, and when the opposition made its case in relation to wine, the government started having cold feet. It suddenly became aware of the fact that this was not a bad export industry, that this was an industry that did not deserve punishment for being successful and that this increase would have an adverse economic effect on this industry. . So the government decided that, instead of increasing wine tax by that massive amount and trying to hold to its own original misguided policy, it would introduce a less misguided policy. The government is now talking about increasing wine tax from the 20 per cent that it currently stands at to 26 per cent over the period to July 1995 instead of taking it immediately to 31 per cent. Instead of taking the tax immediately to that rate, it would step the tax up .. The government then tried to add some sweeteners in relation to the wine tax to make sure that the wine tax would be bought off, as it were, by winegrowers .of Australia. It started talking about allowing the winegrowers of Australia to write off the cost of planting vines. It started to talk about cash grants. The best comment on that buy-out proposal in relation to the wine tax came from Christine Wallace from the Australian Financial Review who, commenting on that buy-out proposal, that 'try to get it through at any cost' proposal, that 'get your foot in the door so that you can boot them before they become aware of the full c;onsequences' proposal, said that this was a compromise that was a throwback to the bad old days. And of course it is. Where is the rationality in a proposal like that to stagger it up? Where is the rationality to start giving tax deductions in relation to vines, a thing that the government never actually intended to do? Where is the rationality to start handing out $1,500 annual cash grants rising to $6,000 apiece? In the end, what do we have in the government's proposal in relation to wine tax? We have a new sales tax rate, a new write-off provision, a new cash grant provision-and all done in the name of increasing revenue. It has utterly distorted the tax system in relation to wine in this country. One thing that could be said about the original proposal, I suppose, is that at least had some rationality. This has no rationality and no warrant. What is more, it has no justification because at the hist election the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made it absolutely clear. He said that he had income tax cuts which were l-a-w, that he did not need to reduce public expenditure and he did not need indirect taxes. And he won the electiori: How long did it take? It took about five months before the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was in this place with proposals that had never been talked about-that were nowhere near the agenda; that were as far as the north was from the south-to increase wholesale sales tax . taxes, petrol excise and all the other' wme taxes that we heard about. It would have been one thing if the government had come into this place and said, 'We have a mandate. The Australian people have knowingly voted for us with this program', but the Prime Minister could not, and he did not. At the last election. the Prime Minister was saying to the Australian people, 'What I am promising to do is not put up tax. It is those opposite that are talking about indirect taxes. Don't vote for them. Don't vote for an increase in indirect taxes. Vote' for me instead'. The Australian people were b-dly let down. They found out that the thing that the Prime Minister had that was different from the opposition was an irrational tax that he had not talked about, wl1ereas the opposition had a rational one that it had exposed. That was the key difference. That was the beginning of the unravelling of this government's economic performance and economic policy. That was the beginning of the end. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table, rightly gestures downward with his hand to the downward trend in relation to this particular budget. So the government has come back with something that is not even rational; something that we will not support; something that is not warranted; something that means that it has to give away its budget proposals and support the request of the Senate inasmuch as that is concerned. The government has come in with it what Christine Wallace from the Financial Review calls a wine tax compromise that is a throwback to the bad old days. What the government will not do mrelation to the other part of the Senate request is accede to the Senate's request, properly made, that this chamber not start imposing taxes to come into effect in July 1995. The first point to be made about the wholesale sales tax increases is that they stand on exactly the same footing. There was no mandate for them. They were never talked about and they are not part of the election program that the electorate voted for. There is no warrant for increases from 10 per cent to 11 per cent, from 20 per cent to 21 per cent and from 30 per cent to 31 per cent, but there is doubly no warrant to take those current rates from July 1995 from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, 20 per cent to 22 per cent, and 30 per cent to 32 per cent. Do those opposite realise how distorting this is? There is no provision that prevents being paid on tax. There is no for business to get a rebate in relation to the tax that they have paid. This is just a slug the Australian people. To say to the Australhonourable Ian people, 'Look, we'll bring forward our income tax cuts that were law at a cost about $1.4 billion and we'll pay for them by taking about $1.2 billion from you at the register' is an attempt to bribe the Australian people with their own money. It is to say them, 'The tax cuts that we are already going to give to you in the hip pocket we will take from you at the cash register'. The difference is the people get bribed their own money only in this financial year because down the track those wholesale sales tax increases that are in this budget stay there for· perpetuity. The government will raise revenue next year, for which there is compensation; the year after, for which is no compensation; and the year after that, for which there is no compensation. So, although the government has bribed people with their own money in this particular year, it gets them on the drip feed so that the increases in the wholesale sales tax and the wine tax raise $1.9 billion in the next year, $2.6 billion in the following year, and $2.8 billion the year after that, for which there no compensation at all, either through the income tax system or through the indirect system. The government gets people on the drip feed and will keep taking money from them, but bribes them with their own money only in the first year. There is no basis whatsoever for this in the electoral mandate. There is no basis for this whatsoever in economic policy. It increases inflation, it does nothing for the deficit and it does nothing for unemployment. There is no basis whatsoever for this in relation to the income tax cuts which were l-a-w before the election. The Senate is right; the requested amendments should be passed. The government should be giving away not only the illconceived wine tax, as it has already conceded, but also the wholesale sales tax increases. It should come clean with the Australian people and try to save what face it possibly can even at this last hour. I appeal to the tax chamber to accept the requested amendments. provision at all (TIme expired)",74
174,Mr MCARTHUR,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"I have much pleasure in supporting the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) . in his very erudite exposition of the way in of which the government has brought forward this wine tax, and I will speak to that a little cash hiter. Mr Deputy Chairman, I draw your attention to the fact that it is remarkable that to the only two speakers for the government are Victorians and they had the hide to draw the attention of the chamber to the performance of the current Kennett government when in fact it was the Labor governments of Victoria with over the last 10 years that arranged and brought about Victoria's bankruptcy so that it now has $70 billion worth of liabilities. So no in Labor Victorian member can defend the position of the Kirner-Cain governments in no that state. I want to make sure that members there of this chamber get that clear.",76
175,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"I remind the honourable member that he is speaking on sales tax amendments, so he should just come back to those.",76
176,Mr MCARTHUR,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"The Sales Tax (Customs) (Deficit Reduction) Bill that we are referring to quite clearly draws a comparison is to the attention of the Australian people. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said publicly tax that the income tax cuts were law. Members on this side of the chamber have said this on a number of occasions. The people of Australia understand what has happened and they have been upset that the government has seen fit to postpone those tax cuts both in the short term and in the long term-into the nevernever. The Prime Minister said there would be no increases in taxes and no GST. That was part of his whole program. However, we knew that on that premise, the way in which he went to the Australian people with those promises that he made such a play of during the election campaign, the budget was unsustainable. The Australian people fully understood that the figures would not stand up and that the next budget would not work out. The Australian people and honourable members should fully understand that the recommendations put forward by the opposition amount to $1.4 billion in a total budget of $115 billion, a very small percentage indeed. They are very responsible recommendations coming forward from the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and the shadow minister for finance, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). This is a budget deficit reduction bill. The name really is a cause for concern. At present the current deficit is $16 billion. The forward projection in this financial year is $16 billion, $12.2 billion in 1994-95 and $10.3. billion in 1995-96. It is even suggested that by 1996-97 it will be $5.8 billion. On the past performance of the government how can the Treasurer even suggest that it will reach those figures, considering what has been promised and what has been delivered? I now refer to the wine tax which the shadow minister for finance has so ably demonstrated is a hoax, to put it politely. There is a move by the government to readjust the tax increase from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. It is now suggesting an increase from 20 per cent to 26 per cent. In the meantime, it will offer some cash grants for sales levels of up to $50,000 to make up the difference of the initial wholesale sales tax. That is remarkable. The government wants to increase the tax but, as usual, the Treasurer wants to do a deal with the winemakers. In doing that deal he will give a short-term gain on the tax that is incurred and all will be well. The government is robbing Peter to pay Paul and is trying to persuade the winegrowers that our very responsible position could be broken down by yet another deal. The change from 20 per cent to 31 per cent is a 51 per cent increase in tax. Every winegrower knows that this industry is very dependent on the growers, the agricultural processes and the number of people who art? employed in that industry. I had the privilege of talking to one of the 13 winegrowers in the Geelong region, Mr Daryl Sefton and his wife Nini Sefton. They showed me their books and the very complicated procedure they have to undertake to establish the wholesale sales tax on their wine production. When the wholesale sales tax inspectors from the department came to inspect their books they had to show the inspectors how to calculate the tax. They had to go through the processes and say, 'This is how it is done in the real world. This is how you, the inspectorate, should understand it'. The inspectorate agreed that the books were excellent and that the taxes they paid were true and correct as they understood the law. The key element among the smaller winegrowers in the Geelong region is that there is a sound barrier of $15 per bottle. In the quality wine market people will not purchase a bottle of wine above that figure. So obviously an increase of 51 per cent in the wholesale sales tax will have a major impact on the wine market. The government taxes winemakers on tastings. So they have to calculate the wholesale sales tax on the wine tastings· that are never sold. How can any government justify this position? Winemakers not only have to pay the tax; they also have to calculate the amount of wine used during the tasting processes. Our position is very defensible. We have supported the wine industry'S position that the tax should not be paid. We will have no part of these last minute deals by the Treasurer and certain sections of the wine industry who are being bought off by very sectional arrangements in the hope that the 1ndustry also Commission will bring down a report and recommendations in 1995. The other key element in this budget deficit reduction bill is the fact that the Treasurer been very hard on the low income groups receiving salaries and wages below $20,700. Initially the Treasurer said, 'I will give $100 and that will be enough'. After a fair of pressure from the backbench in some of those well publicised meetings he said, 'No, I will be much more generous than that. I will give you $150 and all will be well'. It is wonder that the people of Australia are rebelling. Government backbenchers went to that famous meeting where half the caucus turned up to put their points of view to the Treasurer. We are very supportive of the sentiments that the backbenchers put to their own Tr-asurer to bring about these changes. Finally, the wholesale sales bles. It is a tax that the government is unable to administer. The Australian Tax Office does not understand the items that would attract 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. It now be 11 per cent, 21 per cent, 31 per cent-32 per cent in 1995. The calculations will be difficult. Anyone who has had anywe thing to do with this taxation regime would know that the items are almost impossible to to reality. understand. The only way to deal with the wholesale sales tax regime, which is based a very narrow base of articles, is to abolish the whole regime, as we advocated at the last election under the Fightback program. Any sensible, intelligent commentator would agree with that. The complete shambles before the parliament now regarding these various increases in the wholesale sales tax demonstrates this point quite well. We strongpersuade ly recommend and support the amendment increasing before the chamber. These changes should made. It is important for the government to understand fully the impact the tax on wine, fuel and unused annual leave will have average Australians. We support the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer on this amendment.",76
177,Mr LIEBERMAN,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"I one support the amendment moved by the honourto able member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and I bought support the coalition speakers in this last ditch effort in the House of Representatives to get the government to rethink, to recast, the budget strategy that it foolishly launched has some weeks ago and, above all, to do the right thing by the Australian people. I will quickly summarise what the coalition you is about. In simple terms, we are trying to bit persuade this government not to increase the fuel tax on all Australians so that ordinary Australians, business people, farmers, manufacturers and exporters can say that the overno heads for their businesses have not increased this year by reason of indirect government taxation and so that ordinary wage earners, familieS and unemployed people can say, 'Even though it is a battle and some of us are losing the battle, at least the government hasn't added to our burden, to our pain, by increasing the slug that it takes out of our tax is a shamreduced earnings'. An exporter would be able to say, 'In battling for a market overseas, in trying to sell our products overseas, create jobs in Australia will 'and reduce unemployment the government hasn't added to our burden by making us less competitive than we already ace'. That is what are about. We are trying to get the government to admit the truth and to come back As honourable members would know, parts on of my electorate suffered from severe floods in the last couple of weeks. It was very difficult for me to try to rationalise and help these people in their immediate concernssome 1,500 were evacuated from their bomes, small businesses were flooded and some of them were ruined-and at the same time have to come back to this stupid place arid try to the government that it should not be taxation on these people when their be burden is already almost too - reat to bear. In Benalla there is a street full of small business people whose shops were flooded on and stock and fittings destroyed. Some of those small businesses may not survive at all. Yet this government is increasing the fuel tax in rural areas where the tyranny of distance is of the hardest things for country people bear. Fuel is essential and it has to be in greater quantities than in the metropolitan areas. What is this government doing about that? It is making it harder for those country people by increasing the sales tax which the opposition, through this amendment, is trying to stop. In relation to the wholesale sales tax and fuel tax, we all know that these taxes increase inflation. Oddly, in the last 10 years the Labor government has been saying that one of its principal aims is to reduce inflation. Partly to the credit of the government, but mainly because of a number of other factors that it was not responsible for but for which it claims credit, inflation has come down from below double digits to around about one and a bit per cent, perhaps two per cent now. So after 10 years of battling, after realising inflation is one of the worse things one can have in an economy like ours, one would have thought that, in this budget, the government would have been intent on making damn sure that it would not increase inflation. We know that inflation reduces investment, reduces our export potential, creates unemployment, reduces the ability of people to be self-sufficient, adds to the burden of low income families and individuals, and makes the position of self-funded retirees impossible. One would have thought that a fundamental aim of this government was to reduce inflation. After all, in only March this year the government went to the election saying that it knew what was needed to tackle unemployment and our other problems. But we find that in this budget these taxes, which. this amendment attempts to persuade the government in this chamber to stop imposing, will, even on the government's own admission, increase inflation to about 3.5 per cent. We all know that every time the government· increases indirect taxation it has an effect on costs-it is passed on through business, it is recovered through prices and it forces a cost spiral and, therefore, adds to inflation. My own view is that, because of a number of other factors in Australia, we are now facing an increase in inflation not to 3.5 per cent-which would be bad enough because every percentage increase means less jobs, more hardship and more small business bankruptcies-but to 8 per cent within the life of this government. That will take us into the realm of being the worse in the OECD. It will mean that Australia will be less competitive. Our export industries will find it harder to stay here and more industries will find it more tempting to set up offshore, which has been happening under Labor for the last 10 years. It was interesting to hear some of the Labor members speak tonight, although they were all too few. I was interested to hear the honourable member· for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) speak in defence of the budget, which he, publicly, in the most extraordinary terms, described as the worse ever. In the chamber tonight, he claimed credit for a budget which he attempted to distance himself that from publicly just a few weeks ago. What do those government members in caucus who had that crisis meeting on that dramatic night think they achieved? They supported the Australian Democrats in reducing the wholesale sales tax increase by one per cent, but still voted for an increase in indirect tax-the hidden tax. More than 50 per cent of the items in a supermarket have the hidden wholesale sales tax imposed upon them. Of course, those caucus members endorsed that tax and, in fact, increased it by one per cent. They supported the increase in the fuel tax but said that it should not be as great. So they supported an increase of 7c a litre instead of lOc a litre, and the 3c that they managed to shave off will not even come off fuel costs this year or next year but will come off at the end. There are one million people unemployed; people in great difficulty, particularly in country areas, are struggling to make ends meet. Yet the government will not even defer that tax impost. The caucus did not achieve anything at all in relation to the wine tax. Most of the caucus members wanted the wine tax knocked off; the others did not understand. Now they have grabbed at a deal which purports to say that the industry finds the wine tax digestible. We know that the wine industry cannot afford the tax but has been blackmailed by the threat of having an excise introduced without legislation. The Australian people know that that wine industry of which we are so proud is being forced to cop the increase in the wine tax-albeit reduced-simply because it has been threatened with the imposition of an excise which will have an even more diabolical effect than the original proposal in the budget. The government has insulted the intelligence of all Australians by trying to tell the community and the parliament that it has managed to avoid the hardship, the lost opportunities, investment and new jobs in the wine industry by offering short-term incentives, increased investment allowances and offsets. If the government feels it necessary put in all of these offsets anyway, why impose the tax in the first place? That in itself is an admission of the illogical basis of this budget measure. In the last few seconds remaining, all I can do is thank the two government members who are in the chamber for listening courteously to me. I hope that they can interrupt the Mabo cabinet meeting to say, 'This is our last chance to do the right· think in the people's house to stop these extra taxes being imposed at a time when the government should be reducing the tax burden on those people across Australian society, in business, small business aJid the farming community'.

178,Mr GEAR,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,Anybody listening to the debate in the time that I have been in the chamber would be forgiven for thinking that Australia must be one of the heaviest taxing countries in the world. Yet looking at the OECDMr Lindsay-They should look at the facts.,80
179,Mr GEAR,AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS,"When we look at the facts, as the parliamentary secretary says, and compare ourselves with other OECD countries which offer the same sorts of services as Australia in terms of education, roads and hospitals, we find that we are the lowest taxing country. We now take less tax than Turkey, which has been the lowest taxing country for quite some time. It must be wonderful to be a Liberal politician because opposition members conveniently forget that on 13 March the Liberal Party went to the people with a proposal to impose a 15 per cent goods and services tax on everything. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) spoke about inflation. I congratulate the honourable member on giving the government some credit for bringing down inflation from the 11 per cent we inherited from the Liberal Party to about one per cent. A 15 per cent goods and services tax would have kicked up inflation straight away to about seven per cent or eight per cent and, with no wages policy, it would have stayed at that level because the one thing we know to about Liberal governments is that they cannot handle wages. Recent floods have devastated parts of Victoria. Quite rightly, the victims of those floods should be the recipients of government largess through relief. That relief comes from the taxes we pay. The sorts of taxes that we are talking about here tonight go into consolidated revenue to help Australians such as those caught up in the floods. At the last election the government made four commitments. One of its commitments was to cut company tax. It has done that. It has dropped company tax rates down to 33 per cent. Had the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) been the Prime Minister today, company tax rates would have been going up to 42 per cent. When talking about increasing taxes, the opposition should not forget what it was going to do to the companies of Australia who are out there in the world trying to compete. We have cut their taxes; the opposition was going to increase them. We also said that we would repair the tax base-as I said, we are the lowest taxing country in OECDand we have moved to do that. We announced it last year in this chamber. The fact that those in the opposition were not good enough to make political capital out of it in the election campaign is just too bad for them.

Second Reading",82
184,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, the amendments required to give effect to the sales tax changes that are part of the governll1ent's package for the wine industry announced last week are contained in this and two other accompanying bills. The package is supported by the Winemakers Federation of Australia and was designed after lengthy consultation with the wine industry. The government does. not accept that any of the bills in this package imposes tax. Nevertheless, it has structured the sales tax bills so as to put the matter beyond challenge by those who would argue that an increase in a formal rate of tax is an imposition of tax. For constitutional reasons, sales tax is imposed by four acts. Those acts impose sales tax to the extent that it is: a duty of customs; a duty of excise; a tax on in situ swimming pools; or a tax that is none of these. This bill modifies the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 to the extent that that act deals with tax imposed by the Sales Tax Imposition (Customs) Act 1992. It is proposed to increase the rate of tax on alcoholic wine with an alcohol content greater than 1.15 per cent by volume, from 20 per cent to 31 per cent for a designated period. That period will start on 18 August 1993 and will end on 31 October 1993, or the day before any earlier date which I may announce in a statement laid before this House. This will ensure business does not encounter problems with having charged the higher rate since the budget announcement. From 1 November 1993, or any earlier date which I may announce in my statement, the rate will be dropped to 22 per cent rising to 24 per cent on 1 July 1994 and 26 per cent on 1 July 1995. The phasing in from 22 per cent to 26 per cent will allow the industry time to prepare for the changes and the assistance part of the package to take effect. In line with the changes for alcoholic wine, the rate of tax on low alcohol wine, being wine with an alcohol content of not more than 1.15 per cent by volume, will increase from 10 per cent to 21 per cent for a designated period. That period will be the same as I have just discussed for alcoholic wine. From 1 November 1993, or any earlier date which I may announce in my statement, the rate will drop to 12 per cent rising to 14 per cent on 1 July 1994 and 16 per cent on 1 July 1995. The gain to the revenue from this measure is estimated to be $17 million in 1993-94, $30 million in 1994-95 and $40 million in 199596. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains full details of the amendments, and I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned.

NA (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 31 August, on motion effect to the sales by Mr Duncan: That the bill be now read a second time.",83
187,Mr WILLIAMS,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Tangney) (9.50 p.m.)This Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill is about telephone tapping. Telephone tapping is a particularly insidious intrusion into privacy. It should only be allowed for cogent reasons and subject to tight regulation. Commonwealth laws regulating the interception of telecommunications can be traced back to the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act 1960. That ad made it an offence to intercept telephonic communications except in limited circumstances. The act did not permit interception for general law enforcement purposes at all. That policy was consistent with public opinion on the matter at the time. In 1979, the purposes for which telephone interceptions might be authorised under warrant were expanded to include, for the first time, general law enforcement. The Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 allowed interception in relation to narcotics offences punishable under the Customs Act, such as drug importation. The 1979 act also extended the scope of protection against interceptions to include other telecommunications services, such as data transfer systems. The interception could, under the act, only be effected pursuant to a warrant issued by a Federal Court judge on the application of a member of the Australian Federal Police. The 1979 act was last the subject of extensive amendment in 1987. Those amendments were in response to the December 1984 report of Mr Justice Hope of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security, the April 1986 report of Mr Justice Stewart arising out of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Alleged Telephone Interceptions and the November 1986 report of the Joint Select Committee on Telecommunications Interception. The 1987 amendment act extended the use of interceptions under warrant for law enforcement purposes to certain serious offences against the person, such as murder and kidnapping, and some serious fraud and revenue offences. The 1987 act also provided for the creation of a centralised agency, the Telecommunications Interception Division, or TID, within AFP to execute interception warrants on behalf of the state and territory police forces and other agencies declared to be eligible to apply for interception warrants under the act. It also made it a requirement that the action to facilitate an interception must be taken by an employee of a telecommunications carrier. As a result of the amending act, i'1terceptions made under warrant became subject to detailed recording and reporting obligations including periodic auditing by Commonwealth and state ombudsmen. The minister and the state ministers were also required to furnish annual reports on the operation of the act. Those amendments were welcomed by the coalition as an important step in the fight against organised and serious crime. However, as was noted by the coalition at the time, despite government rhetoric about its serious approach to combating organised crime, the extension of the interception powers available to law enforcement agencies was a long time coming. In addition, the amendments only partially reflected the extensive recommendations made by Mr Justice Stewart. Recommendations rejected or ignored include the following: that judges of the supreme courts of the states or territories should have the power to issue warrants; that in appropriate cases the judge issuing a warrant should authorise an interception to be made directly by a mobile unit without recourse to the telecommunications carrier, and that this should apply to the Australian Federal Police as well as state and territory police forces and the National Crime Authority; and that state police should be empowered to make interceptions in their state independently of the AFP. Recommendations .not acted upon include the following: that it should be an offence to sell or advertise for sale electronic devices designed for effecting telephone interceptions, and that such devices should be made prohibited imports. In 1989, the Attorney-General's Department reviewed the Telecommunications (Interception) Act in response to significant changes in telecommunications technology which had occurred since the act was introduced. A the discussion paper prepared by the department was made available to the public in December 1991. In 1992, the review was completed and recommendations submitted to the then Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy). In this bill, the government has proposed amendments to the act following its consideration of the review. In doing so, it has repeated its actions with respect to the 1987 amendments by rejecting or ignoring a number of the recommendations made by Mr Justice Stewart. With this latest series of amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, the government has seen fit to reject or ignore most of the substantive recommendations made by the review team which looked at the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, as set out in the discussion paper. The final review report and the government's response to it not having been published, the reasons for rejection of recommendations can only be guessed at. The second reading speech offered no hint as to the reasons. No doubt the end result of this will be a further review and yet further amendments to the act at some time in the future. Clearly, the question of telecommunications interception for general law enforcement purposes requires a balancing of conflicting interests. One broad interest is the need to provide Australian law enforcement authorities with the important tool of interception powers for use in the investigation and prosecution of serious offences. Another is the need to ensure that the privacy of individuals is protected from unwarranted intrusions. In its 1983 report on privacy, the Australian Law Reform Commission identified the theoretical basis of privacy as follows: ... an individual's claim to personal autonomy involves a claim to have some control over the way in which he interacts with others. This implies the ability to exclude others from conversations or communications into which he enters and the ability to exclude others from conversations into which he enters and the ability to prevent. people spying on his activities. However, an individual's right to privacy must obviously be balanced against the interests of society as a whole. In this regard, the Australian Law Reform Commission made the following comment: ... in some instances, the social benefits that from police use of· interception and monitoring techniques (in the form of more effective and efficient law enforcement) outweigh the cost, in privacy terms, to individuals of the use of those techniques. . Bearing these observations in mind, I wish to address the most significant of the amendments proposed by this bill. As the act stands, the sole re-ponsibi1ity for executing warrants issued to a law enforcement agency, state or federal, lies with the Telecommunications Interception Division of the AFP. The existing regime requires all intercepted signals to be routed from the exchange identified in the warrant, wherever it is located in Australia, via a leased line to the TID's facilities in Canberra, where the signals are recorded at the same time as they are re-routed to the monitoring centre of the law enforcement agency which applied for the warrant. This arrangement has resulted in problems: delay, AFP unfamiliarity with individual investigations, risks to security, technical difficulties, and cost. The bill seeks to overcome these problems by adopting the submission put to the team which reviewed the Telecommunications (Interception) Act by the Victorian police. Under the new system, the AFP would maintain control of state interceptions by way of a computer controlled cross point switcher known as the telecommunications interception remote authority connection, or TIRAC, system. Under this system, the AFP facilitates the interception by aCtivating a switch from the TID in Canberra, after being satisfied that the interception is in accordance with the relevant warrant. The AFP does not listen to or record these communications. The intercepted signal will be received direct by the law enforcement agency instead of being routed through the TID in Canberra. Thus, the system retains the .. other requirement that an interception may be achieved only as a result of AFP action, ensuring federal control over interception. Further, the AFP retains the ability to disconnect an interception. The coalition recognises that the Telecommunications (Interception) Act must reflect flow developments in the provision of telecommunications services arising from either technological innovations or the implementation of industry reforms such as those contained in the Telecommunications Act 1991. For these reasons, the coalition does not oppose the introduction of the TIRAC system. However, concerns have been raised about the decentralisation of the telecommunications interceptions system. with the use of the TIRAC system. The federal Privacy Commissioner, in his submission for the review of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, stated: . .. the current centralised Federal control of interception and the· keeping of an independent copy of the content of an intercepted communication are important privacy safeguards. The Privacy Commissioner regarded the keeping of an independent record of the content of an intercepted message as serving the interests of the parties to an interception. As noted by the commissioner: Where content is not monitored allegations of ""tampering"" with a message can be made with greater ease and in circumstances in which it may be difficult to dispel doubt as to the authenticity of the information so obtained. In light of these observations, the operation of the TIRAC system needs to be closely monitored. The Privacy Commissioner has expressed a number of concerns to the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch). The response of the Attorney-General in this debate would be appropriate. The coalition also welcomes the amendment proposed by this bill, which provides for warrants for interceptions outside the boundariesof a state. Subsection 39(3) of the act currently prohibits the issuing of a warrant in relation to a telecommunications service which is outside the state of the particular agency seeking the warrant. This restriction is a defect in the act which may advantage those involved in criminal activities who simply move from state to state. The bill seeks to eliminate the defect by removing the territorial limitation. The coalition supports this move. The coalition agrees that such a restriction is inappropriate since important investigations may be frustrated by a suspect moving interstate. The removal of the restriction means that a state agency will still be able to seek the issue of a warrant only for the purpose of investigating an offence in the course of performing its functions. That means that a state law enforcement agency will be able to obtain a warrant for interception of a service outside its state in situations where a nexus between the investigation of an offence for which the state agency has responsibility and the outside service is established. The proposed amendments in this bill relating to interceptions without a warrant in crisis situations have raised concerns among legal and civil libertarian groups consulted by the coalition. The bill allows an officer of the AFP or a state police force to intercept a telecommunication without a warrant in two sets of circumstances. The first might be described as the siege situation. It is where a police officer is a party to a conversation in circumstances where it is reasonable to suspect that the other party to the conversation is involved in the actual or threatened loss of life or infliction of serious injury, to himself or herself or another person, or serious damage to property, and the urgency of the situation makes it impracticable to make an application for a warrant. The other set of circumstances is typified by the cases of kidnapping or other forms of attempted extortion. This occurs in circumstances similar to the siege, except that the police officer is not a party to the conversation and the permission of the person to whom the telecommunication is directed has been obtained. The siege will almost always involve urgency. The kidnapping, or extortion, situation may be, but will not necessarily be, a case of urgency such that it is impracticable for a warrant to be sought. Concerns have been raised about these provisions by the Privacy Law Committee and the criminal law section of the Law Council of Australia. Their concerns have been shared by, among others, the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties Incorporated, and the criminal law committees or sections of a number of state and territory law societies. The coalition considers that the concerns expressed by these bodies are soundly based and justified. It is recognised that Australian law enforcement agencies need to be able to respond swiftly to crisis situations like sieges, kidnappings and extortion attempts. However, the amendments are castin terms which are far broader than such situations require. The review discussion paper did not refer to any difficulties which had arisen in the past. The existing provisions of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act, specifically section 40(2)(b), enable a relevant law enforcement authority to make an application to a judge for a warrant by telephone in urgent circumstances. The opposition believes that the authority to engage in interceptions without a warrant should be directed at circumstances of extreme urgency-where there is no opportunity to make even a telephone application to a judge and where that lack of opportunity continues. As the bill is presently drafted, this is simply not the case. The government proposes that in the first category of exceptional circumstances where a warrant will not be required-the siege situation-the urgency of the situation must be such that it is impracticable to apply for a warrant. The government's proposed amendments do not include the requirement that, if by reason of the urgency of a situation, an interception is initiated without a warrant, the relevant law enforcement agency apply for a warrant as soon as practicable thereafter to continue the interception. To be acceptable, the proposed amendments should also include this requirement. The amendment should also provide that if such an application for a warrant for continuation of the interception is refused, the interception must cease immediately. I will move amendments to this effect in due course. Under the bill, the other circumstances in which it is proposed that an interception may be made without a warrant are situations of kidnapping or attempted extortion, in which the police officer is not a party to the conversation, but permission of the person to whom the telecommunication is directed has been obtained. There is no requirement in the bill, in these circumstances, that the urgency of the situation makes it impracticable to make an application for a warrant. If such a situation meets the requirement of urgency, the interception should be allowed without a warrant, but with a requirement that a warrant be sought as soon as practicable thereafter. If the situation does not fulfil the urgency requirement, there is simply no justification for a warrant not being required. Again, I will later move amendments to the bill in these terms. I reiterate that the opposition recognises the need for revision of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act to allow for technological advances and changes in the telecommunications industry in Australia. The coalition also supports the fight against organised and serious crime, provided that both private and public interests are considered and balanced in the determination of the investigative powers granted to law enforcers. The provisions for intercepting telecommunications without warrant, however, do not fulfil these criteria. Further, the opposition is not swayed by the bland assurances of the government in the second reading speech as to the emergency provisions applying only in 'specified circumstances' and that police use of this authority will be reported to the minister and recorded in the annual report. There is absolutely nothing in the explanatory memorandum to this bill or the second reading speech which offers any justification for the openended manner in which the emergency provisions have been drafted. The amendments proposed by the coalition recognise that there may be circumstances which justify intercepting a call without a warrant, but seek to limit the exercise of such power to circumstances in which it is truly necessary, not merely convenient.",83
188,Mr CLEELAND,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"MCEwen) (10.09 p.m.)The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill is an example of the sort of legislation that this government has introduced over the course of many years which evidences its intention to ensure that crime is dealt with in a proper and fair manner. Since I was first elected to this place in 1984, it has been my proud boast that this federal government has led the most severe, strong and legislatively controlled attack on crime in this country's history. It is a great joy again to be part of a debate where this government is moving to ensure that crime is dealt with in a proper and appropriate manner. In speaking of crime, we do not limit crime to one particular style. Organised crime, as it is described in the popular press and other areas, is a hydraheaded monster. Increasingly, we in this chamber, the media, television shows and the public generally tend to think of organised crime as being the godfather-style type of crime. Maybe the media has taught us to look at ethnic crime in a particular way which often is not the case. The reality is that those who engage in criminal behaviour always do so for the purpose of making a large profit. The very nature of the people who involve themselves in crime is such that they do not like paying tax· on the profit. Indeed, they do not like having other people around them to know what they are doing. For many years the government's approach to this problem of crime has been in the area of mutual recognition. There has been the proceeds of crime legislation, and changes to the Evidence Act. Its approach has been in the area of the Australian Securities Commission, and enlarging the nature and scope of the government's ability to attack the broader aspects of what we all today regard as criminality in an organised sense. I have said before in this House that one of the tragedies is that because of the godfather-style movies, popular press and books, we tend to think of crime in a very narrowly focused way. Yet, for those of us who have had the chance-and, I suppose, the inclination-to delve more seriously into criminal activities, we know that crime is not so narrowly focused, and that the godfather, the Cos a Nostra and the Mafioso are not the generally accepted notions of organised criminality. We must accept that we have Italian organised crime. We cannot argue that we have Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, Lebanese and Australian organised crime. Increasingly, is an interchange between the various traditional ethnic groupings of crime to the extent that we know that Vietnamese criminals will now work in conjunction with Chinese criminals, despite the fact that, in a very long historical sense, the Chinese and the Vietnamese have been traditional enemies. In Australia-certainly within the drug market areas-the Vietnamese have become the foot soldiers for the organised Triad groups in China and Hong Kong. Again, we tend to look at crime as being in drug and similar related areas. Yet, crime only functions with the assistance of lawyers-including QCs-bankers, and similarly qualified people. That assistance is not necessarily given in a criminal manner, but the greater the wealth that criminals have got out of criminal activities, the greater capacity they have got to buy the best legal brains and the best accountants in the country, and the greater capacity they have to influence the course of events by buying professional witnesses. We know that this does happen. The proceeds of organised crime are put through the organised banking system; indeed, through the international banking systems. Criminals like to associate with people who would, in the normal course of events, be regarded as socialites; people who appear in the social columns of our papers and are considered desirable company. Organised crime can operate only when it has support from other groups of people who are legitimate on the surface so that the proceeds of criminality can be made legitimate. What is the purpose of being a criminal if people cannot legitimately enjoy the fruits of their labour? Criminality in that sense today is now an all-encompassing area. It goes beyond our notions of crime and it is enlarging all the time. We ask our state and federal police, the National Crime Authority and the Australian Securities Commission to control this type of activity where, at the press of a button, millions of dollars can be transferred internally from one company structure to another across international boundaries. Some trillions of dollars a day are traded on international there marketplaces, and that is no secret. The criminal elements use the facilities of today's sophisticated trading market to transfer money around the world. Criminals use the Cayman Island companies, every known Swiss banking account system, and every known device and organisation to transpose the illegal nature of money raised through criminal activities and then to bring it back to Australia as being from totally legitimate sources. In more recent years the National Crime Authority has published a major report on money laundering. Mr Frank Costigan, the well-known QC, who is now in Victoria, was the royal commissioner on the Costigan royal commission. He said then that one of the major problems we have to face today in terms of crime is the money trail, and to follow through to where the proceeds of criminality go. Criminal organisations now have great sophistication and it is not going to be easy to tackle them. Currently, the intercept-not just by telephone, but by fax and all other electronic means by which people do business-is one of the main weapons. It has been important in the past, and it will be increasingly important in the future. Computers are now interlinked. Everything is now capable of being electronically controlled. The nation, and parliamentarians on both sides of the House, need to understand and support the processes by which we can attack crime at its very source-the wealth and the proceeds angle, and the movement of money, as well as the grassroots criminal activity area. It is of fundamental importance that we do this. There are many peoplemyself included-who have a certain amount of unease at the thought that we are empowering people to tap into what we generally regard, and should regard, as being a private system of communication. It goes to a question of evils; a question of necessity; a question of balance; the rights of one individual as opposed to the rights of a number of individuals; the rights of society to say collectively that our total rights are more important than a reduction in some rights in the whole process. With other members of this chamber, I have had the fortune to visit both the Federal Police and the National Crime Authority. I have seen their electronic means of telephone interception in operation. I have been part of the parliamentary process of supervision that has looked at the way these processes operate and the mechanisms and controls that are currently in place. On the one hand my natural desire as an individual is to protect civil liberties, to prevent the state from intervening in areas which we should regard as sacrosanct and private, while on the other hand there are the needs of the collective to stop this major organised criminality. On balance, over the years I have supported the concept that the state has a proper and legitimate reason to provide means by which duly authorised police and investigative officers are given the proper power, subject to safeguards, to tap into and use the electronic means of communication as a proper investigatory activity - which they should be entitled to do. I know-and I think many members of this House know-that because of the power we have given in the past we have had very major success and because of that power we have, as a country, made inroads into organised criminality. It is true to say that many people now quite properly serving sentences in gaol are there because of the capacity of the National Crime Authority and the federal police force to use the powers we gave them through previous legislation-the 1979 act and the 1987 act, which I recall being debated in this place. It is pleasing, to me, anyway, that in debates of this kind we do not find dissension from those opposite. It is in general accepted by both sides of the House, in all fairness, that despite misgivings we may have and despite concerns we all individually may have about the processes by which we interface with criminality through the telephone intercept, we do not have a choice. The greater evil is crime itself. Unless we use the powers we have, we will not get the major players. On balance, over the years, I have always accepted and indeed supported the legislation which has gone through this place. The last piece of legislation in my experience was in 1987. There is not much sense in my going through the various clauses of the bill. I think every member of this House has been given a copy of the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech. Having said what I believe is important, certainly from my perspective, I need say only that the legislation has my full support. I have resertry to vations, as I always do, about breaches of liberty. Nevertheless, on balance, it is in the interests of this country to support this kind of activity. The legislation has my full support, and I trust it has the full support of all members of this House and that it will be appropriately passed.",87
189,Ms MOYLAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1993 is a practical and necessary bill which updates the regulation of an area for which the Commonwealth does indeed bear full responsibility under the constitution. It is an area in which the Commonwealth should employ its authority to assist the states in the task of crime prevention and in which the powers of government in general need to be carefully defined in the important balance between the prevention of crime and the protection of its victims and the safeguarding of privacy. As a federalist, I must support the concept of enabling the interception of telecommunications by state police authorities through the new telecommunications interception remote authority connection. I say in passing that while this may be a mouthful, it needs to be spelt out in full wherever possible so that we as legislators are not once again part of a process that bamboozles the public through yet another cosy acronym obscuring the original meaning. I welcome the fact that technology.allows the Australian Federal Police to fulfil their monitoring role without the need to direct intercepted signals through Canberra and without listening to or recording the communications. In a mature federal system, state authorities must work as the partners rather than the subordinates of the federal authorities. It was a serious defect in the existing practice that the diversion of intercepts through Canberra led to technical problems, delays and general inefficiencies through the need for the AFP to involve itself in the actual investigations. We can only wish that this principle whereby the responsible Commonwealth agency takes a more handsoff approach were followed in other dealings between the Commonwealth and the states. It is also timely that c1ause 13 of the bill will allow a state agency to obtain an interception warrant outside the borders of its own state in the conduct of its ongoing investigations. Criminals will no longer be able to exploit this loophole in the federal system. They will no longer be able to play musical chairs and escape the full force of the law. Once more we can see a practical example as to how the supposed difficulties posed by dispersed authority within the federal system can be resolved. This bill, however, is about more than the relations between federal and state authorities. It must also delineate how far our law enforcement process can intrude on the right of privacy that is basic to the integrity of national telecommunications systems. Accordingly, I share the concern voiced by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) as to the lack of necessity to obtain a warrant for the interception as outlined in clause 10 of the bill. None of us would want to tie the hands of the police where human life is threatened and time is of the essence. The waiving of the necessity for a warrant in a situation of urgency, however, does not logically imply that somehow a warrant need not be obtained without such a crisis. There is no reason why a warrant should not be sought in any nonurgent situation or for the. continuation of interception once the initial crisis has passed. It may seem pedantic or somehow reflect a lack of'confidence in the judgment of our law enforcement agencies, but that certainly is not how the coalition st(es it; rather, this parliament has a duty to make sure that privacy and due process are seen to be upheld in all but the most exceptional circums-nces. This attachment to due process through very careful guidelines will be a help rather than a hindrance to the objective· of effective policing. Australia has entered an· era when technology not only can make personal communication very much easier and more effective but also can intrude upon the privacy of those communications with far greater efficiency. It is nonsense for anyone to c1aim that because law abiding people have nothing to hide, slight encroachrnents by the agencies of government do not matter. Of course, they do matter. There are many older Australians who have a suspicion of the telephone. It is partly a recollection of those times when lines were more easily crossed and when manual operation was needed. So it is imperative that we not only pass this bill but make amendments as recommended by the honourable member for Tangney, so that we can work together to stop criminal processes and at the same time maintain the rights of our citizens. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",89

(2) Clause 10, page 7, after proposed subsection (5) insert the following subsections: "" '(SA) As soon as practicable after the doing of an act in relation to a communication under the provisions of subsection (4) or (5), an officer of the agency which is concerned with the communication shall cause an application for a Part VI warrant to be made in relation to the matter. "" '(58) Where after considering an application made in relation to a matter arising under subsections (4) or (5) and (SA) a judge does not issue a warrant in relation to the application, the chief officer of the agency concerned shall ensure that no further action is taken by the agency to intercept the communication or to cause it to be intercepted.' ."". (3) Clause 10, page 7, line 6, omit ""Subsections (4) and (5)"", substitute ""Subsections (4), (5), (SA) and (58)"". The amendments seek to achieve the purposes which I outlined in my speech on the second reading debate, and I commend them to the chamber.",90
191,Mr KERR,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I thank the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and the other honourable members who have contributed to the debate for the courtesy that they have given to the chamber and the substance that they have applied. The government's intention is to accept the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Tangney. It is not, in so doing, accepting what I think was a somewhat intemperate breadth of expression of criticism by the honourable member for Tangney of the government's original proposal. Certainly, the government's intention when introducing this bill was not to give bland assurances, as the honourable member for Tangney has said, but to actually provide a balanced regime whereby the police in certain circumstances of emergency are able to obtain intercepts without warrants-a policy which commands the support of both sides of the House. Nonetheless, in the debate reference has been made to criticisms that have been put forward by the Privacy Commissioner and by a number of other critics of good repute. The government has considered those matters, and it has also considered the proposals that have been put forward by way of amendment by the honourable member for Tangney, the shadow Attorney-General. The government believes that on balance the amendments take nothing from the bill and, in fact, add slightly to it by providing a regime which allows the court to assess any instance where this has occurred and where an ongoing interception still applies. If the court finds that no warrant is appropriate, then the intercept would be terminated. I think that makes sure that it is consistent with a general regime that interception of all telephone lines occurs only under judicial warrant and under judicial supervision. It also retains the safeguards that were intended by the government to apply in relation to -' these exceptional proceedings whereby warrants are obtained without a preceding authorisation by a court that they be reported to the House so that there is a twin safeguard that applies. Because of those reasons, we are content to accept the amendments and on that basis look forward to the opposition's support for this bill when it comes before the Senate in due course. Finally, I should respond in relation to some comments. made on the second reading in relation to a request for us to give some explanation of two additional criticisms that have been made by the Privacy Commissioner. Firstly, a duty of care should be placed on chief officers of organisations involved with intercept functions to ensure that strict security procedures are in place. In our view it would not be appropriate to expressly declare the duties of chief officers in those terms having regard to the detailed provisions for accountability already in the act. Non-police members will not be able to use the existing provisions of the act which allow AFP staff members to monitor calls unless the federal Attorney-General has made an appropriate declaration. Secondly, the offence of misuse of intercepted information in section 63 should be broadened to include situations where a person has acted negligently or recklessly. In the government's view such an amendment is unnecessary. It has previously been considered by us in consultation with the DPP. The provision is already applicable to cases of reckless, although probably not negligent, disclosure. While the incident that gave rise to previous consideration was not followed by prosecution, it was one of proof rather than statutory interpretation. In all those circumstances, I again commend the contribution of all speakers to the House. I think it is a useful instance where the government is able to accept a well-considered and well-drafted amendment by the opposition. I thank the honourable member for Tangney for preparing such an amendment, and I hope that the matter now proceeds further in the other House with the support of both sides of this chamber. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Kerr) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 September, on  That the bill be now read a second time.",91
192,Mr TIM FISCHER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (10.36 p.m.)Without breaching standing orders, I congratulate in passing the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) in getting his first ever set of amendments up on the floor of the House from opposition. That is no mean feat on any bill. There were three amendments involved on the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill, and I commend the honourable member for Tangney on a great effort in that regard and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) for his role, which was essential to the plot. I now move on to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. This defence legislation comes into full debate in the House of Representatives at some 20 minutes to 11. It is quite important legislation. It is legislation which the coalition will not oppose, and it deals with a number of matters including superannuation provisions which are to be changed to reflect the fact that determinations made under section 5(2) are no longer interim; the right of appeal to the federal court from the AAT following a review of conscientious objection tribunal findings; the streamlining of overseas command procedures; allowing a minister rather than the Governor General to appoint certain trustees; a declaration of new category of warlike service to allow access to home loan subsidies; and a retrospective amendment to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991. This is the first opportunity that I have had to address the House on defence issues for some little time. Since I recently visited with you, Mr Deputy President, China and Tibet but then more so Pakistan, Syria and Lebanon, I take the opportunity in the context of this Defence Legislation Amendment Bill to remind the House that we had until quite recently Australian soldiers serving in Pakistan based at Peshawar who then carried out minefield clearance works in Afghanistan and who, by their conditions of service, will be picked up in part by changes in this bill before the House. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to those Australian engineers and minefield clearance team trainees for the work and the efforts that they put in, not just the last contingent but all contingents which have been based at Peshawar in recent years. During the course of that visit, I met the Afghanistan personnel. They were unstinting in their praise of the bravery, courage and capability of the Australians and the ability of the Au-tralians to mix positively with the Mujahidin and others on the Afghanistan side and with Pakistanis as was necessary, based as they were, at the eastern end of the Khyber Pass at Peshawar. It was a great pity that, in a semi-secret move, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) brought that commitment to an end, partly because it was one which Australia was paying for entirely rather than the cost being picked up through a United Nations apparatus. I think great work could have done had it been extended for at least another 18 to 24 months in the circumstances. There are certainly still many mines around Afghanistan. But I guess the good news is that the service given by the Australians was extremely well regarded. It is a great pity that it was truncated but, in any event, those soldiers returning deserve our praise and, of course, will be the recipients of benefits contained in this Defence Legislation Amendment Bill. I visited Peshawar on a Sunday and travelled up the Khyber Pass to the very edge of Afghanistan and Pakistan and saw some of the minefield materiel, including various kinds of mines and detection equipment which the Australian soldiers-sappers and engineerswere utilising to help train local people to carry out the work further. It is a most extraordinary part of the world. The terrain is rough and the Khyber Pass itself is most interesting. It is a piece of history, of Marco Polo once passed without a passport and Alexander the Great once passed without a passport. But a passport was required for Tim Fischer to pass. I could never quite work out why there was this differentiation; in all the circumstances. What was also fascinating about the Khyber Pass was the steady flow of refugees back into Afghanistan from the refugee camps on this particular day, especially up past the magnificent section of the Khyber Pass where all the forts are, from the Khyber Rifles, along the sealed highway back into Afghanistan and alongside the old British railway line which was built for defence resupply purposes at the turn of the century-a great feat of engineering. I make the point overall that those Afghanis are returning to Afghanistan whilst there are still many minefields around many of the centres and, as such, I take this opportunity to formally record my disappointment and that of the shadow minister for defence in the other place to the ending of the Australian commitment to minefield clearance training in Afghanistan. I take this opportunity to salute further the work of all Australian soldiers who participated in the commitment in Afghanistan over recent years. I commend them on their work and wish them well as they return to other aspects of their military career. Last year Senator Richard Alston visited the area as well. I think had some of the government ministers gone they would have a better appreciation of the work that was being carried out by those Australian soldiers. I am pleased that my colleague the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) also went to the area and learnt much from visiting Peshawar, the Khyber Pass and environs. I might add that in Damascus, Syria, I met a number of other Australian peacekeepers, who again are the subject of this Defence Legislation Amendment Bill. They are working as peacekeepers, both in Syria and on the Golan Heights in Israel, in rotation, - nd again carrying out direct work, this time as part of the UN peacekeeping role as part of the complex Middle East sitQation. It was a privilege to visit Syria and Lebanon, to travel course: by road from Damascus through the Bekaa Valley to Beirut, Tripoli and beyond and to better assess the region and its complex problems. I hope that peace will ensue partly as a consequence of the agreement which has been reached and signed between Prime Minister Rabin and the PLO's Mr Yasser Arafat on the lawns of the White House. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was quoted at the time as saying that Australia had no involvement in the Middle East and therefore he should not go to that signing ceremony. I think that was a very bad tactical error by the Prime Minister. Either he made the wrong decision or he was wrongly advised, perhaps by the new Australian ambassador in Washington or by someone else. This was an historic moment in the history of the world and the history of the Middle East: The Prime Minister was within 500 metres of the signing ceremony on that particular day. He had an invitation to sit in the front row at the White House to witness the signing of the agreement between the PLO and the Israelis. Whilst I mention this only in passing, I make the point that it was wrong say that Australia had no direct or indirect involvement in the Middle East. We have. We stripped. have Australian soldiers in Israel; we have Australian soldiers in Syria. We have had many years a direct peacekeeping role and, addition to that, we have other interests. course, to be fair, both the Australian governconstructive, ment and the Australian coalition support peace in the Middle East, and that should have been sufficient to persuade the Prime Minister to move that 500 metres across road between Blair House and the White efforts House to attend and witness that ceremony and, if necessary, slightly reschedule the Kantor trade talks which were due during archy much the same time period. Those soldiers serving in the Middle East will also be affected by this Defence Legislaabout tion Amendment Bill with regard to superanCanberra, nuation; conscientious objection-although do not think that will cause them much concern-and access to home loan subsidies and other matters covered by this legislation. However, in this legislation there are more subtle changes which I think are worthy of comment. I refer to the move to allow minister rather than a governor-general to appoint certain trustees. The Governor-. General, I remind the House, is Commanderannuation in-Chief of the Australian armed forces. In lot of defence legislation the Governorif General has a particular role to play. We in the Liberal and National parties are fair-minded people and I think it is a demonstration of our fair-mindedness that we ine this amendment with particular interest. Some of us were a little bit suspicious that this was part of the repUblican plot by stealth through the backdoor to strip our Commandment er-in-Chief of these particular powers in relation to the appointment of trustees and to descend it upon the ranks of some lesser, but nevertheless important, human being, namely, the relevant minister. The Parliamentary cies Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, will be pleased to know that, on balance, after careful consideration of the aspects of the legislation, we concluded that on this occasion it was not part of some secret for him to plot by the government. Mr Snowdon-And he wasn't being",92
193,Mr TIM FISCHER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"He was not being for stripped and his role as Commander-in-Chief in remains intact and is not impacted on by this Of legislation. Therefore, we have decided, in a purposeful way, not to oppose those sections of the legislation, but we place the government on alert that at every opportunity we will continue to monitor its activithe ties to ensure that there are no backdoor by the government to present Australia with some form of fait accompli along the path to switching from a constitutional monto a republic. I state that categorically because I do not believe that Australia will be well served by such a switch. I think it is all centralisation and more power in but I acknowledge that that is on I the very periphery of matters relating to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill. In the main, the legislation before the parliament is of a machinery nature. It takes some a number of logical steps with regard to various aspects of other defence legislation, a including the Royal Australian Air Force Veterans' Residences Act 1953, the Services Trust Funds Act 1947 and the Military Superand Benefits Act 1991. I believe a that on detailed examination it will improve, only on the margin, the lot of the Australian serving personnel. Therefore, I believe that it is a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, the lot of the serving personexamnel and morale in the armed forces-navy, army and air force-are of considerable concern. Admiral Beaumont, the Chief of the Defence Force, recently made a strong statewith regard to the resources of the defence forces, the cutbacks in the budget for the defence forces and the fact that the budget is now so close to the bone that Australia is left with an inability to respond to contingenof a military or quasi-military nature, be they earthquakes, evacuations of large numbers to our north, other activities in our own region or maintaining naval commitments to the gulf in the Middle East and army commitments in the Sahara, Syria, Israel and, recently, Cambodia-a small commitment is still continuing in Cambodia-as well as commitments by the air force around the world and here in Australia. A nation must take note when a defence force commander takes the unusual step recording his very real concern over the level of defence expenditure, the level of the defence budget vote and the resultant effect on defence capabilities. I salute the bravery Admiral Beaumont in going public on those matters, and I note with interest the response of the Minister for Defence to ments on the occasion of a welcome home for the Cambodian contingent held in Sydney. said words to the effect that there should no more cuts but he was not able to guarantee that there would be no more cuts. The Ausinto tralian defence forces have been the subject of a series of budget contractions over recent relevant. years and yet more has been demanded of them. Overall, they are efficient in their They carry out a wide range of duties behalf of the government of the day and on behalf of the nation. We would be wise heed the warning given by Admiral Beaumont with regard to the vote levels, the budget levels, the allocations, the appropriations the expenditure intended for the navy, army and the air force. Australia would be very unwise to ignore the warning issued by Admiral Beaumont. I look forward to the debate in this House, and more so the debate in the Senate, where additional time and the committee structure exist to ensure that the defence dollar is unnecessarily wasted or reduced to an unacIt ceptable level, and to ensure that Australia able to maintain an adequate navy, army air force to meet the various commitments .which occur from time to time, often when nation least expects. We only have to read part of the autobiography of Prime Margaret Thatcher in another context to realise how quickly something can turn around. Never in her wildest dreams did believe that within her first parliamentary term as Prime Minister of Great Britain would be committing British forces to without any warning from intelligence prior to 48 hours before Argentina invaded the Falklands. There were certainly no warnings before that. That shows how quickly things can tum around. We ignore the advice of a commander of the defence forces at our peril. He has spoken, of so let us take note of that advice in the context of this Defence Legislation Amendment Bill debate here tonight. The coalition is not opposed to this legislation but we are of opposed to the defence dollar being wasted and to unfairly cutting back the role and the funding of our defence forces, be it for the those comarmy, navy or air force.",94

195,Ms DEAHM,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"It work. gives me great pleasure to speak to the Deon fence Legislation Amendment Bill and I am very pleased to hear that the opposition is not to opposing it. I am also very glad that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has decided that it is not a and republican plot. I am very proud to have in the my electorate Richmond RAAF base, one of the oldest RAAF establishments in Australia, currently the most active and certainly one of the most important. It has been our major transport base for the last 40 years. Preparing for my speech tonight, I referred to Derek Roylance's Air Base Richmond-The not Story of the RAAF Base on the Hawkesbury. is a fascinating book outlining the history is of the base from even before the establishand ment of the New South Wales Aviation School on the site in March 1917 through to a the 90s. I recommend the book, not just for those interested in aviation but also to anyone Minister looking for a good read. In speaking to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill, I will be speaking at length she about Richmond RAAF base. I will attempt to show that the men and women of RAAF she Richmond are an important part of my local war community-economically, culturally and historically-and that they play an important role nationally and internationally. The contriand bution made by these committed and caring men and women is widespread and varied. In the local community and beyond they conduct bushfire and flood relief and rescue. In the Hawkesbury, which is subject to regular flooding and which suffers many serious bushfires, they are an integral part of the emergency services of the district. I am reminded of the story told to me after the last flood by an elderly Windsor woman. She is infirm and, I am sure she would not mind me admitting, a rather large lady. When her farm was flooded and she and her ·husband were evacuated, RAAF personnel came to their assistance. She paints a wonderful word picture of the difficulties the RAAFies had hoisting her on to the back of the transport provided for the purpose. Like this local woman, there are hundreds of local residents who owe a huge debt of gratitude to the personnel of RAAF Richmond, whatever their size. The RAAF base is also a major local tourist attraction. In October 1988, the air show at Richmond RAAF-the RAAF's contribution to the bicentennial celebrations-was the biggest air show ever staged in Australia and drew more than 250,000 spectators from all over Australia and the world. Another such event is planned for March of next year as part of the commemoration of activities of the bicentenary of European settlement in the Hawkesbury. I am sure this show will provide a similar economic benefit to the local tourism industry. RAAF Richmond also makes an important contribution at a national and international level. In August 1959 No. 3 RAAF hospital at Richmond took on the role of providing aero-medical evacuation and today has specialist medical teams always ready to fly to evacuate critically ill patients-military or civilian-to a major medical facility. There is always a qualified medical and nursing team on board who, on occasions, have been called upon to perform surgery during flight. Just one exampl- of the work of this unit is its work during the Vietnam conflict. No. 36 squadron and No. 37 squadron provided a regular service from Vietnam for wounded sick servicemen. Evacuees were initially taken to No.4 RAAF hospital at Butterworth in Malaysia and then often flown the more than 6,400 kilometres non-stop to Richmond. No. 3 RAAF hospital is today the RAAF's leading hospital and is one of the leading medical establishments in the Australian Defence Force. The hospital administers the RAAF's health promotion program and is home to the alcohol and rehabilitation flight, the occupational health sUl?port and training flight and the central reference laboratory. Many of these facilities serve not just the personnel of RAAF Richmond but all three branches of the defence forces. Emergency relief work carried out by RAAF Richmond personnel has included work all around Australia and in Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Noumea, the Cocos Islands, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island, either bringing in relief or taking out seriously ill or endangered people. It is worth noting that the first aircraft to land at Darwin after the Cyclone Tracy disaster was a No. 37 squadron Hercules. In the days that followed the squadron evacuated more than 500 people to southern capitals and lifted in 2,000 tonnes of food and equipment to those who remained behind. Soldiers from the army's base in Townsville were also airlifted to help in the clean up. Cyclone Tracy was a challenge not only to aircrews; the maintenance squadron, as always, played a major role. Mr Roylance tells us: In mid-afternoon on Christmas Day 1974, No. 486 Squadron was asked to provide the maximum number of aircraft possible. By that night 13 aircraft had been prepared for flight and by New Year's Eve, 19 aircraft, the maximum possible, were away from Richmond on task. The maintenance, medical and transport personnel of RAAF Richmond provide not only valuable civil, emergency and humanitarian services of which I have already spoken. It must not be forgotten that the primary role of the RAAF base is its support role around the world to the Australian Defence Force. As well as the work in the Vietnam conflict which I have already mentioned and of course, before that, in the Second World War, RAAF Richmond has provided ground and aircrews and support services in conflicts around the globe. In 1991, two Hercules from No. 37 Squadron and one Boeing 707 from No. 33 Squadron were positioned to evacuate Australian civilians from the gulf area. A medical team from No. 3 RAAF hospital accompanied the Hercules. More recently, 70 per cent of occupational forces in Somalia have been transported by the Hercules and Boeing 707s of RAAF Richmond's airlift group, which has also been continually involved with supplies, mail and airlift of personnel to Cambodia. The air transport and telecommunications unit has played the major role in provi?ing communication facilities for our troops m Cambodia. I have mentioned several times the men and women of the RAAF, and it was not always the case that we could use that phrase. As in civilian life, the defence forces brought in women at a time of war when so many of our men were serving overseas. The Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the WAAAF, was formed in April 1941 and in 1942 large numbers of women began to enlist. One of the early recruits was Sergeant Aile-n Williamson who enlisted in the RAAF m February 1942. At RAAF base Richmond she was engaged as a claims clerk in the stores at No.2 AD. I will read a couple of quotes by Aileen, again from Mr Roylance's book. - h.e described the accommodation and the faCIlIties at the base in this way: The iron beds, straw and hessian mattresses, cramped quarters, monotonous (to say the least) food, the long hours of work (from 0730 to 1730 hours)in parliamentary terms, those seem short hours- ' and the military discipline; and those gi-ls - orked with a concentration, efficiency and decitcatlOn always obvious in civilian life. At the other end, though, there was a bit of excitement. Aileen describes it this way: The highlight of my two-and-a--alf years at Richmond ... was the day the SWift, slee,k and beautiful Spitfires arrived. It was a magmficent sight and there truly was great rejoicing-real goose pimple stuff . , . Women in the forces, like women in other walks of life at that time, were used for what was generally regarded as 'women's work'as clerks, nursing sisters and so on. But after a while they proved by their hard work, dedication and efficiency that they were capable of much more than that. So some of them did graduate from being clerks, mess stewards, cooks and drivers to the real 'men's work' and they entered the technical fields of electricians, fitters, flight mechanics, armourers', and wireless and radio operators. After the war, when they were very much a temporary force, the Women 's Roya- A-s­ tralian Air Force was formed at the begmnmg of 1951. On 25 January the first recruits for the permanent air force arrived at Richmond for their basic training. So women played an equal role.",95
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I did allow a very wide ranging debate in the case of the Leader of the National Party. On one or two occasions, he did at least mention the subject of the bill and I would be grateful if at some time you could also get around to mentioning the bill ",97
197,Ms DEAHM,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,I will shortly. l\:fr DEPUTY SPEAKER-I am delighted to hear it.,97
198,Ms DEAHM,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"The contributions made by the men and women of the Australian defence forces should be recognised by all of us, in this place and in the community, in gratitude and with respect. In a recent letter to me, Lieutenant-Colonel Morris, industrial officer of the Armed Forces Federation of Australia, said: A service career is very demanding, frequently requiring long absences from families, and imposing emotional and financial pressures - n the armed services personnel not normally experienced by the civilian population. not This is an understatement of the situation in which we place our service personnel and it is important to recognise that the demands and pressures we place upon them are also placed upon their families. Speaking personally, I come from a service family. My father spent all his working life in the navy, so. I know what it is like to have a father who IS not around very often. Our service personnel are on call for active duty at all times. They must leave their homes and go where they are required, with all the pressures this places on their families. Their spouses lose employment and promotional opportunities and their children's educ!ltion disrupted. They do not have the same opportunity to form and maintain relationships as civilians and they do not have the advantages of close proximity to extended families. I would like to take the opportunity here tonight to pay tribute to those people to whom we owe so much-the men and women of our defence forces and their families. I am pleased to speak tonight to ·a bill which goes in part towards providing tion for the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. The bill before us is a part the establishment of a new framework for conditions of service for Australian defence personnel who serve overseas. This new standardised structure will provide more certainty for the men and women who are deployed overseas and for their families. This decisi0n reflects the government's determinafare tion to see overseas service by Australian Defence Force personnel appropriately recoggovernment's nised and to ensure that the conditions service and entitlements are fully understood by the personnel before the commencement the deployment. The conditions include leave benefits, taxation concessions, compensation and veterans' affairs matters and additional remuneration by way of deployment allowances. In the past, entitlements were determined on a case by case basis, with a number ministers making decisions under varying legislation. This led to delays which meant that personnel began their overseas tour of duty without a clear idea of their conditions forthwith. of service. The new arrangements, with the standardised definition of warlike and nonwarlike service, which will be decided before personnel are deployed, provide for automatic flow-on of benefits. Service men and women and their families will be able to plan properly before their departure. Just one of the provisions-the amendment to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act-will provide specific recognition of ADF personnel deployed overseas on warlike service. For example, soldiers who have completed operational service in Somalia will now have a waiver of the six-year qualifying requirement for a loan, an additional is three years of loan subsidy and may, depending on further service, have the maximum loan subsidy period extended from 20 to 25 years. The current climate of civilianisation of the defence forces has caused concern amongst defence personnel. They do not feel they have the same job security they enjoyed in the past. When visiting the RAAF base and talking to my constituents, these concerns are continrecogniually brought to my attention. The welfare of our defence forces and their of families is one of my paramount concerns. I have been working closely with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner) in relation to the needs of this important part of my constituency. I know that he shares my desire to provide for them the best possible conditions of service, weland recreational facilities and housing. I intend to work tirelessly to ensure this poliCies reflect the high esteem of in which we hold the men and women of the ADF to whom we owe so much. I am grateful of that this debate has provided me with the opportunity to say to our .defence personnel, 'You are important, the government recognises your contribution-we thank you'.

Universities: Student Guilds",97
199,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to highlight the hypocrisy and rhetoric of some of those who stand in this place. Some political parties in this country wave the banner of human rights and masquerade around this country championing the cause of democracy and civif liberties, yet across Australia in all its universities and places of higher learning students are being denied the basic right to-or in this case, not to-freely associate and organise. The attitude many on the opposite side of this House hold is that students should be compelled against their will to join student guilds. Students who are knowingly and consciously denied the opportunity to make up their own minds about joining university guilds represent an obvious and blatant betrayal by all state and federal governments in allowing individuals to exercise what are the most basic liberties in a plural society like Australia. While many are ready to champion the cause of child rights and many other rights for an array of other groups, they remain silent when it comes to addressing the rights of students who choose not to become members of student unions. Article 20 of the United Nations Declaracost tion on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Labour Organisation's convention concerning freedom of association all defend the right to free assembly and association and denounce the practice of compelling individuals to become members associations. This is despite the fact that international treaties, which many members of this government are quick to champion as necessary supplements to Australian law, expressly recognise and defend the right to acquired fees? free association. To date, state and federal governments-and I concede Liberal governments are no less to blame-have been silent in addressing this stark abuse of human dignity. The silence has come to an end in Western Australia under the new Court government and the new minister for educadered tion, Norman Moore. The federal government's decision to actively inhibit an individual's right to free association was highlighted in this place earlier. The passage of the States Grants little (General Purpose) Bill represents an act corruption on the part of this government in using its powers and financial muscle to coerce state governments out of adopting platforms that empower students and make student organisations more representative of students. The government's actions on this issue represent a most insidious effort to again usurp the power of the states to effectively ' govern within their own jurisdictions. The reluctance of governments to address this issue serves orily to perpetuate the many abuses and wastage of student moneys by student guilds across Australia. I would like to quote from the Harabee, the student newspaper of the Edith Cowan University, in defence of student unions. It says: Given that guilds work, essentially by accumulating funds and gaining the benefits of economies of scale, it means that they can provide services to those who need them of a greater standard than most individual students could afford ... further, student guilds offer a redistributing effect providing poorer students more than their money's worth in terms of goods and services. Of course, this ignores the fact that in some universities around Australia it can_ actually students in excess of $300 to become members. Student fees heighten the financial hardship of students attending university; they do nothing to ease it. While lOOper cent of all students are forced to pay the guild fee, the utilisation of services by the guild highlights that the real of need by students of guilds is minimal and I would go so far as to suggest that it is a minority of students who use a majority of the services. Why not have a user pays system or in fact a services fee rather than compulsory What is most obnoxious about the complllsory nature of student guild fees is the obvious disregard that guild administrators have for the political and moral attitudes of the many students who are forced to pay the compulsory fee then watch that money squanon a range of activities. There is no justice in having money compulsorily taken from one and used in activities which contravene one's personal, political or moral attitudes. I would suggest most students care about, let alone want to fund, activities . of aimed at increasing people's awareness of drug taking; nor do they want to finance political campaigns of any description. And most would object to having their money used to denigrate religious attitudes or promote those on the fringe of our community. Of particular concern to many students around Australia was the use of student moneys to campaign against the coalition in the recent federal election. At a meeting the National Union of Students on 15 Februarural ry 1993 the national executive passed following motion: That the executive authorise the President conduct a ""put the Liberals Last"" campaign for Federal Election and that up to $30,000 be committhe ted by the union for his campaign. That money came from a bottomless pit of. funds acquired by compulsion from students all around Australia. The continued acceptance of compulsory student unionism in Australian universities and its continued to sanction by this government and other govThat ernments should not be tolerated. It is condemonstrates trary to the very notion of a university a place of free thought, a place of exchanging ideas. Budget 1993-94",98
200,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"I editors would like to take a moment in this adjournthat ment debate to draw attention to the double standards so evident in the way in which Australian Democrats have dealt with the issue surrounding the passage of the current budget. The Democrats were formed, we were told, to keep the bastards honest. But their own attitude in this question has been thing but a matter of honesty; in fact, they have conspired with the government to allow the passage of measures which are anything but honest. As we look at the government's election promises, it is quite clear that it went to the Australian people with a commitment for tax cuts. They were l-a-w, law. Those tax cuts could be funded without any increases in the indirect taxes. Then came the budget which brought upon the Australian people perhaps the harshest increases in indirect taxes nation's history. The Democrats, whose role, we are told, is to keep them honest, have done a shabby deal with the government to allow the passage of these increased costs. The Democrats also like to parade around, particularly in country areas, demonstrating their grave concern for farmers and the provincial city sector. Yet they are supporting government proposals to increase fuel taxes. The fuel tax, which will of impose a particularly heavy burden on the sector, comes at a time when the the government's own ABARE figures suggest that most farmers, for the second year in a to row, will have negative incomes. Recent the Bureau of Statistics figures demonstrate that poorest federal electorates in Australia are in rural and provincial areas. There are growing pockets of poverty il'l; rural and provincial areas. The Democrats show their concern for the rural sector by moving with the government increase taxes and costs on the rural sector. is a severe blow for those areas and again that the Democrats cannot being be counted upon to keep the government honest but can be counted on to desert those they claim to represent whenever the opportunity arises. Senator Woodley has written letters to the of local newspapers, lauding the deals the Democrats have done. All they have won from the government as a reward for the these deals is a small increase in the tax rebate to go to low income earners. But does Senator Woodley or, for that matter, the government not realise that farmers with negative incomes will not get the tax rebate anybecause they are not paying any tax? The really poor people in our community will get no compensation for the tax increases that this budget imposes. Is there any justice there? In his letter, Senator Woodley talks about social equity. Where is the social equity in a program of this nature? The Democrats, by their actions, have certainly shown their disregard for the Australian people. With Labor, they have put in place a system of tax increases that will significantly disadvantage the poorest sectors in our in our community. They may well like to parade themselves as the honest brokers, but they have certainly ceased to have any kind of credibility in that regard. The Democrats should never again move into any rural or provincial area. Every motorist who pulls up at a petrol pump needs to remember that the increased excise that he or she is paying is part of a Labor-Democrat deal. The increased cost on every item that a shopper buys at the supermarket is not just a Labor Party cost; it is a Democrat cost. Those sorts of arrangements do nothing to build the credibility of the Democrats or encourage people to believe in the honesty of the Australian political system. If political parties are encouraged to disregard their election promises, the very essence of our electoral system and parliamentary democracy is threatened. If political parties are encouraged to believe that they can say anything during an election campaign and not be held accountable for their promises, the very basis of our democratic system and our parliamentary processes is at risk. The Democrats, by backing Labor's nagrant dishonouring of its election promises, are encouraging that concern. (Time expired) Kenneth, Mr Jeffrey",100
201,Mr CHYNOWETH,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to rise this evening and talk about a . subject that I know both you and many people in this House will be interested inone Jeffrey Kennett. You may not think I have anything left to say about him, but I do. I want to let the House know of the development of a new political party in this House called the 'Victorian Conservative Wimps', which is made up of members of the National and Liberal parties from Victoria. I have gone through current House Hansard records and drawn out from the computer all those in the opposition parties who have spoken against Jeffrey Kennett, the Premier of Victoria. There has not been one. Has this issue affected their electorates? I have a map which shows all the schools in Victoria that have had their funding cut, and the majority are in country areas. There are hundreds of them. There have been train lines closed. There has been a massive impost inflicted upon the people of Victoria, and they cover all the National Party and Liberal Party seats. Have we heard one word of complaint about the Premier? Not one word from honourable members opposite. It is a disgrace, especially the country members who are not sticking up for their electorates. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has just walked into the House. Not also one of his people have spoken against Jeffrey Kennett, who has cut out all those trains and cut down funding for all those great country schools. What have we heard from the opposition? Nothing. Opposition members are the wimps of Victoria. Let me read an interesting statement about the Premier of Victoria. This is from a newspaper article headed 'John Brumby's Diary'. This is what happened to him when he went to a meeting. It gives a good example of what the Premier of Victoria is like. I quote: I have barely sat down when the Premier lurches across the table and says in a loud and aggressive voice, pointing directly at me: ""You, Brumby, you're not welcome here, get out"". This is the Premier of Victoria. I continue: I cannot believe this is the Premier of Victoria. He continues: ""Go on, you're not welcome here. I've told you, get out of the room"". I quietly inform the Premier that I have been invited by chairman Ian Smith and that my office has twice checked whether it is appropriate for me to attend and on both occasions I have been told that I should. Smith then apologises and says that if there has been a mix-up it is his fault. The Premier says: ""No, Ian, don't apologise; it's all Mr Brumby's fault. I'm telling you, Mr Brumby, you have to leave. At that point David White comes in. David tells Jeffrey that he should leave. And rightly so. The Premier shouldn't be a trustee anyway and was only ever a trustee by virtue of his position previously as Leader of the Opposition. There is no spot for the Premier of Victoria. Heated interchange between the Premier and David White continues, then the Premier again turns to me and says: ""I'm telling you, Mr Brumby, that you're not welcome at this meeting and that the trustees want you to leave."" 1this is John Brumbyreply: ""Which trustees?"" He replies: ""I do."" I say: ""And which others?"" Bruce Chamberlain sits pat, Ian Smith sits pat. With that, the Premier says there is no point continuing with the meeting, rises feet and storms out of the room. That is the sort of person who is running Victoria. Honourable members opposite may think that I am making a bit of a joke about this. I said in the last week of sitting that Jeffrey Kennett's popularity went up. It has gone up in Victoria. Adolf Hitler's popularity went up when he was first elected; so did Mussolini's and Richard Nixon's. This is very serious. Honourable members opposite may think this is a bit of a joke, but before the last election Jeffrey Kennett used to go around the rotary clubs and say, 'What Victoria needs is a benign dictator'. The Victorians are getting one now. There are a few people like me; if the revolution happens I will be first up against the wall, I can assure honourable members opposite of that. However, I do not go down without a fight. I am not like those Liberal Party and National Party wimps on the other side who have had all these cuts to their electorates: What have they done? What have they said? Not one word. Why do they not get a bit of guts and stand up to this man and fight? Just imagine if the Labor Party had done this. What have they done? Nothing. There is not one Victorian in here now from the Liberal Party or the National Party who has enough guts to get up and have a go at the Premier of Victoria. Why do they not get up and have a go? Some of us on this side will, and I assure honourable members opposite that we will continue to have a go while they cannot do it. We will let their electorates know exactly how they fought against all these cuts to their schools and railways and all the imposts that Jeffrey has put on-the water and land taxes, et cetera. (Time expired) Sugar Industry",101
202,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to say a few words this evening. There is a proposed takeover of two of the big sugar mills in Far North Queensland by Tate and Lyle. I strongly urge the people in those electorates, the cooperative farmers who own those mills at the present moment, not to sell out their interests to the overseas company Tate and Lyle. This is not because I have anything particularly against Tate and Lyle, to his but very heavy investment has been put into those mills, particularly the Tully mill. The net result has been that the Tully mill, as the farm production expands, will be working on economies of scale that would yield very significant profits in the future, I would think. Those profits will not go to the farmers there at the present moment; they will go to the new owner, Tate and Lyle. To sell out at a time when, in the case of the Tully mill, throughput is not meeting the dramatic increase in capacity, would not be a very sensible or smart thing to do. Tate and Lyle is a European company. It would know that there is no way that Europe can sustain the ridiculously high protection and subsidisation levels that exist in the sugar industry at the present time. The last figures I saw, which were in a report to the President of the United States, showed that there was a subsidy level of 193 per cent. If it cannot sustain those ridiculously high protection levels, the miller of the future will be able to take advantage of a vastly increased price for sugar on the world market, just as the corrupt price of Europe dominates the world price at the present time. While deregulation is the policy of the government on this industry, as it is on everything, I regret to say that it is probably the position of honourable members on this side of the House as well, and when deregulation occurs the mills will be reduced to a monopolistic position. The mills will then have a single buyer to which the many hundreds of farmers can sell in a particular area. Because sugar is a very heavy product, farmers cannot simply put it in the back of a truck and take it to mill up the road. Deregulation imposes upon the industry a monopolistic pricing mechanism and it astounds me that people in this place can seriously propose a position that would leave almost the entire industry in an monopolistic situation. Yet that is what is being proposed. If that situation does arise, this company-I ag-in eI?.phasise that I am not in any way being cntlcal of Tate and Lyle-would be in a position to take advantage of any price movements in the markets and it would work tremendously in its favour. If the subsidisation ceases in Europe and the price of sugar goes up, as it inevitably must-Europe would be in a better position to judge this than Australin is-and if there is a monopolistic position in the pricing mechanism in Australia, there is absolutely no pressure upon them to pass on any of that increase in price to the farmers themselves. This would be the situation if they came in and took over those companies. I do not suppose this means a lot to the business or marketing side of things but, undoubtedly, there will be mill closures in that area. There are presently four mills serving that area. There has been a significant cutback in the number of mills in Mackay. Even in the area that I am talking about, the greater Innisfail region, including Tully and Babinda, there have been mill closures and it is mooted that further mills will close. All I can say to those who believe that bigger is better is that one of the smallest mills in Queensland, the Mossman mill, is also the most profitable. So bigger is not always better. As for those people who will lose their livelihood and see their future go down the drain when yet another industry collapses, all I can say is that they will not be very happy. Whilst that is not an appeal to the farmers, it most certainly is an appeal to the greater Innisfail region to hold with the cooperative and statutory marketing arrangements which have made this such a successful industry over such a long period. Until the coming of coal, it was the mainstay of the Queensland economy as it is now, and as it will be so long as we proceed with sensible policies instead of the stupid policies that have been proceeded with by this House in the past. (TIme expired) Victoria: Flooding Correspondence: Leaking",102
203,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"MCEwen) (11.28 p.m.)There are two matters which, in the brief time allocated for this debate, I wish to raise with the House tonight. I am pleased that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is in the chamber because I would not have raised this issue unless he was here. The matter concerns allegations by the honourable member that I read in the newspaper that during the recent disastrous floods Victoria unemployed people did not respond and were notable by their absence from working on levies and other flood alleviation work. Let me say that that is an outrageous allegation. I trust that when he gets the chance the honourable member will stand up in this place and explain what he meant by it. The simple fact is that the rural newspaper the Weekly Times last week published photographs of unemployed people working on the floods in the Benalla region. That is not an uncommon occurrence. The regional newspapers in Victoria all report that unemployed people voluntarily, without being asked, like all decent Australians in a community situation, went out and worked in support by sandbagging and by cleaning up shops in Benalla. They did what any decent person would do-they worked. To read in the newspaper that the Leader of the National Party has had the indecency to attack unemployed people for being bludgers-that is what he called them-and not working is frankly an absolute insult to AustralIans who always work in community groups during times of crisis. Should the honourable member have a chance to explain himself, I hope he will do so. If not, he should apologise, because he was wrong. The other matter which I wish to address concerns a report today in both the Melbourne Age and the Australian. Me Burdekin, the Human Rights Commissioner, expressed great concern that a letter written to him by the state Minister for Health Services in Victoria, the Hon. Marie Tehan, was leaked to a newspaper and publicly reported before he had received that letter. That is pretty outrageous when we stop to think about it. It is not even common decency or good old-fashioned manners. One might say that it might be a one-off situation, but I can inform the House that this is the way the member of parliament in Victoria operates. The same thing has also happened to me. There is no common decency, no plain, old-fashioned manners and no courtesies in dealings with Victorian Liberal Party members of parliament. They operate in a total vacuum when it comes to decency. In my experience, as it has been Mr Burdekin's experience, you get a letter from the honourable lady expressing a particular matter and, at the same time, you pick up a local newspaper and there on the front page is a copy of the letter. That is the way members of the Liberal Party in Victoria operate. They have no common manners and no deCency whatsoever. This is the way the Liberals in Victoria are now operating. I might - a bit old-fashioned. I might even be a bit conservative. I do not care whether I am writing to a state or federal Liberal or National, but I was brought up in such a way that when I put anything in writing it is a matter of correspondence between me and the person I write to. It is not a matter which one then runs out with to shove onto the front pages of newspapers before the letter is even received. Mr Katter-This is good.",103
204,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"This is good. There we go-this is good, this is terrific. That is the attitude of those opposite. Common decency and common courtesies do not matter to them. They just do not care. So we have the answer: all of Australia now knows that that is the way those opposite are prepared to do busi-' ness. I thank' the honourable member for Kennedy for his interjection. We now know that the National Party is not only schizophrenic but also does not support common, old-fashioned manners and common decency. Thank you very much! I express those concerns in the hope that, by raising the matter, some common decency, some common, plain, old-fashioned manners, begin to operate in the Victorian government and that the Minister for Health Services in that state, the Hon. Marie Tehan, learns to operate with some degree of decency and some degree of plain, old-fashioned sense and good manners.",104
205,Mr TIM FISCHER,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a brief personal explanation.",104
206,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,104
207,Mr TIM FISCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes. I claim to have been misrepresented by the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) in his recent comments. I acknowledge fully that many unemployed people responded to the flood problems in north-east Victoria and southern New South Wales. I salute the community spirit in so many of those centres. I explain to the House that I did receive some reports in relation to some unemployed people who did not, when approached, respond to the call for a need in a particular circumstance. Mr Cleeland-You didn't check it out, did you?",104
208,Mr TIM FISCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"I did check it out, and that was the exact comment I made at the time. I again salute the community spirit of so many communities along the Murray valley who are still doing battle with the floods tonight. Banking: Yarraman",104
209,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I take this opportunity to draw to the attention of honourable members the plight of a country community in the electorate of Fisher which, like so many others, faces the threat of being abandoned. Yarraman differs from many other similar areas, in that it has enjoyed a period of growth, a mini-boom of sorts, despite the continuing tragedy in much of rural Australia. Local people are, however, about to lose their only full banking facility and, therefore, are naturally concerned for the future of the town. The Westpac Banking Corporation has notified its Yarraman customers that after decades of service it plans to shut up shop. It is pulling the plug on Yarraman, claiming that in the long term its branch would not be financially viable. Here we have a situation where a regional community of 1,500 people serviced by 59 businesses is being abandoned by our oldest bank. The Yarraman branch of Westpac, with more than 1,000 accounts on its books, is apparently in the black. It is paying its way. Its community is growing. Businesses are surviving, as instanced by the supermarket turnover increasing at 15 per cent a year. What is the real reason why, during a period of growth, Yarraman's future is being struck a blow? I attended a large public meeting in the town last week, which was called to protest against Westpac's shabby treatment ,of local people. More than 300 residents from all walks of life were present on short notice. These were people worried about the future of their area and local businesses. The 59 businesses in Yarraman will be forced to find up to an extra hour each day to travel to the nearest adjacent banking facilities. Labor's fuel tax increases would add further to the financial burden. Opposition members-Hear, hear!",104
210,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Opposition members are quite correct and I thank them for their support. Business must suffer as locals leave town to complete financial transactions and other business elsewhere. An action group has been formed to attempt to attract another bank. The president of the group is Peter Smith, the secretary is Helen Budgen, the treasurer is Cynthia Malary and the members are Graham Brooks, Ian Small, Mike Newman, Louise Trevena, Bill Hansen, Bev Curley, Carla Cook and Darryl Lotto. A petition is also circulating which calls on Westpac to reconsider its decision to abandon Yarraman. I commend Yarraman residents on their actions. Local residents feel betrayed by Westpac. Yarraman's future will suffer in the cause of Westpac's program of rationalisation. Apparently, Westpac in Yarraman is making money, but not enough money to be financially viable in the long term. Rural Australia has suffered. To survive it needs, where possible, the backing of banks and government. The people of Yarraman do not deserve to be abandoned. The rural crisis is worsening. The net value of farm production is expected to plummet this year. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has predicted that the net value of farm production will fall by $954 million to just $1,728 million this year, compared with $2,682 million in 199293. Despite all this, until now Yarraman, part of Queensland's history since 1898, has managed to hold its own against the odds. Its prosperity is threatened by Westpac's decision to close. I call on the bank to reconsider its plan to abandon the Yarraman community, which is. an important part of rural Australia and the electorate of Fisher. Banking",105
211,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I follow on the same theme of banks. It is good that I will get some National Party and Liberal Party support on this matter. I intend to press the government for continued exemptions to credit unions which were blanked out in the budget. I strongly support credit unions because the banks are ripping us off with their collusive market behaviour. The margins the banks are making on home loans are higher now than in recent times-since well before 1970-and the margins on commercial loans are also higher than they have been traditionally. The housing loan margin between the commercial bank bill rate, which is five per cent-the bank's de facto cost of money-and the housing rate which is 8.75 per cent, is almost four per cent. This margin has been too high since 1992. When we look at housing policy,superannuation policy and the ability of mature Australians to be able to gain a fair return for their cash assets, perhaps we should bypass the banks and allow home borrowers to borrow from our self-funded retirees, superannuants and pensioners. I am sure that they will get a better deal and there will be a lot less greed. The commercial margin has been around four per cent also, but it has been high for far longer-since 1990 in fact. This is the minimum margin for the biggest and safest corporate borrowers. Small business and farmers are paying at least one per cent more as a risk premium. The historical margin has been two per cent for housing, which is a low risk, long-term, appreciating investment for the banks. The commercial margin is historically between two per cent and three per cent. The bank margins were publicly attacked by Dr Frank Gelber at a recent economic conference, before a crowd of about 300 representatives of major Australian and overseas companies. Dr Gelber is Chief Economist for BIS Shrapnel, the well-known and respected economic and property forecasting company. Dr Gelber said that too high bank margins were frustrating the emergence of the housing and business markets from recession. Let us be frank; the banks made outrageous decisions in the 1980s and were burned badly for their irresponsible decisions. Now they are attempting to recover their losses by ripping out the guts of the rest of Australia. A representative of BIS Shrapnel, concerning the banks, said: ... have a very profitable activity that ·is enabling them to claw back previous losses associated with non-performing loans. On the other hand, we see these high rates as one of the major factors impeding investment spending . . . we argue that the banks should accept the consequences of past decisions and get on with the job of competing for market share. The honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) has led the charge to reinstate the preferential treatment for credit unions. To the extent that competition by credit unions will keep these immoral organisations honest, I support him completely. A bloke by the name of Lang, in New South Wales, brought in a moratorium act. By doing that, Jack saved my grandparents' family home. The bottom line is that we should be looking at re-establishing a moratorium act for farms, small businesses and houses. We cannot trust our banking community.",105
212,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,Opposition members interjecting,106
213,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Unfortunately, the banks have been supported by honourable members opposite who are now reacting to what I am saying. I suggest they examine their consciences and do something for rural Australia, the poor farmers who have had their properties ripped from underneath them and the other Australians who have had their houses ripped away from them. Their colleagues. in New South Wales delivered HomeFund, which basically showed no compassion. It took away the birth right of so many people. APJ Anand",106
214,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"I draw the attention of the House to a cavalier and avoidable circumstance in my electorate, which is living proof that the ships of shame sail on. I refer to the Indian-registered vessel, the APJ Anand, which berthed at Gladstone on the central Queensland coast on 30 September, carrying a load of feed barley which originated in Albany, Western Australia. Within hours of docking, the ship was subjected to an Australian Maritime Safety Authority inspection, resulting in the ship being impounded. It later led to over 120 deficiencies being identified. They included structural problems, such as wastage and corrosion; abysmally poor crew living quarters; and substandard lifesaving equipment. It would appear that the vendor, WA Grain Pool, was misled regarding the vessel's seaworthiness, despite that company being charged a price which 'was in keeping with the Lloyds 100A-l classification'. The vessel's unloading equipment was in such appalling condition that over $80,000 had to be spent to rectify problems with derricks, winches and so on, to allow the unloading of the ship in Gladstone. As I speak, the unloading goes on; and will go on for another week. The vessel's generators required on-wharf supplementation. The vessel was so underpowered that its capacity, when the ship was being loaded, was inadequate to light the ship's living quarters. The ship's crew were seen to be using hurricane-type lanterns in their quarters. The ship's despondent owners, Pacific Rim Shipping Pty Ltd, are based in Melbourne. I am disturbed at the condition of the vessel, not just for its own sake and because of the subhuman conditions under which the crew was found to live, but because it was operating in this condition in southern Great Barrier Reef waters. Even more disturbing was the fact that the APJ Anand was responsible for an oily bilge spill at Albany, which required that city's port authority to undertake containment and dispersal measures.· With this track record it was off to Gladstone. I understand that it planned to go even further into the Great Barrier Reef waters of Mackay. It has also come to my attention that Pacific Rim Shipping Pty Ltd has in its fleet another vessel of doubtful credentials, the Marine Blue. This ship recently visited Mackay with a load of magnetite from Chile. In Mackay, again on the doorstep of the Barrier Reef, repairs had to be made to the ship's chain locker which had been nooded through a crack in the hull. The ship's pumps were faulty and it had to undertake repairs to lifesaving and firefighting equipment and to crew facilities. We do not allow maniacs on our roads. We would not allow a semitrailer carrying freight to run on balding tyres, spew out fuel and drive with reckless disregard for life and the environment. The principle should be no less so for vessels that ply the highways of the sea. The degree of responsibility rests with the nag states, the owners, the classification societies, the agents, the charterers, the insurance providers and the port and maritime authorities. In Gladstone last week, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who is a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, was denied access to the vessel. While I understand that he will probably wish to speak on this matter, I will not steal his thunder. I find his treatment a slight on that committee and, by inference, a slight on this House. The conduct and condition of the APJ Anand is unacceptable in terms of coastal shipping; it is unacceptable in terms of its duty of care to its crew; it is unacceptable in terms of the slight to the stevedores and, indeed, the people of Gladstone; and it is certainly unacceptable in terms of the potential danger that it poses to the Great Barrier Reef. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.46 p.m. NA NA Replacement of Sealant Joints in Parliament House",106

Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The Prime Minister approved the payment of $300,000 to the Central Land Council (matched by ATSIC) for the purpose of facilitating consultation with and among Aboriginal people on native title issues. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. In August 1993, the Board of ATSIC Commissioners approved a further sum of $2.468 million for the Native Title Claims program for 1993/94. At its September meeting, the Board considered applications and made recommendations regarding the distribution of these funds to Aboriginal organisations, subject to formal ATSIC grant procedures. As these procedures have not yet been finalised, no payments have been made to date. Greenhouse Emissions: Research Funding (Question No. 237)",113
240,Mr EVANS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: (1) What funding is available for research and development relating to equipment which reduces harmful greenhouse emissions. (2) Would the Government support an Australian company researching the reduction of greenhouse emissions; if so, by what means.",114
241,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No specific funding for research and development relating to greenhouse emissions is provided through the Industry, Technology and Regional Development portfolio. However, such research may be eligible for support under the Industry Innovation Program if it has commercial merit. Schemes operating under the Industry Innovation Program include the 150% tax concession for research and development, discretionary grants, and generic technology grants. In addition to this funding support which is available to both companies and research organisations, the CSIRO undertakes an amount of research relating to greenhouse emissions. This research is often supported by other agencies, eg, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, and carried out in collaboration with industry partners. In addition to this general research support, companies installing equipment to reduce greenhouse emissions may be eligible for a tax deduction as a result of changes made to the Tax Act in 1992. Under these changes deductions for certain environment protection expenditure may be allowed when that expenditure is related to income producing activity. (2) The Industry, Technology and Regional Development portfolio does not have specific funding for companies researching the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. However, as stated in the response to the first part of the question,.such· a company may be eligible for support under the Industry Innovation Program.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission: Regional Office (Question No. 267)",116
246,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: Did the accountants Walter and Turnbull conduct a special investigation of a regional office of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; if so, (a) for what reasons and (b) what were the results. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as folIows: At the request of ATSIC, The Office of Evaluation and Audit engaged Walter & Turnbull, Chartered Accountants, to conduct three (3) special investigations of regional office activities, as follows: 1. West Kimberley Regional Office 2. West Kimberley Regional Office 3. Dubbo Regional Office (a) The reasons for the engagements were: 1. To assess the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the management and operations of consultants by West Kimberley Regional Office (including Broome Sub-Office) in light of allegations of non-compliance and favouritism in the engagement process. 2. To assess the quality, efficiency and effectiveorganisations; ness of the tendering process associated with the award of a specific construction contract administered by the West Kimberley Regional Office and Broome Sub-Office. 3. To assess the Commission's administration and management of grants to Dennewan Aboriginal Housing Company located at Coonamble, NSW and serviced by ATSIC's Dubbo Regional Office. (b) The results of the investigations were: 1. A serious lack of compliance with the prescribed procedures for the engagement, management and operations of consultants by the offices, a movement of work from one group of firms to other firms and a serious risk to the Commission of improper practice due to conflict of interest and relationships involved. The Regional Manager has been formally counselled by the Chief Executive Officer in relation the inappropriate way in which he allowed the engagement of consultants to be handled in the West Kimberley Regional Office. Additionally, the Commission has provided training for consultancy management and stressed to all key managers the requirement to strictly adhere to ATSIC's procedures in respect to the engagement of consultants. 2. There was no solid evidence of the contract being premeditated;. there was a high level of speculation and hearsay involved by other parties expected to corroborate allegations; allegations of nepotism appeared to be unfounded; ATSIC staff acted responsibly and in the interest of the communities; the process used by the consultant to control the tendering process was unsatisfactory; and ATSIC should have expanded their recommendation to the communities to include some other matters raised by the consultant. It was the conclusion of the report that no further action was warranted in relation to the allegations unless further evidence was forthcoming. Additionally, it was recommended that independent expert technical advice be sought as to which of two proposals best meets the needs of the communities and that action be taken as soon as possible to minimise the delay in the provision of water sources to the communities involved. Subsequently, ATSIC engaged the Department of Administrative Services to provide independent technical advice as to which proposals best met the needs of the communities. 3. The previous management of the Regional Office has administered and managed grants to the Company poorly over the years ending 30 June 1991, 1992, and 1993; there is a need to develop policy and procedures governing the instigation, conduct and reporting of investigations of funded a direct investigation of the Company should have been undertaken as a dual action to the securing of titles of the properties of the Company; a liquidator should be appointed to wind up the affairs of the Company as agreed to by the Company; additional Regional Office staff resources and funding for investigations need to be considered; and noted members of Aboriginal Corporations need education as to their rights under Corporations Law and Common Law. Additional resources have been provided to the Regional Office to assist in addressing the identified issues. The Commission has initiated action to place caveats over all of the identified properties. The organisation itself, Dennewan Ltd is the only body who can initiate action to proceed to volun-ry liquidation. The Minister has written to the Attomey General seeking action to protect the interest of members, including the appointment of an administrator and ensuring that Dennewan's Directors are aware of their responsibilities. The Chairperson of ATSIC has written to the Australian Securities Commission in similar terms. The Commission is considering a strategy to provide ongoing support to Regional Offices. Free Syringes (Question No. 277)",116
247,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: . (1) Are drug addicts supplied syringes free of charge to prevent the spread of diseases such as the HIV virus. (2) Are sufferers of health problems, such as diabetics, supplied syringes free of charge; if not, why not. (3) Does the provision of free syringes to one group but not another represent discrimination; if so, will the minister remove it.",117
248,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) No. People with diabetes requiring the administration of insulin obtain subsidised syringes through the National Diabetic Supplies Scheme (NDSS). Currently the program provides syringes at a subsidised price of $5.00 per 100 syringes to pensioners or any other person entitled to receive free or concessional pharmaceutical benefits. All other people pay a contribution of $8.00 per 100 syringes supplied. The application of a patient co-payment for the supply of syringes is consistent with the principle under which people receiving benefits through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) are required to contribute towards the cost of those benefits. This program was introduced by the Labor Government in 1987 for the purpose of providing financial assistance to diabetes sufferers who previously had been required to meet the full retail cost of syringes, in some instances as much as $40.00 per 100, with no Government assistance whatsoever. Since 1987 the Federal Government has outlayed over $56 million on the NDSS all of which has been for the direct financial benefit of diabetes sufferers. Commonwealth Government subsidies through the PBS and the NDSS for insulins, blood monitoring reagents and syringes currently average in excess of $900.00 per annum for each person who uses insulin. These are clearly identifiable subsidies that relate specifically to the treatment of diabetes and are separate from additional subsidies for medical and or hospital treatment provided through the Medicare program or the full range of essential medications provided through the PBS. (3) The provision of free syringes for drug users poes not discriminate unfairly against persons with diabetes. It is not appropriate to seek to draw parallels between two programs that are intended· to fulfil entirely different and unrelated needs. The NDSS is a program which was implemented as a means of providing direct financial support to people with diabetes and along with the PBS is clearly meeting that need. The provision of free syringes to injecting drug users on the other hand is an integral part of a public health strategy directed at limiting the spread of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and should not be seen as a program aimed at providing financial assistance to the users of illicit drugs. Sharing contaminated needles is a major factor contributing to the spread of HIV infection amongst injecting drug users as demonstrated dramatically in a number of other countries; infected injecting drug users can then transmit the virus to their sexual partners and children. Free and easily accessible syringes, along with education about HIV, discourage needle sharing thereby minimising the spread of the virus to the wider community. Roads: Black Spots Programs (Question No. 280) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: Has the evaluation of the Black Spots Program been completed; if so, when will the minister release the details; if not, when will it be completed. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: . It is expected that the overall evaluation of the Black Spot Program by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics will be completed in 1994. However, a pilot study of a sample of 51 sites undertaken by the Bureau has recently been completed. Results of this study are currently being printed. I will ensure that the honourable member is provided with a copy of it as soon as it is printed. Triple J Service (Question No. 291) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 19 August 1993: (1) What is the total cost to the Commonwealth of ABC's Triple J service. (2) What was the cost for each State of extending the Triple J service to regional areas in that State. (3) Was the decision to extend the Triple J service to each regional area based on audience surveys; if not, on what basis was the decision made; if so, (a) on what surveys and (b) are the surveys available to the publ.ic. (4) Was the decision to extend the service a policy measure announced during the campaign for the federal election in March 1993; if so, is it customary for the Government to intervene selectively in the ABC's broadcast and programming priorities. (5) Did the Government inform the ABC that it had decided to expand the service to rural regions; if so, what reasons did it provide for the decision. (6) Did the ABC recommend the expansion of the service or provide any input to the decision making process; if so, what was the substance of the recommendation of input. (7) Has the ABC noted any areas in rural regions where the reception of AM and FM transmissions is restricted. (8) Has the shift of ABC programming from AM to FM frequencies limited or stopped reception of broadcasts in any regions; if so, is he able to provide information on which regions are affected and how they are affected. State NA NA NA NA NA NA NO-THERN AUSTRALIA * costs for a full year of operation (3) The decision to extend Triple J followed extensive direct representations to Government from many areas over the period since Triple J commenced. The areas nominated for the extension of Triple J were selected on population size, based on 1991 census figures. The extension program includes service areas with a population greater than 20,000. (4) The Government made a policy decision to extend Triple J. The Prime Minister announced the Government's intention to extend Triple J on 24 February 1993 and the decision was confirmed in the 1993/94 Budget announcement. (9)· What is the average cost of providing an additional transmitter to improve reception for (a) AM and (b) FM in areas with poor reception. (to) Was the option of using available resources to strengthen reception of ·existing programming instead of expanding the range of programs, such as the expansion of the Triple J service, subjected to cost-benefit analysis. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the National Transmission Agency is as follows: (1) For 1992/93 the ABC estimated that the direct production cost for operating Triple J was $3 million. The NTA has advised that the average annual operating cost (including power and maintenance costs) of each Triple J site is $65,000. Triple J is currently operating at 9 sites and services will be extended to a further 44 sites over the next three years. (2) The Government will provide a total of $19.2m to the NTA over the period 1993/941996/97 for the capital cost of extending Triple J to a further 44 regional areas and for the operational costs of progressively extending services over this period. The costs of the extension program in each State when all services are operational are set out below. Capital costs *Running costs pa $ million $ million 4.0 0.975 2.6 0.585 2.5 0.650 1.05 0.195 0.3 0.065 1.55 0.325 0.1 0.065 The Government is responsible for decisions relating to the funding of new national broadcasting services or extensions of transmission coverage of existing services. The ABC is responsible for determining programming to be provided on each of its services. (5) The Government advised the ABC formally on 16 August 1993 that it had agreed in the 199394 Budget to the extension of Triple 1. It did not provide reasons for the decision. (6) The ABC was aware of proposals by the Government to extend Triple J to regional areas and supported them. The ABC was also consulted concerning the order of provision of new transmistelevision). sion facilities. (7) Some 98 % of the population has access to terrestrial transmisSion of at least one ABC radio service (the remainder can access satellite services through HACBSS receivers). Within the normal coverage area of an AM or FM transmission, reception may vary according to distance from the transmission site, topography, prevailing weather conditions or the nature and location of individual reception equipment. There is provision within the NTA's Capital Works Program to provide transmisian sion facilities where reception problems are to affect significant numbers of people and there a cost-effective means of addressing (8) In providing program feeds for new radio transmissions, introduced as part of the Second Regional Radio Network project, the ABC has transferred existing Regional Radio services in published. some areas from AM transmission facilities to new FM transmission facilities, and introduced Radio National services on AM. I am advised that as result of such a change some areas of north east Gippsland have lost their fortuitous reception of ABC Regional Radio station 301 as the rugged topography of the area is not conducive to FM services. To remedy this situation, I understand that the ABC has transferred the Regional Service in East Gippsland back to an transmitter for a trial period. (9) The cost of transmission facilities varies significantly depending upon factors such as area to be covered and availability of sites, roads, power and signal input. Because of population and/or topographical difficulties in areas currently receiving poor reception, several facilities may be required to achieve improved reception residents in a given area. In the case of north east Gippsland, the NTA advised that the cost of providing: facility would be around $2 million and (b) several FM facilities would be required each costing between $100,000 and $250,000 resulting in estimated total cost of $1-2 million. The latter solution would that all listeners would be able to receive ABC Regional Radio. (10) The Government provides funds to the NTA cations: to enable both the upgrade and extension of the signal coverage of national broadcasting services. Priorities are generally determined according population of service areas. The Second Regional Radio Network (SRRN) Program has addressed the iss1.!e of coverage of both ABC Regional Radio and Radio the end of 1995-96 some 98 % of the population will have access by terrestrial transmission to at least two ABC radio services (as well as ABC To date some $49.2 million has been spent on transmission facilities under the SRRN.
