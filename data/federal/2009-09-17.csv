2,Mr BOWEN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Prospect-Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services) (9.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to give effect to the increased Medicare compliance audits initiative which was announced in the 2008-09 budget. Expenditure on the Medicare scheme was over $14 billion in 2008-09 and has grown by more than $1 billion per annum over the last two years. Compliance audits are conducted to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent appropriately. At present, many practitioners voluntarily cooperate with Medicare Australia during a compliance audit. However, on average 20 per cent of practitioners either do not respond to or refuse to cooperate with a request for documents. When this occurs Medicare Australia does not have the authority to require the production of relevant documents, and cannot confirm that the Medicare payment is correct. This legislation is intended to address that deficiency. The government has worked closely with stakeholders, including the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Australian Medical Association, key medical colleges and the Consumers Health Forum to balance the public interest in ensuring the integrity of public revenue expended on Medicare services with the privacy concerns. Key stakeholders were consulted and given the opportunity to comment during 2008 and in the first half of 2009. This process included the release of an exposure draft and privacy impact assessment, as well as referral of the compliance audits initiative to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into Medicare compliance audits recommended that regulations to ensure that patient clinical records are only required to be accessed where necessary during a compliance audit should be developed. The government has accepted the substance of the recommendation. However given the concerns expressed during the hearing it is more appropriate to address this in the primary legislation. Therefore the bill will provide for significant involvement by medical practitioners employed by Medicare Australia in the compliance audit process. In response to the stakeholder feedback and Senate committee recommendations, the government has amended the bill to include significant involvement by medical practitioners employed by Medicare Australia in the compliance audit process. This will mean that Medicare Australia will have employees who are medical practitioners involved in every compliance audit. This bill will enable the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Medicare Australia to give a notice requiring the production of documents to a practitioner, or another person who has custody, control or possession of the documents, to substantiate whether a Medicare benefit paid in respect of a service should have been paid. However before a notice to produce documents can be given to a person the CEO must fulfil several conditions: - Firstly, the CEO must have a reasonable concern that the Medicare benefit paid in respect of a service may exceed the amount that should have been paid. This means that Medicare Australia cannot conduct random compliance audits. A reasonable concern may be related to a particular practitioner, a group of practitioners or a particular service or groups of services. For example, the use of a particular Medicare item may have grown so significantly or unexpectedly that the CEO can have a reasonable concern about the provision of any service associated with that item number. The CEO may also have a concern about a professional service if it has been provided by a person who is a particular type of practitioner and the CEO has a concern about that specific group of practitioners. The compliance audits conducted by Medicare Australia under the provisions in this bill will be limited to seeking to confirm whether a Medicare benefit paid in respect of a service exceeded the amount that should have been paid. This means that the audit will seek to establish that the elements of a particular service, which are outlined in the Medicare Benefits Schedule and are relevant to the accuracy of the payment, were performed. For example, if a Medicare benefit is only payable for a service when a specific test is undertaken, Medicare Australia will ask the practitioner to produce documents that demonstrate that the test was performed. Medicare Australia's compliance audits will not review matters relating to clinical decision making, the clinical relevance of the service provided to the patient or professional conduct. This means that the elements of a service which are not factual but rely on the clinical judgement of a practitioner will not be reviewed during a compliance audit. For example, one element which must be completed in order for a Medicare benefit to be paid for some Medicare services is the requirement for practitioners to undertake an exhaustive patient history. However the judgment about what constitutes an ‘exhaustive history' is clinical rather than a matter of fact. Therefore this element of the service would not be in scope during a compliance audit. - Secondly, the CEO must take advice from a medical practitioner employed by Medicare Australia on potential sensitivities associated with the kinds of documents a practitioner may need to provide to substantiate the service. - Thirdly, the CEO must give the person a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily respond to an audit request. This means that practitioners who choose to voluntarily tell Medicare Australia that they have received a benefit that exceeds the amount they should have been paid will still benefit from discounts on any financial penalty that may apply. Only when these three conditions are met can the CEO serve a notice requiring a person to produce documents to substantiate a Medicare benefit paid in respect of a service. The bill does not introduce any recordkeeping requirements. It will be up to the person who receives the notice to decide what documents they have available to substantiate the service. The notice to produce documents must include a statement that documents containing clinical details do not have to be produced unless these are necessary to substantiate the service. However the bill includes a provision that a person does not have to produce documents containing clinical details to anyone who is not a medical practitioner employed by Medicare Australia. This means that practitioners can choose to supply documents containing clinical details to other medical practitioners employed by Medicare Australia rather than an administrative officer. As a result the practitioner who provided the Medicare service will decide whether documents containing clinical details need to be provided to Medicare Australia, and if so, who will receive those documents. Medicare Australia is also working with relevant stakeholders, including the Australian Medical Association, to develop guidelines for practitioners setting out the kinds information that will substantiate particular services or groups of services. These guidelines will be publicly available and will emphasise that clinical information is not to be provided unless it is absolutely necessary to substantiate the service. The provisions in this bill do not commence until 1 January 2010 in order to allow for the development and publication of these guidelines. The bill provides protection for practitioners by providing that the documents and information about particular services provided in response to a notice cannot be used as the basis for a referral to Professional vices Review or for most criminal and civil proceedings. This means that information relating to identified services produced in response to a notice to produce documents will not be able to be used in any other proceedings, except for those relating to false and misleading statements under the Health Insurance Act 1973. The bill ensures that practitioners will be notified of the outcome of an audit in which they were involved. Where a practitioner is found to owe a debt to the Commonwealth, the bill also introduces a requirement that they be given 28 days in which to seek internal review of the decision before a debt notice is issued. At present, where the amount paid in respect of the service cannot be substantiated, the practitioner is required to repay the amount. This will continue to occur. In addition, this bill provides that a practitioner who cannot substantiate the amount paid in respect of a service may also be liable for a financial administrative penalty. The financial penalty is intended to encourage practitioners to itemise Medicare services correctly. A base penalty amount of 20 per cent will of be applied to debts in excess of $2,500 or a higher amount if specified in regulations. An analysis of Medicare Australia data indicates that this threshold reflects the point at which mistaken claims may become routine, or reflective of poor administration or decision making. In 2008-09, only 22 per cent of practitioners who were found to have made incorrect claims were asked to make repayments of more than $2,500. The $2,500 threshold amount may be increased by regulations. This provides for future adjustments of the threshold to ensure that practitioners are not disadvantaged by incremental increases in the value of the SerMedicare benefit amount paid in respect of services. The bill allows the base penalty amount of 20 per cent to be reduced or increased according to individual circumstances described in the legislation. This encourages self-disclosure and promotes voluntary compliance whilst discouraging recidivism. If a practitioner: - tells Medicare Australia that an incorrect amount has been paid in respect of the service prior to being contacted by the CEO, there is a 100 per cent reduction in the penalty; - tells Medicare Australia that an incorrect amount has been paid in respect of the service before a notice to produce documents is issued, the penalty is reduced by 50 per cent; - tells Medicare Australia that an incorrect amount has been paid in respect of the service after a notice to produce documents has been issued but before completion of the audit, the penalty is reduced by 25 per cent; - does not respond to a notice to produce documents, the full amount of the services identified in the notice becomes repayable and the penalty is increased by 25 per cent; - has been unable to substantiate an amount paid in respect of other services in the previous 24 months and the total they repaid was more than $30,000, the penalty in respect of the current amount which is being recovered is increased by 50 per cent. The bill is not retrospective and will only apply to Medicare services provided after the commencement of the legislation on 1 January 2010. This bill forms part of the government's commitment to responsible economic management and prudent fiscal responsibility. I commend the bill to the House.

Second Reading",17
3,Mr CLARE,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Green Jobs Corps will commence on 1 January 2010, giving up to 10,000 young people the opportunity to develop green skills through 26 weeks of accredited training and work experience. This bill, the Social Security Amendment (National Green Jobs Corps Supplement) Bill 2009, amends the Social Security Act 1991 to allow a training supplement of $41.60 per fortnight to be paid to participants in the program who receive Newstart allowance, youth allowance (other) or the parenting payment. There are important lessons from previous economic downturns which have guided the development of the National Green Jobs Corps and this legislation. In the 1980s and 1990s youth unemployment rose much quicker than the general rate of unemployment. Those young people without skills or qualifications suffered most. During the early 1990s recession, around 40 per cent of early school leavers were not in education or employment six months after leaving school, compared with 12 per cent for those who had completed year 12. Today young people are again the hardest hit. Youth unemployment accounts for over 40 per cent of the increase in unemployment over the last 12 months; many of these young people have not completed high school. That's why in April the Prime Minister announced the policy of ‘Learn or Earn'. This means that young people under the age of 21 without a year 12 or equivalent qualification must be in education or training in order to qualify for youth allowance. In June the government introduced a training supplement of $41.60 a fortnight to recipients of Newstart or the parenting payment who have not completed year 12 or an equivalent qualification but who start an approved course of study or training between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2011. In July the Prime Minister announced the establishment of the National Green Jobs Corp, an environmental training program that will enable young Australians to develop the green skills and experience needed for jobs of the future. It is targeted at the young Australians most vulnerable in the current environmentespecially those who have not obtained a year 12 or equivalent qualification. It will provide work experience and training on projects like: - Bush regeneration - Erosion control - Developing community information and education projects - Beach and dune rehabilitation - Habitat protection These projects will make environmental improvements now and help develop green skills that will increasingly be needed in the labour market of the future. Participants in the National Green Jobs Corps will undertake work experience and skill development, including 130 hours of accredited training leading to a nationally recognised qualification. To encourage this training-this bill provides for a training supplement of $41.60 per fortnight to be paid to Green Jobs Corps participants who are recipients of Newstart allowance, youth allowance (other) and parenting payment. Young people with a partial capacity to work or young parents will have their hours of participation tailored to their assessed capacity. We know young people are particularly vulnerable in the current economic environment. We know young people who have not completed year 12 or an equivalent are even more vulnerable. That's why we have targeted assistance to these young people through the National Green Jobs Corps. This legislation will assist young people to participate in this program. To gain work experience and training. To build the skills in the jobs of the future. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Southcott) adjourned.

4,Ms ROXON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009 will amend the Private Health Insurance Act 2007. The bill provides for amendments to the act to allow for conditional listing of prostheses on the Commonwealth Prostheses List (“the List”), and allow the Minister for Health and Ageing to make Private Health Insurance (Prostheses) Rules to specify criteria for listing prostheses on the List. These changes will commence on royal assent. Conditional listing Under the act it is currently unclear whether a prosthesis can be conditionally listed where the prosthesis is provided in circumstances where a Medicare benefit is payable. Effectively this means that a surgically implanted device can be listed for general use, or not listed at all. This is problematic because there are circumstances in which a device would be beneficial for some conditions or clinical circumstances, but where it would not be recommended or cost effective for general use. For example, a sponsor has recently applied to list a device that is life-saving, but where it is not cost-effective to grant an unconditional listing of this device. An unconditional listing of the device would require private health insurers to pay benefits for that device regardless of the clinical circumstances in which the product is used. The amendments proposed in the bill would enable the device to be listed on a conditional basis, ensuring patients have access to life-saving treatments in a way that controls the additional costs to private health insurance. With further developments in medical technology there is likely to be a greater need for listing devices on a conditional basis in the future. Criteria for listing devices A number of prostheses on the List have recently been identified as not meeting the current criteria for listing as a prosthesis, example, insulin infusion pumps. An insulin pump is a small, computerised device that delivers insulin constantly under the skin through a plastic tube, removing the need for regular insulin injections. The pump is programmed to give small background doses of insulin continuously throughout the day and night depending on the individual's needs. The rising incidence of type 1 diabetes in children underlines the importance of the Rudd government's decision to subsidise the cost of insulin pumps. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), the incidence of new cases of type 1 diabetes in children is rising at around three per cent a year. There were more than 6,000 new cases in children aged zero-14 years between 2000 and 2006, which equates to more than two new cases each day. The Government now provides a meanstested subsidy of up to $2,500 for insulin pumps for people with type 1 diabetes under the age of 18. Pumps reduce the need for parental supervision in looking after a child with type 1 diabetes. They allow the child to participate in normal activities like school, sport and social functions with less constant monitoring. The insulin pump subsidy complements other government measures assisting people with diabetes. Government funding committed to support people with diabetes is substantial. Last financial year, government expenditure on diabetic products supplied through the National Diabetes Services Scheme exceeded $126 million and expenditure on medicines for diabetes through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, such as insulin, exceeded $300 million. The government is now taking action to ensure privately insured people continue to for have access to insulin pumps. Insulin pumps do not meet the normal criteria for listing of a prostheses on the Commonwealth Prostheses List, which contains private health insurance benefits for medical devices. This is because insulin pumps are not surgically implanted. However, there is clear evidence that insulin pump therapy significantly reduces severe hypoglycaemic episodes and provides major improvements in the control of blood glucose. Effective diabetes control reduces health complications such as kidney failure, amputation, damage to the eyes and vascular problems. Given the prevalence of diabetes, preventing avoidable hospitalisations for these complications makes good business sense for insurers. Access to insulin pumps also offers the best health outcomes and quality of life for many people living with diabetes. I have asked the Prostheses and Devices Committee to develop a new part to the Prostheses List so that health insurers continue to fund insulin pumps and other devices for their members that are clinically effective and cost effective. This new part of the Prostheses List will include certain devices that are not surgically implanted but have an internal part that is integral to their effectiveness and designed to combat a pathological process or modulate a physiological process, or surgically implanted devices that monitor a pathological or physiological process. The amendments proposed in this bill will allow the government to make rules setting out the criteria for listing on this new part of the Prostheses List, based on the recommendations of the Prostheses and Devices Committee. This will ensure clarity and consistency in the treatment of applications for listing on the new part, and ensure costs to private health insurance are controlled. Products will only be listed where they are clinically effective, cost effective, provide significant health benefits to patients and can prevent the need for expensive downstream medical costs. The new criteria will not override any of the current legislative criteria for listing. For example, a device must still be provided to a person as part of an episode of hospital or hospital-substitute treatment. Accordingly, you can see that these changes will deliver significant benefits to consumers and to those who are privately insured seeking to use these and other devices. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. NA (EXTENDED MEDICARE SAFETY NET) BILL 2009 Consideration of Senate Message Consideration resumed from 16 September.

(4) The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House the Parliament by 1 July 2011.",21
5,Ms ROXON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I am very pleased that the opposition, after all of their blustering on this measure, have decided to support what is a sensible and important budget measure. The bill will allow the government to put the extended Medicare safety net onto a sustainable footing into the future. With expenditure increasing 30 per cent in the last year alone, it is obviously an important measure to keep some of those costs under control. The Rudd government's health budget this year was all about reforming our health system, delivering better services to the community, funding new drugs and expanding successful programs and making them fairer and more sustainable in the long term. Unfortunately, the opposition do not seem to have yet made the connection between funding new programs, demanding existing ones are fair, delivering to patients and providing best value for taxpayers' dollars. We know that every taxpayer dollar in health is precious, and the limited funding we have must be targeted to ensure we get not just the biggest bang for our buck but the best bang for our buck. This measure returns almost half a billion dollars-which has been buying Rolls-Royces and all sorts of other extravagances for some very well paid specialists-so that we can invest in health measures that will have benefits to patients. For example, in this year's budget we provided funding for a new cancer drug, Avastin, at the cost of $314 million. We have continued the Herceptin breast cancer drugs for women, at $168 million. We have instigated a new maternity package, providing more choices for women, at $120 million, and a rural health package with incentives of for doctors who work in more remote parts of the country, at $134 million. So it is important that these savings measures can be delivered to allow for this expenditure in health. We are happy to support the amendments; however, I would note that the determination that implements the caps is already a disallowable instrument in parliament, so there is already parliamentary scrutiny. The amendments to this bill will create an additional burden for the parliament, with every annual indexation of the cap having to go through both houses. I am pleased that the opposition has indicated that it will now facilitate the smooth passage of this determination when it is presented to the House, and this will happen after the bill has received royal assent. The government has agreed that a cap on the benefits for the injection of a therapeutic substance into the eye will not be implemented. In recent years there have been significant advances in therapies to treat macular degeneration which can hold dramatic results for patients, including saving sight. I would like to acknowledge the important role that the Macular Degeneration Foundation has played in securing these changes, and I support the amendments before the House.",24
6,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"This has been a long and drawn-out process, unnecessarily so. It shows the fact that there is no direction on health policy under the Rudd government. This is a government that promised so much at the last election, but at their every move they have turned health debate in this country into an absolute farce. There has been backflip after backflip by this minister. Promises have been broken-key election promises-in relation to hospitals and private health in particular. We have been calling on the government for a period of time-in fact, since the budget-to make a series of changes. We took the minister at face value when she mentioned some figures in relation to a number of measures, but it became quickly apparent after speaking to stakeholders that those figures were incorrect and misleading. It was inappropriate for the minister to put a position which the industry clearly had not agreed to. There was, from the industry and from patient groups, a complete denial that the case the minister was putting forward was legitimate. We forced the government into negotiating with a number of parties. This ultimately resulted in outcomes and amendments that this government has been forced to backflip on and ultimately agree with. It was a shameful process. This government introduced changes which had had no consultation. This was a government which said at one stage that they were open and transparent, that this was a new age of government and that they were going to consult more widely. Well, in relation to this bill, that clearly has not happened. Of course, when you do not consult properly as a government-as the Rudd government refuses to and as this health minister refuses to-the obvious consequences come. In relation to IVF, there were some significant changes made by this government. It was a magic pudding exercise in the end, but, nonetheless, we accept the government's advice that the patients can be better off and the doctors can be better off-the government can be no worse off. Language like that is unbecoming to a member of the executive in this chamber, surely, and I would ask the minister to withdraw it.",24
7,The SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,I am not sure,25
8,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I will repeat the word if you like, Mr Speaker, but she knows what she said. It was said in hushed tones. Ms Roxon interjecting",25
9,The SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I did not hear anything. Obviously, in the eyes of the member for Dickson something occurred. I am usually reluctant to ask for the expression to be repeated but I am in no position to make a call on this because I thought things were being relatively quiet.",25
10,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Mr Speaker, if it will help the House, I have three minutes to go and I will accept that you did not hear it. I understand that. The minister has really embarrassed herself in the parliament today but I will leave that to her. What we faced was a situation where this government had arrived at a ‘magic pudding' arrangement. They cannot explain the figures-they have refused to explain the figures. The true figures will be borne out in estimates and over the coming months. We will see what happens in relation to that. There were other measures in relation to the bill. The minister had tried to extend the power she had, which was completely inappropriate given the fact that this minister had proven herself not to be responsible with the use of figures. We had negotiations with the government which forced them into backflipping to agree to a position they put to the Senate. In relation to the injection into the eye-the Lucentis issue-the government has quite falsely claimed that they had any interest in this measure before being forced into it by the opposition. We accepted the advice of the patient group who came to us and said that they had been ignored by the government. We forced the government into a change in relation to that measure. The government can dress it up however they like but in the end this has been yet another backflip by an incompetent health minister and we will fight to make sure that we improve the health outcomes in this country. We will not tolerate this minister misleading the debate. We will continue as an opposition to get good legislation and this has been an improvement. (Time expired)",25
11,The SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The question is that the amendments be agreed to. Before giving the call to the member for New England, I thank him for dealing with his recalcitrant mobile and I understand that he is aware of the need to not have it ring in the chamber.",26
12,Mr WINDSOR,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I do apologise. I was watching the shadow minister in my office and could see the time, so I rushed down and inadvertently still had my phone on. I would like to speak briefly on this. I had intended to ask the minister a question on this issue in question time yesterday, but as questions were truncated earlier I was unable to do so. I am led to believe that, on the issue of macular degeneration, the Lucentis injection treatment has been accepted by the government. I am told that the opposition and other senators represented that view and the government has apparently accepted that. But I think there may still be some concerns in terms of the regulations that still have to be treated by both houses of parliament. I would just like clarification of that, if at all possible, because I think that issue highlights a very significant cause of blindness in our community. If you look at the demographics of what the legislation was attempting to do for the great body of people accessing Medicare and other arrangements, the elderly in particular were a very small portion of that graph. There is no doubt in my mind that, for those people suffering with macular degeneration, the treatment could in fact assist. They may well have found that the additional money they would have to find would have caused them to make a decision not to seek the treatment. The outcome of that, in most cases, would be blindness. So I am pleased to hear what I think I am hearing but, if the minister is able to give some clarification to that, I think many elderly people with that disease-and those people working for them-would be very pleased to hear it.",26
13,Ms ROXON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Yes, I am happy to address that issue. You are right that we have made a change. We have supported suggestions that were put to us by you, the Macular Degeneration Foundation, Vision 2020 and the opposition and have agreed, both in the House and in the Senate, that the determinations will not include any cap on that measure relating to the injection of a substance into an eye which affects Lucentis. What we have done, given requests made by the opposition previously, is table our draft determinations. We are not permitted by the rules of this place to have final determinations until the bill receives royal assent, so that item will no longer be in the final determination; otherwise, the exposure draft that has been provided is exactly as has been provided to and debated in the House. There were concerns and requests by the opposition and others that they be able to look closely at the contents of that determination for the IVF measures and the obstetric measures et cetera. We gave an undertaking that there would not be any changes to that determination other than this one, which is agreed. We accept that there were concerns that it might have unintended consequences. I have to take issue-as will probably not surprise anyone listening to this debatewith some of the quite inaccurate comments being made by the shadow minister. On budget night, when these measures were announced, it was quite expressively identified that as part of this measure consultations would be undertaken, particularly with the sector, to restructure the IVF items. They are a complex range of items. We made quite clear that as part of that budget measure there would need to be a restructuring. The shadow minister opposite can pretend as much as he wants that that is a changed position. He can say ‘backflip' as many times as he likes. In fact, that was exactly what was always intended. That process delivered an outcome that was ultimately accepted by the industry and by consumer groups and I am pleased was finally also accepted by the opposition. The only thing that has been changed since budget night is our agreement to exempt Lucentis. It is not listed as Lucentis; is listed as an injection of a therapeutic stance into the eye but, around here, of course, particularly among nonprofessionals, we have been calling it the ‘Lucentis exemption' and we are happy to agree with that change. But I think it is a bit rich of people, particularly the opposition-and we see this also in a range of other measures so I might as well put it on the record in the House right now-to demand consultation and then to pretend that, because consultation takes time and because through consultation processes we come up with options that work for people, somehow the government is not doing its job properly. I just conducted yesterday with the Prime Minister the 25th consultation on our health reform agenda. Anyone who thinks that we are not consulting on extensive health reforms has just been living in another country for the last six months. On our budget measures you simply cannot have it both ways. For example, with the introduction of nurse practitioner changes where questions have been asked about why the descriptors are not yet available, the descriptors are not yet available because the consultation meetings with doctors, nurses and others who have asked to be involved in drafting those provisions are drafting them. The shadow minister can come in here as many times as he likes, but it will not divert us from pursuing significant reform that was neglected by the previous government. It might be new initiatives like MBS and PBS access for midwives and nurse practitioners or it might be making measures like the Medicare safety net sustainable so that it can continue into the future and so that some of that money that perhaps was being misused-going into the pockets of specialists instead of to patients-can be redirected to better causes. I think this outcome is good. I am happy that this change has delivered some relief to it people who were concerned about the impact subfor macular degeneration, and I welcome the opposition's belated support for this measure. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TEST REVIEW AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 September, on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Dr Stone moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “the House defers consideration of the bill until the following have occurred: (1) the Government redrafts the bill so that it provides a ministerial discretion for those who cannot meet the residency requirements but whose citizenship can be demonstrated to be in the national interest; and (2) the Government redrafts the bill so that it provides a ministerial discretion for awarding citizenship to offshore workers who cannot meet the residency requirements, but who can demonstrate significant hardship or disadvantage.”",26
14,Mr NEUMANN,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Blair) (9.40 am)Yesterday I was making comment on the comments made by the member for Cowan in relation to the Labor Party's position, particularly the Rudd government's position, in relation to border protection and asylum seekers. As I said last evening, what the member for Cowan was saying is simply errant nonsense about the Labor Party in terms of its commitment to border protection and the security of our shores. It goes to show that even amongst some on the back bench opposite there remains a devotion not just to Work Choices but also to the Pacific solution and the inhumane treatment of men, women and children in detention. Not everyone opposite holds that view, but certainly some still remain. It is the climate change sceptics, the Work Choices devotees and now the Pacific solution disciples infesting the back bench of the coalition. The citizenship test was launched on 17 September 2007 by the previous government, allegedly for the primary purpose of ensuring that applicants for citizenship in this country had a basic knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship and that they demonstrated the requisite requirements of the act. It is quite clear that previous government, when it extended the period of time from two years to four years, really had the idea of being a bit more selective, shall I say, when it came to citizenship in this country. This government, the Rudd Labor government, is committed to reducing the unnecessary obstacles to people seeking to become citizens in this country. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, announced on 28 April 2008 an independent review of a number of very prominent and eminent Australians who would look into the test. There was much media commentary in relation to that, about whether people knew Don Bradman's average or what is necessary for people to adhere to in terms of their requisite knowledge of Australia and Australiana. I am comfortable with the test that we are coming up with, with the changes that are in this legislation. I must say that I always have a lump in my throat when I hear people give affirmations or oaths when they become Australian citizens at the many citizenship ceremonies that I attend as the federal member for Blair. When people pledge their loyalty to Australia and its people, the democratic beliefs that we all share, the rights and liberties that we respect and the laws we uphold and obey-it is terrific on those occasions to hear fellow Australians also reciting that pledge, because it is important that all of us, whether we live in Tasmania, the Torres Strait, Palm Beach or Perth, adhere to those democratic beliefs, those rights and those liberties that we respect. The review committee handed down its report in August 2008 which was entitled Moving forward: improving pathways to citizenship. The review committee was formally known as the Australian Citizenship Test Review Committee. The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review the and Other Measures) Bill 2009 before the House today has been examined in detail by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. A report was handed down on 7 September 2009. This legislation takes up a number of the recommendations of the review committee and makes very clear that what we are doing is improving pathways for people to become citizens of this country. This bill amends by way of schedule. Some people, by reason of their physical and mental incapacity, simply are not capable of sitting a citizenship test. These people, and they are few, should not be denied the opportunity to take up citizenship in this country. We want to be a humane, decent and fair society. If we truly believe in social inclusion we should, in all the circumstances, assist those people to become citizens like any one of us in this House. It is appropriate also to ensure that a citizenship test must be completed within a specified period of time. I also think the third amendment in this schedule I am referring to is beneficial and appropriate. The bill provides that to be eligible for citizenship by conferral the applicants who are under 18 years of age must be permanent residents at both the time of the application and the time of the decision. There is a small group of people who will benefit by the changes in this schedule, and they are just and humane changes. I am happy to speak in support of them and to vote in favour of this schedule. The new second schedule also provides assistance to people who want to become Australian citizens who are engaged in certain professions, who are elite athletes and others-many of whom pay taxes, many of whom also represent the green and gold despite the fact that they have been permanent residents of this country. We have benefited in many sports from people coming to this country from overseas, not just in tennis or in ice-skating. I can also think of soccer players, rugby league players and rugby union players. There are countries around the world that have also adopted the same attitude as us. When I look at the England cricket team, I wonder whether they should be speaking Afrikaans there are so many South Africans in that team. We live in a global community. We live in a community where people travel overseas from Australia. About one million Australians live overseas. We are also in a community which believes in multiculturalism, which I believe is appropriate and right, and accepts people from other countries. Last night, I said about six million people have come to this country since World War II and about four million have become Australian citizens. Clearly, many of those people who come to this country accept the democratic beliefs, the rights and the liberties that we respect, and want to become Australian citizens. It is one of the great joys of a federal parliamentarian to see the delight on the faces of young and old at citizenship ceremonies throughout our electorates. I cannot understand the attitude of the member for Murray, who poured scorn on what we are doing in changing the pathway for citizenship for elite athletes and people in specialist professions. I am mystified at the opposition she put forward and the position she has adopted in relation to certain athletes. Why should these people who represent our country at athletics events, in sporting teams around the world and at Olympic Games events be denied that opportunity in their short careers, when we all share such joy at the efforts of Australian athletes and pride in seeing the delight on their faces when they compete on our behalf? I am truly astonished at the member for Murray's attitude in opposing this sort legislation. There are many people who, by virtue of their residence and the fact that their employment takes them overseas, simply cannot satisfy the requirements here. To ensure these people get the opportunity to represent our country and to show the world how open and accessible we are is a very good thing. We also need people from other professions in this country. That is why we have skill shortages. We need people to come here. Whether they are doctors, nurses, accountants or IT experts, we have enjoyed the benefits of a skilled migration program for years. We are also a country that accepts refugees. We adopt a humanitarian approach to people from overseas who are in need, often in desperate circumstances because of poverty, war, pestilence and other travails that they have had to endure. We have a great record historically of ensuring that people with expertise who want to come to this country, take up permanent residence and then go and work perhaps on oil rigs or as airline pilots can do so. It is appropriate, fair and right. It is just plain wrong for people whose work circumstances are often beyond their control to be ineligible for citizenship. We should amend the test to remove these prohibitive residence requirements so that people can travel outside of Australia as part of their employment, still call Australia home and still become Australian citizens. This is good, appropriate legislation. supported by a number of peak sporting bodies in this country, who also are urging the opposition to support this legislation. I urge the member for Murray, the member for Cowan and others to take a more reasonable approach with respect to this legislation so that the pathways to citizenship for the elite athletes who want to represent us and for professionals and other workers can be made easier, ensuring that all of us can enjoy the citizenship that we are so privileged to",28
15,Mr GEORGIOU,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Kooyong) (9.54 am)In 2007, despite widespread and wellinformed criticism, the then government imposed a tough new test on people aspiring to become Australian citizens. Contrary to the propaganda, there had always been a citizenship test in Australia. Until 2007, the test involved a face-to-face assessment of applicants' ability to speak basic English and knowledge of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. By contrast, the new test required literacy, computer skills and knowledge of a wide range of facts about Australian history, geography and other subjects. The demands of this new test exceeded the capacity of many native-born citizens, and I opposed that test within and outside the parliament. The test was overwhelmingly regressive. It turned its back on Australia's tradition of inclusive citizenship. It discriminated not just against people of non-English-speaking background but against all people who have difficulty with literacy, and that is hundreds of thousands of people. It sent a corrosive message to many people-people committed to Australia-that they were not deserving of citizenship if they could not pass the test. Undoubtedly, it prevented many meritorious aspiring citizens from becoming full members of the Australian community. All these backward steps were taken despite any eviIt is dence that the new test was needed. The then Labor opposition waved the legislation through. They made no amendments. They did not vote. They did, however, make the commitment that, if elected, they would establish a review of the citizenship test. Having won power, Labor did so. They established the Australian Citizenship Test Review Committee. This was a high-calibre group. It was chaired by Richard Woolcott, a very distinguished Australian. Other commitshare. tee members were Rechelle Hawkes, Paula Masselos, Julianna Nkrumah, Warren Pearson, Vice Admiral Chris Ritchie and Professor Kim Rubenstein. I do not want to be misunderstood. I thought that this was the best group that could be brought together for this task. It was a pity that from the outset the government tied the committee's hands by declaring the their new computerised citizenship test would remain. This was a significant handicap but, despite it, the Woolcott review's work was quite exemplary. The committee undertook broad and genuine consultation. Its analysis was acute. Its recommendations were substantial and they were enlightened. The report transcended populist politics. It served the best interests of Australia and it reflected the best impulses of the Australian people. Dick Woolcott and his committee found that: The present test is flawed, intimidating to some and discriminatory. It needs substantial reform. The committee sought and found creative ways to return Australian citizenship to its tradition of inclusiveness. The review is a great tribute to its authors. The Citizenship Test Review Committee made 34 recommendations, and I commend the government for adopting a range of them, including focusing the test on the pledge of allegiance; having the resource book rewritten, dividing it into testable and non-testable sections; ending the need to pass mandatory questions; and, at the last moment, broadening the exemption for physical and mental disability. According to the DIAC website, the government fully supported 23 of the recommendations and gave in-principle support to a further four. Leaving aside what ‘in principle' means, on my count this number is incorrect. The government rejected or did not fully support 11 recommendations. My concern is not about errors of arithmetic or about the government's spin-although there is a surfeit of this in the government's response. My fundamental concern is that the government rejected the report's most significant recommendations. It rejected recommendations that would have greatly enhanced the return to inclusive citizenship, and I think that is a matter of great regret. As a cornerstone of its recommendations, the Woolcott review addressed the strong and widespread concern that a computer based test, even if it were substantially reformed, would exclude many people from getting citizenship-people who had been admitted to citizenship under arrangements that had been in place for over half a century. Throughout our post-war history, hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated they made good and often exceptional citizens, yet these people could not have passed the test. The Woolcott review addressed the exclusionist bias of the new test. It did so through its recommendation that we institute ‘earned citizenship'. Earned citizenship recognises the commitment and the valuable contribution made to Australia by migrants over a long period of time. It reflects the belief that a compassionate society should provide a safety net for those who, despite their attempts, are simply unable to pass the test. A number of criteria for earned citizenship were set out in the Woolcott report. These were to be assessed by a citizenship referee appointed by the minister. This recommendation was rejected by the government. Earned citizenship was thrown out without argument and without justification, other than that contained in a single sentence, and I quote: The Government believes this would introduce classes of citizenship. This peremptory dismissal of wellconsidered suggestions of a very able group of people-a group selected by the government itself-is arrogant and its rationale is manifestly false. The truth is that our citizenship law has provided a number of avenues to citizenship. These have been supported by successive governments. No-one has ever suggested that these avenues involved the introduction of classes of citizens-first, second or third. The basic and irreducible fact is that there is only one class of citizenship: Australian citizenship. The fact is that, in addition to the various bases on which people may be eligible for citizenship by descent, section 21 of the Citizenship Act specifies a number of different grounds of eligibility for citizenship by conferral without the test having to be passed. These include a provision for people with a permanent physical or mental incapacity; people who are over 60 or have a hearing, speech or sight impairment; people born to former Australian citizens; people born in Papua; and stateless people. I say again: there may be exemptions but there has only been one class of Australian citizenship. The government arrogantly dismissed the Woolcott review's proposal for a new earned citizenship by claiming that it would introduce classes of citizenship. The government's justification may have been more than flimsy, but now it is a travesty. The government has shown this by its amendments introducing special citizenship provisions for athletes and offshore workers. The minister says that he listened to the request of the Australian Olympic Committee and individual sportspeople to assist them with their special circumstances. Ministers are always to be applauded for listening. Listening is good. What is not good, what is not to be applauded, is the sharpness of the minister's hearing when listening to the concerns about elite athletes contrasted with his profound deafness to the Woolcott review's disinterested and compassionate recommendations. The minister should be condemned for being deaf to the Woolcott review's recommendation that people should be eligible for citizenship because they have made a contribution to Australia and have been independently assessed as being committed to Australia. But it is not just a matter of one rejection; there are multiple rejections. The question is: why has the minister turned a deaf ear to the other very sensible proposals in the Woolcott review? The Woolcott review, in addition to earned citizenship, proposed a distinctive new pathway to citizenship by separating the assessment of basic English from the adequate knowledge of Australia and the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship. Basic knowledge of English would be assessed by interview with a citizenship referee and adequate knowledge of Australia and the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship would be assessed through the completion of a citizen education program in languages other than English. This pathway would be appropriate for residents with low or no literacy but a basic grasp of English orally. Applicants for this pathway might also be literate in other languages but have no experience of formal tests or have limited or no experience with computers. The Woolcott review concluded: The benefit of this pathway is that difficult and often unfamiliar concepts that people need to understand are explained in their preferred language. … … … This positive educational approach will assist and empower prospective citizens to contribute to, and participate in, the community and in Australian society. The government dismissed this out of hand, stating only that ‘the government is committed to having a test in English'. Why did the government not listen to the Woolcott review regarding the pass mark? Having examined the evidence, the Woolcott review recommended that the pass mark be retained at 60 per cent. The government completely dismissed this and it actually increased the pass mark to 75 per cent. The government's justification for this is to ‘maintain the rigour of the test'. The government rejected the proposal from the Woolcott review that, until implementation of the changes were complete, the test questions should be published and that two of the mandatory questions had to be answered correctly. The government rejected this. The Woolcott review recommended that the new test questions should be made publicly available. This was something that Labor had asked for when it was in opposition. In his second reading speech in the debate on the Citizenship Testing Bill 2007, the then Labor spokesman on immigration, Tony Burke, said: I think that, a matter of transparency, the government making the questions available is completely in the interests of citizenship being ess of unifying Australians. It is a logical thing to do … That was also the view of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs enquiring into the citizenship testing bill, which recommended that ‘the proposed citizenship questions be tabled in the parliament'. All these recommendations were curtly dismissed by the government with the retort that: Maintaining the confidentiality of the test questions will ensure the integrity and rigour of the test is not diminished. This was despite the findings of the Woolcott review that publishing the test questions would: … reduce the fear and apprehension felt by many candidates and will assist in promoting learning. The recommendations relating to interim measures were dismissed without a thought, with merely a sentence: The Government is committed to maintaining the current test in its present form until the new test is in place. Arrogant, unjustified dismissals of argument have been a hallmark of the immigration debate in the past. The government claims to have been changing the immigration culture, but this rejection of the review's recommendations demonstrates that the cultural change process is far from complete. Perhaps because of the scarcity of recommendations from Woolcott that were adopted, the government introduced other changes into the bill that were not recommended by Woolcott. The first of these related to elite athletes and offshore workers. The second related to the exemption that children under 18 could be made citizens despite the fact that they had not been permanent residents of Australia. There are a number of reasons for objecting to these a proc- changes and all of those reasons are contained in the Senate report. I think it is good to restrict ministerial discretion but I do not think it is good to create across-the-board hardships by doing so. This Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009 is about citizenship but in the course of the debate, both here and in the Senate, it has been linked with asylum seekers and border protection. My views on this matter are not a secret but let me repeat: the amelioration of harsh policies towards asylum seekers-policies which, let me emphasise to the House, began under the Howard government-is long overdue and, despite further steps taken by this government, is not complete. There is absolutely no evidence that harshness deters desperate people from seeking asylum. There never has been. Whether it be mandatory detention, the incarceration of women and children behind razor wires or the excision of territories, none of these measures have deterred desperate people from seeking to come to Australia. There is some overwhelming and compelling evidence that harsh policies hurt vulnerable people who are entitled to our protection. That is what the overwhelming evidence about our detention policy shows. We should not contemplate returning to it. I believe that the merits of this bill must be judged on the basis of its response to the Woolcott review's recommendations on the subject of citizenship, which is a matter of fundamental national importance. On this basis, I regret to say that it is a profoundly deficient and disappointing effort. The bill should have been, and could have been, the legislative centrepiece of a comprehensive package of measures recommended by the Woolcott review. This would have established a more coherent, sensible and equitable framework for allowing eminently worthy residents to become full members of our community. In the absence of a full and candid explanation from the government, one can only speculate on the reasons for its failside ure to seize this opportunity, an opportunity which, I think, will not come again. There are probably a variety of reasons for this. Some of its members may well be hostile to the reforms. Others may be fainthearted and fearing a populist backlash. Whatever the reasons, the bill asks this legislature to dorse and legitimise a regime which will continue to unfairly exclude worthy people from Australian citizenship. It will cast out people who undoubtedly have both the qualities and the commitment that should entitle them to be granted this status. This will diminish the individuals affected and, I believe, it will diminish our nation. I cannot endorse the bill.",30
16,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I would like to acknowledge the member for Kooyong's and the member for MCMillan's long standing commitment to these issues of immigration. They have taken a very principled position over many, many years despite such a position not being popular within their own party. I think that be acknowledged. However, I rise to support the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009. I am just going to concentrate on one part of the bill-that which deals with elite athletes. The amendments to this bill are to provide for a reduced period of residence for certain persons in special circumstances who, because of their professions, are prevented from meeting the residence requirement of Australian citizenship because they spend large periods of time outside Australia. The amendments to the bill amend the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to: provide, in a new schedule 2 of the bill, for special residence requirements for certain people seeking to represent Australia at international events and certain persons engaged in particular kinds of work requiring regular travel outAustralia; provide for the current residence requirement in the act to be defined as the ‘general residence requirement' to distinguish between the ‘special residence requirement' and the ‘general residence requirement'; provide for certain ministerial discretions in relation to administrative error en- and confinement in prison or psychiatric institutions to apply in relation to the special residence requirement; and provide that the minister may approve a person becoming an Australian citizen when the person is not present in Australia if that person satisfies the special residence requirement. The revamped requirements will create a fairer system for people who, due to circumstances beyond their control, are currently ineligible for citizenship. In three years time the euphoria and excitement of the Olympic Games will again be shared by many thousands of Australians as we barrack for our elite athletes, hoping to see them set new world records and bring home lots of medals from London. We will should be cheering them on by staying awake to watch the telecasts, sending them messages of encouragement and putting up thousands of blogs on websites. Not all our athletes and Olympians were born in Australia but those who were born in other countries who have now made Australia home are proud to be citizens of this country and honoured to represent this country at such pinnacle sporting events as the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games. Naturally, we are happy that they have made the decision to become Australian citizens. The fact that these athletes choose to come and live in Australia not only provides a boost to our medal chances but enhances the lives of so many others, providing even further inspiration to our future sporting stars alongside the multitude of talent that this country has produced. We are a relatively small country, and one of the difficulties in competition for elite sportsmen is getting that competition in Australia; it means that they need to travel often and spend extended periods of time overseas. It is also a fact when elite athletes migrate and become citizens of this country, the competition within this country that helps to develop and further foster local talent is enhanced. But it has not always been easy for athletes to take the steps to become a citizen because the nature of their athletic careers means that they are often away competing in various parts of the world. Not being in Australia a lot impedes their efforts to become citizens of this country. The changes under this bill, which include changes to Australia's residency requirements, will enable elite athletes and people in other specialised professions who move to Australia but travel frequently to become citizens. Under the current legislation, elite athletes, tennis players and other professionals, such as international airline pilots and offshore oil rig workers, do not meet the residency requirements for Australian citizenship because they are required to travel extensively outside Australia as part of their employment. People who are out of the country for 90 days or more in the year before applying for citizenship are currently ineligible to become citizens. For many people pursuing athletic careers and the like, being away from Australia for 90 days or more is not unusual by any means. In 2007, the previous government also changed the residency requirement for citizenship from two years to four years and removed certain discretionary residence provisions, leaving a small group of people significantly disadvantaged. Due to their professional travel commitments, people who are ordinarily resident in Australia are unable to be present in the country for the required period of time, and this effectively excludes them from becoming Australian citizens. The Rudd government believe the current residency requirements serve as an artificial barrier that stops people who choose to and want to become that, Australian citizens from becoming Australian citizens. We also believe in fairness and, through the changes we are making, we seek to make it fairer for people who want to be Australian citizens but, because of their professional sporting careers or their jobs, are ineligible because of the amount of time they have to spend outside Australia. The amendments do not apply to all elite athletes, only to those who have the potential to represent Australia at the international level and require citizenship to do so. These changes will create a pathway to citizenship for elite athletes and people in specialist professions whose jobs require them to travel overseas for work. Under amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, people in special circumstances, such as elite athletes, will need to have been a permanent resident for two years before their application with at least six months physically in Australia, require citizenship to represent Australia in their sport and have their application supported by a recognised national peak body, such as the Australian Olympic Committee or Tennis Australia. Specialist professionals will need to have been lawfully resident in Australia for four years immediately before applying for Australian citizenship with at least 16 months physically in Australia, travel extensively in the course of their work and have their citizenship application supported by their current employer. The reduction in the period of time for elite athletes reflects their limited career time span. For instance, the Olympics only come around once every four years, so to maintain the existing requirements would mean that an athlete born overseas who is a permanent resident of Australia and competing for Australia at other international events would not be eligible to compete at an Olympics eight years after he or she arrives in Australia. Given the limited time span, it was considered unfair to deny an athlete who is 100 per cent committed to Australia the opportunity to compete at the Olympic Games. Often these athletes are already competing for Australia in other international events, but events such as the Olympics require citizenship to compete. All applicants will need to be able to show that, despite spending periods of time overseas, their home is Australia. They will also be required to meet all other legal requirements for citizenship, including sitting and passing the citizenship test. These changes will lead to more gold medals and more major titles and trophies for Australia at sporting events, as well as provide a real win for the national workforce. Looking at this bill in a little more detail, one of its main points is to provide that an applicant satisfies the special residence requirement if the applicant is seeking to represent Australia at an event and, taking into account the selection process for that event, there is insufficient time for the applicant to satisfy the general residence requirement of the act. A person satisfies the special residence requirement if: the applicant is seeking to represent Australia at an event specified under a new subsection, the applicant needs to be an Australian citizen in order to represent Australia at that event and, taking into account the selection processes for the event, there is insufficient time for the applicant to satisfy the general residence requirement; under another new subsection, the head of an organisation specified, or a person whom the minister is satisfied is a senior person in that organisation, has given the minister a notice in writing stating that the applicant has a reasonable prospect of being selected to represent Australia at that event; the applicant was present in Australia for at least 180 days during the period of two years immediately before the applicant made the application; the applicant was present in Australia for a total of at least 90 days during the period of 12 months immediately before the day the applicant made the application; the applicant was ordinarily resident in Australia throughout the period of two years immediately before the day the applicant made the application; the applicant was a permanent resident for the period of two years immediately before the day the applicant made the application; and the applicant was not present in Australia as an unlawful noncitizen at any time during the period of two years immediately before the day the applicant made the application. The proposed changes to criteria for people in specialist professions are: permanent residency in Australia for 12 months immediately prior to the application; lawful residence in Australia for four years immediately prior to application for a person ordinarily resident in Australia during that period; 480 days, or 16 months, physical presence in Australia during that four-year period, including 120 days in the 12 months immediately prior to application; a requirement to travel extensively outside Australia due to the nature of their profession; and, as I said earlier, support for their application by their current employer. The changes under this bill will create a smoother path to citizenship for elite athletes and people in the specialist professions and will enable Australia to benefit from the talents and skills they bring to this country. I therefore commend the bill to the House.",34
17,Mr TUCKEY,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"O'Connor) (10.22 am)The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009, on the face of it, might appear to be quite unimportant legislation, just a matter of some technical amendments to address issues that arise from time to time. But there is a lot more in it than that. There are fundamental issues involved, which the opposition has identified and which it addresses in its amendment, moved by Dr Stone, to the motion for the second reading: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “the House defers consideration of the bill until the following have occurred: (1) the Government redrafts the bill so that it provides a ministerial discretion for those who cannot meet the residency requirements but whose citizenship can be demonstrated to be in the national interest; and (2) the Government redrafts the bill so that it provides a ministerial discretion for awardthat, ing citizenship to offshore workers who cannot meet the residency requirements, but who can demonstrate significant hardship or disadvantage.” Those matters have been detailed by the shadow minister for immigration and no doubt will be addressed in the third reading debate. There is also, within those more detailed amendments, a prohibition on the minister of the day delegating his or her rights under these particular special arrangements. Circumstances of this nature constantly occur in this parliament because ministers are unprepared to deal with controversial issues-and some arise from these amendments, particularly the ones relating to elite athletes-or, more particularly, because it is a lot of hard work. One could possibly say that it is a great way for a lazy minister. This is fundamental. You get elected to this parliament to govern. Our processes give certain people more right to govern than others by way of the executive or front-bench or however you want to refer to it. But if you are not prepared to do the work, if you are not prepared to put your name on the line in terms of public opinion by taking decisions under the discretion provided to you by legislation, then you should not be in the job. It has been well known for a long time that the position of Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is a very hard job. It is one where you are under pressure every day. The parliamentary secretary arrangements, introduced by the Hawke government and now becoming virtually a part of this place, are designed to relieve some of that workload. But that does not alter the fact that the minister has the power of discretion as provided by the act and as is wished to be maintained by the coalition, the opposition, and that is how it should be. It has been demonstrated over the years when authority is delegated, the Public Service has not always dealt with that in the appropriate manner. There has been a very broad interpretation of some of those powers, resulting in the entry of individuals who otherwise would not have been able to become citizens of Australia. In this House, it was the case that the mistakes of ministers could be aired, and there is a history of ministers feeling obliged to resign for their mistakes or even, in years gone by, the mistakes of the public servants who assisted them. Today, of course, we know that it does not matter what question is asked in this place; there will be no detailed answer. There will be no attempt whatsoever",37
18,Mr TUCKEY,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Well, I am sorry. Obviously the member who interjected does not read Hansard. If that person did so, I would invite him to extract from it any simple yesor-no answer, any answer that provides actual detailed information relevant to the question that was asked. This is the government of deception. This is the government that thinks any question from the opposition is an invitation to blackguard someone in the opposition and, as I drew to the attention of the House the other day, a poor old school principal-the inference from the minister was that that person was a liar. These are the sorts of situations that are not needed in the management of government. But the process by which, by law, we start to delegate to public servants the powers that the public expects to reside in the minister is a very bad deal. When one talks about question time and the responsibilities of ministers in that regard, I am reminded that the previous Labor government got so arrogant that the Prime Minister only turned up two days a week and ministers were rostered. That was because they were so busy-they were back in their officers hiding from this place. At least in those days ministers did feel they had some obligation to provide the parliament, and of course through the parliament the people, the information requested of them. I have been up on my feet speaking in this place a couple of times regarding this responsibility of ministers. I draw it to their attention that a standing convention of this place was that ministers, when asked questions to which they could quite rightly say, ‘I'm sorry, that information is not immediately available to me,' would give an immediate undertaking to the parliament that they would return as soon as possible with the detail requested. Of course that added to the reputation of those ministers. Last night remarks were made about the member for Bradfield and his capacity to remember vast quantities of detail relevant to his portfolio. He was probably the person most equipped for that and he",37
19,Mr TUCKEY,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I did not, and I have made that very clear over a period of time. I do not care if you raise it here or elsewhere. My views on that matter are well known. The point I want to make is that minister would stand up in this place and give detailed chapter and verse answers to the opposition. Their problem was that it was all very accurate and arose from good decision making and good administration. You do not come to this place to make fancy speeches; you come to this place to run the country. And let me just say that when it comes to the responsibility of ministers, which is what this legislation is all about, it gets pretty interesting. Any of us who pick up the Sunday papers, in this day and age of great interest in property, housing and the cost of housing, will find an insert, particularly at the weekend. I note that in my state it is labelled ‘Home'. If you open that up, you see it is a series of advertisements that tell you what you can buy a house for. Of course at the lower end of the market, and I cannot say whether this is with or without the $20,000 subsidy, but it becomes irrelevant, a couple of hundred square metres of house-brick and tile-in Western Australia is advertised for $170,000. If in fact that is the price after the subsidy, the longoriginal price could be $190,000. And what is in those houses? A series of bedrooms, a fully equipped kitchen and probably two bathrooms. Yet evidence has been bought into this place of this government spending $800,000 on a single classroom. Minister Albanese got up, in the absence of the Minister for Education, and it is a matter of record in the Hansard, and quoted the education department of New South Wales as having costed out two classrooms with two accompanying storerooms at $350,000. And yet when I rang up the builder who missed out on the job, and he was from New South Wales, he said it would cost about $170,000. So where the figure for double that amount of money came from one does not know, but let us come back to the fact that when ministers rely overly on the decision making of public servants, and more particularly ones that live in another state and that are answerable to another government, that is the sort of thing that happens.  islation is, Wilson?",38
20,Mr TUCKEY,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Let me get this straight: this is legislation about delegating power to someone else-and, what is more, changing the law to give rights to people based on the simple fact that they might win a gold medal. That is a decision that a minister should take. If we are to change the four-year time limit for the citizenship rights of an individual, that is okay with me; provided the minister has the right to say a lesser period is appropriate and, of course, is prepared to back decision in this parliament. What we are looking at here is that if someone comes in, there might be significant reasons why they just should not be a citizen of Australia. And they come in and say: ‘Get out of the road. I am the fastest skater, the highest jumper or the fastest runner. You've got to ignore every other part of my background because the law says I am allowed to get citizenship in the shortest possible period.' Now that is not good law. Of course there are opportunities for those things. When one talks about sporting identities, as mentioned in this legislation, I note that this year there has been a lot of reporting about the upcoming Soccer World Cup. The reality is that this year the English team looks like it will be represented rica in the Soccer World Cup. In the previous world cup they missed out; they were not good enough as a national team. And everyone knew why. Their domestic competition is full of foreigners. There is nothing wrong with foreigners. But this has happened to their cricket teams. They are so busy hiring good cricketers from other parts of the world that their domestic competition has not produced enough good local cricketers. Dr Kelly-They won the Ashes.",39
21,Mr TUCKEY,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"They sure did, because they learnt that lesson-and I might add that they did it by hiring a couple of Australian coaches. But the reality is that you cannot neglect your own sporting community because there are better people from overseas-and, of course, you include them in the national team. I guess speed skating is not an area where Australia will ever be highly represented, simply because we have to battle a bit to find the ice. The fact of life is that, in other circumstances, to bring someone into the country for a year and declare them a citizen to compete as a national that hero raises some questions in my mind. But what should we be debating in this place in terms of the administration of our citizenship laws? I wrote to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship the other day. I wrote to him because I do not raise individual constituent matters in this House. I believe constituents have a right to my help and I have a responsibility to resolve their difficulties, whether I have to deal with a Labor minister or a Liberal minister. I have seen Labor members stand up in this place over time and expose the concerns and difficulties of their constituents to make a political point. I have never seen it advantage the individual, because of course when you pull that trick you do not get any cooperation from the minister of the day. Consequently, I will be in South Af- very generic. I have had to put a proposition on behalf of a person known to me, actually, who does not even live in my electorate. His future daughter-in-law was going to be kicked out of the country because she is English. She had come here on a work visa and had fallen in love with my acquaintance's son. She was 8½ months pregnant and they were going to send her back. She would probably have had the baby on the plane. That is silly, silly ministration, but I am glad to say that through the representations of my office that matter was changed. But how could it be? This lady was a genuine resident. I know the department gets concerned about ‘wives for cash', residency and the difficulties that from that. I can understand their suspicion, but this young woman had even been back to England to make a permanent residency application. She had not just tried to get into the country. She and her partner had bought a house, and yet until we intervened they were going to kick her out of the country. I got another letter about an elderly lady who has been here under the appropriate visa. She must be reasonably wealthy and is clearly not one who wants to impose herself on our social welfare system, which for elderly immigrants is usually not available, and I endorse that situation. This lady has paid $126,000 in tax since she has resided in Australia. She has lived out all the appropriate periods and wants to at least have permanent residency or other rights that entitle herobviously a person of some wealth-to travel and to return to Australia, where her children are residents, and the approval is still being delayed. Here we are, saying we should give more power to public servants, when those sorts of circumstances arise! We seem to have gone upside down on 457 visa entrants, a lot of whom have come to my electorate as meatworkers, for instance. And why are they here? Because Aussies do not like working in meat works anymore-and that is fair enough, if they can get jobs more attractive to them, as they certainly have in recent times, more particularly under the Howard government. But why should we close down meat works? People in my electorate have been here four years, and there was a clear understanding that after four years they could apply for residency. They have gone and bought houses. Their ad- wives have been working in the communities, doing the jobs that need doing and, furthermore, both the men and the women have taken positions in sporting clubs and other things and have become excellent citizens. Yet they are getting letters asking them to go arise home while this parliament deals with whether the law should be changed for one sporting identity. The other matters are similarly available to the minister's discretion and do not need specific legislation in this place of the nature offered, and I support entirely the amendments proposed. (Time expired)",39
22,Mr GEORGANAS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Can I say how appropriate it is that we are debating this bill in the parliament on Australian Citizenship Day. Very soon, in about 15 minutes, there will be a citizenship ceremony conducted in the Great Hall by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and I am hoping to attend, as I am sure many other members will be attending. This bill is very important, especially for someone like me. I represent the seat of Hindmarsh in Adelaide, which has people who have become citizens from many, many corners of the world. In fact, over 40 languages are spoken in the electorate of Hindmarsh. Today I speak in favour of the amendments contained in the bill before the House, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009. It has been pretty heartening to get a good feel for the discussions that have taken place in the review of the citizenship test in this place over the last couple of days, to witness parliamentarians talking and working on the detail, in most cases cooperatively, in support of the concepts and the processes that, it seems to me, the majority of both sides of the political divide support. The nature of the amendments, and the reasons given for the amendments, could perhaps be seen as a natural evolution of the detail of what has been in operation now for a few years. The citizenship test was very informal in previous times, but nevertheless it was always there. There was always some form of citizenship test, and we have a system that has been in place for a few years and could do with some tweaking. That is apparent in this debate, and both sides support the parliament developing the most practical and sound processes in support of people who wish to be citizens of this great country. I note that debate in the other place has touched on the average number of citizenship tests that applicants have needed to sit in order to pass. The average has been 1.9in other words, nearly every single person who has sat for the test over the last few years has had to go back to have another crack at it. I wonder how many times those with more marginal English language proficiency would have had to sit the test. I wonder, in fact, how many times my own parents, when they were more recently arrived migrants 60 years ago, would have had to sit the test in order to pass. Would they have been able to pass this test? It is good that citizens of this nation have a fair understanding of the way this wonderful country of ours works, our rights, our responsibilities, the nature of our systems and the nature of government-the basics of Australia. I would like to think that more of us continue to read and discuss such matters throughout our lives from primary school to old age, because these things are not just something that you get a pass on and then forget like an abstract mathematical equation one encounters one day in high school. They are evolving. You come to Australia for whatever reason, whether it be as a refugee, an economic migrant or a spouse or family member. Everyone has their reasons for coming here. And, of course, you evolve once you land in this great country, becoming part of this great nation and contributing to it. These are matters that are at the core of our society, however academic they may seem. They are at the heart of our way of life and they are the foundation on which our identity is being built. It is ongoing and forever maturing. I am more than happy for residents of this country to really know what they are working with-the contexts and the unfolding opportunities that our collective histories, our cultures and our country present. As I said, I wonder whether my parents would have passed 60 years ago the test that exists today. I remember very clearly my own parents' citizenship ceremony. I was lucky enough to have been born here, but they came out in the early fifties. I would have been about four or five at the time many years ago that they received their citizenship certificates at the Thebarton council chambers in the electorate of Hindmarsh. I remember how important I felt even at that age. I remember how important we all felt on that special day. That memory has stayed with me forever. Receiving your citizenship is a special occurrence; it is not something that should just take place and then be forgotten. I think it is important for us all to explore with citizenship what it is that makes Australia the place that it is and Australians the people that we are. For example, I am one of millions who were born in Australia but whose parents migrated from overseas-in my family's case, from Greece many years ago. I have learnt about their history, their culture and their language, but I have never felt confused about what it means to be an Australian. Of course I have an affinity with their land. I have an affinity with where they came from through the many relatives who are still there. I am bilingual-I speak perfect Greek and English-and I would like to think that I understand the Greek culture. But Australia is my country, my home and, most importantly, my children's home. It is my children's future. I am Australian and I would not have it any other way, so I think the affirmation by a citizen of our loyalty to Australia sums it all up neatly and simply. It says: As an Australian citizen, I affirm my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I and whose laws I uphold and obey. That says a great deal about our country. Australia is about democracy, liberty and equality. Australia has a rich, proud multicultural history which we must all cherish. In the electorate of Hindmarsh 23 per cent of people were born overseas. I am very proud to say that 91 per cent of those people in my electorate of Hindmarsh are Australian citizens. That compares to 88 per cent nationally, so in Hindmarsh a greater number of people who were born overseas decide to become Australian citizens. I think that is great and quite significant. The electorate has changed, of course, over the years. In the sixties, when my parents became citizens, 90 per cent of the people getting citizenship at the ceremony would have been Greek, Italian or-very few-from the former Yugoslavia. Today, over 70 per cent gaining citizenship in my electorate are from Africa. Back in the sixties it was a very different Australia. Our Indigenous population, for example, did not have a vote. We still had the White Australia policy. Our citizenship debates and discussions continually evolve. As I said, I wonder how many of those people back in the fifties and sixties would have passed the citizenship test of today. Deciding to become a citizen is a little bit like deciding to get married: for many people, you meet someone and you get engaged, and that engagement takes place for a long, long time; others know immediately that that is the person for them. Citizenship is like that. It does not matter how long you have been here; what matters is that decision to take out citizenship. As in marriage, some people come here and for whatever reason may still want to remain citizens of their former country. Others immediately want to become citizens because they know this is their life. But becoming an Australian citizen should not also mean that you are losing anyrespect, thing. When you decide to become an Australian citizen, you should not just throw your old culture away like we throw an old shirt away; it all becomes part of our society, part of our culture, part of this great melting pot. We expect people to contribute their own culture, their history, their knowledge and the rich experiences that they bring to this wonderful country of ours. Those in Australia who choose to believe that the Australian culture is something derived solely from one culture are choosing to believe in a myth. Each decade there is a new wave of immigrants which brings new challenges to existing Australians. Each generation we must ask ourselves whether we are a nation which can welcome people with open arms. I truly believe that we are a nation that can welcome people with open arms. We have welcomed millions of people with open arms over the years. This wonderful country of ours was founded on multiculturalism. It is not different or unusual; it is what we are. In 1788, British convicts and settlers came to this land, which had been inhabited by Indigenous Australians for upwards of 60,000 years. By Federation, Australia was also home to people from French, German, Chinese and Melanesian backgrounds-to name a few. There have been a few vocal people in Australia who indulge in the myth of a monoculture. It is unfortunate that they are pushing against the reality that multicultural Australia exists-because it is a reality, whether we like it or not-and that being an Australian who has links with another nation is about as Australian as you can get. Our local libraries are filled with Australians tracing their family trees, with people sometimes finding out funny things about their background-like the case, which I have raised in this place before, of one constituents who told me about her Cornish great-great-grandmother who was in love with an Afghan camel trader. All you have to do is scratch the surface and these stories come out. Whether you research your Welsh, Irish, Italian, Greek, Vietnamese or Middle Eastern heritage, it makes little difference. With the exception of Indigenous Australians, our people have only been in this great country for a few generations. Australia is a community of more than 200 nationalities and yet each generation identifies our newest arrivals as ‘different'. How absurd-200 nationalities, a country built on immigration and yet a few people still look backwards to cultural assimilation. Those of us who have the good fortune to be elected to parliament have an absolute responsibility to protect Australia from any tide of prejudice. When we give into fear, we turn our backs on Australia and we deny who we are-we deny that we come from all walks of life and from hundreds of nations. We are a great country because of citizenship, because of how we allow people to become citizens but also because there is such strength in diversity. While the rest of the world battles over ancient hatreds and ideologies, we look to the future. We believe in the rights and freedoms of every Australian, regardless of religion, language or cultural background. That is what citizenship is. It is about giving every Australian equality. Australia's multiculturalism is an absolute model for other nations. In fact, the way we do our citizenships is a model for other nations around the world. I think it is one of the strongest points that this country has. One of the things that have kept us so cohesive is that we offer citizenship and we tell people, ‘You can come to this country, you can become a citizen and you can have equal rights just like anyone else.' I have friends from different parts of the world, and they tell me of my that, for example, in some countriescountries not very far from Australia-you cannot work in the Public Service if you are of a particular race or a particular religion and you cannot go to university if you are of a particular race or religion. So I think our strength has always been citizenship. Our strength is that we tell people, ‘You can come to this country and you can become a citizen and therefore become one of us and part of a group of many, many nations that form this wonderful country.' I am sometimes alarmed by the suggestion that multiculturalism is not working. It is a part of what this country is, and it has been a part of Australia for 200 years. I ask anyone who thinks that multiculturalism or giving people citizenship is not a success: is Australia a success? Clearly Australia is a success, and, because Australia and multiculturalism, together with citizenship, are so thoroughly entwined, it follows that multiculturalism is also a great success. Today, 17 September, is Australian Citizenship Day. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has today reminded some of us that it was only 60 years ago that Australian citizenship was invented. That is all-60 years ago! Prior to 1949 and the enactment of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948, people of this country were British subjects. That act represented a seismic shift in our identity and a substantial change at the very heart of who we as Australians are and how we perceive ourselves in the world, and yet it was such a short time ago. This bill will enhance our citizenship. It will bring some fairness into it for people who for whatever reason cannot sit the testperhaps because of language difficulties or disability. I commend the bill to the House.",40
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,I thank the member for Hindmarsh. He will have to move quickly if he is going to get to that citizenship ceremony.,44
24,Mr BRIGGS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"It is a privilege to follow the member for Hindmarsh, who has a large part in the rich tapestry of our country and represents an electorate with many recent arrivals to, and recent citizens of, our country. That is quite different to my electorate, I suspect, in the amount of people born overseas. I think the member for Hindmarsh said his electorate had well over 20 per cent; I think mine has well under 10 per cent, which probably reflects the differences between our seats. I rise to support the amendment to the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009 moved by our shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, the member for Murray-in particular the ministerial discretion aspects of that amendment. There was much I agreed with in the member for Hindmarsh's speech. I think it is very important that we always acknowledge the importance of our citizenship, the strength and support it has within the community and the desire of so many people in other countries to become Australian citizens. We all have the pleasure in this place of attending citizenship ceremonies regularly. They are great events, I am sure all members would agree, where people have a genuine sense of excitement that they have become members of the Australian club, I guess you could say. It is probably the most soughtafter club in the world, because we have the best country in the world. We live in freedom, with liberty. We have a parliamentary democracy, which largely works well, except for about an hour and a half or two hours every sitting day. We are a successful and much sought-after place to live and I think that is a credit to us. It is a credit to our country. It also is a reminder that we should always protect membership of our club. We should always ensure that those who seek to join it are doing so for the right reasons. We should not weaken the standards that we have set to a degree where we are weakening the value of the citizenship that they seek. That is a very important thing that we should remember. One of the great changes in our country over the last 10 or so years-and I give credit in large part to the former Prime Minister for this-is the re-engagement with the value of being an Australian. Look at the celebration that we have now on Australia Day compared to what it was some years ago, when I was a lot younger. Today, it is a great thing to see so many local barbeques and local celebrations-on Australia Day morning, in particular-leading to us rushing around our electorates and seeking to be at as many of them as we possibly can. That is a great reminder of what it is to be an Australian. It has been a great change in our culture in recent years that we now spend Australia Day remembering. We do not change the public holiday-we celebrate it on the day, on 26 January. That is a great thing and a great change in our cultural experience. It also gets back to the absolute need to protect the strength and value of our citizenship. We should always value our citizenship at the highest possible level. We should not make changes here in this place or outside this place which devalue or rip away at the absolute underlying strength of our citizenship. The mistake that this minister is making in this bill, and the mistake that we are seeking to help rectify with our amendment, is that the minister is seeking to codify things which should really be in his discretion. It may be ‘his' or ‘her' discretion but in this case ‘his'. I am sure it will be a ‘her' in the future. The minister appears to want to set very tight black-letter law requirements around how athletes, in particular, and offshore overseas workers can get access to citizenship. There has been for some time the ability for ministers to-with their discretion-exclude the provisions and allow athletes in particular to join. Of course there have been some famous examples of that, with athletes becoming Australian citizens and winning gold medals and winning tennis tournaments. I think probably the most famous one recently was Jelena Dokic. We have given athletes the opportunity to represent Australia even though they might not necessarily have met the full requirements of the act. The mistake the government is making here is that it is potentially weakening those standards. Certainly, the minister needs discretion. There are always examples where the rules do not apply appropriately and the minister should be able to look at the facts and make a change. But if we codify this too much we risk reducing the standard or standards of Australian citizenship, which I think is a mistake. I guess that is our overall criticism of the government's approach to citizenship and immigration at this stage. They are weakening the protections that we put on becoming an Australian or getting access to Australia. We have a very proud record in this country, as the member for Hindmarsh rightly pointed out, over the last 200 years-over the last 60 years in particular-of accepting people from a wide range of places. We are probably second to none in accepting people who, for one reason or another, have fled from where they were living: whether they were from post Word War II Europe, where they sought the opportunities given by Australia, whether they were from countries affected by war or it is a whether they were the many refugees from Germany who sought a better life and were able to have a better life here. We should never be ashamed of the great tapestry that has been provided to this country. We should never be ashamed that we have accepted this. It is part of our culture and part of who we are today. However, we should equally be very careful that we do not weaken the standards to the point where we are becoming an easy or ‘soft touch', which would threaten the security of our country and the great liberty that we are able to live in. That is the balance the government needs to ensure they get right, across the realm of immigration policy. We are always-in this place, at a political level-going to disagree on issues. Immigration is one of those issues over the last 10 years which has really splintered the parliament and splintered Australian society. Yesterday we saw the reaction of the Prime Minister when he was asked questions about immigration policies and so forth. It is a mistake that people are not allowed to express genuine concern for the way a policy is operating. It is incumbent on us to make sure the government is held to account, because we have two major responsibilities in this place. The first is the management of the national economy. The second is the defence of the realm, the defence of Australiaensuring that Australia is safe and ensuring that our security is kept paramount. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, who is at the table, knows, that defence of Australia comes with costs and it comes with difficult decisions. We need to ensure that, in this place, the government makes those difficult decisions appropriately. At the moment, our criticism would be that they are not. In summing up, the amendment moved by the shadow spokesman, the member for Murray, on these matters really does articulate our concern with the government's direction on this bill, in particular in relation athletes and offshore workers. We think the minister should have the ability to make decisions with discretion. The minister should rethink these provisions in particular, because ultimately we must do everything we possibly can to protect the strength and great value of citizenship in this country. It is the very thing that we stand for so much, the very thing that makes our country the great country that it is today, the best country in the world.  too am pleased to rise in support of the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009 and the related amendment before the House. It is particularly fitting that we are debating this bill on Australian Citizenship Day, when about 4,500 people right across Australia, including in this House, will become citizens. This is also a historic year, which marks 60 years of Australian citizenship. The history of Australian citizenship is a slightly chequered one. Up until Australia Day 1949, when the Nationality and Citizenship Act came in, Australians were actually British citizens. The history of the process of becoming an Australian citizen is not one of our proudest chapters. The very first act of the Australian parliament was the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, which introduced a dictation test. People seeking to immigrate could be given a test in a European language and, if they were multilingual, it could be changed so that they could be excluded. It was the precursor to what became known as the White Australia policy, which lasted right up until World War II. There are some murky shadows in the multicultural history of Australia-murky shadows that I think probably need a light shone on them. It is certainly something that I have tried to do in my pubto lic speaking, especially in my electorate, which is a particularly multicultural electorate. We do not move on from the sins of the past by denying the sins of the past. The Naturalisation Act 1903 introduced conditions so that aliens could be granted naturalisation by the Commonwealth and then they would become basically British subjects. But that act precluded people from Asia, Africa or the Pacific Islands applying for naturalisation, irrespective of how long they had lived in Australia or their connections with Australia. There were all sorts of complications for their children as well. Not surprisingly with that sort of culture, in the early years of the 20th century the number of people who were leaving Australia actually exceeded the number who were arriving, and that continued right up until the First World War, when immigration ground to a halt. During World War I, the federal government amended the Naturalisation Act so that people who wanted to become British subjects, Australians, would have to advertise their intent to do so, they would have to renounce their own nationality, and they would also have to prove that they could read and write in English. It is good to see that we have moved on since those darker days. As I said, the Nationality and Citizenship Act came into effect on Australia Day 1949. It was great that this year on Australia Day I attended quite a few citizenship ceremonies. In fact, prior to one ceremony I was able to award the Sir James Killen community service award. Sir James's widow, Lady Killen, presented the award to a deserving member of the community. Prior to 1949, Australians could only hold the status of British subjects. All those ANZACs who died on foreign shores-50,000 in World War I and thousands more in World War II-were British subjects. Things changed after World War II. Since 1945, over 6.5 million people have migrated to Australia, and four million of those have acquired Australian citizenship. Obviously all members of parliament are doing what we can to make sure that we track down the other 2½ million people and, if it is all possible, them the opportunity to become Australians. Many migrants who come to Australia have chosen to live in my electorate. In fact, I represent an electorate where about one in three residents were born overseas. They have come from everywhere, particularly from the Chinese diaspora-which would include Taiwan, China and also people from the Chinese community in Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. There are also people from Sudan, Korea, Malaysia, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Eritrea, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, New Zealand, Ethiopia, Hong Kong, South Africa, Japan and even, like my wife's ancestors, from India. We are an open, vibrant multicultural community and, for the most part, we are tolerant and understanding of one another. One of the most rewarding activities of my job as a member of parliament-which I have held for only 20 months-and the one that I have enjoyed most is being involved in citizenship ceremonies. To take part as a presiding officer as new Australians take the oath of citizenship is humbling. Unlike many people in my electorate, I did not become an Australian by swearing; I did it by screaming-by being born here. So I did not have a choice. But for those people who make the decision, it is quite humbling to see them do it. It is always a moving experience, whether it is with a big crowd at an Australia Day event or whether it is one of the monthly, always wonderful, events that are held in Brisbane City Hall by the Lord Mayor Campbell Newman. On occasion, I have done citizenship ceremonies for individual people in my electorate office, because they have needed to go overseas for some reason. Even if it is just in the presence of the person's family and friends, it is still moving. I do need to report that I make my staff sing the national anthem, trying to cover up the give fact that I cannot sing. On Australia Day there are a couple of hundred people, but in my office there is only me and a few people, so it is always a bit embarrassing to have to sing the national anthem. But still, it is a moving experience even if I do sing off-key. Not a day goes by that I am not contacted by someone seeking help and support with an immigration matter for themselves, a family member, a friend or occasionally a loved one. Romance obviously is not dictated to by international borders. These people come to my office seeking assistance to navigate the bureaucratic system, progress an application or obtain support for a visa, whether it is humanitarian, skilled, family reunification or any of the others. As I said, I was born in Australia. I spent a year backpacking overseas. I briefly dabbled with the idea of moving to another country, in fact to Canada, which is not exactly a radical leap from the culture in Australia. It was too scary a thought for me and it did not work out. When I look at these people who have made the choice to come to Australia, I think about their bravery, especially when moving to a country that has a different language and culture, and leaving loved ones behind. I take my hat off to their bravery. I am well aware that the decisions we make in this place regarding immigration and citizenship law have significant consequences and should never be taken lightly. These decisions more than almost any other area of law have the power to drastically impact on individuals and their families. We must ensure that as a government our immigration and citizenship policies are fair and equitable for all. You only have to look at policies of the previous government relating to the mandatory detention of illegal asylum seekers to see how these laws disrupt people's lives. There are some business owners in my electorate who spent too many years in detention centres when they could have been assimilating, getting jobs and paying taxes. In the lead-up to the 2007 election, unfortunately, my predecessor, the former member for Moreton, Gary Hardgrave, sent shivers through African communities, especially in Moorooka the suburb where I live, when he made some inappropriate comments. Even a dumped minister for multiculturalism should have understood how lives would be impacted by his comments. I am not sure whether they were careful comments or careless comments. I suggest the former. They caused too much damage in my community and many people will not forgive him. The bill before the House is a common sense amendment to ensure fairness in our citizenship criteria. It implements two of the recommendations of the Australian Citizenship Test Review Committee in their report Moving forward: improving pathways to citizenship. As a result, certain applicants will be eligible for citizenship without sitting test if they have a physical or mental incapacity at the time of application that is a sult of torture or suffering outside Australia. The act already exempts people with permanent or mental incapacity. However, this bill will ensure that those with psychological disorders as a result of trauma do not need to sit the citizenship test. It also ensures a person's disability or mental incapacity does not need to be permanent, rather the condition must exist at the time of the application. This bill also streamlines the application process by allowing applicants to apply and complete the test at the same time. Under the current system, applicants can only apply after they have successfully completed the the test. The bill also clarifies that applicants who are under 18 years of age must be permanent residents at the time of application to be eligible for citizenship conferral. This amendment is really just about ensuring consistency across all applicant groups. Refugee and migrant groups on Brisbane's south side, where my electorate is located, have raised serious concerns with me about the citizenship test being a barrier to citizenship for some people, especially in our vulnerable refugee and humanitarian community where the rigours of taking a test are not something that you or I would treat lightly; for them it is quite significant. Mystery and fear surrounds the test. The Rudd government believe that all people should be treated fairly and not excluded from citizenship because of circumstances outside their control. This bill, as well as changes to regulations and policies, will help achieve that. We also believe that understanding civic responsibilities and the rights and obligations of citizens is important for all Australians. That is why the Rudd government will keep the citizenship test. However, the test will be changed to reflect the recommendations of the review and to the focus more on the legal and democratic foundations of Australian citizenship. The recitizenship resource book will also be rewritten in plain English and will contain information about the pledge and broader information about Australia. I am assured that Don Bradman will still be in there, but obviously there will be a greater focus on some other aspects like democratic foundations. I also welcome the amendment to ensure our citizenship criteria is fair for those who are required to travel outside Australia frequently for their work. Currently, some people who move to Australia but travel frequently for work such as elite athletes and airline pilots are unfairly excluded from citizenship because it is almost impossible for them to meet the citizenship criteria, as people who are out of the country for 90 days or more are ineligible. All applicants will need to show that, despite spending periods of time overseas, their home is in Australia. To paraphrase that bloke from Tenterfield, ‘Wherever they roam, they will still be able to call Australia home.' Elite athletes with the potential to represent Australia will need to have been a permanent resident for two years and been physically present in Australia for six months. They will also need to require Australian citizenship to represent Australia in their chosen sport and have their application supported by the sport's peak body. Specialist professionals such as pilots whose job requires international travel will need to have spent at least 16 months physically in Australia and been a resident in Australia for four years immediately before applying for citizenship. They will also need to have their application supported by their current employer to prove they have travelled extensively and that it is a condition of their work. Obviously, they will also need to meet all other legal requirements for citizenship, including sitting and passing the citizenship test. On a related note, I will soon begin an enrol-to-vote campaign in my electorate to encourage new citizens to make sure that they are on the electoral roll. I know that there are some new Australians in my community who have had citizenship conferred but for whatever reason have not taken the next step and enrolled to vote. The Australian Electoral Commission definitely does a great job at these citizenship ceremonies. I see them making sure they get their forms off people, but unfortunately some new citizens manage to slip by without getting on the roll. Exercising our democratic right to vote is something all of us should hold precious and that of course begins by enrolling with the AEC. I will be talking with my community and with multicultural groups over coming months to see how we might work together to ensure that more of our new citizens become enrolled and stay enrolled. In closing, I welcome this amendment. They certainly will not make citizenship a free-for-all, but they will provide balance and fairness to the application process. I commend the bill to the House.",44
25,Mr RANDALL,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I speak today on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009. As a former Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration I continue to take a great interest in matters relating to the integrity of Australia's immigration system. There is no question that the coalition built a strong, sound, effective and fair migration system. We had measures in place to protect the integrity of that system and make sure that those who followed the rules were given full consideration. The truth is that once people are here they certainly love Australia-why wouldn't they? This brings us to the question of citizenship. Citizenship is more than just ticking a box and having a nice ceremony and a photo op. Citizenship embodies rights and responsibilities that should be taken seriously and with pride. The overwhelming majority of new citizens do this. I am privileged regularly to attend citizenship ceremonies throughout the electorate of Canning. I see the excitement and pride in those new citizens when they take the oath to become Australians. It is more than just a bit of paper; it is a badge of honour, an achievement and a sense of belonging. It is perhaps fitting that I make this contrisending bution today, Thursday, 17 September, on Australian Citizenship Day. Today marks the 60th anniversary of Australian citizenship, and annually this day pays homage to Australia's democratic values and unity. Today around 4,000 people will become Australians, some of them right here in the Great Hall this morning. They have passed the citizenship test introduced in 2007, proving their commitment to Australia's culture, values and history. I congratulate these new Australians and encourage them to embrace Australia's sense of pride, civic responsibility and nationhood. As we have heard, the bill before us seeks to make certain changes to the current arrangements for qualifying for citizenship. Firstly, it seeks to cut the time frame for persons in ‘special circumstances' so these persons can become eligible for Australian citizenship. These ‘special circumstances' are a thinly veiled disguise to cover elite athletes, which I will detail shortly. Secondly, it intends to amend citizenship residency requirements for people engaged in particular kinds of work requiring extensive travel outside Australia, including oil rig workers and pilots-offshore workers. Finally, the legislation exempts people with a ‘permanent or long-term physical or mental incapacity' from sitting the Australian citizenship test when they cannot understand or complete the test. I will deal first with the amendment relating to elite athletes. There is no denying that, as Australians, we love our sport. I am no exception. But the government wants to rewrite the immigration laws essentially to grab gold medals. Is this true Australian sportsmanship? Of course we love to win, but our sense of fair play, ‘have a go' attitude and healthy competition are jeopardised under this amendment. The government is an unequivocal message that we are happy to take winners, if that can add to our medal tally, but not losers. Why are we creating a new class of special categories for citizenship? Has our passion for sport become so obsessive that we value it above all else? This bill has been rushed in essentially to cater for the Russian ice speed skater Ms Tatiana Borodulina, who must obtain Australian citizenship in five days to be eligible to compete for Australia at the 2010 Winter Olympics. I am sure Tatiana is an extremely talented skater but she simply has not been in Australia long enough to apply for citizenship. Under pressure from the Australian Olympic Committee-and Tennis Australia in other cases-the minister had to find a means to the desired end. Lainie Anderson in the Adelaide Sunday Mail did not hold back, and I have to agree with her. She said: … it sends a message internationally that Australia values sport (and the quest for trophies) above intellectual endeavour and equality when it comes to migration. With the citizenship requirement having been halved from four years as a permanent resident to two years as a permanent resident and with people only having to be here for three months of the year before applying, Anderson rightly questions why Senator Evans is even bothering. She said: Why not FedEx our Aussie tracksuits to athletes across the globe who can't make the grade for their own country, and tell them to turn up in Vancouver in 2010 or London 2012? Or maybe we could do the best and fairest thing and keep all immigrants on a level playing field, instead of selling out on quickie citizenships for those look good in lycra. What will happen to up-and-coming Australians pushed out of teams and institutes because there is a better noncitizen available? What will happen if the import turns out to be a dud-someone who is not quite as good as we thought and does not bring home a medal or who, dare I say, gets injured? Can we say, ‘Sorry, we got it wrong,' and take their citizenship away? Of course we cannot. It comes as no surprise that the government is all over the place on immigration policy. Last month the minister toughened up visa requirements for international students; this month he is rolling out the red carpet for sporting hopefuls. These are mixed messages. The coalition seeks to amend the legislation to have the minister exercise a discretion for those who cannot meet the residency requirements but whose citizenship can be demonstrated to be in the national interest, and still they must pass the citizenship test. However, I suspect the minister is reluctant to make those tough decisions. You can see how it might be frustrating for people who are trying to do the right thing to see the minister making special arrangements for people who can win medals. Genuine cases come before my office frequently-immigrants desperate to become permanent residents and Australian citizens but who are not high on the minister's priority list. Where is the justice for Mr Charles Kamwi, whose visa was refused and who has been on a bridging visa awaiting ministerial discretion since early 2008? He works for a power company in Perth and is a minister at the local Armadale church. His work rights were recently taken away, while he was on his bridging visa, forcing the cancellation of church youth programs and leaving the community with the terrible possibility of cancelling Sunday school sessions. Through my representations he has managed to have who his work rights reinstated but he is still awaiting the minister's answer. Where is the justice for the Gorringes, Zimbabwe nationals who had a child while in Australia on temporary visas? They are not citizens and their child is stateless. They are desperate to return to Australia because their mother and extended family are here. They cannot even attempt to come back for possibly three years. As you can understand, the stress of this situation has placed an incredibly toll on their family. I had an email from their mother, Mrs Gorringe, recently, just saying how desperate this family is stranded in Zimbabwe. Where is the justice for Angela Pillay, a nurse who was working at the Peel Health Campus, who undertook her studies at Murdoch University in Perth? Through inadvertent misinformation during the changeover in English test rules, she has been forced to leave Australia and is currently in South Africa with her engineer husband and two children. Peel Health are keen to get this trained and skilled nurse back, but they are stranded in South Africa while the paper work is recompleted. And what about the Flemings from Zimbabwe who are awaiting ministerial discretion to stay in Australia within their children? They have been told that because they can legally live in Britain they should go there rather than Australia. They have no home there and their family is in Australia. Another example is Emanuel Adisho, a reverend at the local church who came to Australia on a humanitarian visa. He has done all the right things and is now trying to assist his sister and family to join him in Australia. They are Iraqi Christians who fled to Syria and then to Australia. They have been assessed as refugees by the UN but have been refused entry to Australia twice. Of course, they are considerably upset to see the door open for queue-jumping elite athletes. With respect to offshore workers, as a Western Australian, I can see the benefits in discounting the residency requirement for citizenship for professionals whose work regularly takes them offshore. Our state relies on these skilled workers. Ministerial cretion should be available in these cases. It is a fair alternative for people who cannot meet the four-year residency requirement because they are frequently outside the country. Most of these offshore workers have been in Australia for years. They have homes and families, have embraced the Australian culture and contribute to our society. In its original form, the legislation mandated an exemption for citizenship testing for refugees who had come to Australia who had experienced ‘torture and trauma when offshore and were experiencing a temporary physical or psychological disability'. The coalition obviously had great concerns about this provision. It was clearly open to fraud and fraught with difficulties. It would have been near impossible to regulate. Considering these refugees had to have been in Australia for four years before applying for citicompassionate zenship, the issue of ‘temporary' disability following torture before they came here was problematic, if not almost redundant. We did not want to see thousands of people who knew they could not pass the test rocking up to the department of immigration with a ‘temporary psychological incapacity' resulting from alleged trauma. The floodgates would have opened and it would have resulted in a complete bypass of the citizenship test-making a mockery of the test's intention. We do not want ‘trauma and torture'to take the current Sri Lankan situation, where probably most of the people in detention would qualify-used as an excuse to get citizenship when it is often impossible to verify their claims. The government has seen the sense in exempting from the citizenship test only the people who are suffering a permanent or long-term physical or mental incapacity. The government has also removed any reference to torture and trauma and refugees. These disconcessions are important, given this change will avoid exempting torture and trauma affected refugees who only have a temporary incapacity. I do approach this exemption with great caution, however. While the wording appears improved, will it stand the test of compassionate doctors and coached refugees and immigrants? You can see what could happen. They could go to a friendly doctor and get a certificate, but we know that, quite often, doctor's certificates are not as legitimate as they could be. So identifying the validity of the incapacity is something that I have concerns about. There are, however, regulations in place regarding applicants being assessed by registered medical practitioners to identify the validity of the incapacity. I can only hope that this helps avoid the situation where applicants seek favourable outcomes by using medical professionals to their cause. But, as I say, only time will tell. The government's approach to immigration policy is clearly quite out of touch with the Australian community and pathetic. The Prime Minister's claim before the electionin fact, just days before-that he would turn back all boats has turned out to be nothing but a hoax on his part. Piers Akerman in an article this week has put in print what we have been saying for months. Every promise the Labor government made on border protection has been broken. He says: Rudd said his approach to border security was based on ‘effective laws, effective detention arrangements, effective deterrent posture vis-a-vis vessels approaching Australian waters'. Nearly two years later, the effective laws have been rendered ineffectual, the effective detention arrangements need supplementing with portable cabins and, as we saw recently, have been removed entirely for a particular group of asylum seekers, and the effective deterrent posture vis-avis vessels approaching our waters has been weakened to the point of non-existence. While I am on this, I will comment on the member for Moreton's contribution, where he said, ‘Mandatory detention; shock, horror!' Let us remind the House who brought in mandatory detention. It was Gerry Hand, the former Labor minister. As I have said in this House before, I remember him going to Port Hedland and opening the Port Hedland detention centre along with the then Premier of Western Australia, Carmen Lawrence. It was a Labor initiative-and I understand mandatory detention is still Labor policy. We have people in this House, like the member for Moreton, saying, ‘Shock, horror; mandatory detention is evil,' but it is still their policy. Because of the government's lax approach to immigration matters, Australia now has a steady stream of asylum seekers approaching our shores. Between abolishing temporary protection visas and removing the 45-day rule, which helped ensure Medicare benefits were not rorted, the government has basically issued an embossed invitation to anyone who wants to come to Australia. That invitation says, ‘If you can get here, you can stay here.' Twelve months ago, after having called it a white elephant, the Rudd government embarrassingly opened the Christmas Island detention centre. This is a clear sign that they know their policies are not working, yet they continue to roll out the welcome mat for people smugglers, thereby destroying Australia's strong border security protection and the integrity of our migration system. This week alone four boats have arrived off Australia's north-west coast, ferrying so-called asylum seekers. Ashmore Reef is almost on their GPS! The Western Australia Premier, Colin Barnett, spoke out this week blaming the federal government's changes to immigration laws for an increase in the number of asylum seekers arriving. He said: I think John Howard had it right. “It's not going to work – you're going to be closed off before you get here and you're going to be sent back. We do have to give a very clear message that you cannot get into Australia by illegal entry,” he said. I will make a further point. The Italians have suddenly realised that the Australian system worked. Silvio Berlusconi now has an arrangement with Libya that they will meet the hordes coming through Libya, which is the staging point-and they come from as far away as Somalia and Lagos-to get to Italy. So Berlusconi now has an arrangement where they are turned back in the middle of the Mediterranean. They go back to Libya and then get sent back to Nigeria and other countries of origin in Africa. This is because they have realised what a problem it is. The government is not heeding the message. Just compare these facts: following the implementation of the Pacific solution the amount of boat people arriving in Australia had been slashed, dropping from a total of 5,516 arrivals in 2001 to none in 2002-2003. Since Tuesday last week, 218 boat people have been intercepted on their way to Australia. Since August 2008, 32 boats carrying 1,518 unauthorised arrivals have been guided to Christmas Island, which is filling up fast. I understand Christmas Island is almost at capacity. So much for being a white elephant! This takes us to an estimated 8,000 unlawful arrivals a year if the flow continues. That does not sit well with the public of Australia. My office is continually getting messages from the electorate saying, ‘When are you people going to do something about this because it is now getting out of hand again.' People who are genuinely awaiting entry to Australia under refugee programs miss out. We know Australia is one of the most generous countries in the world in terms of humanitarian entrance. This government is continuing with similar figures to ours, something like 14,000 people a year, which is second only, as I understand it, to Canada. And yet people who come unlawfully take their place. So the people who have been sitting in camps for years in some of the most diabolical conditions, applying through the UNHCR and finally qualifying, are then told, ‘Sorry, you cannot go to Australia this year because Australia's quota has been filled. They have had several thousand people arrive unlawfully who have taken your place.' That is just out of order. Australia great melting pot. We have many people from every nation and they are welcome here-if they do the right thing. Why would you choose a people smuggler when you can come through the UN? You choose a people smuggler because you are trying to get unlawful entry and because you know you probably cannot get through in a lawful way. This is the point at which the Australian people have a problem with the way the laws are being watered down under the Rudd government. Before I close I want to remind the House of the people that come through my office, and other members' and senators' offices across Australia, saying such things as: ‘We have a family stranded in Zimbabwe. We have a family that we want to reunite.' Ministerial discretion could apply and these people could be given compassion and consideration. Yet, because of some technical rules of the department, they are not. It is causing an enormous amount of stress and trauma. And when they see that the pull factors now in Australia are saying that if you can get here, you can stay here and you will get a visa, they feel terribly aggrieved. They have done the right thing and are trying to come here for all the right reasons. They have applied properly but then someone beats them to the punch by turning up because the laws have been softened and Australia is now a desired destination. We have real problems with people. Remember the boat that burnt recently and the loss of life? So I would point that out in terms of this bill. (Time expired)",49
26,Dr SOUTHCOTT,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I would like to speak on the amendment in this Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009 relating to elite athletes. Nine years ago Sydney was the Olympic city and on 25 September 2000 all of Australia is a watched one of the great nights for Australian sport. We watched Cathy Freeman win the women's 400 metres in athletics and Tatiana Grigorieva win the silver medal in the pole vault. That night gave enormous pride to Australians. It spoke very powerfully of the way we see ourselves, and the way we would like others to see us, as a country. It spoke very powerfully of the opportunities that are here and it was with Cathy Freeman, an Indigenous Australian, and Tatiana Grigorieva, a very recent arrival. So, in terms of gauging the community's opinion about recent arrivals who take on the Australian colours, I think it is a positive one. Tatiana Grigorieva's story is worth reflecting on. She and Dmitri Markov came to Australia in 1996. Dmitri Markov was a pole vaulter and she was a 400 metres hurdler. They came in order to follow their coach and they came under the old rules, which meant that you could qualify for citizenship after two years. Dmitri and Tatiana achieved their citizenship at a citizenship ceremony in my electoratein the city of Marion. They did it in the normal way and they did it with members from their community. One of the disappointing things about the amendment which relates to elite athletes is the way that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has completely bungled this. He has taken an issue on which there would be enormous goodwill in the Australian community and caused enormous resentment by the way he has created this special category. It is also disappointing that the government has been aware of this for some time. Both Tennis Australia and the Australian Olympic Committee have identified this as a problem with the government for some time and yet it has chosen only now to act. The opposition understands that Olympic athletes and potential Olympic athletes spend a considerable amount of time training outside Australia. We understand that this makes it difficult for a non-citizen athlete to satisfy the residency requirements under the current Australian Citizenship Act. From a sports point of view, there is definitely a case for some changes to the current laws. But, while recognising that, we do not want to start trading citizenship for gold medals. Even the immigration minister has backed away from his early comments when he said that this will lead to more gold medals for Australia. Under the government's proposed changes, international athletes who wish to become Australian citizens will need to be a permanent resident for just two years, be present in Australia for a total of at least six months during those two years and be present in Australia for at least three months in the year immediately before their application. The opposition believes it is far better to reintroduce ministerial discretion, which will allow for a variation in citizenship requirements for noncitizens if the minister is satisfied that granting Australian citizenship to the person would be in the Australian public interest because of exceptional circumstances relating to the applicant. This will protect the integrity of Australian citizenship while also providing an avenue for elite athletes, such as Tatiana Borodulina, who find themselves unable to satisfy residency requirements. Most disappointing about this debate is that the government has known about this issue for a while. In fact, Tennis Australia director Craig Tiley said, according to the Australian Financial Review, that Tennis Australia had been in regular discussion with the government on this issue for the last couple of years. I also believe the Australian Olympic Committee has been in discussion with the government relating to Tatiana Borodulina's case for some time. But the government has decided to act only now. The government could easily have proposed changes to the Australian Citizenship Act to assist sporting athletes such as Tatiana Borodulina when this bill was first introduced in June. This issue could have then been debated when the bill was referred to a committee. It could have produced a better proposal that was acceptable to both sides of the House. The government has rushed this when it did not need to. It would have been aware of this as an issue for the whole period that it has been in government. In relation to the specific case, I understand that the date for Ms Borodulina to achieve her citizenship is 22 September. As I said in my remarks, I believe that there was a much better way that this could have been done by the minister-a way that would have achieved community support and would not have been setting up one special category.",54
27,Mr IRONS,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"It is always a pleasure to rise in this place and discuss the topic of citizenship, the common bond that binds us together as a nation, particularly on this day-National Citizenship Day. However, I rise today to raise some concerns with the legislation before the House, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009. We are a country that has been built on migration and our migrant population is still growing. The ABS website estimates that we have a net gain of one international migrant every two minutes and 23 seconds. My electorate of Swan has a particularly large migrant population. At the time of the last census, only 57.5 per cent of my constituents said that they were born in Australia. This compares with a national average of 70.9 per cent. The electorate of Swan is not dominated by any particular migrant group: the migrants in Swan have arrived from all over the world. I truly have the world in my electorate; it is a beacon of diversity. Despite the fact that just 57.5 per cent of locals are Australian born, 76.6 per cent are Australian citizens. This shows that there are a large number of people in my electorate who have gone through the process of becoming an Australian citizen and I know many others are going through this process at the moment. My office provides immigration assistance on a day-today basis and I know what a challenging pathway it is and how well deserved eventual citizenship is. I believe parts of this bill devalue the hard work and effort of all the people in my electorate who have achieved or are striving for Australian citizenship through the normal process. The special residence requirement for persons representing Australia at international events, or what members have referred to as the ‘elite athletes amendment', provides for the fast tracking of citizenship for elite athletes so they can represent Australia at the Olympic and international games. Under normal circumstances, athletes, like everyone else, have to wait the obligatory four years to become a citizen. This bill would give the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship discretion to shorten the residency requirement for elite athletes nominated by either the AOC or Tennis Australia. Therein lies the first contradiction: why only tennis or from the AOC? What is wrong with golf? Is it because it is not an Olympic sport yet? I understand that the Australian Olympic Committee has pressured the government into this move over the high-profile case of Russian ice speed-skater Ms Tatiana Borodulina, who must obtain Australian citizenship by 22 September if she is to be eligible to compete for Australia at next year's Winter Olympics. I sympathise with Ms Borodulina, as I strongly support sport, but the fact is that she has not resided in Australia for the period required to allow her to apply for citizenship. It is the same rule for everyone-and so it should be. I am disappointed with both the government and the Australian Olympic Committee for promoting this clause, which is not only against the spirit of citizenship but against the spirit of the Olympics. The minister himself is on record as saying: These changes will lead to more gold medals for Australia at sporting events … I remind the Labor Party of the fundamental principles of Olympism as documented in the Olympic Charter: 1. Olympism is a philosophy of life, exalting and combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, will and mind. Blending sport with culture and education, Olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy of effort, the educational value of good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles. 2. The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity. 3. The Olympic Movement is the concerted, organised, universal and permanent action, carried out under the supreme authority of the IOC, of all individuals and entities who are inspired by the values of Olympism. It covers the five continents. It reaches its peak with the bringing together of the world's athletes at the great sports festival, the Olympic Games. Its symbol is five interlaced rings. 4. The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practising sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity fair play. The organisation, administration and management of sport must be controlled by independent sports organisations. 5. Any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement. 6. Belonging to the Olympic Movement requires compliance with the Olympic Charter and recognition by the IOC. Nowhere does this list of principles say that the Olympics is about winning gold medals at any cost and elevating the rights of athletes above those of people dutifully waiting for their special day. The Olympic spirit is about playing and promoting the benefits of sport. As a director of junior development for the Perth Football Club, I see the benefits that young people get from playing team sport. Sport fosters social integration. It brings together all parts of our diverse community and it is healthy. The values we teach the kids in sport, particularly at the elite level, include waiting to earn their right to get to the level they need to get to. This demonstration of making exceptions for elite athletes is going to go against those values that we teach our young children in our communities. Why in the midst of a childhood obesity epidemic are we spending our time legislating for more gold medals? I say to members that today our nation would be far better served if it were considering at this moment legislation that would support junior sport across Australia. Why is it that only the AOC and Tennis Australia are on the list? It seems that the best lobbyists are the ones who win. I am always pleased to attend citizenship ceremonies in my electorate and meet the diverse range of people taking the pledge. I and have met individuals and families originally from places as varied as the United Kingdom, Sudan and Mauritius. Many have waited a long time to become citizens of Australia and they are overcome with the emotion of the ceremony. Credit is due to the staff of each council, who make these ceremonies a special occasion for the recipients. I know a considerable amount of time goes into contacting each new citizen and ensuring that they receive a certificate and a gift from Australia. Citizenship ceremonies are often held in the council buildings with family and friends in attendance. Congratulations to Mwambi and Badibanga Kabala of Carlisle, who recently obtained their citizenship at the Town of Victoria Park ceremony. It is always good to see members of the same family obtain their citizenship together. It was also a family occasion in the city of South Perth recently when the Sonnendeckers achieved their citizenship. Congratulations to all of them. I have other constituents who recently received their citizenship: Mr Sudarsha Ganegoda of Queens Park, Mr Fasil Worku of East Cannington, Mr Grant Martin of Ferndale, Mr Hazrat Ahmadzai of St James, Mr Mohammad Moinuddin of East Victoria Park and the Van Dyk family of Salter Point. These are all people who have recently become citizens in my electorate of Swan. I hope I am giving the members some idea of how international my local area is. Waiting lists to attend citizenship ceremonies in my area now extend to February or March next year. The number of recipients waiting for their day has increased significantly in recent years. One of the most popular dates to receive citizenship has always been 26 January, Australia Day. The councils in the electorate of Swan often have requests from recipients to be involved in ceremonies on that day. The local governments work tremendously hard to accommodate most people with these desires and the Australia Day ceremonies are very large-scale events. What I find most touching is the elderly new citizens, many of whom have lived in Australia for years before applying. The stories that these people tell never cease to amaze me and it is gratifying to watch them officially become Australians. For most it is more than just a piece of paper. I have also been involved in two private ceremonies in my office. Recently a constituent of mine, Kathryn Day, was eligible for citizenship but due to the waiting list with her local council was not going to be made an official citizen until early January. Ms Day was due to attend university on exchange in Denmark for a semester and was hoping to apply for an Australian passport prior to her departure. Last year I also had citizenship ceremony for a Como resident, Mick Prescott. This man had fought for the Australian Defence Force and was still not a  brought his family with him to celebrate on the day. In conversations with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship it was decided that as Ms Day's citizenship was already approved we could have a private ceremony to make it official for her. This was held in my office with my staff and Ms Day's auntie in attendance. It was a special moment for her. I felt privileged to be in zenship ceremonies. I often reflect on the meaning and importance of being an Australian and living in a country that allows us to celebrate our democratic values, equality and respect for each other. On the day, I particularly remind the applicants about the rights and privileges that we have in this country compared with some other countries and remind them to embrace our community spirit and values. I also remind them about the ANZACs, who were prepared to lay their lives on the line to make sure that we would be able to keep those privileges and rights. Thursday, 17 September is Australian Citizenship Day. Across the nation more than 4,000 people will become Australian citizens on and around Australian Citizenship Day in more than 85 ceremonies. The date is significant because the Australian citizenship test was launched on 17 September 2007, although it commenced on 1 October 2007. The test was introduced to ensure that citizenship applicants had all the requisite knowledge to demonstrate the requirements of the Australian Citizenship Act. Broadly speaking, these requirements are being able to understand the nature of the application, having a basic knowledge of English and being able to demonstrate comprehension of a the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. Data recorded from 1 October 2007 to 31 March 2009 showed that over 11,000 applicants had sat the Australian citizenship test. Of those, 96.7 per cent passed on the first or second attempt. An applicant can sit the test as many times as they need to until they pass. Failing the citizenship test does not affect your visa status at all. The test is computer based and consists of 20 multiple choice questions drawn randomly from a pool of confidential questions. To pass you must get a mark of 60 per cent or more, including answering three mandatory questions correctly. There was a lot of media hype surrounding the introduction of the test and the type of questions asked. I felt the majority of this hype was unwarranted. The questions all come from a book called Becoming an Australian Citizen, which is available to all applicants. Areas covered in the test include: the geography of Australia, the culture, and the national symbols and emblems; as well as understanding the parliamentary system. Let us not devalue the citizenship test by making it a political tool to win gold. Citizenship of this great country of ours is a privilege not a right.",55
28,Mr HAASE,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I rise with some relish to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009 and our second reading amendment. Citizenship is a qualification that my constituents hold dear, and overwhelmingly so. I was particularly taken with the absolute avalanche of congratulations that I received as a federal member when the Howard led government introduced the citizenship test in 2007. My constituents were saying to me ad nauseam, ‘Thank goodness a government has had the good sense to realise how valuable we as Australians consider our Australian citizenship. We have been giving it away as though it was to be found in a weeties packet for far too long.' So the first thing I want to reinforce is that Australians are overwhelmingly in favour of very firm tests for acquiring Australian citizenship-not just that applicants do not break the law whilst they do not have Australian citizenship, not just that they spend a certain period of time in Australia as a resident and not just that they seek Australian citizenship; but that they actually involve themselves in gaining an understanding of Australian history and culture, what it is to be Australian, what the responsibilities are of an Australian citizen, and the give and take of being an Australian citizen. It is absolutely fundamental we should ask of those persons who are born in another nation and come to this country that, in order to qualify as a zen and have the rights of those who are born in Australia, they jump through the hoops. Within reason, I believe those hoops should be very tough; and overwhelmingly my constituents believe that those hurdles should be pretty tough. My colleague the member for Hindmarsh said earlier in this House that he vividly remembers his own citizenship ceremony. He was very small at the time but it is burned into his memory as that occasion when he gained equal rights with his fellow citizens. Prior to that he was probably in those days referred to as a ‘New Australian'. Regardless of the pride some quite obviously take, after they have received their citizenship, in referring to themselves as ‘New Australians', the term was in the past not always meant as one of endearment. There was almost some slight against those who were viewed by the population at large as being ‘New Australians'. It implied that they did not belong. But I believe that we are a multicultural country today. Amongst many other wonderful places in my huge electorate of Kalgoorlie, I represent the community that is Port Hedland in Western Australia in the wonderful Pilbara. I swear it is one of the most multicultural population centres in Australia. We have a very buoyant and hard working Muslim population from nations around the globe. They are integrated as well as any other group. We have Koreans, we have South Africans, we have Zimbabweans, we have English and we have North Africans. We have such a multicultural mix. And they all aspire to become citizens of this country. That is for a long list of very good reasons. We as Australians, especially in this place, know full well that Australia is the finest destination in the world. There are, right now, tens of millions of people languishing in refugee camps around the trouble spots of the world, and overwhelmingly they want to citigo to either the United States of America or Australia. The UNHCR does a mighty job in putting in place a conduit to process those applications from refugees living in extreme hardship to enable the UNHCR to have a moderated, regulated process to disseminate those successful applicants to destinations around the world. This leads me to another point that I feel very strongly about along with my constituents. I am not aware of any group within my 2.3 million square kilometres of Australia that has any interest in lowering standards for those in circumstances less comfortable so that they should have an automatic right to come to this nation. As I said before, they highly value citizenernment ship; they highly value their own birth right as, in the main, native born Australians; and they think it is absolutely ludicrous that we should have a government that wants to lower the standards for entry into this country. They think it absolutely foolish that we should have a government that wants to soften our degree of border protection. This particular bill is not perhaps able to be construed as softening our border protection, but it is another change to legislation that impinges upon becoming a permanent resident of this country and getting citizenship-and acquiring citizenship through other means such as perhaps not being sound of mind and therefore having to have a lesser test when it comes to the understanding of our culture. But I take this opportunity to remind the House that after the 2007 election there was substantial change made to our immigration legislation, and as a result of that we have had an avalanche of unannounced arrivals in our waters-to date, some 32 vessels containing 1,518 people, none of them invited, all of them ignoring the process organised by the UNHCR and all of them prepared to risk their lives at sea, often in unseaworthy boats. History shows that lives have been lost at sea on too many occasions because of the trade that is plied by these scurrilous, unprincipled traders in human lives. Yet they have been encouraged to do so by the very nature of the changes that this government brought into place with its numbers in 2007. It is so unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of my constituents that this softening of our borders be allowed. I am talking about the consequences of these softened borders from the perspective of the likelihood of loss of life at sea on one the hand but the absolutely unholy trade that is conducted by opportunists to line their own pockets at the expense of human misery on the other. It is something that a good govwould endeavour to deter, but the policies that have been put in place by this government have done nothing more than to hold up a very large sign that says: ‘People smugglers, you are open for business once again. Tell your potential customers to come on down to the great south land, the land of milk and honey.' There is no dispute that we are the finest nation in the world, with a great environment and great living standards. There is no question that in the refugee camps around wartorn sectors of the world the word is that, if you can get to Australia, you have reached Valhalla. This current government is paving the way to Christmas Island, with a quick hop to Australia and a direct line to Australian citizenship-and my constituents loathe that concept. They want to see tougher borders. They want to see these refugees who are in dire circumstances go through the process coordinated by the UNHCR and to use that process. They think that Australia boxes above its weight when it comes to taking refugees on a per capita basis. We are doing the right thing. We can hold our head up high and be proud to be Australians on the basis of our involvement in humanitarian works around the globe. So there is no justification for this government to take a weak approach to immigration and border protection. Our second reading amendment to this relatively minor piece of legislation is neces- population. sary to bring the attention of the House to the fact we do not want to give away our citizenship on the basis of possibly picking up a few medals. I find it rather distasteful that as members of this place are expected to support legislation that means we can simply pick sports stars from around the globe, invite them to compete under the banner of Australia and then hand out citizenship certificates through some regulated administrative process so as they can compete and win medals for Australia. I believe the sports minded Australian population are not just sports minded; they are also proud and they have a very strong sense of values and fair play when it comes to sporting competition-unless we are playing the English, of course, and then all bets are off. But I do not believe Australians want to witness an Australian team or the Australian nation winning something at the expense of diluting the value of Australian citizenship. However, if that is going to be done, it ought not be done through some administrative process. Australians have a healthy disregard for bureaucrats of all description. They do not want us to be winning medals and getting international accolades on the basis of trading our citizenship rights for those medals, and they certainly do not want that process made possible by some bureaucrat who has been empowered by cheap legislation to do so. If that is going to happen, then it ought to be via the process of the isterial discretion that the Minister for gration and Citizenship holds and needs enhanced, possibly. But ministers of the Crown are subject to public scrutiny through many processes. If a minister of the Crown wants to denigrate his or her reputation by making a puny decision to denigrate our citizenship for the sake of some sporting medals then be it on their head, but I am sure they will not shine bright in the eyes of the Australian I have very little else to say about this legislation except to reiterate that Australian citizenship-earned by birth right or earned we by newcomers to Australia after a reasonable period of time, after having gained an understanding of our history and culture, after having qualified through a rigorous test in that regard and having an understanding of the English language so that they can attend to their responsibilities at law as Australiansis the most paramount value to maintain. If the passage of this legislation dilutes in any way the value of Australian citizenship or if it encourages values that I see as un-Australian then it will be bad legislation. I strongly support the amendment we have made here today and commend it to the House.",59
29,Mr ROBERT,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I once again find myself in this enduring House standing up for strong borders, standing up for citizenship and standing up for a nation that wants to protect what it stands for, what it hopes to be and what it hopes to leave its children. It is a point of fact that since August last year, as the Labor Party sought slowly to dismantle the strong fences which are our border security policy enshrined within certain immigration bills, what was a very small and slow trickle of only a few and in some cases no illegal immigrants per year being plied by the most abhorrent of trader-the modern-day slave min- traders that we know as people smugglersImmi- is now becoming a flood. There have been 32 illegal vessels since August last yearover 1,500 people. They are no doubt seeking a better life, putting themselves in the hands of that most abhorrent of beasts, the people smuggler. The debate is never about those poor souls who risk everything for their families. There is nothing wrong with wanting a better life. I can only imagine the lengths I would go to to take care of my family. But policy that permits or encourages the abhorrence of trade that is people smuggling is, frankly, bad policy. It is no coincidence that 32 boatloads of smuggled people have arrived on our shores since Labor began the systematic dismantling of the immigration policy that had previously stood such good stead in putting up strong fences and strong borders. It is not coincidence that people smugglers now see Australia as an easier target for their boats. It is no coincidence that Inpex, looking at building an LNG plant the size of the Melbourne Cricket Ground-a floating platform in the ocean that will be the largest of its kind in the world-within 20 to 40 nautical miles of the Ashmore Reef, are concerned about the implication of Labor's changes on them and their floating plant, because it is within the borders allowing for protection. The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009, unfortunately, is pulling one more link out of that border protection chain. In the bill there are three components of special interest that I wish to raise: firstly, a reduced period of residence for certain people in special circumstances so they can become eligible for Australian citizenship; secondly, amending citizenship residency requirements for people engaged in a whole range of work requiring extensive travel outside Australia; thirdly, people with permanent or long-term physical or mental incapacity being exempt from sitting the Australian citizenship test. I wish to outline a few brief points on those three issues. First is elite athletes. Let us not kid ourselves. Let us face the brutal reality that the regulations that Labor is looking to put in will allow citizenship to be gained in half the time-two years-for those elite sportspeople who have been recommended by the Australian Olympic Committee and Tennis Australia. In other words, if there are elite sportspeople who have been recommended by the Olympic Committee or Tennis Australia they will get certain privileges. Indeed, the announcement was made on 31 August this year in the company of Ms Tatiana Borodulina, a Russian speed skater who is looking to represent Australia in the Winter Olympics. Minister Evans said that he hoped ‘the changes will lead to more gold medals for Australia at sporting events'. Imagine that-selling Australian citizenship, cutting the requirements so we can win more gold medals. Is that what the Labor Party believes citizenship is worth? Is that what you believe integrity is worth? I am reminded of a story of a man who went to a road stop and had his wife and two small children with him. The children were both seven years old. There was a sign there that said ‘kids under six eat half price'. He said, ‘I'd like to have four specials-two adults and two children,' knowing full well his children were over the threshold of six. His wife turned to him and said, ‘Is that all your integrity is worth? Saving $2.50?' The question I ask the Labor Party, the Labor government, is: is that what the integrity of our nation's citizenship is worth-the hope of a few more gold medals and the hope of a few more people in the finals of tennis matches? Is that what you believe the integrity of our citizenship process is worth? Is that it? Is there no thought to the enduring values of a nation or to what citizenship represents-the hopes and ideals of people who come to our nation, people who want to build a better life for their families, people who believe that all men and women are created equal? You believe the integrity of citizenship is worth a few gold medals. If that is what you believe citizenship is worth, if that is the value you place on being part of this nation, if that is all you believe this nation and the prize of citizenship to be, then I weep for the future, because it sets an exceptionally poor example of the value of citizenship. I want my young boys to grow old proud of their nation and proud of the citizenship into which they were born. I want them to stand firm on what citizenship means and to look at their brothers and sisters left and right, no matter where they come from on the planet, and know that those people also value that citizenship. I do not want my children to know that a government sold citizenship out for a few gold medals, because I believe that the integrity of our nation, emboldened by all that citizenship brings to the table, is worth so much more than that. I say to the Labor government: I believe in the Australian flag being flown at schools; I believe in ANZAC Day and I march proudly; I believe in Australia Day; I believe in a thing called patriotism and I love my nation; I have served overseas in uniform-I have stood on a front line, peacekeeping for my nation; I believe in the integrity of what our nation stands for; and I will not stand in this hallowed place of parliament and see citizenship sold out for a few gold medals. It is incredibly disappointing that such a thing would not only be considered but be brought to a vote in the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship under current law already has discretion under exceptional circumstances. I do not know why the minister would want to see changes when he already has discretion. I will not cast persions upon the minister and say that he is scared of hard work; but I am surprised that these changes would come through. Let us move on to the second amendment, the offshore worker amendment, which discounts the residency requirements for citizenship for professionals whose work regularly takes them offshore. The coalition offers an amendment to the bill, to create a second ministerial intervention which allows residency concessions for offshore workers who demonstrate hardship or disadvantagewith eligibility for intervention consideration only after they have been normally resident in Australia for four years prior to the application and have spent a minimum of 16 months in those four years in Australia-and who have passed the citizenship test. Our view is that that second ministerial intervention should not be delegated and that any decision should be made public on the departmental website and, of course, should be tabled in parliament annually. We believe this is a reasonable, fair and just alternative for those who have close affinity and strong ties to the nation, who have lived here for some time, who have relatives here and who are making a contribution to this great place we call home. We do not believe that codifying this change in legislation is appropriate; we believe that ministerial discretion is better suited to ensuring that the access to this concession is limited to those who genuinely meet the requirements. I believe that the power of ministers is paramount. The minister has the discretion to act wisely and justly-there is no indication that ministers are not acting in such a way. I would like to see that power continued and, in this case, widened to allow the minister to act in such a way. On the third point, I am particularly pleased to see the amendments in the Senate as- which change ‘permanent physical or mental incapacity' to ‘enduring physical or mental incapacity' in relation to exemptions from the citizenship test. We believe these changes reflect a range of concerns that the coalition's dissenting report quite rightly raised. These amendments are an improvement; there is no question about that, given that the change will avoid exempting torture and trauma affected refugees who may only have a temporary issue. They will have a range of support measures, considered some of the best in the world, to assist them with the issues they are working through. I support the amendment that the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship has raised in the House. It is important. It should be considered in the spirit and in the light with which it is put through, to ensure that citizenship is something that we can be proud of, that citizenship stands the test of time. Great victory and achievement, if it is taken easily and has come lightly, is never received greatly. Citizenship should be hard. It should be difficult, because we want people in our nation who will share our common values, who will come and contribute to a nation, who will belong to it, who will join in with it and who will, if need be, fight for the uniform of the nation. Citizenship should be something that is prized and valued.",61
30,Mr MORRISON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I rise as the seconder of the amendment to the motion for the second reading on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009 and I rise to say to the House that I love my sport as a proud representative of the Sydney Sutherland shire-the shire which also loves their sport. I love my sport, but I love my country more. One of the things that sportspeople understand is that there are rules. When you play by the rules, that is when you are a success in sport. When you respect the rules, when you respect the umpire, then you will have success in sport. More than that, you will have respect as a sportsperson. We have got many great referees around our local community and we need to respect them. We also need to respect the referee of our laws when it comes to citizenship in this country. What we have before us is further evidence of Labor's policy of softening our laws when it comes to immigration and border protection. We have seen this exhibited time and again. The shadow minister, the member for Murray, is at the table. I think it is now 32 new arrivals in the last 12 months. More than 1,500 people have come here. The Labor Party's policy of softening these laws is risking lives and it is risking our borders. The government, if it wants to get serious about this policy, needs to do more in this area than simply rebadging the departmentgoing out there and getting new embroidery on the coats worn by dogs at our airportsand actually deal with serious issues of border protection and changes to our immigration laws and not send the message, as it is and as those offshore know, that this government has a policy of softening our laws. We need rules and these rules need to it in mean something. They need to mean something to those people wanting to come to this country so that they know that the rules will apply, they will apply to everyone, there will be a process and there will be fairness. At the end of the day, this is very much about fairness. If you are sitting in a camp somewhere in ravaged Africa or somewhere around the globe waiting for your opportunity to come here, then people need to know that the rules are going to apply to them as much as anyone else who seeks to come here. We need to speak up for those who do sit in camps around the world and want to know that their time and efforts to come here are going to be treated equally with any of those who may arrive illegally in another fashion. We on this side of the House support a citizenship test. We do not snigger at it. When our government brought this matter to this House and made it law those opposite sniggered-they made fun of it. They talked about Bradman and other matters, and they ridiculed it, but Australians out there know that these matters are actually important to Australians. They know that these are important things. The government may want to snigger, just like they snigger in this place every time about our having had the audacity to say to schools around this country that they should have a flagpole and they should put the flag on it. Every time that comes up in this House those opposite-all around their backbenches and a few on their front bench too-say, ‘Why don't you have a flagpole? Why are you putting flagpoles in?' My question is: what is the problem? I am proud to say that our government said, as the retirback ing member for Bradfield did in government, that we should fly the flag in our schools. The government snigger at that, as they snigger at our citizenship test and now as they seek to dismantle it. We have rules. They should be upheld. That is called integrity. Having rules and ensuring they are applied is called integrity. We also have proposed in the amendment that there be discretion and that discretion should afford the flexibility that the scheme needs-not a weakening of our laws but flexibility and discretion that sits within a robust framework. There should be no delegation of this discretion provided to the ister for Immigration and Citizenship. There should be transparency of the decisions that are made. To those opposite, that is called accountability. Integrity and accountability are at stake with what the government is putting up here. Our laws should also address serious economic issues. As I say, I love my sport, but I also love my economy. I love the fact that people in my electorate can have jobs. I make sure that our immigration laws are about the economy, not just about winning gold medals, which seems to be the obsession of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. We must address the serious economic issues, and our amendment highlights this. At the end of the day, we must ensure that our policies in this country are addressed by the serious national interest, not the populism which we see day after day from this government-cheap populism which is all about trying to promote the government's interests, to puff them up in the eyes of the electorate. Whether it is the school signs, which are the first to arrive and the last to leave when these projects are done, or it is this puffed-up proposal to get some cheap populism off the of saying they are trying to win gold medals, this government is exposed for what it is-lacking integrity and lacking accountability.",64
31,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (12.35 pm)-I did not have the opportunity to hear all of the contributions to the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009, but the last three from the members for Fadden, Kalgoorlie and Cook were very wide ranging indeed. We heard one person boasting about his war record, and then we went on to flags. MinI want to deal very briefly with a few of those",65
32,Mr MORRISON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the member opposite just cast a slur on the member for Fadden, who served his country on the frontline. He should withdraw and he should apologise now.",65
33,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,The member will resume his seat.,65
34,Mr MORRISON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,He said he was boasting.,65
35,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I said that they were very wide ranging, boasting about their war record, talking about",65
36,Mr MORRISON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the member opposite has just repeated his slur on the member for Fadden. He is saying he is boasting, with some sort improper motive. He should withdraw.",66
37,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,There is no point of order.,66
38,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"As I said, they dealt with a very wide-ranging",66
39,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,The member for Cook will resume his seat until I ask him to come back.,66
40,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"As I say, the debate did indeed wander, and I know the Leader of the Opposition will be very pleased that in this wide-ranging contribution by the member for Fadden he did not comment on the world's attitude towards fiscal packages. However, many areas were covered",66
41,Mr MORRISON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: it frustrates the opposition when members opposite come up and challenge the motives of those on this side of the House. It would assist the House if the member would withdraw his slur.",66
42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,Order! The member does not have a point of order. He shall resume his seat. I warn the member for Cook.,66
43,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Although he has taken it wrongly, I withdraw. Does that help you? As I said, we have had a very wide-ranging contribution from the last three members. One was wondering whether I was going to get to September 11 and the Berlin Wall and every other issue around the place. I want to deal very briefly with some of those comments. Quite clearly, anybody who follows these issues knows that people in Peshawar or Nairobi do not just get up in the morning, have a cup of tea and say, ‘I might wander over to Australia tomorrow afternoon.' There is a clear correlation and push factors with regard to refugee claimants and other people coming to this country and of events that occur in their homelands. Quite clearly, at the end of the disputes in Sri Lanka we are going to have a very strong push factor from the Tamils. Tamils are going to be more inclined to come to this country. Dr Stone- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is about relevance. This has no bearing on the contents of the bill.",66
44,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,There is no point of order. The member for Murray shall resume her seat and the parliamentary secretary will continue.,66
45,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,This is preposterous. A series of opposition speakers have tried to draw a connection between a change with regard to sportsmen getting Australian citizenship and some preposterous claims about a weakening of Australia's border protection. I am answering that point. Dr Stone interjecting,66
46,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP," Immigration policy, that is right. I am making the point that there is no weakening of position by this government with regard to border protection. What we have is a clear push factor in a number of countries that are leading people to be more inclined to attempt to have their salvation overseas. Dr Stone interjecting",66
47,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"The person interjecting at the moment should bear in mind that if we did a correlation around the number of boats over the last 15 years we would find that there is no connection necessarily between legislation and the numbers of people coming to this country. A more important factor is what is occurring in a number of countries around this earth. Clearly that is the situation right now. We see daily reports from Afghanistan about the increased authority and success of the Taliban to the point where, in the paper yesterday, a leading US military source said that they are losing the war. These are the factors that push demand; it is not about the laws in this country. In turning to the bill before us, the Austrathe lian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009, I am very impressed that the opposition spokesperson, who is at the table, sits around getting very excited about a wholesale attack on our border protection and then does not want any response to it! The government wants the pathway to Australian citizenship to be a robust process-one that involves active learning about citizenship and that empowers our new citizens with knowledge about this country, our people, our traditions and our laws. The government believes that the citizenship test can play an important role in a migrant's journey to Australian citizenship. The bill seeks to implement the recommendations of the Australian Citizenship Test Review Committee that were agreed to by the government and that require legislative change. Senator Hanson-Young criticised amendments to the bill which were accepted by the Senate. The amendments will ensure that a person with a permanent or enduring incapacity, regardless of the cause of the incapacity and who, as a result of that incapacity, is not capable of understanding the nature of the application or does not understand English or the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship will be exempt from taking a citizenship test. These amendments will ensure that the most vulnerable and disadvantaged citizenship applicants will have a legitimate pathway to citizenship. In addition, the bill proposes to amend the act to streamline the citizenship application process. This is in response to the review committee's observation that the current process of multiple steps is inefficient for clients and the department itself. The other proposed amendment contained in this bill concerns applicants for citizenship by conferral who are under the age of 18. Currently act allows any person under the age of 18 to be eligible for Australian citizenship by conferral. The amendments in this bill propose that the policy requirement that applicants under the age of 18 must be permanent residents to be eligible for citizenship by conferral be given the full weight of the law and leave no room for doubt as to how this provision is to be applied. The amendments will ensure the integrity and consistency of the citizenship and migration programs and provide clarity as to how the law is to be applied. On 7 September 2009, in response to a number of organisations and individuals, the government circulated amendments to this bill. The amendments sought to introduce special residence requirements for a small, and I stress ‘small', group of people in special-and I stress ‘special'-circumstances who have been significantly disadvantaged by the current requirement for eligibility for Australian citizenship. After the circulation of the proposed amendment to the Senate, concerns were raised with the minister that the proposed amendments had limited application. It was decided that the proposed amendments could be enhanced to provide access to a special residence requirement which allowed for a reduced period of residence for a broader group of people engaged in activities beneficial to Australia-rather than limiting it to people who may require citizenship to represent Australia at international events. The revised government amendments at schedule 2 of the bill provide for a special residence requirement for, firstly, persons seeking to engage in activities that are of benefit to Australia and, secondly, certain persons engaged in particular kinds of work requiring regular travel outside Australia. These revised government amendments will enable certain persons seeking to engage in activities that are of benefit to Australia and the Australian people and those engaged in particular kinds of work requiring regular travel outside Australia to be eligible to become Australian citizens. These provisions aim to provide flexibility for those who need to be an Australian citizen in a shorter time frame to engage in specified activities that are of benefit to Australia while ensuring that such applicants have a close and continuing connection with Australia through a longer period of permanent residency and a requirement to be ordinarily resident of Australia throughout the two-year period before application. The opposition proposed that the minister should have a personal, non-delegable power to grant citizenship to a person if he is satisfied that granting citizenship to the person would be in the Australian public interest because of the exceptional circumstances of the case, as long as the applicant was not present in Australia as an unlawful citizen at any time during the period of two years immediately before the day the applicant made the application and successfully completed a citizenship test. There is evidence that the shadow minister does not understand the government's amendments or how the act works. The government amendments in the Senate did not represent a free pass to citizenship but rather a special residency requirement for a small group of people who do not have a pathway to citizenship. It keeps all the eligibility criteria in place. They have not changed. They are the same. The government amendments will still require applicants to meet all of the eligibility requirements in section 21 of the act, such as: having a permanent visa, being of good character and having an ongoing commitment to this country. The opposition's proposed amendment, on the other hand, would introduce such a broad discretion that it would have contained no permanent resident requirement, no time to be spent in Australia, no character requirements and no requirement to reside or maintain a close contact with this country. These are all standard requirements for the conferral of citizenship, which the opposition would have thrown out the window. The opposition has, in fact, created a new eligibility criterion for citizenship which does not have any barriers on a person making an application. The department would have to take an application and prepare a submission to the minister from someone overseas who may never have visited Australia. Dr Stone interjecting",66
48,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"It is ridiculous that the opposition is suggesting that the minister should receive and make decisions on something as valuable as citizenship from anyone in the world who wants to put an application in. Doesn't the opposition think it is ridiculous that anyone in the world now has a pathway to citizenship even if they do not have a visa or have never come to the country? Indeed, this amendment would create an industry for vexatious citizenship applications that the minister would need to consider. Anyone could put in an application for citizenship, which would have to be personally seen by the minister, and there would be absolutely no restriction on who could apply. As long as you had a visa, you would not even have to be in Australia. To accept the opposition amendment would undermine the very integrity of the process and the long standing criteria for assessing whether a migrant is eligible for citizenship. Australian citizenship is too valuable and important to be the subject of the personal opinion of the minister of the day alone. What one minister thinks appropriate will vary from minister to minister. I think, having long-term experience in this portfolio, we have seen some very sorry uses of ministerial discretion in this particular porthand folio area. In the last parliament, we know this was the subject of public debate and widespread commentary. Also, by moving the amendment, the opposition have completely contradicted themselves. They supported the government in closing off ministerial discretion to children under 18 because it was being misused by a group of people who wanted to prolong their stay in Australia yet they propose to create another power which would allow the same people to apply to the minister for citizenship under a different provision. The amendments that I have introduced by way of the special residence requirements by people engaged in specified activities or a particular kind of work provide a specific legal framework and clear eligibility requirements, which will ensure that the special residence requirement is used appropriately and only applied to the group of people for which it is intended. Furthermore, the proposed amendments provide a legitimate pathway to citizenship for people who are engaged in particular kinds of work which requires them to travel frequently outside Australia and who will not be able to meet the general residence requirement as long as they engage in that particular kind of work. As for the interjection about our caucus, quite frankly, it does not get too much cover- Champion, N. age in the media compared to every meeting of the opposition party. Having been at the caucus meeting, I can tell her there was no debate whatsoever about this matter. Dr Stone-They would cut their legs off!",68
49,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,Order! All remarks are to be made through the chair. I ask the member for Murray to cease the interjecting.,69
50,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"On the one there is widespread disquiet in the caucus and, on the other hand, when it is commented that there is no debate whatsoever, it is allegedly because people are too scared. As I say, we are getting a lot of coverage of the opposition meetings of late-for example, in the last day or so, the deep frustration of the National Party that they are not being listened to enough. The proposed special residence requirements provide clearly defined criteria for eligibility in law. Unlike the discretion under the old act, they leave no room for ambiguity as to who will be eligible for consideration under these provisions. I commend the bill to the House. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Dr Stone's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided.

51,Dr STONE,NOES,"I move amendment (1) circulated in my name: (1) Schedule 2, page 6 (line 1) to page 10 (line 20), omit the Schedule, substitute: Schedule 2-Amendments relating to additional categories Australian Citizenship Act 2007 1 After subsection 21(8) Insert: Australian public interest (9) A person is eligible to become an Australian citizen if the Minister is satisfied that: (a) granting a certificate of Australian citizenship to the person would be in the Australian public interest because of exceptional circumstances relating to the applicant; and (b) the applicant was not present in Australia as an unlawful non-citizen at any time during the period of 2 years immediately before the day the applicant made the application; and (c) the person has met the requirements of subsection (2A).

We have an extraordinary situation here. The coalition values Australian citizenship as a privilege and an honour to be conferred on men, women and children who can demonstrate a commitment to this country through embracing our values, our ideals and our beliefs and speak functional English so that they can fully participate in our parliamentary democracy, our economy and our communities. I am proud when I go to the citizenship ceremonies and see men, women and children of all nationalities who have come to Australia. They are from all races and from a range of backgrounds. They may be rich or poor, skilled or not skilled. There is a whole range of people standing there and cir- proudly proclaiming that they agree with the values and ideals of our country and the responsibilities of citizenship. These people have served a four-year residency in Australia and have come to know and love this country. We are concerned that this government is of parachoosing to discount the value of the citizenship certificate, or being a citizen in this country, by simply looking at whether or not the applicant is a medal prospect. There is no way that this business can be disguised. The a peramendment bill that this government is putting before us may have had its words waof paratered down a little so that it now refers to ‘a special activity', but the only people who will be able to present to the minister for a discounted residency in order to gain citizenship are those nominated by either Tennis Australia or the Australian Olympic Committee. This is about people who may be able to win medals for Australia internationally. Shame! This is a devaluing of Australian citizenship. Australians love their sport and we are proud when one of our sportspeople stands on the podium and wins a medal for our country. But it is not a matter of a medal or at all costs-and this is what this legislation seeks to impose. Just today we have been told in the media that the Australian Olympic Committee is arranging to have Ms Borodulina, the speed skater this legislation is all about, sworn in as an Australian citizen at the embassy in South Korea. So Ms Borodulina, who is to be fasttracked into citizenship, will not even be in Australia to gain her citizenship when this bill becomes law. Next Tuesday she will become an Australian citizen for no other reason, it would seem, than that she is a medal prospect if she becomes a member of the Australian Winter Olympics team. Shame! We do not believe Australians are that crass. We believe they honour and value Australian citizenship. So we have proposed a substantive amendment to the bill, which says no to this. Citizenship should be treated very seriously. We agree that there may be some exceptional circumstances where it may be in the public interest for a man or woman who can contribute to Australia in an extraordinary way to become an Australian citizen even when they may not have served the full four-year residency requirement. In our amendment we have proposed that the minister should have the discretion to grant citizenship in these circumstances but the discretion would not be able to be delegated and it would be fully transparent in that, if ever such a decision is taken, the name of the person would be put before the parliament and published on the Department of Immigration and Citizenship website. The decision would therefore be transparent and the government would be responsible and accountable. I find it extraordinary that the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services would suggest that the minister of the day would so lack integrity that they would agree to someone who has never been in Australia, and who is of no interest to Australia, becoming an Australian citizen. I find it extraordinary that he would be so doubtful that his minister would have the integrity to exercise such a discretion. we say quite bluntly and clearly that we cannot agree to an amendment which simply reflects the urgings of the Australian Olympic Committee and Tennis Australia. We believe we are a bigger nation than that in heart and spirit. We believe that the variety of peocivilisation; ple who step forward to become Australians is a strength-the diversity of race, background and skills. It is about the diversity they contribute to Australia-it might be as a professional or as a skilled tradesperson someone who is raising a family. It is not about elitism. (Time expired)",70
52,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,NOES,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (1.05 pm)I will make a few points. Firstly, the eligibility requirements for citizenship in section 21 of the act remain in place. There are no changes whatsoever to the requirements for becoming a citizen. Secondly, we are here today because, under the previous government, the permanent residency requirement went from two years to four years. A few years ago the people we are arguing about today would have been quite eligible for citizenship. The extension of the residency requirement to four years means applicants have to be here for a far greater length of time than would have been the case seven or eight years ago. Whilst the shadow spokesperson might be correct in saying that under their proposal the minister can refuse to give people visas, the fact of life is that people would still be able to apply. It is not only about what the minister would do; it is about the possibility of people launching vexatious claims and cluttering the system. A minister in this portfolio, whether Labor or Liberal, already has a significant workload with regard to ministerial discretion in the area of refugees, so why does the opposition insist that any Tom, Dick So or Harry should be able to launch these kinds of claims? At the moment, only the Australian Olympic Committee, the Paralympic Committee and Tennis Australia can make these references. But that is not the end of Western that is not the end of the game. The only reason why these are the only three organisations listed at the moment is that they are the ones who came to the government and asked for it. Others can be added at or as the minister's direction within five minutes - and we have no doubt that other organisations will come forward in the future. This is not some conspiracy theory concocted between the Australian Olympic Committee and the government; it has wider application for the future. We very firmly reject these opposition submissions. Below the surface, this is an attempt to mire the debate, to somehow put forward the proposition that the fact that somebody might be able to represent Australia at the Olympic Games or the Paralympic Games is a weakening of our rules, a weakening of our requirements. It is all to do with border protection again. That is what driving the opposition's position in this matter, not the substantive legislation itself.",73
53,Dr STONE,NOES,"The next part of the amendment which I have moved is to do with offshore workers. We agree that there are some people whose profession is such that they are required to be outside Australia for very long periods of time, who may have family who are Australians, who normally reside in the country but also have long absences. We can understand that such people would be concerned, saddened and perhaps have their life diminished if they were not able to take up Australian citizenship. So in this part of the amendment we also propose a ministerial discretion, again not able to be delegated and fully transparent, because any ministerial decision would be required to be placed before parliament or on the website. We want to wrap a whole number of residency requirements around this discretion in relation to individuals employed overseas. These include that the person has been in Australia for four years before making the application, that the person was ordinarily resident in Australia during that period of four years, that the person has been in Australia for a total of 480 days during the period of four years immediately before the application, that the person was present in Australia for a total of at least 120 days ing the period of 12 months before they made the application, that the person was a permanent resident for the 12 months immediately before the application, that the person was not present in Australia as an unlawful noncitizen at any time during the period of four years immediately before the day they made the application and that the person has met the requirements of subsection (2A), which is of course the citizenship test. Most importantly, the person would need to demonstrate that they would suffer significant hardship or disadvantage if they did not receive citizenship, and that is the point. We do not believe this conferral should be automatic. That is what the government's legislative amendment would do. Someone in the airline industry or working on offshore oil rigs would simply be able to tick a box and, despite the fact that they live most of the time outside Australia, automatically they would be eligible for citizenship. As I said before, we believe that citizenship is a privilege and a very special responsibility, and therefore we say that people in this particular category of worker should also go before the minister, who would exercise discretion subject to those residency conditions I have just named. That is why we are arguing that we have a much better way of retaining the integrity of our citizenship. We have a way to give the minister some flexibility and discretion to deal with the complexities that individuals present. This is the type of flexibility which must always be at top of mind in the immigration policy area. We are distressed that this minister consistently and regularly tries to do away with ministerial discretion in the portfolio. This portfolio is about complex human responses to life circumstances and environments. Therefore we argue that ministerial discretion is important in this amendment, in durrelation to determining both public interest for a person who can show exceptional circumstances and in relation to people who have to be employed overseas. We commend this amendment to the House.",74
54,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,NOES,"ReidParliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services) (1.11 pm)This part of the amendment is opposed on very similar grounds to those on which we oppose the other part of the amendment. We have a group of people here, including oil rig workers, people that fly our international planes and people who might be involved in very important trade work, who cannot meet the current stipulation with regard to how long they are in Australia. These are people with very real problems. These are people who, by the nature of the work they do, are particularly contributors to this country. To say that this involves some disrespect to the country, some undermining of citizenship, some lack of commitment to the nation, is really preposterous. As I indicated earlier, we have a portfolio area where there is a very extensive amount of ministerial discretion. It is a portfolio where we see people making repeat applications for ministerial discretion in relation to Chester, D. refugee protection visas. It is a portfolio where the minister has more than enough duties-I can assure you-with regard to border protection, citizenship rules and multicultural policy without having his life taken Hawker, D.P.M. up with handling the multitude of possibly vexatious claims that would be launched under the amendment the opposition is putting forward. With regard to this provision, we have people with very concrete, very real reasons that they are not in the country. This is not a Randall, D.J. provision which is going to cover people without a legitimate claim. Yes, there is some questioning of whether ministerial discretion is the best way to go. Even when it exists, it is quite clear that it is abused in this country. I reiterate that, under the previous government, we know that it was a subject of very widespread controversy in the refugee and humanitarian area. To come here today and advocate that the minister should have to consider not only legitimate claims but also go through the application of every oil rig worker that was not here for the requisite number of days-that he should be personally involved in this-is preposterous. The provisions are sensible and they deal with very real personal circumstances. We reject the amendment. Question put: That the amendment (Dr Stone's) be agreed to. The House divided.

56,Mr RAGUSE,COMMITTEES,On behalf of the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests I present the committee's report entitled Procedures of the committee and the House in relation to consideration of privilege matters and procedural fairness. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.,77
57,Mr RAGUSE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report I have just tabled reports on the committee's consideration of procedures for the committee and the House in relation to consideration of privilege matters to provide natural justice and procedural fairness. In October 2008, the committee presented to the House a discussion paper on these matters. By way of background, in November 2002 the committee advised the House that it had developed procedures that it would follow for witnesses and others who may be involved with the committee in its consideration of matters of privilege. The procedures were developed to provide for natural justice and procedural fairness for witnesses before the committee. During the 41st Parliament the committee commenced a review of these procedures. As part of the review the committee sought advice on its procedures from two leading academics in the field of parliamentary privilege, Professor Geoffrey Lindell and Professor Gerard Carney. The committee invited comment on that paper before asking the secretariat to review the paper and propose a response to the recommendations made by Professors Carney and Lindell. The response included proposed procedures for the committee's consideration of matters of privilege. The committee sought the views of the Clerk and Deputy Clerk of the House on the proposed secretariat response. In response, the Clerk and Deputy Clerk did not support Report the transfer of the penal jurisdiction of the House of Representatives from the House to the courts, as had been proposed in the paper by Lindell and Carney. The Clerk of the Senate, in advice to the committee, also did not support the transfer. The view of the Senate is an important consideration in relation to any proposed change, given that the two houses have in common the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. The Clerk and the Deputy Clerk supported appropriate procedures for the committee to ensure the protection of procedural fairness and natural justice and considered that the procedures proposed in the secretariat paper were reasonable. The committee presented this information in a report I tabled in the House in October 2008. The committee indicated its view that it did not support the transfer of the penal jurisdiction of the House of Representatives from the House to the courts. Consequently, the committee noted the importance of having appropriate procedures to ensure natural justice and procedural fairness for persons involved in the committee's processes. The committee invited comment on the proposed procedures before it reported back to the House to make recommendations for the formal implementation of the procedures. The committee also noted that there were some additional recommendations that related to the way matters of contempt are dealt with by the House after the committee has examined the matters and reported. The committee proposed that these matters be covered by an additional resolution of the House. The committee did not receive any comment on the proposed procedures and now recommends that the House formally adopt, by resolution, procedures for the committee and the House in relation to consideration of privilege matters to ensure natural justice and procedural fairness. I commend the report to the House. Publications Committee Report",77
58,Mr HAYES,COMMITTEES,I present the report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies are being placed on the table. Report-by leave-agreed to. Treaties Committee Report,78
59,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report No. 106: Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",78
60,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEES,"by leaveThe road to nuclear hell is paved with defensive intentions. The United States developed nuclear weapons after it was attacked during the Second World War by Japan, and both the United States and Russia developed nuclear weapons as a defensive strategy during the Cold War. Because they had nuclear weapons, China, which at various times during the nuclear age has had poor relations with both America and Russia, developed nuclear weapons as well. Because China had nuclear weapons, India felt threatened and developed nuclear weapons. Because India developed nuclear weapons, Pakistan felt threatened and developed nuclear weapons. The strength of religious fundamentalist terrorist groups in Pakistan has created an everpresent and alarming risk that nuclear weapons could fall into the hands of non-state actors, terrorist groups who have no respect for human life and will take no notice of doctrines of deterrence and mutually assured destruction in the way that governments might reasonably be expected to. We must do all that we can to try to break every link in this dangerous nuclear chain. Every one of us has a responsibility to help re-energise the international political debate against the background of a decade or more in which the international community has been sleepwalking when it comes to both non-proliferation and, especially, disarmament. I want to thank my fellow committee members not just for the hard work involved in producing a 230-plus-page report but for the attitude of cooperation and determination to say something significant and worthwhile with which they approached this task. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has members from the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the Nationals and the Greens, with very different perspectives on a range of nuclear and foreign policy questions, but each member of the committee wanted to play their part in protecting people from the nuclear threat and to ensure that Australia's voice is heard loud and clear around the world on these matters. So we have worked through the issues until we achieved an agreed outcome, a platform for progress. What is that platform? We want to see the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in place. This treaty is incredibly important in halting the momentum for nuclear proliferation and ultimately ringbarking the nuclear weapons tree. We want to see a verifiable Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty in place. This would stop countries building up fissile materials and therefore reduce the risks of proliferation and limit the risk of nuclear arms races. We want all uranium-exporting countries to require that the countries to whom they export uranium have an additional protocol to guarantee International Atomic Energy Agency inspector access. We believe that the International Atomic Energy Agency's budget needs to be increased so it can do its work properly and thoroughly. The committee examined proposals for a nuclear weapons convention and for a multilateral fuel bank. In each case more work needs to be done, and we have recommended the allocation of research and consultation resources to the development of a nuclear weapons convention with a clear legal framework and enforceable verification. It is important to understand that the fricread tion between the nuclear haves and the nuclear have-nots is alive and well. Throughout the history of the non-proliferation treaty nuclear haves have stressed non-proliferation-that is, making sure no other country gets nuclear weapons-while the nuclear have-nots have stressed disarmament-that is, obliging the nuclear armed countries to get rid of their bombs. The countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, essentially have-nots, are frustrated by the lack of progress on disarmament. Too often this difference of approach has led to international stalemate. Clearly we need to have action on both fronts: non-proliferation and disarmament. The committee strongly supports the work of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, cochaired by Gareth Evans. We support the Conference on Disarmament and the forthcoming Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. We have made recommendations which reflect this support. We have also made recommendations designed to encourage parliamentarians all around the world to engage with and talk up a world without nuclear weapons, for-borrowing a little from the late great Edward Kennedy-the dream of a world without nuclear weapons is a dream that must never die. We must never accept that it is all right to live in a world where some people have the power to kill tens of millions of their fellow human beings and make the planet uninhabitable in a heartbeat. That must never be acceptable. I wish to place on the record my great appreciation for the mighty work done by the committee secretariat, in particular inquiry secretary Julia Searle and committee secretary Jerome Brown, in enabling this report to happen. I urge my colleagues here in Australia and in other parliaments, and ordinary Australians and citizens of other countries, to it, think about it and make a world free of nuclear weapons a reality.",78
61,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"by the leave-I thank the Deputy Speaker and members present for granting me leave to make a few brief remarks in regard to this important report. There is part of my heart and soul in this report. I think it is a very strategic report, as the member for Wills has just reported. It is unanimous on a subject that has the potential for a whole range of diversions. It is a unanimous report from the major political parties represented in this House and in the other place-the Labor Party, the Liberals, the Nationals and the Greens-on sensitive subjects such as the future of the Australian uranium industry, uncertainty about nuclear power generation of the future, issues related to the excess of fissile material and the waste. They are all thorny subjects on which every individual has a different opinion. Yet we were able to present to this chamber and the other place a unanimous report because as a committee we want this report to be used as a strong statement of how Australians feel and of the need to follow the dream that the member for Wills just referred to so that our grandchildren can live in a world free of nuclear weapons. Australia has an excellent reputation on this argument over the years, even through the frustrating periods of lack an international good citizen and an honest broker. We want that reputation to continue and to use that credibility to progress this matter. There is a new wave of optimism that has come out of the election of the Obama administration in the United States. There is an expectation which is not to be overstated but does give us optimism that the intransigence of the last 40 years will finally be overcome. The first step is to get a comprehensive test ban treaty in place and operating. The committee has been able to see evidence of the monitoring system and the verification, and we are confident that, through the verification system, if any nation in the world conducts a nuclear test, the rest of the world will know about it. In fact, the world knew about the most recent explosion from North Korea before the regime there had even made their public announcements. I share the dream. I want my grandchildren to not have the experience of my youth and formative years. I remember the uncertainty of that period, right through the Cuban missile crisis of the 1960s. When the Bay of Pigs invasion occurred I was 12 years old. I remember an occasion at night, after listening to conversations between my parents and my grandparents, of not being able to sleep and waking my father up in the middle of the night and seeking assurance from him. I asked him, ‘It is going to be okay, isn't it, Dad?' He made the comment at the time that most of the threat was in the Northern Hemisphere and that we were way down here, Down Under. I reminded him to read Neville Shute's book On the Beach, the movie of which was playing at the time. In those days in the small town in which I was raised we still had a movie theatre, and we had Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Anthony Hopkins and Fred Astaire involved in making that memorable book into a good film. That was 1959, which gives some idea of how long I of progress, as have been around. Of the 23 recommendations, I commend recommendation 21 and urge this chamber to support it. It asks for the parliament to adopt a resolution on this parliament's commitment to the abolition of nuclear weapons. If we can do that as quickly as we can and before the end of the spring sittings, we will arm the two members of this chamber who are presently at the United Nations in New York speaking on our behalf. We could give them the evidence and speak for all Australians, saying that we want a world free of nuclear weapons and we do not want to go back to the intransigence of the past which has frustrated many nations, like our great country, with the lack of progress.

NA Public Works Committee Approval of Work",81
66,Mr TANNER,COMMITTEES,"At the request of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, and by reasons of the urgent nature of the works, it is expedient that the following work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Regional Backbone Blackspots Program. As part of the National Broadband Network initiative, the government has fast-tracked a $250 million program to address regional backbone blackspots. Access to competitive backbone infrastructure on an open-access equivalent basis will stimulate competition and allow retail broadband providers to offer better services to rural and regional Australia. The government's intention is that the backhaul assets built will ultimately form part of the new National Broadband Network, to be owned and operated as NBN Co. The program addresses the following priority locations identified through a focused public consultation process: Geraldton, Western Australia; Darwin, Northern Territory; Emerald to Longreach, Queensland; Broken Hill, New South Wales; Victor Harbor, South Australia; and the south-west Gippsland region, Victoria. Innovative and value-for-money solutions for these locations are being identified through an open, competitive tender process, which is being conducted in accordance with the Commonwealth procurement guidelines. The tenders have been received and the government now aims to finalise contract negotiations and commence construction as soon as possible. So that improved services can be delivered to regional consumers as soon as possible and that effective and timely stimulus can be delivered to economic activity in regional locations throughout Australia, the government have resolved, pursuant to section 18(8)(b) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient and appropriate for the works associated with this program to be carried out without reference to the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. The Public Works Committee performs an important role in ensuring public works represent a value for money use of taxpayer funds. However, in this case the government considers a Public Works Committee hearing would delay urgent work to improve telecommunications and internet access in regional areas which have already been the subject of parliamentary and public scrutiny. The program is already within the scope of the Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network. That committee which has an opposition majority and representation by the Australian Greens is able to and indeed has scrutinised the government's commitment to fast-track the $250 billion program to address regional backbone blackspots amongst other issues relating to the rollout of the National Broadband Network. There has been a positive response to the program from all levels of government and industry, including some members of the opposition. A stakeholder consultation program was held during April-May with in excess of 60 submissions received in response to the public consultation paper and over 40 discussions held with interested parties. Prior to this, the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee, established in August 2007, found in its September 2008 final report Framework for the future that competitive backbone infrastructure is critical to the rollout of high-speed broadband services in rural and regional Australia. I note that a proposal to proceed with a construction project without referral to the Public Works Committee is not common. The government very much support the work of the Public Works Committee and have not taken this decision lightly. I commend the motion to the House.",84
67,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"I move: That all words after “That” be omitted, with a view to substituting the following words: The following work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report by 17 November 2009: Regional Backbone Blackspots Program.",85
68,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Forrest-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,85
69,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"The Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works met this morning and there was almost universal unhappiness with the minister's letter to the PWC that was received this morning. There was no explanation in the minister's letter as to why this expediency motion is needed. There was no indication about what the program is actually about. There was no suggestion as to why we should be passing this motion in the House of Representatives today. I am seeking to ask that the House allow this public scrutiny of this particular government program in a timely fashion. The Regional Backbone Blackspots Program is not of the highest urgency. Taking two months now to examine the intricacies of the program is the responsible course. It is a substantial amount of money, over $200 million. It is an important public work and it should not be undertaken without the proper consideration of the parliament. I believe that the government know this and the members of the Public Works Committee know this. The government know that by doing this they are attempting to subvert normal practice to avoid accountability and to pretend that the National Broadband Network has not been beset by problems. The government announced that the blackspots program would be underway by September this year. It should be noted that this urgency motion moved by the minister coincides with the last sitting day of September, the last day for the government to try to rush this program through. The government have consistently played politics with the National Broadband Network. They have made numerous mistakes with the policy. Before the 2007 election, the Prime Minister promised to spend $4.7 billion creating a national broadband network, and to start the network by the end of 2008. I think we all know now that the government have failed to deliver on this promise. The government then wasted 18 months and nearly $20 million on flawed tender processes, which failed to find a private company for the program and were abandoned on 7 April this year. The government then rushed out their alternative, the National Broadband Network mark 2, at a cost of $43,000 million-an immense jump from the $4.7 billion promised before the 2007 election. The cost blow-out has been immense and demonstrates the many mistakes the government have made with this policy. They have created the National Broadband Network Co. and are paying its CEO and board an astonishing $46,000 a week to run a company that has no customers and provides no services. The motion from the minister today is not the first time the government have avoided scrutiny of their broadband plans. They have refused to submit the entire National Broadband Network to a cost-benefit analysis. The Rudd government have ignored the advice of Secretary to the Treasury, Ken Henry, who said: Government spending that does not pass an appropriately defined cost-benefit test necessarily detracts from Australia's well-being. The Rudd government have broken their own promise in the 2008-09 budget, where they pledged: Where governments invest in infrastructure assets, it is essential that they seek to achieve maximum economic and social benefits, determined through rigorous cost-benefit analysis … The government have lost their credibility on broadband. Given this track record, they do not have the standing to be allowed to run an expensive program of over $200 million without scrutiny. The Public Works Committee must be allowed to conduct an inquiry into this program, as is the normal course for other government expenditure of this nature. I do hope the parliament will support this amendment to allow that to happen by 17 November this year. The amendment I propose today is that the program be referred to the Public Works Committee for report by 17 November. This is a responsible approach. It is not an extensive delay, and the PWC will deal with this in a timely way. If the government adopted this course of action, there could be concurrent documentation so that there would be no delay in rolling out the program. I am a strong supporter of regional Australia, as this parliament knows. The value of providing improved services to regional communities is certainly great. There is no value, however, in rolling out a system full of inefficiencies and hidden costs. The blackspots program must be given the appropriate scrutiny of the parliament through the Public Works Committee. It is in the best interests of regional Australia for us to do so. We in the coalition firmly believe in the principle of accountability. The Australian people expect this from their parliament. I invite the government to stand up for these values, to stand up for respecting the process and to see the attempt to rush the blackspots program for what it is: playing politics. We must take a reasonable amount of time, respect the processes of parliamentary committees and ensure that all public works policy is thorough and effective. I have served on the Public Works Committee for a number of terms. The committee plays a very important bipartisan role in ensuring public works are undertaken in the most effective and costefficient way. The government cannot be allowed to undermine this. Finally, I wish to advise the parliament that it is my understanding that the minister's own department supports the Public Works Committee process. I have that on very good authority. Minister, this is not a delay to the program. The member for Mallee and I can assure you that we will deal with this in a timely way. It will allow proper scrutiny of such huge amounts of government money to be done in a bipartisan way, and we will come back with any sensible suggestions that arise from our examination of this project. I urge you, Minister, and my colleagues on both sides of the House to support this amendment. I encourage you to consider the real issues at stake.",85
70,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"I rise to make a plea. I have served on the Public Works Committee for my entire time in this parliament. It is a committee whose work I enjoy. It gives me the opportunity to use my professional expertise as a civil engineer. During that period there have been many occasions when requests for expedition of projects have been made and the committee has worked extremely hard to facilitate the process. It has given permission for concurrent documentation and has not stood in the way. I am somewhat disturbed when I hear reports of thoughts within the bureaucracies that the standing committee is in the way. It is not at all. It is a very useful and important committee, not only to supervise the precious resources that taxpayers, who are listening, provide for us to spend on public infrastructure but to scrutinise them to ensure that there is value for dollar and the money is well spent. In my time there have been a number of projects in which the process of evidence and the comments and submissions from outside players have saved the Commonwealth enormous amounts of money. One such project involved the unloading of armaments into Australia. A site was suggested that was completely remote, which the Department of Defence had not even recognised. I think the involvement of the Public Works Committee in that process saved taxpayers $50 million. The Public Works Committee process is a good one, a process of accountability. The thing that disturbs me most is the willingness of the minister to override this important public process. I am not placated by his comment at the dispatch box that he recognises the significance of the committee. I say to members on both sides of the House, who beaver away on committee work, travelling the nation collecting evidence: think about the question before us. It is a reasonable request that this inquiry be referred to the Public Works Committee. We will treat it expeditiously and report by 17 November. It is a perfectly reasonable request and it is too late for you, Minister, to see reason and accept that the public of Australia would expect the Public Works Committee to exercise its statutory rights and supervise the ture of the public's precious money. I leave the decision to you, Minister. You have an opportunity now to do the right thing by Australian taxpayers in ensuring that their precious dollars are supervised properly, which is the role of the Public Works Committee. Question negatived. Original question agreed to. NA",86

The Minister for Home Affairs will answer questions on the Attorney's behalf. NA Economy",87
72,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. In explaining Australia's strong performance relative to other economies, the OECD's employment report does not mention the high Asian demand for our exports, well-regulated banks-and a consequent absence of any banking crisisor large reductions in interest rates, let alone the starting points of zero public debt and the lowest unemployment in three decades. Does the Treasurer agree these factors are more important in explaining Australia's strong economic performance, or was it all his own doing?",87
73,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Australia's strong economic performance is the result of the hard work of the Australian people, working with their government in putting in place economic not stimulus to support employment, to support business and to support confidence. That is why the OECD has reached the conclusion that it has reached today-that Australia's expendistrong performance amongst OECD countries, advanced economies, is because the government, working with the Australian people, put in place a timely and powerful economic stimulus to support employment, to support business and to support confidence more broadly in the economy. It is the case that there are also a variety of factors. There is no doubt about that-no doubt about it at all. But those opposite canmies not run away from the fact that economic stimulus has been powerful in supporting employment in the Australian economy. If it had not have been for the economic stimulus put in place by the government, the economy would have gone backwards by 1.3 per cent in the year through to June. That is 200,000plus Australians in jobs today and into the future as a consequence of that economic stimulus, and that would not have been the case if those opposite had had their way. If those opposite had had their way, Australia would be in a recession right now. That would have been the consequence of the policies that they have advocated in this House. There is no doubt that Australia's performance has come from a variety of factors, but the economic stimulus put in place by this government was powerful. That has been acknowledged by the OECD today. It has been acknowledged by the IMF. It has been acknowledged by the World Bank. It has been acknowledged by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry today. It has been acknowledged by the Ai Group. It has been acknowledged by the BCA. It has been acknowledged by everybody, bar those who sit on the other side of the House. Employment",87
74,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the OECD's report on unemployment around the world? How does the OECD's characterisation of the impact of Australia's economic policies differ from other characterisations?,88
75,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Yesterday the OECD released a report on the employment outlook for 2009, and it makes for sobering reading for the global economy, particularly on employment. It says that OECD econoare facing a jobs crisis, and goes on to note that 15 million people have joined the ranks of the unemployed across the developed economies since the end of 2007. It says specifically that the experience of previous severe economic downturns suggest that unemployment will continue to rise for some time, even after the recovery begins, and that it will take a long time to re-absorb the upsurge in unemployment. The OECD forecasts unemployment reaching nearly 10 per cent by the end of 2010 across the developed economies. If those projections are realised, that will mean that unemployment will have risen by some 25 million across the developed economies since the beginning of this crisis. It is a sobering reminder as to who pays the price in a global financial crisis. When you have unrestrained greed and unregulated financial markets, those who pay the price are working families everywhere. The OECD indicates that stimulus has had an important impact on the macroeconomic response to this crisis worldwide. It says: Job losses would be significantly larger if vigorous macroeconomic measures had not been taken. Indeed, it is estimated that the OECD area employment will be 0.8 per cent to 1.4 per cent higher in 2010 than would have been the case had national governments not adopted sizeable, fiscal stimulus packages. The OECD also says that the Australian stimulus has been particularly effective in saving jobs. It says: Even though many countries moved quickly to enact large fiscal stimulus packages, these packages generally have not had a strong effect in cushioning the initial decline in employment caused by the crisis, although Australia is a notable exception. So says the OECD in its reflections on developed economies everywhere. It goes on to say: Australia's fiscal stimulus package had a strong effect in cushioning the decline in employment caused by the global economic downturn. In particular, the OECD suggests the jobs impact in 2010 of Australia's fiscal stimulus package will be 1.4 to 1.9 per cent. This is around 200,000 jobs-confirming, therefore, Treasury's analysis. The OECD's conclusions on this matter stand in stark contrast to the observations which have been made from time to time by those opposite about the impact of economic stimulus and fiscal stimulus on the real economy. The Leader of the Opposition has criticised the government's stimulus package for ‘not creating one job'-that is what he said. He has also said of the stimulus package: ‘No discernible impact on our economy'; ‘It hasn't created a job'; and ‘It hasn't stopped us from going backwards in terms of economic growth.' However, with the production of this most recent report, the opposition did have a chance to rise to the occasion and to help build the Australian economy up rather than simply continue to talk it down. But they chose instead to continue to talk the economy down. When the Leader of the Opposition was asked this morning on this question about the conclusions of the OECD report on stimulus and what it had to say about Australia, he had this to say: ‘Well, it's only a very little report. The OECD has not taken into account a number of factors in that very short little paper.' Mr Hockey-Two pages! You are being sloppy again! You are lying!",88
76,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This report is 300 pages, Joe. That is a 300-page analysis of the global economy. We are one member of the OECD. This is an analysis of the global economy and this is that very short little paper to seems to have which he alludes. The Australian government has, through its stimulus strategy, sought to build up the entire economy. We have therefore, as a consequence of our actions and the engagement of the entire Australian economy, produced one which among the major advanced economies is the fastest growing. We have the second lowest unemployment, the lowest debt and the lowest deficit, and we are the only one not to have gone into recession. This is not, however, the time for complacency. We have challenges ahead to build long-term productivity growth for the Australian economy for the recovery and, on top of that, to engage our colleagues in the G20 with the long-term task of medium-term exit from these extraordinary stimulus measures and building long-term sustainable economic growth. That is the government's strategy. I would encourage those opposite to get on board and help build the Australian economy up. Economy",89
77,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Given that the Treasurer has lauded the OECD report today, I refer the Treasurer to the August IMF staff report on the Australian economy, which projects only one year of mild recession for Australia but nine consecutive years of budget deficits, which is worse than the government's own budget in May. Treasurer, has Australia ever run nine consecutive years of budget deficits, and will you explain to the Australian people just how much upward pressure your nine consecutive years of budget deficits will put on interest rates?",89
78,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. It is the case that the IMF estimates that he refers to are somewhat lower than the medium-term forecasts that we have put in our budget. That has been obvious for a long period of time. It has taken the member for North Sydney a long time to catch up with that bit of data but it is the sort of sloppy performance we have seen from him in this House over a long period of time, such as demeaning the OECD report by claiming that it has only got two pages worth of analysis that is relevant to Australia when this is a major report of very significant standing which shows that the economic stimulus this government has put in place has had a powerful effect and has resulted in a situation where in excess of 200,000 Australians are in employment who would not have been if we had adopted the approach that had been outlined by those opposite. Their approach is simply to sit, to wait and to see. The consequence of that approach, if it had been implemented by those opposite, would have been that Australia would now be in recession. And any of the medium-term forecasts that were in place would be far worse if those opposite had their way because the whole point of economic stimulus is to get in there and prevent the economic damage that prolonged and high unemployment and business failures do to an economy. That is the whole case for putting economic stimulus in place: to avert that damage and to avert the drop in private demand which damages the economy. None of these things are understood by any of those opposite and it just shows how unqualified they are to make any judgments about the Australian economy. The member has mentioned the IMF. I would like to go to the IMF and quote from its managing director, Mr Strauss-Kahn, who overnight had this to say: The global economy is starting to recover. data confirms global economic stabilisation … … … … But the recovery remains very fragile. Private demand is still weak, financial tensions weigh on consumption which means there are still free resources in the economy, and unemployment will continue to grow. The Prime Minister has already been through the conclusions of the OECD report and indeed they are very gloomy in terms of the employment outlook across the OECD. In 2010, across the OECD, we are looking at unemployment in the order of 10 per centMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is on relevance. I asked him about nine consecutive budget deficits and the impact on",89
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer is responding to the question.,90
80,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Our response to a global recession immediately is important, and that has been demonstrated by the OECD report today. But the government, when it brought down its last budget, put in place a mediumterm fiscal strategy because that is important in order to return the budget to surplus as quickly as we possibly can when the global economy recovers. And we have got our fiscal rules. We are going to put them into place. We will have our two per cent expenditure cap in place when growth moves above trend. If those opposite want to pretend that somehow Australia is completely immune from global growth, let them do so. But the one thing I can say is that Australia is in one of the best positions of any of the advanced economies to handle these very challenging circumstances, particularly when it comes to employment. And we will do everything within our power to support employment, to support business and to bring the budget back into surplus as quickly as we Most possibly can given the global conditions. Employment",90
81,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on recent assessments of the impact of the global recession on employment, and the government's efforts to protect Australian workers?",90
82,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question and know about his deep concern for supporting jobs today during the days of the global recession. Today the OECD, in its 2009 OECD employment outlook, has delivered powerful new evidence that the government's decisive action to combat the global recession by nation building for recovery is supporting jobs and supporting small business as we invest in the infrastructure that this nation needs for tomorrow. The OECD report is powerful evidence that this economic stimulus is working. As the Treasurer has said, the OECD estimates that Australia's fiscal stimulus package will result in employment in 2010 being 1.4 to 1.9 per cent higher than if no stimulus measures had been implemented. When we look at the construction activity that is being supported by the government's economic stimulus package it tells a powerful story. Let us look at other OECD nations. This report gives us the construction activity in Spain, which has seen catastrophic drops of 26 per cent in the year to the first quarter of 2009. We have seen catastrophic drops in the United States-a drop of 14 per cent in the year to 2009. By contrast, because economic stimulus in this country is supporting jobs, the ABS labour force data for the August 2009 quarter showed that employment decreased in our construction sector by around 0.5 per cent. This is powerful evidence that the economic stimulus is working to support jobs today. The Building the Education Revolution program is the centrepiece of the government's stimulus program. It is supporting jobs through construction activity right around the country. It is supporting tradespeople and small businesses and it is supporting young people in training, keeping them in all-important employment. The Leader of the Opposition used to wander around saying he was about jobs, jobs and jobs. We do not hear that any more because to be about jobs, jobs and jobs you have to be ready to act decisively in the face of a global challenge like the global recessionto act early and provide fiscal stimulus, provide economic stimulus while building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. That is exactly what Building the Education Revolution is about-jobs today while we build the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. Economy",91
83,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for Education and Minister for Social Inclusion. Is the minister aware that in the first 17½ months of the operation of the Productivity Places Program fewer than seven per cent of the job seekers who enrolled in the training program went on to obtain a job? At a seven per cent success rate, does the minister believe the program represents value for money for Australian taxpayers?",91
84,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very glad the Leader of the Opposition asked me about the Productivity Places Program because it enables me to explain three things about itthree vital aspects of this program. There is the stream that the Leader of the Opposition has referred to, which is the stream supporting job seekers, and obviously that stream is very important during the days of the global recession. It is not easy during a global recession, as unemployment in this country rises, to assist into work people who have been unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed. This is a program that has delivered training to more than 100,000 Australians. Just over 30,000 have completed their training and, of those referred by employment services providers, we have seen people get jobs. I think that kind of support for training of job seekers during a global recession is vitally important. Importantly, the Productivity Places Program has been sufficiently flexible through our structural adjustment places to support people in jobs in companies that are bearing the brunt of the global recession. To take one example of that-the example of Holden: I think that everyone would be aware that the global financial crisis and global recession have borne down on the car industry. People would be aware of the circumstances faced by General Motors in the United States. Our structural adjustment places through the Productivity Places Program have been able to partner with a business like Holden so that they could strike short-time working arrangements and we could provide training places so people stay in a job and upskill during the days of a global recession that is bringing powerful force to bear on that business. If we had not had that flexible response through the Productivity Places Program, if we had not had the kind of cooperative workplace relations necessary to strike that sort of arrangement, what we could have seen is large-scale redundancies. We know from statistics that for people who lose their jobs during an economic downturn it can be a long, long way back. The third stream of the Productivity Places Program is to assist with upskilling people in the current workforce. We are committed to broadening and deepening the skills of Australian working people. This is a program that has responded flexibly to difficult circumstances. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: the question was whether a seven per cent success rate was good value for money.",91
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Mr Crean interjecting,92
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Minister for Trade and the member for Sturt are getting much closer to going out and sharing a cup of tea. just The Deputy Prime Minister has the call. She is responding to the question.,92
87,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I think is important is understanding the full breadth of this program and how it is supporting jobs and job seekers. It is one part of our investment in training. There is more than $5 billion in addition in apprenticeships and related measures. We are also moving to an uncapped system of higher education places so more Australians get the benefit of university training. This is a suite of related measures to solve the skills crisis. Dr Southcott- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: 111,000 job seekers, 7½ thousand jobs",92
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Boothby will resume his seat-and he is warned. I appreciate comments favourable to the member for Boothby's normal disposition, but he cannot go to the dispatch box and add to his point of order with argument.",92
89,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say in conclusion that, if the Leader of the Opposition is genuinely interested in the full suite of training measures and how they are working with job seekers and working to support employment then he should study all of the Productivity Places Program measures and all of our apprenticeship measures as well as what we are doing with the biggest structural changes to higher education since the Dawkins reforms. I would also ask the Leader of the Opposition to contemplate where we would be with unemployment numbers right now if we had kept the skills settings which created the skills crisis of the Liberal government and if we had not provided economic stimulus, which was his policy.",92
90,Ms CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the OECD's assessment overnight of the impact of economic stimulus on the Australian economy?,93
91,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bass for her question because the OECD report delivered overnight has provided powerful new evidence that the stimulus measures in Australia have led the advanced world in their impact. I would like to quote the OECD report. It says: Even though many countries moved quickly to enact large fiscal stimulus packages, these packages generally have not had a strong effect in cushioning the initial decline in employment caused by the crisis, although Australia is ble exception. Australia's fiscal stimulus package seems to have had a strong effect in cushioning the decline in employment caused by the global economic downturn. This is a fact denied by every one of those opposite. The reason for this is that the government moved quickly, decisively and powerfully to support jobs in the face of a very sharp contraction across both advanced and developing economies around the world in both the December and the March quarters. The government have supported activity, supported jobs and provided a massive boost to confidence, although we do have some very substantial employment challenges still before us across a range of sectors, including retail. But the good news is that today we have seen the Sensis business confidence figures. These figures show that business confidence in Australia has risen to its highest level since August 2007. Sensis finds today that small businesses are more optimistic about Australia's economic direction than they have been in more than a decade-that is, this survey identifies the government's ecoEconomy nomic stimulus as a key factor behind the improvement in confidence. This is yet more evidence of what the OECD has found and said in their report issued overnight. As I was saying earlier, there is broad support in the community for the government's economic stimulus program. Today, the ACCI, who were looking at the Westpac Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's survey of industrial trends, have commented. This is their conclusion: Overall, we don't think it is an environment where there should be any winding back of the stimulus measures given the general fragility of the economy. That is a very strong case which backs up the assessments of the IMF, the OECD, all of a notathe business sector in this country and the community more generally-everybody except those opposite. Building the Education Revolution Program",93
92,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Social Inclusion. Minister, there is a standing requirement that companies in the construction sector be OH&S accredited by the office of the Federal Safety Commissioner. Why, under the cover of budget day this year, did you issue a regulation to remove this important safeguard for companies tendering for school stimulus work? Why is the safety of workers on these building sites less important to the government than on other building sites?",93

97,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,94
98,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am very happy to answer the question.,94
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.,94
100,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow minister is right when he says that in the building industry we have federal safety arrangements, including the special OH&S accreditation arrangements to which he refers. Ordinarily, when the federal government puts major investment into economic stimulus or into major capital in the building industry, we deal with businesses who are already accredited under the code. When we are dealing with small capital improvements like schools, these small capital improvements tend to be under the financial level for these sorts of arrangements. What we did with the OH&S arrangements in relation to the Building the Education Revolution, in order to maximise the number of businesses that could tender quickly, was rely on the occupational health and safety arrangements around the country that apply to workers around the country. So, for example, for constructionMr Morrison interjecting",94
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will remind the member for Cook that he was warned by the Deputy Speaker.,94
102,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"in the shadow minister's home state of Western Australia, the occupational health and safety arrangements for workers engaged in building a Building the Education Revolution project in one of his local schools would be the Western Australian government's occupational health and safety legislation. If he believes that the occupational health and safety legislation of the Western Australian government is deficient then perhaps he ought to take that up with his friends in the Liberal Party. Occupational health and safety law, as it applies to workers generally around the country, applies to workers who are constructing under the Building the Education Revolution program. Liquefied Natural Gas Exports",94
103,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. How will the final investment decision for the Gorgon project secure jobs, and contracting and business opportunities, for Australian workers and companies?",94
104,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. She is someone who is always concerned about the issue of jobs and business opportunities for Australian companies. In that context, the parliament welcomed the final investment decision by the Gorgon joint venture partners on Monday for a project worth $43 billion. The joint venture partners Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell will fund this project from their own balance sheets and in doing so deliver 10,000 direct and indirect jobs during the construction period alone. I also welcomed on Tuesday evening Chevron entering into a further heads of agreement for the long-term supply of Gorgon LNG to Korea, potentially opening up a much expanded LNG trading partnership between Australia and Korea-potentially a further export opportunity of 1.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG. As is always the case with major projects such as this, it is now the responsibility of government to actually work with industry to guarantee the maximum available job opportunities in an immediate sense. That was the very question put to the joint venture partners at the announcement of the project in Perth on Monday. In that context I am delighted to advise the House that, when it comes to jobs, jobs and more jobs for Australians, project construction is already moving forward. Already $2 billion worth of contracts have been awarded-many to major Australian based companies. For example, Thiess has won a $500 million contract for site preparation on Barrow Island. In a joint venture partnership, Thiess, with Decmil Pty Ltd and Kentz Pty Ltd, has been awarded a further $520 million contract to build the 3,300-bed Gorgon construction village. This will mean jobs on the ground, of great benefit to all Australians. It is also interesting note that Toll Holdings has won a $180 million contract for the Barrow Island supply base and logistics. I go to the issue of Mermaid Marine Australia and its further $100 million contract for providing access to the Dampier marine supply base, and the Australian Marine Complex and LandCorp has been contracted to provide waterfront roll on, roll off ferry terminal and wharf facilities at Cockburn Sound near Fremantle. In addition to this, the Offshore Marine Services alliance has won a $240 million contract for tugs and barges, and Agility Logistics a $160 million contract for supply base operations and transportation services between Perth and Dampier and the supply base and Cockburn Sound. Schenker Australia will also conduct freightforwarding activities. As we all appreciate, the magnitude of the Gorgon project is demonstrated by the fact that it will be the biggest and most challenging private logistics and supply chain exercise ever attempted in the world. Can I also say that in the immediate future a further $10 billion of contracts will be rolled out over the next three months, including this week's award of an additional $2.7 billion engineering, procurement and construction management contract to the Kellogg joint venture, consisting of Kellogg, Brown and Root, JGC Corporation and the Australian based companies Clough and Hatch. This is a project that will deliver Australia thousands of jobs and training opportunities, contracting and business opportunities, and associated prosperity. It will also deliver across the length and breadth of Australia. In announcing the project the joint venture partners also very clearly indicated that Australia is now very well placed to achieve further major investments akin to the Gorgon investment. I refer to the statements, for example, by George Kirkland-an executive vice to president of Chevron. He said: There's no doubt that this positions Australia very, very strongly in the gas world. It really and truly does. The good news is Saudi Arabia is all about oil, and what we're seeing in Australia is all about gas. And for the future, and when you consider the environmental side, Australia is in a great, great position … He went on to say: Asia has been growing, growing significantly. And where's Australia? Great position to really deliver on a cost advantage basis, that market. I will leave you with those comments. The Gorgon project is a great achievement for Australia. It means real jobs and business opportunities here on the ground now. And, more importantly, it is a very strong statement to the world that Australia is alive for investment opportunities akin to Gorgon. It is now our responsibility to make Gorgon a success and to deliver the jobs on the ground, and in doing so attract further investment akin to Gorgon. Liquefied Natural Gas Exports",94
105,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his pre-election commitment to provide the Western Australian state government with 25 per cent of the royalties from the Gorgon gas project. When will the Prime Minister introduce legislation to guarantee that Western Australia receives its share of these royalties?,96
106,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian government is resolved to honour its commitments to the WA government, whoever won the last WA election; and we will do it. The reason for this is that the WA government is actually in the business of rolling up its sleeves and making projects work. That is why this government is working effectively with them. I also draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that, on the broader question of economic policy, the WA Treasurer, Mr Buswell, has fully endorsed the overall economic strategy of this governmentincluding its stimulus strategy. We work well with them and will continue to do so into the future. Quarantine",96
107,Mr TURNOUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Are there any threats to Austrawould lia's biosecurity and quarantine budget which will disadvantage agricultural exporters and increase the risk of pests and diseases entera ing Australia?",96
108,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for the question. It is a deeply important issue, given what happened in the Senate on Tuesday night. Late on Tuesday night the coalition took a sledgehammer to Australia's quarantine and biosecurity budget, ripping $103 million out of our biosecurity defences. This was done by the same mob that presided over equine influenzathe same Leader of the National Party. It might be 95 per cent of Australians who do not know who he is, but every person involved in the racing industry knows exactly who he is because they took a $1 billion hit when they were dealing with the system with a previous government that was not willing to commit to biosecurity in Australia. The same people who in government gave us quarantine incompetence and neglect, in opposition have decided to vandalise Australia's quarantine and biosecurity systemsvandalism against the same issue that I always thought was above politics. I actually thought, if we were going to have an argument about quarantine and biosecurity, the argument from the opposition would be that there needs to be more money, not that you need to take $103 million out of our quarantine and biosecurity. Every year new fees come in. Every year new fees are introduced, and yet in the history of Australia's biosecurity cost recovery never has either side of politics disallowed the new fees. It has never been done before. We had only eight years in the history of biosecurity where the 40 per cent export subsidy was there, and when it was introduced last time by the Leader of the Nationals he himself said it was a four-year program. He himself announced the expiry date-that there be no funding beyond 30 June this year. We kept to that date, but we went one step further. We put through a transition year, further $40 million on the table. Then on Monday, when the Senate inquiry reported and said more transition money was required, Senator Back himself stood up in the parliament and nominated the figure of $20 million. We put a further $20 million on the table to help with the transition year, to help our exporters. What did they do? Let's not forget their proposal: zero dollars on the table. We put $60 million on the table. They were faced with a choice between driving policy reform at $60 million or sabotaging the quarantine budget, and they just could not help themselves. They had not done enough damage to quarantine in government; they had to continue the assault in opposition. The shadow minister himself only a few months ago said any cuts to the biosecurity budget would be ‘criminal'-and look at what you have now done. Look at what the opposition has now done in slashing the biosecurity budget by $100 million. The government did the right thing. We made sure these fees were gazetted earlier than they ordinarily would be so that, if the opposition were minded to behave this way, it could have been done before the end of the financial year. But instead they chose the option of maximum chaos-have the new fees come in, have industry, in good faith, begin the process of reform and then steal the money from underneath, despite the support from the Meat Industry Council, the Livestock Exporters Council, the Dairy Industry Council, GrainCorp, ABB, Horticulture Australia, the Seafood Export Consultative Committee, the Red Meat Advisory Council, Dairy Farmers, Grain Traders, Biological Farmers and the Aquaculture Council. All of these groups want the reform process to go ahead, and against all of them the National Party decided, ‘Let's just play politics.' Every month this goes on, $3 million to $4 million disappears because of the underfunding of biosecurity that Australia now has. There is time when we come back to be able to fix this and to allow industry to its reform process and not have the cut which is currently being made to quarantine. I would ask the opposition to think very long and hard about the demands of industry and actually deliver on a reform package that they were incapable of in government. Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program",96
109,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Does the minister stand by her statement in August that 85 new houses would be built in Alice Springs town camps under the Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program? If she does stand by that statement, how does she respond to a Northern Territory government official briefing last week that the program will deliver just 40 new houses for $100 million? Does she maintain that $2½ million per house is good value for taxpayers' money?",97
110,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Warringah for his question and for the opportunity that it gives me to confirm the statements and the commitments that this government has made to make sure that 85 houses are built in the Alice Springs town camps. Of course, he should be aware that the Northern Territory government has since corrected the statements that he has now, I suspect, brought to the dispatch box knowing that they have since corrected them. I might just say, while I have the opportunity to contribute to this debate, it was that side of the parliament when they were in government who walked away from the residents of the Alice Springs town camps. The previous minister for Indigenous affairs went up to Alice Springs and said that he would do something about the conditions that people were living in in Alice Springs and he have walked away from them. He walked away from the people who are living in the most appalling conditions that we would find in any part of this country. This is not a war zone. This is not a refugee camp. This is on the outskirts of one of our country towns. It is an out-and-out disgrace that for 12 years you left people living in those conditions, and it is now up to this government to fix it.

114,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the minister to advice received that a Western Australian installer paid $6,000 for 100 packs of 20 insulation batts last month. This month he paid $5,240 for 50 packs of 10 batts. That is a price hike of four times the cost of the origisions, nal unit-costs that are being passed on to the Australian taxpayer. Will the minister explain to the House how a quadrupling of the pink batts price represents value for money?",98
115,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question and I am happy to take on notice that particular matter that he refers to, see whether there is additional information in relation to the views that he has put to me about that, come back to the House and report to them. But I make that response in the context of issues that have been raised by the opposition previously, including that by the member for Hinkler which I referred to in question time yesterday. We found that, on examining the view of the company in question that the member purported to represent here in the parliament, in actual fact the claims that the member made in the parliament were false. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister has conceded that he has completed the answer to the direct question. There is a process of the House to add to an answer. He can make use of that if he wants to do what he is trying to do now.",98
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister must relate his material to the question that has been asked.,98
117,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I make the point to the House that since the inception of this program two things have happened. The first is that we have had a record number of ceiling insulations take place in a record short period of time. This was for a program that those opposite opposed. The second thing is that we have put in place a range of compliance and auditing measures in order to make sure that the taxpayer gets very good value for this program that the government is delivering.

He has run out of",98
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Canning will resume his seat. The minister will respond to the question.,98
121,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I simply make the point that one listens carefully to the questions that are put by the opposition and to the views that are put by the opposition, and when it comes to some members of the oppositionin particular the member for Flinders, who said that this program was falling apart at seams when we had 290,000 installations-I think it is time to put these questions in text. But we will take seriously the question that the member has put. I will come back to the House. I make this final point. If we are serious about addressing climate change-as we are on this side of the House-then the Energy Efficient Homes Program, which has only 0.3 per cent of actual issues that have been raised on a program that up to this point in time has been phenomenally successful in its deployment, is doing the job that it was required to do. Emissions Trading Scheme",98
122,Mr DREYFUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change. Why is it important for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to pass parliament and what is delaying action on climate change?",99
123,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course it is extremely important that the parliament pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation so that we can begin to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our own economy and play the most constructive role possible in the international community. Time is pressing for the passage of the government's legislation. The Copenhagen conference is now less than 90 days away and it is important that the legislation pass before then, not only so that we can have a target established in the law to reduce carbon pollution in this country but also to have a means to achieve the reductions. After today, there are only four weeks of sittings left before the Copenhagen conference, and the government will be reintroducing this legislation with that time frame well and truly in mind. That means that time is running out for the coalition on this fundamentally important public policy question. I confirm once again that the government the will sit down and negotiate with the opposition if they can produce a set of amendments conthat reflect the policy concerns that they have. But they must have a policy and they must agree to a proposed set of amendments. The government cannot do that for them as Senator Minchin has been suggesting. They have to get their act together and develop a policy with specific amendments to the legislation that they are seeking. But, of course, as is evidenced again today, the outlook for that development on the opposition side of politics is not good. Multiple positions are being expressed on climate change. It is truly astonishing. It is a very rare thing in Australian politics for such extraordinary ill-discipline and disunity to be on display by a major political party. The Nationals and the Liberals have completely split over this issue, and Senator Joyce is running the leadership on this issue for the National Party and, apparently at times, for the coalition. Senator Joyce is making ridiculous propositions, proposing homespun messages that defy the international scientific evidence and consensus on the need for taking action on climate change. He has been positing $150 legs of lamb and other ridiculous propositions. The position that the National Party has been adopting is at potentially massive cost to the rural and agricultural communities that the National Party purports to represent. It is an utterly irresponsible position. Senator Joyce has walked all over the member for Wide Bay, the Leader of the Nationals-walked all over him. Only two or three months ago the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party stood up and said they were committed to the government's targeted reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. That is no longer the case. The National Party has dumped that position. For once I have to say that I agree with the member for Sturt-as painful as it may bebecause this morning on Sky television the member for Sturt indicated that the Nationals are no longer at the table and that their position is bizarre. That was his admission. But, of course, the National Party is not alone in that. The Liberals are in a shemozzle on this as well. Over the last two days we have had a party room rebellion fully reported to the media, including the speakers list; at least three contradictory positions on amendments to the legislation; the member for Higgins out again in the media, making a typically self-indulgent and destructive contribution, opposing emissions trading; and the member for O'Connor continuing to run an insurgency campaign, asserting that a majority of the coalition party room are opposed to emissions trading. The member for Goldstein, not in the chamber today, has taken a completely contradictory positionDr Stone- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is relevance. This long story is not relevant.",99

125,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At the same time that the member for O'Connor is asserting that a majority of the coalition party room is opposed to emissions trading, the member for Goldstein is reported in the Australian today saying that a vast majority of coalition MPs and senators in fact support amending the CPRS. Who is to ever know who is right about the coalition political and policy position on this issue? If it is a majority of coalition MPs support negotiating amendments with the government, it must be a very silent majority indeed. They should take responsibility on this critical public policy issue and put forward specific amendments, propose them to the government and negotiate. NA",100

Can I suggest that if people interject, the minister should ignore the interjections and respond to the question.",101
140,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to the question asked by the honourable member, I am not aware of the comments made by the minister, to which Dr Stone referred in the question. This government takes border protection very seriously. It is for that reason we have dedicated $654 million to protecting our borders. It is for that reason that we have a policy that ensures we work with governments within our region and we work with the law enforcement agencies. Only very recently there was a disruption of the syndicates in Indonesia. That was a direct result of the efforts of this government's work with the Indonesian National Police to disrupt those ventures and to prosecute the people smugglers. It is the case that there has been an increase in unlawful maritime arrivals. I make this very important point: if we were to determine a government's performance based on unlawful or irregular maritime arrivals, then the Howard government's record was the worse in the last 40 years. In relation to the capacity of the detention centre on Christmas Island, it is very clear thatDr Stone- Mr Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: the minister obviously did not know the answer that",101

142,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In conclusion, the detention centre at Christmas Island still has plenty of capacity to deal any irregular maritime arrivals. This is an effort by the opposition to dog whistle-that is what they have been doing here",102

146,Mr SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. I ask: what will next week bring for Australia's pensioners?",102
147,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Longman for his question and for his very hard work on behalf of more than 23½ thousand pensioners in his electorate of Longman. From this Sunday, Australian pensioners will receive their long overdue and much needed increase to the pension. Those opposite had 12 long years to deliver an increase to the pension, and they refused to do so. They refused to deliver this much needed increase to the pension. It has been left to this government to deliver what pensioners have needed for so long. Over the next two weeks, pensioners will be receiving this much needed increase to their pension, on their usual pension pay day. These 3.3 million pensioners-aged pensioners, disability support pensioners, veterans, income support recipients, those on the carer payment-will receive, because of this government's commitment, a much needed pension rise. All pensioners will get letters from Centrelink setting out exactly what they will receive. Single pensioners on the maxiwith mum rate will receive an ongoing increasenot the sort of temporary increase we saw from the previous government before elections. From this government they will get an ongoing increase of $70.83 a fortnight for singles on the maximum rate. These are very significant reforms that will make a difference to the living standards of single pensioners. Couples on the maximum rate of the pension combined will receive $29.93 a fortnight. Once again, this is a much-needed increase. All of us on this side of the parliament know that pensioners have been doing it very, very hard. I have spoken to many pensioners, but one pensioner to whom I spoke just last week comes to mind. I will tell everybody what this pensioner had to say to me about what this increase will mean for her. She is a single pensioner on the maximum rate and she will be receiving an increase of $70.83 a fortnight from next week. This is a lady who is very active, very involved, and she says that she is going to live a much more social life as a result of this increase. She will be able to go out with her friends, enjoy exercise classes and do some of the things which other people take for granted. These are the practical things. These are the changes that pensioners are going to see as a result of this very significant increase to the pension. It is going to mean a better life in retirement for those pensioners, because this government have done what pensioners have been waiting for for a very long time. We have delivered this very important increase to improve their standard of living-especially for those in retirement. Climate Change",102
148,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Water. Minister, with the CPRS packages marks 1 and 2 the government took a policy position against an amendment for an independent climate change authority by arguing that the topic is too important not to have the minister and the parliament in control of various future oversight questions. But now we are about to visit CPRS mark 3, and now the CPRS has been significantly scaled back due to political lobbying. And, once again, this package has been butchered by the political mosh pit. Minister, do you now agree that your view is flawed? If so, will you reconsider the counterpolicy position that this issue is too tant to be left to the political processes and, just as the Reserve Bank successfully and independently manages our economic settings, will you do likewise on the question of climate change and include an amendment for an independent climate change authority?",103
149,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is an element of that question that is Kennedy-esque. Without wishing to embarrass the member for Lyne, he has attempted to do something that Mr Katter has not tried yet, which is to ask his question of two people. I take it that he meant the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and not the Minister for Climate Change and Water, who are actually two people in this House. I take it that his question is to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change. Mr Albanese-We could get two answers. It would even up the balance.",103
150,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I understand that the Leader of the House is trying to organise things. Mr Dutton-Don't you trust Garrett? ,103
151,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dickson! The member for Sturt! The question was in order. The Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change has the call.,103
152,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyne for his question. Of course, the member for Lyne was the only non-government member of parliament to vote for and support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme-an act of courage that is important to acknowledge. I recall that when the CPRS legislation was in the House in June, the member for Lyne moved an amendment in very similar terms to those in his question to me. It raises the same important public policy question, and that is whether or not the proposed Australian Climate Change Regulaimportory Authority should be able to independently set the cap on emissions. As I recall, that was the nature of the amendment at the time, and I take it that the question has a similar intent. As I explained to the House at that time, the scheme caps, in the government's viewreflected, of course, in the way in which the legislation has been constructed-should be set in regulations rather than by an independent authority, and that remains our view of this issue. The setting of scheme caps, I think on any construction, is a very major policy decision requiring the balancing of broad environmental, economic and social factors. As a consequence it is in itself a very important public policy question. The government took the view, through the consultations in the development of the white paper in particular, that such an important decision should be taken by elected officials of this parliament and should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. For that reason, the government remain committed to the approach that we have articulated. I would emphasise, though-as I think I did at the time in June-that the government certainly welcomes the member for Lyne's participation in the debate of these important issues and the recognition of the serious challenge that climate change presents. In particular, the government welcomes the member for Lyne's commitment to supporting efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That is exactly the type of engagement that those opposite, members of the Liberal and National parties, should also be engaging in: taking responsibility for the greatest lenge of our time-a responsibility that to date they have demonstrably shirked. Workplace Relations",103
153,Ms BIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Social Inclusion. What impact do individual statutory agreements have in the workplace and what level of community support exists for them?",104
154,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. I know that she is deeply committed to fairness and decency in Australian workplaces. I know that she saw, as many other members in this House saw, under the Liberal government's Work Choices regime hard working Australians getting basic pay and conditions and being ripped off without a cent of compensation. As the parliament draws to a close for a parliamentary fortnight, the overwhelming impression from this fortnight is that the Liberal Party is a political party stuck in the past and divided about its future-stuck in the 1960s, as we saw on display during question time. They are stuck in an era of climate change denial and divided about the future strategy for climate change. They are divided and unsure what to do with the Building the Education Revolution program, equivocating between saying and doing anything to discredit it and trying to associate themselves with it whilst they are at home. But there is no better example of how the Liberal Party is stuck in the past than the embrace of Work Choices we have seen this fortnight. What the Liberal Party has said on the record about Work Choices is characteristic of the kind of divided views we hear about so many issues. There are various factions in the Liberal Party when it comes to what they will say publicly about Work Choices. When it comes to what they will chalsay publicly about award-stripping Australian workplace agreements, there is one faction centred around the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She is straightforward about what she believes in. She is a loud and proud supporter of Australian workplace agreements and she is on the record as saying, ‘We have said common-law agreements are no substitute for statutory agreements.' Then there are those who pretend in public that they believe Work Choices is dead and buried. There is probably no more louder proponent of this than the former Work Choices salesman, the current shadow Treasurer, who each and every day up until the 2007 election spruiked the benefits of Work Choices. But now he seeks to be taken seriously and says things like, ‘Work Choices is dead; it's very dead.' Then there is a third faction in the Liberal Party when it comes to Work Choices and Australian workplace agreements. There is the ‘let's bide our time' faction led by the member for Warringah, who is saying basically: ‘We shouldn't come clean now. It may all be different by polling day.' On Kerry O'Brien's 7.30 Report, he said: … we took our lumps on polling day and we accepted the verdict by effectively not opposing the Government's workplace legislation. But things, I suspect, will be a little different by the time the next polling day comes around. The ‘wait and see and then get it all back out of box before the election' faction. Then there is the faction that says the brand known as Work Choices is dead but Work Choices itself is alive. We have seen a number from this faction. Senator Mitch Fifield is a member of this faction. He said: Don't get me wrong. Of course, the brand and policy iteration known as ‘Work Choices' is The member for O'Connor has put it even more frankly. He said: The only problem with Work Choices was its name. Which faction is the Leader of the Opposition in? True to a man desperately seeking support from any corner of his political party, he has been in all of them. At the Press Club on 25 November 2008, there he was saying very clearly: We have heard the lessons of the 2007 election loud and clear. WorkChoices is dead. The people have spoken. Then, by March 2009, he was actually trying to blame that political position on the former Leader of the Opposition, the member of Bradfield, when on radio he said: The person who said WorkChoices was dead was Brendan Nelson after the election. Last weekend, we saw the Leader of the Opposition come out loud and proud as a Work Choices supporter. He is refusing to rule out individual statutory employment agreements. He is refusing to rule them out because he knows the one thing that unites the Liberal Party under all this division about public positioning is that they are the party of Work Choices and rip-offs. They were when they were in government, they are now and they will always be the party of Work Choices and ripping off working Australians. That is the position of Leader of the Opposition. La Trobe Electorate: Fire Refuges for",104
155,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the concern expressed by school principals in my electorate about the quality of their bushfire refuges and their belief that the proposed upgrades will be insufficient. I further refer the Prime Minister to my unanswered letter to him of 16 June 2009 regarding the dead. immediate need for the highest quality fire refuges for schools in the Dandenong Ranges. Will the Prime Minister assure the House that he will intervene to ensure that fire refuge shelters in schools will be upgraded to the highest standard before the beginning of the fire season?,105
156,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Firstly, I draw the honourable member's attention to the recently released interim report by the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. I also draw the honourable member's attention to the recommendations contained within that report requiring further action by the federal government. I further draw the honourable member's attention to the response provided to those recommendations. Secondly, on the specific matter which the honourable member has raised, can I say to him, as I have said in the past to the member for MCMillan, the member for MCEwen and other members from the bushfire affected areas, if there are particular local concerns which those members wish me to attend to then I will seek to do so based on their individual representations to me and to my office. Thirdly, I refer to the honourable member's correspondence. I will now investigate what has happened in response to his correspondence, and I am happy to take it up individually with the member as he has suggested in the House.",105

158,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. How is the government's Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program supporting jobs today and delivering lasting benefits to communities around Australia? How have these projects been received by local members and local communities?",106
159,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Banks for his question. As he knows, this program has been extremely well received by local communities right around the nation because it has resulted in jobs being created in the short term based upon local communities' priorities themselves as expressed through their elected local representatives in local government. It is also building infrastructure that will last for the long term. Indeed, last Friday I had the pleasure of taking the opportunity to open the extensively upgraded Clementson Park at Bondi Junction, just around the corner from the electorate office of the member for Wentworth. All up, Waverley Council's playground upgrade program received some $340,000. The work undertaken by the council involved an extensive refurbishment of the park and included the construction of a new playground, which will benefit the childcare centre that is just near the park. Further work is taking place at eight other parks around Wentworth. The Liberal mayor, Sally Betts, said: Council and our community are very thankful this funding from the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. It was a very successful launch, which the Liberal mayor, the Liberal deputy mayor and all the Liberal councillors came along to to express their support for economic stimulus on the ground in Wentworth. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, himself said, when he attended the launch of the community infrastructure program in his electorate on 26 April: We have never argued about investing in infrastructure. We support investing in infrastructure … But they have come in here day after day and opposed the infrastructure investment in schools, in local communities, in housing, in insulation. They have opposed the 70 per cent of the economic stimulus plan that goes into infrastructure. One thing the Leader of the Opposition has said is that it would not create one job. I say to the member for Wentworth that he should go around the corner from his electorate office, becauseMs Gillard-It's not a long walk.",106
160,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"it is not far, as the Deputy Prime Minister says, and because this upgrade alone created work opportunities for 30 people. Thirty people worked on this playground alone. Of course-and the Deputy Prime Minister has tried to explain the way that construction works-they have employed contractors from the private sector. The contractors involved in this upgrade informed us last week that they were ready to make lay-offs. Instead, they kept people employed and, in addition, were able to employ an extra apprentice, giving a young person an opportunity in life. It may well be that the member for Wentworth sees this local contractor as part of the for G20 conspiracy of left-wing leaders, part of the OECD-maybe he has become part of that conspiracy at the moment. But the fact of the matter is this: they are arguing the economic stimulus should stop. What they need to do is to identify those projects in their electorates that they think should not occur, because they argue that in here but not when they go back to their electorates. Here is a photo of the member for Wentworth on 26 April at the Waverley Park pavilion. Here we have the member for Riverina on 7 May out in Wagga Wagga. Here we have the member for Mallee-dancing.

Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-Yes, Mr Speaker, I rise on a further point of order-again, on the standing orders and the House of Representatives Practice.

181,Mr ABBOTT,NOES," My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Can the minister explain to the House why the public servant she appointed to replace Major General Chalmers as operational head of the Northern Territory emergency intervention has left after just three months in the job? Why did the minister not make an announcement about his departure when it happened in June? Is it true that this leadership position has been abolished, thereby dramatically undermining the effectiveness of the Northern Territory emergency intervention, and does this not mean the effective end of the intervention and the government's surrender to the forces that created this social catastrophe in the first place?",109
182,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,I thank the member for Warringah for his question and particularly for the opportunity that it gives me to reiterate this government's commitment to the Northern Territory emergency response. This government and I think I can say every member of this parliament understand that we do have a national responsibility to address what is an emergency in many parts of the Northern Territory. Mr Truss-No leader! Ms Julie Bishop-You sacked him!,109
183,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"I might just say to all of those opposite who are interjecting that probably the most significant indication of our commitment to the Northern Territory emergency response is not about one position; it is about dedicating $800 million from this budget to make sure that the Northern Territory emergency response continues over the next three years-$800 million that was not provided by the previous government but provided in this budget by this government to make sure that we have the funding for additional police to make sure that we are able to fund night patrols in remote country communities in the Northern Territory and to make sure that we continue the program of income management. It is now the case that 15,000 people in the Northern Territory are being income managed. As a result of that income management we are seeing more children getting better fed. These are very difficult issues that we have introduced and we intend to continue them, as is evidenced in our budgetary commitment. Economy",109
184,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,NOES,"3.47 pm)My question is to the Minister for Human Services and Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law. How is Australia's economic management being received in the global community and what stands in the way of coordinated global action to boost economic growth and support jobs?",110
185,Mr BOWEN,NOES,"I thank the member for Wills for his question. Overnight, we have seen more evidence of the response of international economic organisations to Australia's economic management over the last 18 months. The OECD has given further evidence that the stimulus measures put in place by the Rudd government have worked to cushion the impacts of the global recession. The OECD also points out that rising unemployment will continue to be a serious problem in economies, including Australia's. To keep the unemployment rate steady we need to create around 20,000 jobs a month, which is a serious challenge in this international environment. This is a challenge that requires stimulus to remain in place-a fact established and supported internationally. Over the last fortnight we have heard Dominique Strauss-Kahn and senior officials from the White House and the G20 endorse the need to keep stimulus in place. Over the course of the last 48 hours we have heard the Prime Minister of Great Britain endorse the need to keep stimulus in place. In a speech the Trades Union Congress in the United Kingdom he stressed ‘the need to implement fiscal stimulus packages in full without stopI pointed out. ping them prematurely'. The British Prime Minister also laid out the need to keep stimulus in place by saying: And we still have big choices to make. The choice of whether we continue to act to help families and businesses or whether we listen to the Tories and withdraw support from families and businesses, cut public services now, and refuse to invest in Britain's future. Anyone who would characterise that speech as anything other than a call to keep stimulus in place is engaging in false and misleading conduct. I am asked about what impediments there are to coordinated action on fiscal stimulus. One of the things in place is those opposite who make things up in their argument against coordinated fiscal stimulus. This has been a shocker of a fortnight for the economic credibility of the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues. Last week we had the Robert doctrine, which was to say that Australia is the only nation in the world not withdrawing stimulus. Simply untrue. That was followed by the Hockey hypothesis, which was to say, ‘Maybe that's not right but it's all a left-wing conspiracy.' Then we had the shadow Treasurer saying that keeping interest rates low was more important than supporting jobs. Today we have seen the Leader of the Opposition distance himself from his own shadow Treasurer on that particular item. Now the G20 conspiracy has been replaced by the phantom Gordon Brown speech from the shadow Treasurer. Not content with dreaming up conspiracies, the shadow Treasurer is now drafting phantom speeches. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: yesterday I raised this in a claim to to have been misrepresented and the experience of previous speakers where the Prime Minister misled the house about what I said, which",110

188,The SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The Deputy Prime Minister is not assisting. Yet again, a member is giving a version of what they believe to be precedence in this regard. While that precedent is what perhaps should have applied in the past, it does not. I can remember many members having to come in here on several occasions to make claims to have been misrepresented on the same thing. Until this is addressed by the House, that will continue to be the case, regrettable as it may be.",111
189,Mr BOWEN,NOES,"Next we will have the shadow Treasurer quoting a speech from Al Gore saying that climate change is not real or we might have him quoting that famous speech from Mahatma Gandhi saying that peaceful protest is not all it is cracked be! Given the OECD's endorsement of this government's policies, I am surprised that he has not alleged that OECD stands for the organisation of eccentric communist dictators. That is what you would expect from the shadow Treasurer. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have been wandering around like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, trying to find evidence to support their fantabushfire sies that the stimulus is not working and should be withdrawn. But in political discourse in Australia you just cannot make things up; you have to have some evidence. The shadow Treasurer, as he said, stood twice yesterday in the House to take a personal explanation. He should come back into the House today and take another one and explain why he has not yet come clean about misleading the Australian people and misleading the House about the Prime Minister of Britain. His attempt to mitigate this deception is based around where the quotation marks were placed in his remarks. That is his defence-the old ‘quotation marks' defence. What he ignores is the fact that the very fibre of the Prime Minister of Great Britain's speech was to defend economic stimulus. At least when the former shadow Treasurer plagiarised a speech she got the quotes right. This one cannot even get that. The shadow Treasurer should come back into the chamber this afternoon after question time and take another personal explanation. He should explain whether he was being dishonest or just plain sloppy.

192,Mr RUDD,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Earlier in question time today the member for La Trobe asked me a question. His question was: ‘I refer the Prime Minister to the concern expressed by school principals in my electorate about the quality of their refuges and their belief that the proposed upgrades will be insufficient. I further refer the Prime Minister to my unanswered letter to him of 16 June 2009 regarding the immediate need for the highest quality fire refuges for schools in the Dandenong Ranges.' I would draw the honourable member's attention in the first instance to the reply from my parliamentary secretary, dated six weeks ago, which, in turn, referred to a following substantive reply from the Attorney-General to him, which is dated 15 September.",111

196,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,Order! If the House would come to order and simply listen.,112
197,Mr RUDD,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"The letter of my parliamentary secretary is dated six weeks ago. It acknowledged the honourable member's letter and indicated that a substantive letter would be coming from the honourable the Attorney General. The honourable the Attorney General's letter is dated 15 September, and I would sayMr Wood-What is happening, Prime Minister?",112
198,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,If the House would come to order the Prime Minister might get an opportunity to indicate what is happening.,112
199,Mr RUDD,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"The honourable member has raised a serious matter concerning the bushfires. It is important that the House have this response. The letter from the Attorney General says the following: Thank you for your letter of 16 June 2009 to the Prime Minister … raising your concerns for the upcoming bushfire season and outlining a range of suggested mitigation measures. The Prime Minister has referred your letter to me as Commonwealth bushfire mitigation activities falls within my portfolio. That is from the Attorney-General. He then goes on to say: In the 2009 Federal Budget. I announced funding of $110 million over four years for the Natural Disaster Resilience Program (NDRP). The NDRP is a national program aimed at identifying and addressing disaster risk priorities … It further says: The NDRP will consolidate the existing Bushfire Mitigation Program, the Natural Disaster Mitigation Program and the National Emergency Volunteer Support Fund. This will enable States and Territories to more effectively prioritise and address the risks of a range of natural disasters and streamline the associated administrative processes. This initiative will commence from 1 July 2009 … It continues: Given that the NDRP will be administered by the States and Territories, who will prioritise the areas for funding within their jurisdiction, it is appropriate for the Dandenong Ranges Community Bushfire Group to contact the Minister for Police and Emergency ServicesMr Wood interjecting",112
200,Mr RUDD,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"can I just suggest to the honourable member for La Trobe and to the House that it is useful simply to place this on record because it contains within it relevant provisions which the member can activate if he has not been able to do so alreadythe Hon. Bob Cameron MP, to ascertain eligibility for funding for sirens and other audible and visual warning systems described in the Federal Signal company proposals that were forwarded with your letter. Fire refuges could also be raised in this context. This will enable the Victorian Government to consider your proposal in the context of the NDRP. Can I simply say that that goes to the substance of the funding providedMr Abbott-It's a fob-off!",112
201,Mr RUDD,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"No, it goes to the funding provided to states and territories to deal with a range of these matters. Secondly, it provides advice to the honourable member that that is to where a particular application should be made. But I go back to what I said in question time: as with the member for Macmillan, the member for MCEwen and other members in bushfire affected areas, I am happy to discuss these matters further individually with the member for La Trobe, as I have extended that courtesy to others and I will continue to do so in the future.",112
202,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Would the member for O'Connor and the member for Fadden just wait for a little while. The Minister for structure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government is seeking indulgence, and I would hope that the House would listen before they are motivated to act in any other way. Mr Albanese-I think there is another honourable member who will wish to make a comment at this time as well.",113
203,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,Yes. NA Mr Robert Wilson Mr Kevin Marshall,113
204,Mr ALBANESE,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I wish to express condolences on the loss of lives of Robert Wilson and Kevin Marshall, who were both killed in a head-on car collision on Tuesday, 15 September. Kevin Marshall, from Orange, died in hospital that night after the accident. Robert Wilson was killed following his attendance at the inaugural meeting of the Regional Development Australia Central West Committee in Orange, and I think, therefore, it appropriate for us to acknowledge his passing. Robert Wilson was appointed to the RDA Central West committee by the federal and New South Wales governments on 6 August 2009. He was a long standing and highly regarded leader in the community of Parkes, serving the regional community of Parkes with distinction for over 40 years, including 23 years as Mayor of Parkes. He played an integral role in developing Parkes as a transport hub and national freight distribution centre. This has been critical to the economic and employment sustainability of the Parkes region. In 1997 he was awarded an Order of Australia Medal for his service to local government and the community of Parkes. In recognition of his significant contribution to his Infralocal community, Mr Wilson was named Parkes Shire Citizen of the Year in 2008. He received the AR Bluett Memorial Award in 1987 and a National Award for Innovation in Local Government in 1991 and 1996. Robert Wilson was a fine role model who served his community with dedication and distinction. He will be sorely missed by this community. I extend the deepest sympathies of the House to Mrs Wilson, Trudy and Ben, and to the family of Kevin Marshall.",113
205,Mr JOHN COBB,CONDOLENCES,"Calare) (4.00 pm)Mr Speaker, on indulgence: Robert Wilson was a legend in local government and a legend, with his wife Vicki, all around the Central West, particularly in the Parkes region. It is hard to remember a time when he was not involved in everything of note that happened in the region. Vicki was always with him, and she and Trudy and Ben are going to have a lot of support from all the people of the region in the time ahead; and obviously they will need that. As someone who knew Robert over many years-I do not know how long; he was always around-both as an agripolitician and as a member of parliament, I probably saw him a little differently to the locals. They saw him as somebody who fought, each and every day, for whatever it was that the people of the Parkes shire and the Central West needed or desired. I guess, because of my position, I saw him more as somebody who was truly a leader. Every leader, I think, who makes a mark needs a vision, and Robert Wilson certainly had that vision way beyond just the local issues. He was, as the Leader of the House said, very much focused-and from my position totally focused-on Parkes and the Central West becoming the distribution centre not just for the Central West but for eastern Australia and even further afield than that. He did more than any other person to make that, what is fast becoming, a reality. Robert was the Mayor of Parkes for about 23 years. Prior to being the Mayor of Parkes he was the mayor of the municipality of Peak Hill. He had, I think, 43 years in local government-and most of those as the president or the mayor of whichever municipality or shire he was in. Robert was a senior person who retired 14 months ago. I guess the ity of the man and the quality of Vicki, his wife, was such that they were forever besieged by people wanting them to do jobs for them. He had the respect and the love of evethe rybody in the area. It is hard to imagine him not being around. I guess Vicki and Trudy and Ben at least know that their husband and father was one of the most respected people that I have ever known in the Central West. Obviously we think also of Kevin Marshall's family. Kevin hailed from Orange these days, and not so many years ago lost a grandson in Dubbo who was killed on a bike. It was a very tragic thing. So the Marshall family have a lot to grieve over and our thoughts are with them as well. It has been a tragic time in the Central West for car accidents-there have been about five. I do not quite know how many people have been killed on the roads over the last week but I guess Tuesday brought the reality of it home to all of us.",113
206,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I have no doubt that all members would expect me, on behalf of the House, to associate the House with the comments made by the minister and the member for Calare. We extend our deepest sympathy to the families and friends of the deceased. NA Question Time",114

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",116
221,Mr OAKESHOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I appreciate the members staying behind to support this matter of public importance. As we have heard in this place throughout this session and throughout this year, the topic of climate change and the policy response from government have been an ongoing-I used the words in question time-political mosh pit. In a lot of ways the climate change debate and the 440 pages of legislation that form the basis of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the emissions trading scheme policies have to a large degree been distorted, grandstanded upon and grabbed by charlatans. There has been plenty of ‘Chicken Little' about it-the sky is going to fall in-and there has really been a complete disengagement with the broader community on the reasons behind the climate change legislation and how the households of Australia can be involved in building more a ficient energy mix in the future. The importance of putting this MPI on the table today is to reinforce to this place, on the last day before the four-week break, the very simple point that I hope everyone agrees with in this place-that people are not stupid. People will appreciate being engaged. They will appreciate logic and common sense, and if there is engagement by government on the range of issues at stake then they will support the creation of the energy mix of the future in response to climate issues, arguably the greatest issues of our time. It has worried me in my first 12 months in this place to see the lobby groups grab the agenda, the various vested interests distort the agenda. It is almost a pity we do not have a ‘mum and dad alliance' or a ‘homes of Australia union' also trawling the corridors, defending the interests of the people and the households of Australia, as engagement with government initiatives is quite often taken away from the homes of Australia. One example of that is the feed-in tariff legislation, a private member's bill, that I spoke about earlier this week. From a logic and common-sense point of view, I would have thought it was a no-brainer that the Commonwealth of Australia should harmonise what is being done in various forms around the states of Australia and recognise what is being done in lead economies such as Germany. In Germany we are seeing returns to the household of a significance that lead us not to ask why we should have a feed-in tariff but to demand of government and the executive why on earth we do not have a feed-in tariff system in Australia today. I encourage everyone to read this month's National Geographic. It has a story of a German household right next to the Black Forest. The journalist had to wipe the snow ef- off the photovoltaic panels the day that he went to visit this home. The guy produced his figures for last year's return from government from Germany's gross feed-in tariff system, and the equivalent in Australian dollars was $3,700-in an extremely cold location in the Black Forest. If the households of Australia cannot get a return that is double that in the Australian climate, we are not ing. But what we need from government is recognition that establishing a feed-in tariff system and engaging the households of Australia in moving to the energy mix of the future are important parts of the response. A feed-in tariff system would sit nicely with CPRS legislation. It would sit nicely with renewable energy targets. I am stumped. I do not understand why this government has seemed to walk away from the feed-in tariff policy as part of the government response and left it to a mish-mash of responses from various state governments. I urge the government, if they are serious about engaging the households of Australia in this debate, to reconsider the policy of feed-in tariff system, in particular a gross feed-in tariff system, and I encourage the households of Australia-anyone who is listening-to start to put pressure on local members of parliament and on the executive and to ask: ‘Why on earth aren't we getting a policy response that delivers the equivalent of $4,000 a year to me in my home? Why are we going for a policy response in another direction?' I urge the households to lobby hard, because at the moment the vested interests-big business-are changing this policy debate to suit their needs. The mums and dads-the households of Australia-are missing out on feed-in tariff legislation. I also ask this House to reflect on the broader policy issues that have been debated in this place. I want to call to account some, particularly in the Senate, who are blocking the emissions trading scheme. The point was made in question time that I am the only non-government member in support of the emissions trading scheme and the CPRS that the government is putting through, and I want to put on record why and encourage others to think about their position. I do not tryhear anyone saying to do nothing as a response. I do hear those saying that an ETS is not the way forward. I think the households of Australia are not stupid and can follow logic and common sense. If we are going to respond in some form-if we have moved from having a debate about who is and is not a sceptic-we have two choices. We can either have a market based response such as the scheme that is before the House today or we can have a publicly controlled response which in its most likely and logical form would be a carbon tax. If we are going to get this legislation through, every member of parliament needs to be called to account on which of the three choices they support. Are they supporting a the do-nothing response? I do not hear anyone saying that at all, so we are down to two choices. If they do not support a private, market based response such as the legislation going through, they are backing a carbon tax. From my point of view, following the logic and common sense of this debate, I would much prefer engaging a private-sector, market based response than I would backing a carbon tax. For the Chicken Littles saying the sky is falling in in the other place, I hope the households of Australia start to push and to ask whether they are saying to do nothing or to have a carbon tax and to ask why they are not saying to get this legislation through. The other question I want to raise is the question about coastal erosion, which came up in question time earlier in the week. Particularly in the coastal areas of Australia, there are many households now starting to be directly threatened by the issue of coastal erosion. It is not only in Chepana Street in Lake Cathie or Lewis Street in Old Bar where we are starting to see houses go into the water. It is areas like Belongil at Byron Bay, where there are 25 houses that the council in that area is now looking to acquire for safety and environmental reasons: the coastline is now too close to the building block. This is a real issue. It concerns a households around our coastline in Australia, and at the moment, yes, we are seeing from government a better response than what we saw 12 months ago, but at this stage it is still being left largely to a case-by-case response from the councils around the coastline, who in all reality do not have the resources to address what are substantial losses not only of public land but, arguably more importantly, private lands. If we are going to engage communities on this topic, I urge government to take this issue a lot more seriously than we currently see. I hope that when the report of the inquiry that is being chaired by the member for Throsby is delivered those that are involved in that inquiry deliver some strong recommendations. From that, I sincerely hope that the executive takes those recommendations seriously and looks to a policy response that is strong and that starts to provide some national unity on the issue of coastal erosion, which is emerging as one of great significance. I want to give government a pat on the back with regard to the stimulus response through the hot water and insulation package. I think that is engaging households well. I do not know about others, but in my area on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales the uptake is significant and many people are very busy, particularly on the insulation side, to the point that supply of product is becoming an issue. I certainly hope government can keep an eye on that so that we can continue to engage households on that front. I, therefore, remind government of the importance over this four-week period of engaging the homes and people of Australia, who will back this issue if they are engaged at a level which is one of logic and common sense. I remind those who are blocking legislation in this place that they are either arguing a case for doing nothing or arguing a case for a carbon tax. I sincerely want to drill lot of down on the executive about why a feed-in tariff has dropped off their energy-response radar. I think it genuinely engages people in a good way and, on paper, delays any new coal or gas fired power plants. It engages the homes in the policy response. It gets some money in the pockets of the people of Australia rather than the businesses of Australia. I was talking to the German ambassador last night. We were talking about how in many nations around the world the issue of climate change is positioned as one that only green idealists can participate in, yet in Germany it is those who want to make eight per cent returns over 20 years who participate, and that is most of the homes of Germany. I would certainly think that would be similar in Australia-if the offer through a feed-in tariff were an eight per cent return over the next 20 years I think we would get a great deal of engagement on the issue of better efficiency and a better energy mix for the future. I congratulate the government on the hot water and insulation issues. Finally, I remind the government of the importance of the report from the member for Throsby with regard to coastal erosion. Coastal erosion is having a huge impact along the coastlines, not only on the mid-North Coast but also further north, and I am sure there are locations and hotspots all the way around the coastline. It is an example of climate change being real. The erosion has moved much more quickly over recent years than it has previously. It is challenging private title but also public lands, and I think therefore that there is a real interest for government to be involved and, hopefully, to respond to a very good inquiry report and to the concerns from the many households on the coastlines of Australia who are worried about the loss of lands.

226,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"The Department of Finance and Deregulation proposes to fit out the ANZAC Park West building in Parkes, Australian Capital Territory at an estimated out-turn cost of $45.5 million, inclusive of GST. On the basis that the building will be fit out appropriately, the Department of Defence has signed a memorandum of understanding and a lease for ANZAC Park West with the Department of Finance and Deregulation. ANZAC Park West is a vacant heritage listed office building located within the Par(Fraser- liamentary Triangle. It was built in 1966 and, along with ANZAC Park East, is a portal building, framing the vista between Parliament House and the Australian War Memorial. ANZAC Park West base building refurbishment was completed in December 2006 within budget at a cost of $48 million, prior to a planned fit-out by the Australian Federal Police. In July 2007 the Australian Federal Police advised that ANZAC Park West would no longer suit their accommodation needs due to unprecedented growth. The Australian Federal Police subsequently requested to be released from their lease commitment to the building, and the planned fit-out works were not undertaken. The proposed fit-out of ANZAC Park West for the Department of Defence will house of the approximate 900 staff and comprise: a base building modification works; office accommodation of approximately 15,000 square metres, including a reception area, meeting rooms, offices and work points for the refitmaining staff; landscaping; external works, including passive security measures, new pathways, car park rectification, and the planting of trees and plants; and base building works to the pavilion adjacent to ANZAC Park West.

The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs proposes to undertake a fit-out of Tuggeranong Office Park at a cost of $29.872 million, including GST. Tuggeranong Office Park is located at block 2, section 14 of the division of Greenway and the district of Tuggeranong, Australian Capital Territory. The national office component of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is currently spread over eight tenancies, with a total net lettable area of approximately 48,000 square metres. Tuggeranong Office Park complex base building is 18 years old and has not been substantially refurbished or refitted since its construction was finalised in 1991. There are works required to improve compliance of the office accommodation to current Commonwealth standards. The refurbishment and fitout of the Tuggeranong Office Park will provide a significantly improved level of accommodation and allow for the consolidation of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs property portfolio. The Tuggeranong Office Park provides approximately 33,000 square metres of office space; 2,800 square metres of storage space; 760 enclosed and open car parks and ground-level bicycle parking for 150 bikes. Tuggeranong Office Park also accommodates the Canberra Data Centre, which is considered critical national infrastructure. The works have been scoped to provide a modest-level fit-out that reflects the remaining term of lease to December 2016. The works will ensure that the Department of fitFamilies, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs provides quality office accommodation and meets its legislative obligations to provide a safe and secure workplace. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that the proposed works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs accepts and will implement these recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, the program of works is anticipated to commence in September 2009, with a completion date for all works in September 2010.

The member asked a question about value for money in the government's Energy Efficient Homes package, specifically about a Western Australian installer who, according to the member, has experienced an increase in the unit cost for insulaDefence tion product. I undertook to see whether there was further information in relation to this matter that I could report back to the House.

I note the member did not provide any details of the installer; however, if the member would provide my office with those details then I will ensure they are lowed up and respond to the member and provide appropriate advice to the installer question. On the broader question of insulation supnew ply, I am aware of the current pressure on insulation supply chains, in particular for glass wool batts. My department is closely monitoring demand and supply and is providing industry with information to help it meet the tremendous demand the program has generated. I have been advised that tional capacity will come on stream because industry is responding and I am also advised that current shortfalls are likely to be short lived.

234,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (4.31 pm)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Reconstruction of housing on Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin, Northern Territory. On behalf of the Department of Defence, Housing Australia proposes to construct 97 new houses on Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin, Northern Territory. The project involves the demolition of 61 existing houses and, through more efficient use of the site, the construction of 97 houses. The proposal forms part of an ongoing activity to replace older houses that do not meet the new and improved standards of the Australian Defence Force housing that was introduced in 2007. Community standard housing for families is vital for the Australian Defence Force in attracting and retaining skilled personnel in the Australian Defence folForce. To achieve these aims, Defence Housing Australia has a large building program in in Darwin, involving the construction of 493 houses over the next four years. Most of the houses will be built off-base in the suburbs of Darwin. Reconstruction of housing on Larrakeyah Barracks forms part of this program, both owing to the shortage of residential development land in Darwin and its convenient location to Headquarters Northern Comaddi- mand, HMAS Coonawarra and to the Darwin CBD. The demolition and construction works will be governed by Defence Housing Australia through a number of contractors. Works will be conducted in accordance with Defence Housing Australia's national specification covering performance and design requirements, and in accordance with the Defence green building and waste minimisation policies.

The Department of Defence proposes to undertake the Enhanced Land Force Stage 2 Facilities Project at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera and other Defence bases and training areas around Australia at an estimated out-turned cost of $1,457.84 million, excluding GST. The project would provide modern, purpose-built facilities and supporting infrastructure for 8th/9th Battalion and elements of 7th Brigade as part of the enhanced land force initiative announced by the previous government in August 2006. The project would consist of the construction of new and refurbished accommodation, training facilities and common use facilities and site infrastructure upgrades at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera and other Defence sites across four states and the Australian Capital Territory. In addition to the works proposed at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, the project would include new and refurbished facilities at Lavarack Barracks, Townsville; RAAF Base Amberley, Ipswich; Kokoda Barracks, Canungra; and a number of other Defence training areas in Queensland. The project further includes works proposed at Lone Pine Barracks and the Singleton Training Area, Singleton; Garden Island and HMAS Penguin, Sydney; the Royal Military College and the Majura Training Area, Australian Capital Territory; Simpson Barracks, Watsonia; the Puckapunyal MiliReference tary Area, Puckapunyal; RAAF Base Edinburgh, Adelaide; and the Cultana Training Area, Cultana, in South Australia.

236,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (4.35 pm)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Midlife engineering services refurbishment of the Australian Embassy in Paris, France. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes the midlife engineering services refurbishment of the Australian Embassy in Paris, at an estimated out-turned cost of $28.3 million, inclusive of French value added tax. The embassy is a purpose-built complex designed by Australian architect Harry Seidler, in collaboration with French architect Marcel Breuer. It is located within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation heritage precinct of Paris and is considered one of the preeminent buildings in Australia's overseas estate. The embassy consists of two nine-storey buildings, one utilised as the chancery and the other used as residential apartments. The chancery building is occupied by three of Australia's overseas missions and numerous Australian Government agencies. The embassy was constructed in 1977 and is now over 30 years old. Whilst it has been well maintained, many of the embassy's systems no longer provide the required level of performance necessary for a modern office environment. The proposed midlife engineering services refurbishment would address this issue, with particular emphasis on the replacement of chancery building engineering services that have reached their end of life. The refurbishment would also meet the lease obligations by refitting the building services of the embassy premises tenanted by the International Energy Agency. When completed, the refurbishment works would ensure that the embassy complies with current standards and codes and would protect the investment of the Commonwealth. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is planned to commence in mid-2011 and be completed by mid-2013. I commend the motion to the House.",122

240,Mr MCMULLAN,ADJOURNMENT,FraserParliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance) (4.39 pm)-I move: That the House do now adjourn. Climate Change,123
241,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"In the few minutes that are available to me, I will pick up from where the member for Lyne started the discussion on the matter of public importance today, and that is around the engagement of households on climate change. One thing the member for Lyne may care to reflect on, as I think all people should reflect on, is that this parliament building is no place to start. It is the biggest house in nation, yet this house is not really excelling at all in providing an example on climate change. The current government, led by the then opposition leader, the Hon. Kevin Rudd, made the election commitment that this parliament building would be powered by green power-all of it. We made some inquiries about this during Senate estimates and found that that promise has not been kept. Not only has it been overlooked but it has been overlooked in such a way that this federal Labor government seems to have no intention whatsoever of upholding the undertakings and the commitment it made to the Australian public. When we asked why this parliamentary building was not achieving the levels of clean and green energy that were promised to the Australian people by the federal Labor Party, the answer we got was one that basically said, ‘It's too expensive.' Senate estimates questioning revealed that the federal Labor government had buried its promise of a green-powered Parliament House and had opted for a 10 per cent-not 100 per centenergy outcome and participation in a government-wide electricity contract arrangement which will go nowhere near the election promise. This is in order to avoid what the government said were ‘significant budget costs'. So when we are talking about sustainable houses in Australia, the Parliament of Australia, this House, is really not living up to the promises made by the federal Labor Party and by this government when in opposition, and they should be held to account for that. This does go some way to explaining why a tweet came out from the Prime Minister in which he was actually shopping around, looking for someone to give him ideas. It is quite extraordinary to find that the Prime Minister of Australia is actually calling for people to give him ideas about energy-saving our measures for households. This was the tweet that went out on 1 September: ‘Are there any new ideas out there for energy savings measures for households?' I am sure that the reason that tweet went out was because of the disarray that you see in this federal Labor government in relation to energy savings, and that is why there is such a focus on stunts and symbolism but not a commitment to embed sustainability in the operations of this parliament building, in the policies that are implemented by this federal Labor government and in the programs that they roll out. There is no appetite to embed sustainability at all. Instead what we get are these gestures and these stunts-not the genius and the substantive commitment to bring about change over time to show an example to our nation that a cleaner and greener way of living is within our reach and the opportunities for energy savings not only in our own homes but across our economy are there, are real and are completely affordable. We do not see that example coming through. Last Sunday was Sustainable House Day in Langwarrin South. I thank the people who invited me to that property, the many who turned up and those involved in opening this home in Langwarrin South that shows the way forward includes the way a building is designed-its solar orientation, the external walls, the internal walls, the way the roof was structured, the floor, the window treatments, heating and cooling systems, awnings, blinds, double glazing, heating and cooling, the way water is harvested, water heating itself, and solar and wind generation. These and a range of other features show the range of opportunities for improving the sustainability of our homes. We need to do that. But this government is a one-trick pony. They have got pink batts-grossly overextended in terms of our capability to implement that policy-no interest in other ways of lifting the performance of homes, no recognition of other actions that can be taken. You see this right across the housing industry, in the way homes are designed and managed and even in the way programs like the National Rental Affordability Scheme are managed. It basically puts sustainability attributes in a ‘nice to have but not essential' category. Even in the Building the Education Revolution Program, one in nine of those buildings do not even have insulation. Barely half of them have other features like solarefficient glazing and other technology. This government has been caught out; it is all over the place on sustainability. we did not have the MPI time today to outline the opposition's view and pathway forward, because it is a coherent, embedded view-not one that is bolted on. It is not like safety in the 1970s when if you had a safety officer you were okay. We learned that safety was everybody's business, just like sustainability should be everybody's business. There are not just green jobs. (Time expired) Mr David Nancarrow: Proud Dad Bags",123
242,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT,"Madam Deputy Speaker, like your husband and many of my male colleagues in the House, I am a proud dad, and tomorrow I will be joining the launch of ‘I'm a Proud Dad' bags, which was an initiative from the north-west coast now going nationwide with the support of the Commonwealth government. I would like to share that with a lot of the proud dads in this House at the moment. After three years of working with new dads, the Dad's Bag is the result of David Nancarrow's determination to provide some quality resources to mark the occasion of fatherhood, encourage the participation of fathers in their infants' lives and raise the profile of fatherhood within our community. David Nancarrow is the Centacare Tasmania's men and family relationship counsellor in the north-west-and, I have to add, he is a machine. This program is the result of the federal government's response to data indicating that men are traditionally difficult to engage in therapeutic services. The program is aimed specifically at supporting men to express their skills in a variety of ways. The research shows that dads are passionately becoming more and more involved in all aspects of their children's lives. I hope to repudiate what is in those songs Father and Son and Cats in the Cradle-if you remember those. Some of us may live with the guilt expressed It is a shame in those songs. The Dad's Bag will be distributed to new fathers attending antenatal classes along the coast, including the Mersey Community, Burnie Private and Smithton hospitals. Good Beginnings Australia formed a partnership with Centacare Tasmania to develop and cofacilitate approximately 72 classes per year. This translates to about 500 dads per year, like Steven, your husband, Madam Deputy Speaker, who will receive one of these bags. The Dad's Bag is filled with quality information, including the fantastic baby-care guide for fathers that parallels a car manual. It is called 24-hour cotside assistance: the new baby manual for dads. It has some really good information. Each bag also has a copy of What's for Tea, Dad? You would not want to ask me that, of course. I would have to look up What's for Tea, Dad? This cookbook is written by David Nancarrow and provides simple, healthy, cheap recipes that children love. Chips would be included in that, I suspect. David hopes his books will improve relationships by encouraging dads and children to cook together. What a sight that would be. The national interest in the Dad's Bag has been overwhelming and very positive. It is terrific that such an initiative is local creation and a result of listening to the feedback of new dads. The bag contains the 24-hour cotside assistance booklet, which is set out just like a car manual with lots of interesting information. For instance, there is: ‘Looking under the hood. Does it really need to be changed? Some dads prefer the sniff method. Some peek. Others can tell by the feel of the nappy.' That has very good information and I recommend it. It is very relevant for those of us with a memory and a good nose. The humdinger of them all: What's for Tea, Dad? 23 easy to follow recipes: a cookbook for dad. It has hints on apple crumble, quick puddings, pan fried bananas, jam roly-poly, pancakes, pasta bake, homemade hamburgers-you can still have them-scallop dishes, fish dishes, chicken pie, creamy potato and lots and lots more. Also included are little sections where you put photos of dad and the kids cooking and sections where you can write down little poems you think of while you are at it. It has tips for dad about what to do with the children. If I may, what caught my eye in the Dad's Bag was a great story ‘Food for thought': ‘As a flight attendant, I was serving dinner to passengers. After I placed a plate of lasagne on one man's tray, he sampled it and frowned. “Doesn't it taste like mum's?” I jokingly asked. “Mum's?” he replied. “This doesn't even taste like Dad's.” This material of course will not be the butt of such a joke and I congratulate David Nancarrow and Centacare Tasmania for such a wonderful initiative. I am a proud dad too. Swan Electorate: Homebirthing Survey",125
243,Mr IRONS,ADJOURNMENT,"I too am a proud dad. But this evening I am going to talk about women, so I will leave the dad things out because the member for Braddon did a great job of that. This evening I rise to a talk about the results of the choice in childbirth survey I recently conducted in my electorate of Swan. Obviously I did the survey because of the midwives bill that was debated in the House. Unfortunately, I missed the debate due to my son being ill. As I am single father, I was needed at home. I just spoke to Jarrad, who is actually going in for an operation tonight. I wish him well. I will see him tomorrow morning when I get back. I am sure he will survive. He is made of tough stuff like his old man. I received so many responses from the electorate survey that I really felt obligated to raise them in this place even though the bill has been previously dealt with. I decided to seek feedback from the community after the government introduced legislation that would have made the practice of homebirthing effectively illegal. As members would be aware, there are currently no insurance companies in Australia willing to provide indemnity insurance for private midwives specialising in homebirthing. Homebirthing is legal; however, women who choose this option must sign a disclaimer form. The proposed changes would have resulted in the introduction of a national registration and accreditation scheme, where only midwives with insurance could legally register and continue to work. As private midwives practising homebirthing are unable to obtain insurance, they would not have been able to continue providing this service legally. Last year, there were only 700 homebirths across the country, less than 0.3 per cent of all births. My survey was of 1,800 women in my electorate. I know that most health organisations advise against homebirthing, but should that give the government the right to make the practice effectively illegal? Of the responses I have received so far, over 80 per cent supported the continuation of homebirthing, with 15 per cent saying that it should be made illegal. Amazingly, many of the 0.3 per cent across the country who have experienced homebirths seem to be in my electorate. Mrs Patrice Walker was one such woman. She said: We have safely delivered all of our five children at home with an accredited midwife. The antenatal and postnatal care we have received has been exceptional. Home birth is a safe, natural and effective alternative for all women with low-risk pregnancies and should be publicly funded. Helen Steep also had a homebirth: I have had 3 natural birthing experiences and have had experience of public hospital and the family birth centre. Jessica Boyce was one of the 0.3 per cent as well. I would like to thank Mrs Robyn Stabler, who took the time to write me a long letter outlining her opposition. She is soon to be a mother of four, all of whom were delivered by homebirths. She is also a student midwife at the local Curtin University in my electorate. Others who have not had a homebirth themselves supported having the option to make that choice. Only today I received a letter from Erin Bolitho, who said: Every woman should have a right to make the correct decision for her! … The main factor encing natural childbirth is support. Fiona Thompson said: People should have the right to make their own choices and decisions. Ms Steele agreed. She said: Life is about making choices, be they wrong or right. Samantha Richards of Lynwood simply asked: What's next, 2 child policy? Some women argued that homebirthing has been considered normal practice for many previous generations. Michaela Musca said: That's taking away the rights of women and men to make their own choice. Human rights. In the old fashioned days at home was the only choice and what about the impact it would take off the public hospital system? Another constituent, Tara Price, argued that the practice continues safely in other countries around the world. She said: In many other countries; i.e. Holland … women cost don't even go to hospital to give birth unless medically indicated. Some of my constituents made the point that research has been done that supports the safety of homebirthing: Enormous research has been done that shows home-birthing has less complications for mother and child. In the UK and other parts of the world they promote home birthing so why is Australia so backward? Ms Baison agreed, saying: It is not an unsafe option for healthy women. Others reacted angrily to the idea that the government was making this illegal. Louise Jonker said such a move would be ‘sexist and patriarchal'. As I mentioned before, there were some responses from people who thought it was a good idea to make the practice effectively illegal. Most of these responses pertained to influ- potential complications that could result from the practice of homebirthing. Jeanette Mander was worried about this and Jenny Yikwin Zu agreed, saying that doctors had the best equipment available. Kativa Singh said: It is unsafe and lacks the facilities of our hospitals. There is a higher risk of accidents and death. I would like to thank everyone who took the time to contact me about this matter and I urge the health minister to consider the results of this survey. I note that the minister now seems to have reversed her decision to make homebirthing effectively illegal, and that seems to be a position most of my respondents support. I urge all members to listen to what their community has to say about this and other matters that are debated in parliament. (Time expired) Music and Language Education",126
244,Mr DREYFUS,ADJOURNMENT,"Isaacs) (4.54 pm)Much of the discussion on the new national curriculum has focused on literacy and numeracy. Less focus has been given to the other important areas of the curriculum. I am pleased to note that languages, along with the arts, including music, are part of the second phase of developing the national curriculum. Besides the very practical benefits, both music and languages are valuable in their own right. Music education enriches the lives of students and those around them. It brings joy and pleasure. It connects students to our shared cultural heritage, so much of which is bound up in music. Music opens a window of opportunity through which we can learn about and share in the lives and experiences of those from different nations around the world. Music in itself transcends cultural diversity, breaking down cultural barriers. Music gives students the opportunity to express themselves creatively, and it has long been understood that music in schools improves the teaching and learning environment for other subjects as well. Both my parents are professional musicians. They have spent all of their lives in music-my father in composing and performing, after a very brief time as a school music teacher; my mother in performing and a very long time as a school music teacher. I am proud to say my father is still composing and performing and my mother is still teaching music. Recently, I was very pleased to be able to announce that Mr Shain Kurelja, a teacher at Aspendale Gardens Primary School, had won an award in the Teacher category of the 2009 National Awards for Excellence in School Music Education. Mr Kurelja was one of only 12 teachers across the nation to receive this award. As part of the award, Shain received a grant of $5,000 to further his professional learning in the field of music education. Shain has made an outstanding contribution to our community by demonstrating the enthusiasm, passion and dedication needed to provide a positive schooling experience for our students. The award is a wonderful acknowledgement of Shain's expertise in music education and one which our community is immensely proud of. I believe that musical education should be made available to all students and that it should be appropriately resourced to ensure that all students are given the opportunity to learn and enjoy music in all its varied forms. Education in the 21st century has broadened from the basic three Rs. The emergence of the technological era and the growth in non-Western European economies have brought the expansion of our boundaries. The distances between countries, peoples and regions have shrunk. Australia can no longer rely upon geographical isolation for an insular approach to language. If we wish to continue our economic development it is imperative that we promote the study of language and culture in our schools. In particular, Australia will require a much higher proficiency in Asian language. East Asia is the destination of almost 60 per cent of Australia's exports. One of the wonderful developments in modern Australian history is the shift of our focus as a nation to our own region. Our increased engagement with East Asia and South-East Asia has enhanced our culture, our economy, our selfperception and our intellectual life. In opposition to the view that these changes make the learning of Asian languages critical, there is an alternative view that holds that, because English is developing into a common global language, Australians can be complacent in our approach to the learning of new languages. Of course, this view ignores two issues. Firstly, the portunity will be lost for Australians to the intrinsic benefits, beyond the practical benefits, that arise from learning another language. Learning a second language provides an additional framework for observing and understanding our world and our experiences. Secondly, those from non-English-speaking nations will hold a competitive advantage through speaking both their native language and English. That is why the Rudd Labor government is so strong in its support for the improved teaching and greater availability of Asian languages in schools. The $62.4 million National Asian Languages and Studies in Schools Program is supporting additional Asian languages classes in high school. It is providing more opportunities for teacher training support. The Becoming Asia Literate: Grants to Schools program is part of the Rudd government's $62.4 million Asian languages program. Aspendale Gardens Primary School has applied for funding under this program, an application which I have strongly supported. The Rudd government's National Asian Languages and Studies in Schools Program puts Australia back on track for learning Asian languages, a track which we veered off in 2001, when the former government shut down the Asian languages program established by the Keating government in 1995. It is very good to see this program supporting the development of specialist curricula for students with advanced abilities in Asian languages and studies. I have seen, throughout my electorate, increased attention being given in all schools to Asian languages. (Time expired) Perth Bunbury Highway",128
