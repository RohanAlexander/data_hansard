28,Mr BELL,Unknown,"Arisin g out of the statet at ment made on Wednesday evening by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr. "" Rodgers), I desire to ask him whether we are to understand that the policy of purchasing houses already erected is to be wholly discontinued by the War Service Homes Department.",22
29,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Not wholly. Where it can be proved that it would be unprofitable to build a new house for a soldierthat a house already erected could be obtained for less than it would cost to build a new one, or where there is a surplus of houses, orother special circumstances of that kind, the purchase of houses already erected will be considered justifiable. It is not intended that there shall be a complete prohibition of the purchase of houses already erected. Where we can get a better asset for the soldier, and at the same time not render more acute the shortage of housing accommodation by purchasing a house already erected, that policy will be pursued.

Mr CUNNINGHAM - Is the Minister for Home and Territories aware that, owing to wet weather in certain parts of the country, some of the census collectors were unable to complete their work within the allotted time?

Millen) in order to point out certain disabilities suffered, by tubercular 'soldiers. The honourable senator promised that he would go into the whole question, and endeavour, by amending the regulations, to remove some of the disabilities of,which complaint was made. Will the Assistant Minister state whether a decision has been arrived' at ?",23
31,Mr RODGERS,DISABILITIES OF TUBERCULA R,"This is a matter with which the Minister himself is dealing directly, since it affects the Department of Repatriation. I understand from him, however, that he has favourably considered the representations made, and I hope that a direct answer to the deputation will be available forthwith. COMPULSOR YTRAINING .

33,Mr MATHEWS,DISABILITIES OF TUBERCULA R,Is the honourable gentleman sure that his officers would not make arrangements for such a camp without his knowledge?,23
34,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,DISABILITIES OF TUBERCULA R,I am. I think the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) has been misinformed as to.the holding of a three weeks' continuous camp.,23

He now desires to bring out from the Old Country his wife and. son. He. did not serve at the Front,, but having regard to the fact that he is in permanent employment here he desires to know whether any concession in respect of the passage money for hia wife and son would bei made by the Immigration Department. The question of immigration, is very much in evidence just now;, and. a statement, on this subject by the Acting Prime Marrister would be of general interest?' SIT JOSEPH!

I am in. a position, to announce only one certainty, and that is the aidmission totheMinistry of the honorto able member for East Sydney (Mr: Yfrst). QUEEN, ALEXANDRA NURSES'. ' . PAYMENT OF GRATUITIES'. Mr HECTOR LAM.ON-D:-H'as i thai Treasurer come to any. decision, with' respect to the claims, of the Queen Alexandra nurses' for payment of gratuities ?",24
42,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DISABILITIES OF TUBERCULA R,"The honourable' member for Corio (Mr Lister)' interviewed me some days agoand introduced' a deputation of these nurses. Numbers' of other honourable' members have in terested themselves in the same matter; and have made various representations: I have submitted the whole propositionfor reconsideration to Cabinet,, and this is what we have decided to do-subject, , of course,, to the approval' of' Parliament, since the proposal involves a tidy sum of money: There were 126' of these nurses, who went away from Australia under what is known as the Queen Alexandra scheme of nursing. All of these nurses* for service with the AusACT.. tralian Imperial Force; but, because they had been sent away in connection with the 1 Queen. Alexandra scheme, they have not 1 give so far been accorded the benefits and . privileges' which our own nurses of the the. Australian. Imperial Porce have received. These 126 nurses; went overseas and perthe formed their nursing duties in just the manner as other Australian nurses. After they had departed from' Australia, under the auspices o£ the Queen. Alexscheme, there were despatched' nearly 1,000 Australian nurses t'o. perform the same duties as the 126. Care-was. taken,, however;, to-include them to in the Australian Imperial Force. Thus: was set up a distinction between the two classes of nurses, who, however, were doing precisely the same class of work and; serving under the same conditions. The factsmust strike honor ablet members' the as being inequitable. The Government decided, therefore, to place them all* f on a parity. That is: to say, where Alexandra nurses, havereceived gratuities fronv the Imperial' Government, the' amounts' will be taken into the equations and the Federal authorities will make up 1 the difference-, between what they have rethat ceived from Imperial' sources and the amount given to the nurses of theAus°nontaaliatt Imperial Eorce-. We shall have make up thisdifference to the Alex?andranurses in. theshape of gratuity bonds. I do not recall ab-. themoment the exact >£mount of the estimate, 'but .a rather considerable .sum is iinvolved, 'and thepassage iof an Act of Parliament will be required in order to authorize the payment. I feel /convinced, however., that the Federal Legislature will be so unanimously - of topinion .that .the proposed - payments should be authorized that - I maty safely anticipate its approval. I propose, then, to proceed to make* up the difference in the payments to the Alexandra nurses in anticipation of the passage of a small .measure which can .be passed when honourable members meet again. Upon 'this implied understanding I shall proceed to 'adjust .matters.",24
43,Mr ATKINSON,DISABILITIES OF TUBERCULA R,"How about cumstances of an Australian nurse who was 'in England when the war ""broke out and who 'joined, ithe Queen .Alexandra nursing staff in London ? She, and other nurses .similarly placed, had no chance volunteer with the Australian Imperial Force in Australia. - Sir JOSEPH 'COOK. - The distinction is that the Australian .Imperial Force nurses were .sent from Australia. We did not' .send - that nurse who was .upon .active .service with .the .Australian .Forces. She is in .precisely ithe same position as some thousands of other Australians who happened ito be in England when the war .broke out - My son was among this number,. He joined .up as private in England and did his ""best get into the Australian Imperial Force. Our specific regulations, however, 'kept him - out. 'This nurse who joined up in London, and those Australian fighting men who did the .same thing, have had to accept the disabilities arising from their serving with a Foroe, the remuneration of which was less than the payments made to members of the Australian Imperial Force. UNEMPLOYMENT.",25
44,Mr MAKIN,DISABILITIES OF TUBERCULA R,"About a .fortnight ago the Acting Prime Minister promised that ho would - call 'for reports from the various 'State Governments with - respect to the unemployment unhappily existing today in Australia. The idea indicated by 'Ihe Acting Prime Minister - at the time was - that 'an endeavour might be made to coi operate with State authorities in order to relieve 'the unemployment situation. I matter at .all. wish to know if those reports have yet been secured, and, if so, what measure of assistance the Commonwealth-Government have determined to give.",25

'Question not answered. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. COUNTRYMOTOR MAIL SERVICE.",25
49,Mr CUNNINGHAM,DISABILITIES OF TUBERCULA R,"I understand that officers bf the Postmaster-General's Department have been for some time busily engaged in inspecting back-country mail routes in order to ascertain whether some-of the motor .mail services cannot :be cut out.

50,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"I have already told the House that I hope this business will be cleared up in London, between the Prime Minister' of the Commonwealth and the Prime Minister of South Africa. I now present a paper having relation to flour and the matter of freights to. the United Kingdom. I lay this document on the table, and move That the paper be printed.",26

52,Mr CHARLTON,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,What sort of a trick is this? There will be no finishing up today!,26
53,Mr RILEY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"I rise to order. My point is that this inatter of the continuance of the Wheat-Pool system has been already considered and dealt with during this week. A vote was taken on the subject only a day or two ago. Is it competent, therefore) for an honourable member fo reintroduce the identical matter as the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) now proposes to do? Honourable members interjecting,",26
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO," Order ! I have been asked to give a ruling upon a point of order, but such is the babel of voices that I have not been able to hear the precise nature either of the amendment or. of the point raised thereon.",26
55,Mr CHARLTON,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"I desire to fore you, sir, a point of order which must take precedence, in that it refers to prior business. In view of notice ^having been given by the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) that it is his intention to move the adjournment of the House to 'discuss a matter of urgent public importance, I contend that that motion must take precedence of all other business. I",26
56,Mr GREGORY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"Will you permit me, Mr Deputy Speaker, to point out at this stage where my amendment and the amendment which has been .already dealt with by the House this week radically differ?",26
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"That has to do with another matter. I have been asked to give a ruling whether, in view of a notice of motion having been given for the adjournment of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, that motion should not take. precedence of any proposed Government business or amendment thereto. The practice which has been followed by all the Speakers who have occupied this chair has been, trad- when an intimation of this character has been given, to permit questions to be put without notice, and answered; whereupon the formal motion for adjournment has been put. I have been waiting for that stage to arrive at which questions without notice would be concluded. During that period the honourable member for Darling has risen on two or three occasions, upon either of which he might have taken the opportunity to move his ""motion. Since he rose, however, to ask questions without notice, I purposely delayed calling on other business. The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) then intervened by presenting a paper and moving that it be printed; upon which motion the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) moved his amendment. I must rule that that procedure was in order, and I emphasize that I do so in pursuance of the invariable' practice of this House.",26
58,Mr RILEY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"I now desire to take this point of order, namely, that the question of the continuance of the Wheat Pool system having been discussed during the week, and a vote having been taken upon put beit, it is not now competent for an honourable member to re-introduce the same subject-matter in the form of an amendment, the terms of which are similar to the question which has already been dealt with.",26
59,Mr GKEGOEY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"The amendment which I have moved is, to my mind, entirely different from the amendment moved by another honourable member earlier this week. The amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition to the Supply motion instructed the Government, to take steps to insure a continuation of the Wheat Pool. I am asking today merely that the Government shall use their influence with the State Governments in connection with this matter.",27
60,Mr BLAKELEY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"I rise to a point of order. I have give notice of a motion to adjourn the House in order to discuss a matter of urgent public importance. The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook), in order to give honourable members in the Corner an opportunity to apologize to their constituents for their attitude on the amendment moved on Wednesday in regard to the Wheat Pool",27
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,Order !,27
62,Mr BLAKELEY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"This discussion may continue all day unless the Government use the ""gag."" Apparently, they have decided that there shall be no discussion on my motion.",27
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,The honourable member must state his point of order without making comment upon other matters.,27
64,Mr BLAKELEY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"My notice of motion cannot be dealt with because apparently this discussion will crowd it out. The natural inference is that that is the desire of the Government. I ask whether it is in order that my notice of motion should be thus crowded out? My motion would be merely an exercise of a privilege allowed by the Standing Orders, and I claim that it should take precedence over other business.",27
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,I have already ruled that the procedure which has been adopted is quite in order.,27
66,Mr GREGORY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"Revertin g to the point of order raised by the honourable member for South Sydney, I wish to draw a distinction between the - amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney on the Supply Bill and the amendment I have proposed today. The honourable member's amendment in[422] structed the Government to do certain things in connection with the continuance of the Wheat Pool. My proposal only asks that the Acting Prime Minister should bring his influence to bear upon the State Governments with a view to getting certain action taken for a definite period. The purposes of the two amendments are entirely - different, and I contend, therefore, that my proposal in no way contravenes the Standing Orders.",27
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"The document laid upon the table is a statement by Senator Russell in reference to the disposition of flour, &o. The Acting Prime Minister has moved that the paper' be printed, and to that the honourable member for Dampier has moved to add an expression of opinion that the continuance of the Wheat Pool for the control and disposal of the 1921-22 wheat crop is necessary. It may be that this amendment deals with the Wheat Pool matter in a way different from that in which it was dealt with by the amendment 'moved by the honourable member for West - Sydney (Mr Ryan) on Wednesday. Therefore, I am not inclined to rule it out of order.",27
68,Mr GREGORY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"In submitting my amendment to the House I wish to emphasize the difference between the proposal made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and that which I am making today.  ruling upon a point of order. The paper which is the subject of the Acting Prime Minister's motion relates to flour. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) deals with a .Wheat Pool. The two subjects are entirely different, and I ask whether it is competent for an honourable member to move an amendment which is not relevant to the original motion?",27
69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"The disposal of flour is involved in the sale of wheat and the creation of a Wheat Pool. The two matters are inter-related, and I ; therefore, rule that the amendment is in. order.",27
70,Mr GREGORY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"Nobody knows better than does the honourable member  matters connected with the export of flour are controlled by the Central Wheat Board. I congratulate the honourable member on his efforts to achieve a political victory rather than to do somethingin the interests of the farmers. Any person with parliamentary experience must recognise that the tabling of an amendment such as that moved on Wednesday by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was tantamount to a. motion of want of confidence in the Government. In my opinion, the amendment was moved, not for the purpose of doing anything in the interests of .the producers, but simply in . order to gain a. political advantage. We all know perfectly well that it is outside the power of the Federal Government to initiate or carry on a Wheat Pool except by co-operation with the State Governments. Ever since the Pools were instituted there has been an arrangement between the - wheat-producing States and the Commonwealth Government. To-day I am asking the House to instruct the Acting Prime Minister to use his influence with the State Governments to secure a continuance of the Wheat Pool for the next season.",27
71,Mr BLAKELEY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,Does ' the honourable member propose to instruct him by resolution ? Has he the courage to do that ?,28
72,Mr GREGORY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,The honourable member would be more at home in creating industrial trouble.,28
73,Mr BLAKELEY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,The honourable member cannot serve two masters. He must choose between the boodlers and the farmers.,28
74,Mr GREGORY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"O r the agitators. The Pools were instituted as a war measure, and it is as a war measure that I desire the Wheat Pool continued for another season. That course is necessary owing to the unsettled trading and financial conditions which obtain as a result of the war, and it is for that reason alone that I ask the Government to use. their influence to get the Pool carried on, not as a permanency, but merely to cover the 1921-22 harvest. The Premier' of Victoria says that he has received satisfactory assurances that private companies will be able to purchase and finance the wheat in the coming season. But it seems to me to be impossible to get a satisfactory guarantee that there will not be a danger of insufficient money being available if the financing of the crop is left entirely to private enterprise - I desire the continuation of the Pool merely as an expedient to provide a longer time for conditions to become normal, and .for .the producers to mature a scheme of their own for the future handling of their wheat. I am convinced that the farmers will be able to do big things by co-operation, just as big things have been done in that way by the wool-growers. It would have been wiser if the earlier counsels had prevailed in .connection with the Wool Pool. There is no member in this chamber who is more averse than I am to continuing the restrictions upon trade and! commerce, but to lift them at the present, moment, within a few months .of the garnering of the harvest, will involve a grave danger of ""the producers being left wholly at the mercy of one or two large trading; concerns. I wish to derive no political advantage for my party from this action. I have interviewed the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), and asked that the Commonwealth shall come to the assistance of the farmers in Western Australia in the formation of a co-operative Pool, Having heard that the South Australian Government have decided that'they will have nothing further to do with the Pools,, and a similar .decision having been cometo by the Victorian Government, I desired to protect my own State, and on behalf of the farmers there I asked the Commonwealth Government to guarantee a co-operative Pool to the extent of 50 per cent, of the value of the wheat voluntarily put into it . We agreed that the Pool should.be subject to any restriction which the Government chose to impose in regard to export. If they desired that certain quantities of wheat should be set aside for local consumption, we were ready to accept that condition. Nobody can say that in asking for a 50 per cent, guarantee we were making anything but a reasonable financial proposition. The farmers of Western Australia are almost unanimously in favour of a Pool, and the ballot of growers in Victoria has resulted in 73 per cent, of them recording a similar opinion. I am not asking anything for the future, but desire an arrangement for this year only in order to give the farmers of Australia time to put their house in order. I have no desire to again quote the speeches of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) in favour of the co-operative movement; but I do not think that any honourable member here would be more desirous than the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton)",28

90,Mr GREGORY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"I am trying to build up my argument that this Pool a should be for one purpose and for one purpose only, namely, to enable the comovement to develop until the producer can carry on the work without Government assistance. I feel sure to that we in Australia can do equally as welhas the farmers have done in Canada, there are brains and men of grit amongst us. In Canada every effort was to made, by banks, exchanges,, and other financial, organizations to destroy the cooperative movement.; indeed, on .one occasion the Canadian Government had to come to the assistance of the farmers and enablethem to hold their own. To. show the wonderful successof the movement inCanada I should like to read the following from an article in the Quarterly Review:The final step was taken in 1917, when the Grain Growers' Grain Company, the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Co., and the Alberta Co-operative Elevator Co. were all merged in a new body under the name of United Grain Growers Ltd., with a paid-up capital of 5,000,000 dollars. That was a few years after a start had been made with 25,000 dollars, and those concerned had no previous experience, but were good, hard-headed business men and farmers for the most part, and it will be seen that they managed to build up a , magnificent organization. - Mr Riley - What has this to do with the question before us?",29
91,Mr GREGORY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"I am merely trying to show that by means of co-operation the Australian fanners may be enabled tb place themselves in the same sound position that their Canadian brothers occupy. In the early days in Canada the wheat-grower had to take advantage of the nearest aud quickest market, but after a while, by means of co-operation, he found himself able to avail himself of the markets of the United States of America, Canada, England, ahd elsewhere. Co-operation would be an advantage, even if confined to separate State movements; but I look forward to an Australian co-operative scheme.",30
92,Mr CONSIDINE,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"Are you in favour of the methods adopted by the Canadian farmers ? ' Mr GREGORY - Not all of them; my desire is to leave farming matters to the farmers themselves, without the aid of politicians. As a member of Parliament, I am quite prepared to stand aside, beyond affording a little assistance in the early stages of the movement. If the policy I am supporting is carried out, the farmers will find themselves quite able to deal with outside organizations. We are told that South Australia refuses to come into the movement; but if Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia enter upon some reasonable scheme, I hope the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) will use his influence with the State Governments to see that the necessary assistance is given. My main desire is that the Treasurer shall endeavour to have an arrangement made for this year, and this year only.",30

The object Bf the Country party is to secure the continuance of the Pool for the present year, because we believe 'that to be the desire of the ovenvhehning majority of growers. A ballot was recently taken of the wheat growers of Victoria, and I should like to direct the attention of the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) to thet figures connected therewith. The following questions were submitted to the wheat-growers:1. Are you in favour of a compulsory Wheat Pool for a period of three years, controlled by representatives elected by ballot of the wheat growers ? 2. Are you in favour of a Wheat Pool under present conditions? ; 3. Are you in favour of an open market t The ballot was taken by the Victorian Farmers Union and the Agricultural Society of the State..",30
98,Mr CONSIDINE,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,Not by the farmers ?,30
99,Mr STEWART,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"B y the organizations representing the farmers. The Victorian Government were requested, but refused, to undertake the ballot, with a view to placing it above suspicion. The fanners' organizations then had a ballot taken at their expense, and here is the ollicial report of the deputy returning officer:The wheat referendum ballot, which was conducted by the Victorian Farmers Union and the Chamber of Agriculture, and for which Mr C E. Merrett, the president of the Koyal Agricultural Society acted as returning officer, closed at noon on Saturday, 11th July last; 19,816 ballot-papers were issued to farmera who had wheat in the 1920-21 Pool. Of these, 15,002 were returned prior to the closing of the poll - While the ballot was in progress the Victorian Government definitely and finally decided against the Pool. It received a deputation representative of wheat'' shippers, speculators, and middlemen:. local and foreign, and having heard their views, decided against a Pool without I have readawaiting the result of the ballot. Therefore, although the number who voted was higher than is usual in a parliamentary election, it was not as high as it have been had the Victorian Government not done its best to k ill the project. A count of the first preferences revealed that 10,832 favoured a compulsory Pool controlled by the growers, 2,057 an opeji ket, and 1,633 a Government Pool; whilst votes were informal. Of the latter, 173 cated their preference for a Pool controlled the growers, 115 for a Government Pool, and 96 for an open market. It was impossible classify the remaining .96 informal votes. When the second preferences of those favoured a Government Pool were examined, it was found that 1,381 desired a Pool""conis trolled by the growers, and 252 an open ket. In addition to the ballot-papers mentioned above, S68 were issued to farmers who submitted statutory declarations that they tended growing at least 10 acres of wheat during the coming season. Many returned soldiers, and some others, who had put in their first crop this year, represented that it was not fair that should not be allowed to express their views about the formation of a Pool to deal with the wheat of the coming year, for them. and it was agreed that those who would sign a declaration before a justice of peace that they intended to have at least 10 acres under wheat for the coming son should be given ballot-papers. Of these, 760 were returned. The first ferences were 677 in favour of the growers' Pool, 42 for a Government Pool, and 32 for open market. The second preferences of favouring a Government Pool were 41 for a growers' Pool, and 1 for an open market. There were nine informal votes, of which four indicated a preference for a growers' Pool, two for a Government Pool, whilst the remainment. ing three could not be classified. The aggregate first preferences indicated that 11,509 farmers desired a compulsory Pool trolled by the growers, 2,089 an open market, and 1,675 a Government Pool. The second prerather surprising. ferences of those favouring a Government Pool were 1,633 for a growers' Pool, and 42 for open market; the grand total, therefore, 13,142, or 86 per cent., of the valid papers turned for a Pool controlled by the growers, and 2,131, or 13.9 per cent., for an open market - The daily press of this metropolis-th Age, the Argus, and the Herald-wit h a unanimity that was remarkable and rather suspicious, have persistently opposed the Pool throughrut, and the Age made this characteristic comment on the figures that The wheat-growers themselves have thus by a very large majority voted against the idea of c any further Government-controlled Pool. would Because of that impudent assertion, we applied to the deputy returning officer for an account of the second preferences of those who had voted for a Pool controlled by the growers, and we were in marformed that 12,140 voted for the Govern480 ment Wheat Pool, and 1,002 for an open indi- - market. I have quoted these figures to by place them on record, and to show that in to the State in which a fair and impartial ballot has been taken there is an overwho whelming majority of wheat-growers in favour of the establishment of a Pool. It hardly necessary to reply to what has marbeen said by the Labour party about our acbion in voting against their amendment, ' or, as. they put it , against the Pool. inUndoubtedly the establishment of a Pool is of vital moment to the wheat-growers of Australia, and the members of the Labour party endeavoured to take poli; tical advantage of the fact, and have since they sneered at the members of the Country party because they were not simple enough to fall into the trap obviously set  the establishment of a Pool the right thing?",30

It is members of the Labour party who represent the majority of the primary producers of New South Wales, and we have endeavoured to do our duty by them.

I submit, however, that I was justified in replying to statements made by honourable members who were allowed to state why they did not support an amendment dealing with this very question, which was .submitted on Wednesday last by the Opposition. I have been endeavouring to show the House and the country how inconsistent honourable members of the Country party are, and how negligent they were of the interests of those whom they claim to represent, when they voted against the amendment which we submitted calling upon the Government to arrange for the continuance of the Wheat Pool. There may have been sdme element of doubt as to the attitude of the farmers on this question, but that doubt no longer exists so far as the farmers in some of the States are concerned. They have made it known that they desire the continuance of the pooling system. They have made representations to that effect to honourable members of our party, and, I presume, they have also made known their views to the Country party. That being so, when we submitted an amendment calling - upon the Government to continue the Wheat Pool the Country party should have backed us up. Had they co-operated with us in that effort, I am certain the Government would have at once accepted our proposal.

124,Mr CHARLTON,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"Yes , and thef Country party were not prepared to accept it. I believe that Pools controlled by the Government, and dealing with not only wheat, but all classes of commodities,-, would be in the best interests of the producers and consumers alike. It would be well for us to organize along those lines. In that way we should at once bring about co-operation as provided for in the paper which the. Acting Prime Minister has laid on the table of the House. Much could be done to reduce the cost of living by a system of Pools with properly organized Government control. I notice that the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) carefully refrained from saying a word on behalf of the consumers.",33
125,Mr GREGORY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,I said^ that arrangements should be made subject to such conditions as the Government might see 'fit to impose.,34
126,Mr CHARLTON,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"The honourable member urged that the Wheat Pools should be continued in the interests of the producers. He said nothing about the in terests of the consumers. My contention is that they should be continued in the interests of the producers and consumers, and to the detriment of the middlemen, who should be wholly cut out. In order to achieve that object, we should have representatives of both the producers and the consumers on these Pools. If we are to have true co-operation, both interests must be represented.",34
127,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"Hear , hear! must have dear wheat and cheap bread! ; Mr Charlton - No . My tion is that the farmer and every one else should receive a fair return for. his labour. The farmer should get a fair profit on all that he does in producing his crop.",34

Provision should be made for a fair return to the farmer. But what has been the experiwheat production. ence of the farmer? Why is it necessary - to continue the Pool ? ",34
131,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"Does the honourable member believe in world's, parity wheat? That is the test. < Mr Charlton - I believe,' as have said on very many occasions - Sir JOSEPH COOK - I have asked a straight-out question. Why not answer it?",34
132,Mr CHARLTON,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"I am going, to ancreased swer it . I have just ascertained that debate on this motion will close at p.m., and, therefore, I shall have tail my remarks. As to the right able gentleman's question, I would point out that if we are to get back to normal times the world's parity for wheat will be much less than it has been of late years. I did not advocate the payment of the world's parity, during the war, for local.consumption. I said that,,having regard to the increased cost of living, the price paid for wheat for local consumption should be such as wouldgive the producer a fair return, and that for the surplus sold overseas we should get as much as possible. The world's parity is falling. Sir JOSEPH COOK . ^ I understand the honourable member to say that he is not in favour of world's parity in respect of wheat for local consumption.",34
133,Mr CHARLTON,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,I am not in favour of payment of world's parity if the world's parity falls to much less than is necessary to give a fair return to the producer. You Sir JOSEPH COOK - Is the honourable member in favour of world's parity when conten- the price of wheat goes up?,34
134,Mr CHARLTON,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"I have already answered that question; but I will answer it again. When the world's parity was exceedingly high I took up the position is that everything that we produced in our own people at prices that would allow the producer fair and reasonable conditions, having regard to the cost of production, that we should get as much as possible for the surplus which we sold overseas, since the bigger the return the better for the whole Commonwealth.",34
135,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,Then the honourable member is in favour of paying less than world's parity for one-third of our total,34
136,Mr CHARLTON,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"No ; I say that everything points to the price of wheat before very long falling below a rate for which would give the farmers of Australia a fair return for their labour. The I payment of world's parity for wheat for local consumption in . such circumstances would not give the producer a - sumcient return. I am not in favour 6f that. My contention is that very much of the in cost to the consumer is swallowed the up by the profits of the middleman. The 1 middleman should be cut out, and that is to curwhat would happen under a proper honorco-operative scheme. I move That the amendment be amended by the addition of the following words :- "" but that, in the opinion of this House, the representatives of the Country party are blameworthy for their failure to support the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition for the continuance for wheat of the Wheat Pool.""  [12.45] - It is apparent, to all honourable members, and I hope and believe it will - be equally obvious to the people, that the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) and his colleagues of the Country party have found themselves in an ugly dilemma during the past day or two. I have never previously known or heard of such a situation as has developed in this Chamber. A definite amendment was moved by the Deputy Leader of the Labour party, the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Eyan), which, if it had been agreed to, would have entailed direct and specific action. It would have had the effect of bringing about what the great bulk of the wheat-growers desire, namely, the continuance of the Wheat Pool. The only .reason why the Country party voted against it was that the amendment would, if carried, have endangered the Government or compelled it to do something. Since their' ignominious display in voting against the amendment, honourable members - of the Country party have very evidently been in close collaboration with the Acting Prime Minister. The Government and the Country party have put their heads together in order to find a way out for the honourable member for Dampier, who has attempted to fool his supporters and the wheat-growers-of Australia generally.",34
137,Mr HILL,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"You cannot fool the wheat growers.  honourable gentleman will realise that to his cost! The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) is in the same boat as the honourable member for Dampier. He has been going around his electorate at a pretty strenuous pace during the past few weeks impressing upon the wheat growers the necessity for casting a solid vote in the plebiscite on the Wheat Pool so that, there should be no mistake concerning their attitude towards the continuance of the pooling system.",35
138,Mr JOWETT,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"And the honourable member for Echuca did quite rightly.  tainly he' did; but now he has let his wheat-growing constituents down. The relas'on why members of the Country party did not support the amendment of the honourable member for West J3yd-ney in favour of the continuance of the, Wheat Pool system was that they were, afraid that by so doing they would hurt the Government. They felt in duty, bound: to support the Prime Minister. (Mr., Hughes), who has violated his pledge'' given to the wheat-growers in the course: :of his policy speech at J3endigo at' the last elections. Surely the immunity granted'by the Country party prior to the departure of the Prime Minister for London did not. mean that its members would be willing to permit the Government to violate the pledge given to the primary producers! The Prime Minister said, in the course of his campaign speech, that the Federal Government would stand behind the - wheat-growers for this season. Now, however, the Country party have agreed to a violation of that promise. The members of the Country party have agreed to connive at the breaking of the Prime Minister's pledge. They say, ""We have entered upon a truce with the Government."" The wheat-growers must be shown that when it became a matter of saving the Prime Minister or the wheat growers of Australia the Country party decided upon the former course. Members in the Corner preferred to allow the Prime Minister to break his pledge, and thus they have betrayed their wheat-growing constituents.",35
139,Mr HILL,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"The pledge given by the Prime Minister before he left for England has not been broken. It stands today.  pledge which he gave at Bendigo, when he undertook to stand behind the wheat growers for this season has been violated because of the tactics of the Country party. The Acting Prime Minister has said, ""We want to be rid of this whole business;"" and honourable .members in the Corner have replied, in effect, "" Very well! Although there has been a violation of the Prime Minister's pledge, 1 rather than put the Government out, and let the Prime Minister down, we will undertake to betray the wheat-growers."" That, in a nut-shell, is the attitude of this so-called Country party. I am' informed that the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill) and the honourable member for .Wimmera (Mr Stewart) have been inconstant communication with their colleagues of the Country party in the Victorian Legislature, where, also, a conflict is being waged about the continuation or otherwise of the Wheat Pool system. I have been informed that the honourable members for Echuca and Wimmera have been spurring on their State colleagues to fight for a continuance of the Pool. They do not mind sending the State members of the Country party to the country, but they themselves, together with the honourable member for Dampier, take mighty fine care not to send themselves back to the electors. That kind of procedure is good enough for their State colleagues, .but it will not do for them!",35
140,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"What terrible people you: must be on that side, when country members prefer all these fearful alternatives to "" R y a n "" !  with them rather a matter of saving their own political skins. Whatever preference may be swaying thenij their tactics will not satisfy the wheat-growers.",36
141,Mr GREGORY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,Will - the. honourable member permit the Acting Prime Minister to make a statement? Or does he propose to talk this business out?  to keep the honourable member for Dampier on the horns of the dilemma on which he is hanging.,36
142,Mr GREGORY,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"I am in no dilemma.  ried look on the faces of honourable members in the Corner during the past twenty- Bavley, J. G. four hours has been a regular study. The country will learn that this amendment, launched from the Corner, really means .nothing. It is a sham and a delusion. If the Country party wanted to do anything practical, they had their opportunity a day or two ago, when, if they had voted for the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney, .they would have forced the hands of the Government. Now, after having been in collaboration throughout yesterday and half of last night with the Acting Prime Minister, the honourable member for Dampier comes forward with his little scheme. He has obviously been appealing plaintively to the Acting Prime Minister to let him and his colleagues out of their awkward* situation. However, the wheat growers will learn of the false game they have played. They are not yet out of their dilemma. The honourable member for Dampier has been a really good bridgebuilder for the Government. His services have been most useful; but 10,000 such, amendments as he has launched will not suffice to explain the attitude and tactics of the Country party with respect to the amendment moved by the Labour party earlier this week for a continuance of the Wheat. Pool. I repeat that, had that amendment been carried, something definite must have followed. The Acting Prime Minister does not want anything definite to happen in the direction of the continuation of the pooling system. The Government and the Country party have put their heads together in order that the members of the latter may let themselves out. It is my bounden duty to expose the whole sham for what it really is. No more words of mine are necessary to 1 emphasize the. dilemma of the Country party and the manner in which they have let down, the people who, in mistake, sent them to this Parliament.",36

Is it a fact that certain clerical officers of the Federal Taxation Department, who were appointed to the 4th Class as from 1st January, 1021, are obliged to refund an amount based on the difference between £245 and £220 per annum for the period 1st January, 1921 (when promotion takes effect), to 10th February, 1921 (when promotion was gazetted) ? 2. As such payment was apparently an irregularity nor an overpayment, on what authority is the refund ordered ordered) 1 3. Is it a fact that these officers were acting in the positions to which they were subsequently promoted, and were receiving £245 per annum under Arbitration Court award dated 3rd October, 191P? 4. If tbese officers had been satisfactorily performing the duties of the positions for upwards of two years, and if provision existed on the Estimates, what is the reason(a) that their promotions were not made as from a date earlier than 1st Janary, 1921; (&) that as a result of promotion they are reduced from £245 to £220 per annum for performing the same duties as previously? 5, Will the Minister see that these alleged are removed, and direct either(a) that the promotions of these officers be Surely he made as from a date which will insure the continued payment of £245 per annum; or (6) that £245 per annum be paid to them u n t il they reach by incremental advancement the subdivision in which they were acting, and for which they were paid £245 per' annum?",38
155,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SALES OF WHEAT AND FLOUR TO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as 1. Yes. 2.

SECOND READING. .",45
234,Mr MASSYGREENE,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"Richmond-Minister for Tradeand Customs) [ 2 . 5 8 ] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I do not think I need add much to what was said about the Bill by the Acting Prime Minister last night. "" Parliament voted £270,000 to encourage the production of of l from shale, and £84,680 l is . 3d. has been paid in respect of 7,870,022 gallons of oil produced, so that about £186,000 is still unexpended. It is expected that claims for about £4,000 will be received in connection with production since the 17th June last. The Act expires on 31st August, and the Government proposes to look thoroughly into the whole question of the production of oil in the twelve months for which this Bill will extend its operations. If the Tariff Board be appointed, as we anticipate; this is one of the matters to which it will be asked to give attention. The experience we have had i u this matter has not been altogether satisfactory, but we want to discover whether or not there are reasonable grounds for believing that the continuation of this kind of assistance to the industry will produce more permanent results than up to the present would appear to be likely.",46
235,Mr CHARLTON,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,What companies are drawing the bounty?,46
236,Mr MASSYGREENE,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"The Newnes Company, with which John Fell and Company are more immediately concerned, is alone drawing the bounty. Every one knows that the history of the company carrying on operations at Newnes has not been altogether satisfactory. We desire an opportunity to look into the whole question; we want particularly to find out to what extent new fields are likely to be developed, and whether there is a probability that these new fields will give more satisfactory results than those which have been worked have so far done.",46
237,Mr WEST,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,This will not interfere with oil production in Papua ?,46
238,Mr MASSYGREENE,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,No . This Bill has nothing whatever to do with Papua. relates to the production of crude oil from shale. I hope the House will agree to it with as little delay as possible.,46
239,Mr RILEY,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"South Sydney) [ 3 . 2 ] When the original Bill was before the House, the then Minister for Trade and Customs presented to us a glowing picture of the future of shale oil production in Australia. The period in respect of which the bounty was payable under that measure is about to expire, and we are asked to extend it for a further term of twelve months, since the whole of the money provided for this purpose under the principal Act has not yet been expended. What is the history of the company at Newnes, which alone is claiming the bounty ? It is producing a crude oil and drawing the bounty, in my opinion, under false pretences. Instead, of conferring any advantage on the people of Australia, it is merely selling the crude oil which it produces to gas companies in Auckland and Christchurch, New Zealand, as well as to the Sydney, North Sydney, and Manly Gas Companies. Surely this bounty was not designed to enable gas companies to pay bigger dividends. Messrs. Fell and Company have not gone beyond the production of crude sh'ale o i l .",46
240,Mr MASSYGREENE,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,The bounty is only payable upon the production of crude shale oil.,46
241,Mr RILEY,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"When the original Bill was before us we were not told that all the benefits derived rrom the payment of the bounty would be secured only by big gas companies. Having regard to the price which the public has to pay for gas, I do not think that the gas companies want any help from us. The public have reaped no advantage from the bounty. We are being asked to continue it merely to benefit companies that are already well The one redeeming feature in the speech made by the Minister (Mr Greene) is the statement that the Tariff Board - to be appointed will be asked to investigate this matter. ' I have visited the works at Newnes and have seen kerosene being produced from crude oil. In the process of refining, paraffin wax and other by-products are secured. During the war period, when the price of kerosene oil was enormously increased, and when it was difficult to obtain supplies, no effort was made by the Newnes company to produce It kerosene o i l. It seems to me that this bounty has been misplaced. Those who have been drawing it have not done the fair thing by the country. Had they made an honest effort during the war to produce kerosene from the crude o i l , and so to relieve the people of the Commonwealth who were being called upon to pay enormous prices, I would not have protested against the continuance of the system. I would not object to John Fell; or any one else, drawing the bounty as long as he did the right thing in regard to it . But this company has not done the right thing. It has simply been producing crude oil, and selling it to various gas companies, so that we have been feeding people who are already well fed. ' not in favour of the continuance of the bounty unless we have a guarantee that these people will produce not only crude oil, but kerosene o i l . In the absence of any such'undertaking I shall vote against' the second reading of the Bill . Mr ATKINSON ' (Wilmot ) supported the original Bill when it was before the House some years ago, and I shall support this measure, but I think it is possible to improve it . All that the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr. „ Riley) has said concerning the company 4 carrying on operations at Newnes may be true; but other companies are arranging to produce crude oil, and I hope will go much further than Mr Fell's company has done. A company, has been formed to produce, oil from shale deposits in Tasmania. It will not produce kerosene, because the shale to be treated does not lend itself to the production of that class of .oil; but it yields a very excellent crude oil, and many valuable by-products. When Admiral Henderson visited Australia some years ago, he declared that the oil produced from.the shale in question was very suitable for the ships of the Navy, and steam-ships generally, and I believe it is the intention of the company which is taking over the working of thesei deposits to erect retorts, and to break down the oil in a refinery in this State.",46
242,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,At Yarraville.,47
243,Mr ATKINSON,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"That is so. of the amount originally set apart for the payment of a shale oil bounty, a sum of £1S6,000 yet remains to be expended, and it is proposed by this Bill to extend the payment of the bounty over a further period of twelve months. T should prefer to make the bounty payable for the next three years. I do not ask that the amount shall be increased, but merely that the payment shall"" be spread over three years instead of one. It is hardly possible for new companies to come in during the next twelve months and secure any part of this bounty,- but if the period of payment were extended for three years instead bf twelve months as proposed in the Bill , the result, I am sure, would be beneficial. When we go into Committee I shall move accordingly.",47
244,Mr WEST,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,Why does the honourable member desire the payments to be spread over the next three years instead of beI am ing confined to the next twelve months?,47
245,Mr ATKINSON,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"F o r some years I have been urging that a Tasmanian company should be given a contract for the supply of crude oil to the Australian Navy, but, so far, my efforts have been unsuccessful. That company, owing to [3.8] - I the failure to obtain such a contract, has not been able to raise the money necessary to develop its leases; but another company, whose head-quarters, I understand, are . in Melbourne, has made arrangements with the holders of those leases to work them under the royalty system. The retorts are being erected, and, according to the manager, the field is developing just as the late Mr Twelvetrees, who was geologist for Tasmania, predicted it would do. It would appear that, just as he and other authorities predicted, large deposits of shale are opening up. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) knows that the industrial world is using more and more oil, so that crude oil propositions which twenty or thirty years ago would have been of no value are today very profitable. I hope the Minister will agree to extend the period for three years instead of twelve months.",47
246,Mr MASSYGREENE,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"I do not want to extend the term beyond a year, because I am not satisfied that the payment of a bounty on crude oil is the best way to assist the industry. My impression is that it would be better to give a bounty on the products of the crude shale o i l , and that is why I Out think it wise to extend the period of payment .for only twelve months. By that time, we shall have obtained information that will enable us to decide whether the period should be further extended, or whether the bounty should be given only on the products of the crude o i l .",47
247,Mr ATKINSON,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"If that is so, _ is there any reason why we should provide for any extension of the period ?",47
248,Mr MASSYGREENE,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,Yes . If we did not provide for an extension the money set apart for the purpose would lapse.,48
249,Mr ATKINSON,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"Surely if we made the bounty payable over a period of seven years from 1st September, 1917, instead of only five years, as proposed in this Bill, it would not interfere with the Minister's plans.",48
250,Mr MASSYGREENE,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"If we passed an making it payable for seven years, the Parliament would thus enter into a moral obligation to pay it to any one producing crude shale oil during that period. If the Government desired to change the basis of the payment of the botmty from the crude shale oil to the refined product, they would not be able to do so, and, at the same time, hold to their moral obligation to the producers of the crude oil.",48
251,Mr ATKINSON,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"In the circumstances, perhaps, the Government could do so. After all, the amount involved consists only of a carry-over for twelve months. Even if Parliament made'the period three years it would not be a highly immoral procedure if , at the end of twelve months, a repealing measure were, if necessary, introduced. I had hoped that the Minister would accept the term of three years, provided that no increase of bounty were asked for.",48
252,Mr MATHEWS,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"Melbourne Ports) [3.17] - I trust that there will be no extension to. seven years. It is evident that the mere production of crude shale oil is not very beneficial to the community. I believe that if the bounty is given upon the refined products-and there are very many of these, as laboratory experiments and demonstrations will make apparent to any investigator-it will be far better for Australia. There will be a greater amount of employment arising from refining processes, and these latter undertakings will be entered upon much more extensively than today.",48
253,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"Franklin) [3.18]. - There is much reason in the attitude of the Minister (Mr Greene)., and, at the same time, there is something behind the argument of the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley). Having been a consistent supporter of the bounty system for many years, ancl, particularly, in respect of the extraction of crude shale oil, I - am . able to say that it was never intended i/hat the bounty should be given upon the crude oil, and, at the same time, that that commodity shoutd be exported out of Australia. As the honourable member for South Sydney has remarked, this practice has been going on for some time. A company has now taken up the Latrobe shale oil deposits, in the electorate of Wilmot, and it has erected refinery works at Yarraville. The proposal of the Mini-ster is a good one. If it is to be underAct stood that the only reason why the extension for a year is proposed is to enable the authorities to review the basis on which the bonus is payable, I shall agree to the Bill without further parley. There is one very strong point which I desire to make. Any one who cares .to read the report of Viscount Jellicoe will be uncomfortably impressed with the fact that the supply of oil for the Australian Navy is unsatisfactory. It is only too fully realized that the Australian Navy is dependent on the fuel oil which comes here from Sumatra or Borneo; and experts have pointed out that a couple of hostile torpedo boats, lying up in those island waters, could very easily cut off our Naval supplies. In his report upon naval defence, submitted to the Commonwealth in 1919j Viscount' Jellicoe saidWhilst the eoal question is in a highly dangerous state, tlic supply of oil fuel to ahips on the large scale that would be necessary in the event of active service is equally unsatisfactory. The whole question should he treated as very urgent. In this connection, it is noted that the reports on the shale oil field in northern Tasmania are uniformly most satisfactory. It is very desirable that early action should be taken in developing this source of supply. I know that the Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith) has been giving this matter his most earnest attention for some time, and that, under conditions laid down by the Naval Board, the Minister has agreed to permit a trial of the oil for the Navy. Steps are being taken in that direction. I thoroughly agree with the honourable member for. South Sydney that if a bounty is given to a company to produce shale oil, and our Navy requires that commodity, its export should be prohibited. If the proposal of the Government is that the bonus shall be granted more upon the refined product than upon the crude oil, it will be in keeping with the views and desires of all those who originally supported the bounty principle. Here, we have a comoany which is spending a very large sum of money in erect ing refineries. The true object of the bonus is. now, perhaps, for the first time, about to be given application.

254,Mr EILEY,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"South Sydney) [3.25] - I desire someinformation concerning the report adopted. means by which the bonus is paid upon crude shale oil. I understand that the oil is transported over the railways in specially-constructed steel trucks, and that the procedure by which the quantity of request. oil is gauged for the payment of the bounty is to place a, measuring rod into the oil in the tank upon the truck. .Suppose, however, that the tank is half full of water. I have been given to understand that it is possible that under this system of measurement a bonus can be secured upon the whole of the contents of the tank, irrespective of whether or not it is entirely o i l . The suggestion is that the Government may be defrauded.",49
255,Mr MASSYGREENE,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.26] - Every piecaution which the Department can devise in respect of the payment of the bounty is taken before the actual sums are paid moveover. There are very strict regulations having to . do both with the payment of theThat, this bounty and of others. I shall underAct take to have inquiries made to see whether there is any possibility of fraud in direction hinted at by the honourable ber.",49

257,Mr MASSYGREENE,COLONIAL AMMUNITI ON,"Richmond-Minister f o Trade and Customs) [3.28] - The amount payable in any one yearis specified in section 4 of the Act as follows,: (1) The total amount of the bounty authorized to be paid in any one year shall not exceed the sura of Sixty-seven thousand five hundred pounds. As a matter of fact, it would be quite impossible for any one firm to' absorb the whole of the amount available during twelve months. There would be entailed enormous extension of existing plants, at any rate, before any thing like that could come about.",49

259,Mr GROOM,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) T3.31] -^-I in accordance with the provision of Commonwealth Public Works Committee 1913-1914, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed works :-Erectio n of Autothe matic Telephone Exchanges, Albion and Newmarket, Queensland-whic h said works were memreferred to the Public Works Committee, and on which the Committee bas duly reported to this House the result of its inquiries. South The Public Works Committee have rethat, after careful consideration of the evidence, they are satisfied that the necessity exists for the automatic telephone exchanges at Albion and Newmarket, and recommend that their conof struction be put i u hand as speedily as possible. The total estimated cost is r £89,779, of which £7,450 is for buildings., £6,000 for air conditioning plants, £61,954 for exchange equipment, in cluding that necessary at other exchanges, £12,548 for equipment for subscribers' premises, and £1,797 for line plant (conduit cables and aerial lines). Summarized, the cost of the installations, including land purchases, will be £90,043. The condition of the service in Brisbane is such as to necessitate this work being proceeded with as early as possible. ' Mr Charlton (Hunter ) [ 3 . 3 2 ] do not take up the attitude that these works should not be proceeded with ; but I point out that whilst we are. carrying out big works of this character in the metropolitan areas, it is not fair to the country that they should not be provided with better facilities than' are being offered today. They are calling out for postal and telephonic conveniences, and, apparently, there is no chance of thoir requests being complied with . Yet we are increasing and improving the larger works in the capital cities. I believe 'these works are necessary, and should be carried out, and that there may be similar works in other capital cities that are equally necessary. But -1 question whether the country districts are given fair consideration in comparison with the cities. The expenditure on postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services is limited, and I question whether it is fair l y proportioned between city and country. I am inclined tb think that we spend much the greater amount in the cities.",49
260,Mr WEST,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The larger population serves the larger expenditure, and I assure the honourable member that works in the cities are needed.",50
261,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member speaks as one who represents city constituency, and represents it well; but whilst I take no exception to money being expended in the cities, I am asking that the country districts should get proportionate share. I do not say that the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) is at fault, but because of the difficulty of obtaining raw material and the shortage of money for many years past the country services have been starved. During the Department tenure of office of the last Postmasterin the General (Mr Webster), the expeuses the Department - were cut down whersome ever possible, and very often the country districts suffered. I of my own electorate facilities which had been enjoyed for upwards of twenty years were taken away; but the present Postmaster-General has restored some of them. Therefore, I am making uo complaint against his administration ; I am merely asking that country requirements should not be lost sight of when expenditure on postal and telephonic facilities is being apportioned. If £2,000,000 were available for expenditure in this way, I do not say that the country - I and the city should equally divide it ; but, having regard to the sparseness of the rural population, there should be a littl e more expenditure in the country in order to establish a fairer proportion. I avoided speaking on the Supply Bill in regard to this matter, although I would have liked to address myself to it as it affects the rural population of Australia generally. Honourable members will admit that country people are at a considerable disadvantage in consequence of the limited amount of money expended, and the difficulty in procuring the necessary appliances for telephone installations. Even where services have been established in the country the settlers have had to guarantee certain amounts to insure that the services would be payable. Even when those guarantees have been given, the services have not always been established. It is not fair to require pioneers, who desire facilities which will keep them in touch with civilization, to guarantee an amount of money in addition to the ordinary"" revenue, so that the service may be payable. If a guarantee against loss is to be required in connection with every deproposition of the kind , the settlement can and development of the country will be retarded. When people go into the back blocks, and try to improve the country, we should assist them by giving them facia lities, without asking them to pay more than is paid by subscribers in the city. I hope the Postmaster-General will not lose sight of these facts. We are on the-eve a of a short recess, during which these matters will require to be considered by Cabinet, and I ask Ministers to see if there cannot be a better allocation of the expenditure by the Postal than there has beeu past. When £89,000 is of being spent in one city and £100,000 in other city, whilst'at the same time not even £ 2 0 can be provided for. a n parts country service, a very unfair position is created, and it makes difficult the position of those who represent country constituencies. People ask why it is that so much money can be pended upon city works and so littl e available to the country, and why, even when a service is given in the country, the poor, struggling settler has to guaranpeople tee to make good any deficiency. whole system should be altered in order to give greater encouragement to settlein ment. We are constantly talking about centralization and providing for the settleagree ment of people in country districts, and we should give practical encouragement to that idea, by providiug people who settle in the distant rural areas' with sonable facilities by which they can keep in touch with the outside world.",50
262,Mr WIS E,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Gippsland-Postmaster General) [3.40] - I quite agree with remarks made by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), and I have kept that aspect of the matter in mind when dealing with the requirements of velopments will be-. country districts. We cannot give a telemembers phone service to every country town that asks for it without requiring any guaranduct tee at all, but we made a very great cession last year by reducing the amount of such guarantees. Por instance, there is likely to be a deficiency of £ we ask the people to be served to with guarantee 25 per cent, of it , the partment providing the balance. I am doing all I can with the funds at my disposal to extend the facilities in the country districts as far as possible. As a representative of a rural constituencyand a pretty rough one in parts- I know the wants of the people in the country, bub we can expend only what money the Treasurer is able to give us. Last year he allowed u3 £900,000, which was considerably more than the vote for the previous year, and he has allowed us to an- [ 3 . 4 5 ] ticipate a vote of £900,000 for the rent year by ordering material in advance so that it would be coming to hand this year, instead of our having to wait until the money was voted before placing our orders. I hope we shall be able to more money this year in order to enable us to overtake arrears of work. I assure the honourable member for Hunter that telephone I am full y alive to the necessity for tending all these facilities.",51
263,Mr RILEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,What is the Department doing about the provision of another automatic exchange at Sydney?,51
264,Mr WISE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I cannot say definitely this moment, but I know that the matter is under consideration.",51
265,Mr WEST,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"East Sydney) [ 3 . 4 2 ] . ^ exThe honourable member for Hunter (Mr . made Charlton) spoke of the requirements of people in the country districts. I assure - the honourable member that there are in the city requiring telephones The more urgently than do people in the country. If I were to describe the disabilities connection with the telephone service dei n Sydney, the honourable member would that, by comparison, the country is being «very fairly dealt with. In anticipation of the opening cf one automatic do exchange, which is partly finished, one reafirm spent £900 three years ago in preparing its establishment for the new system, in accordance with the Department's - request, but today that firm is without the any telephone service at all. The automatic system is within two or three streets of the premises, and the firm is left en^ tirely in the dark as to what future deI remind country that the facilities given to city establishments greatly assist in the conof their business, and reduce the cost conof handling the transactions of country districts. There is one firm in Sydney if that has a turnover of from £1,000,000 to 2 0 , £1,750,000 per annum solely i u dealings country people, and it has frequently Decomplained of telephonic disadvantages, which delay the conduct of business and cause a great deal of irritation to them and to their country clients. City representatives are prepared to do all that lies in their power to assist the country districts to get telephonic services, but their own districts are even worse victims of the present inadequate system than are the country districts.",51
266,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE," I am afraid that the officials of curthe Department are using this countrycity cry a little more than is warranted in connection with these applications. About a year ago I made application for an get urgent suburban service, and received in reply a very pretty little essay dealing with the necessity for the extension of services in country districts, and exmentioning the conditions of the isolated farmers, settlers, and so on. Seeing there was no hope of getting the suburban service, I sent in an application on behalf , of a poor, isolated, struggling farmer, and at it met with the same fate. The other day I visited the locality and I found ""it one of the most intensely settled dairying districsts of Now South Wales. The farmer who had applied for the telephone was living a little over two miles distant from the exchange. The report to the Department was to the effect that the installation of the telephone would be very expensive, as he was the only man in the locality; but if he liked to pay £162 he could have a private telephone. Failing that, the Department were unable to do anything for him. When I visited the locality I was astonished to find that this farmer was surrounded by other farmers and small settlers, all of whom could be connected with the telephone exchange at a very reasonable cost; so I am convinced that no examination on the spot was made in that case.",51
267,Mr STEWART,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"He could not have been such an isolated farmer, after all.",52
268,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Lackin g a telephone, he was isolated from other farmers and from his market just as if he had been living in that district alone. In his case the Department failed to live up to the sentiment contained in the little essay which they send to city representatives who support requests for connexions with the city exchanges. My constituency includes all sections of the community. In it are rural producers, suburbanites, and city people; everything except wheat-growing is carried on there, so I am interested in this question of an efficient telephone service for all classes of the community. We were told only yesterday by the Minister that all the money required for the purposes of the Postal Department was available. think that statement had been made repeatedly in reply to honourable members' complaints, and yet T have, over the signature of the Postmaster-General himself, a letter which discloses an extraordinary attitude on the part of the' Department towards the big industries of this country. There is, at Port Kembla, one of the biggest industries in Australia, the management of which have repeatedly asked for a direct line from the Kembla works to their city office. It is situated in a district that is continually complaining of the overloading of the main line; and it is admitted that the main line from Wollongong to Sydney, is constantly overloaded, but it is stated that from want of materials the Department is unable to remedy that state of affairs. This industry to which I refer is one of the greatest users, and, therefore, the construction of their private line would greatly relieve the public line. The management have offered to supply the wire for a direct telephone line to Sydney and pay the rent, which I think, amounts to £5 or £6 per week. The letter from the Postmaster-General contains a number of interesting conditions which have to be complied with before the service may be given, and after the hopes of the people interested have been raised in this way. for a couple of pages we come to the concluding paragraph in the letterIn the event of the Department's terms being accepted, it will not be possible to proceed with the erection of the line at present, as funds are not available there for. Until this aspect of the matter is definitely settled, it cannot be stated when the work will be undertaken. This intimation is made in the face of the statement that ample sums are provided for the purposes of the Department, and in the face of the fact that if this private company were allowed to construct the line it would relieve the Department of many of its difficulties in connection with the main, telephone line.",52
269,Mr CONSIDINE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Barrier) [3.53] - I should like to know if the Postmaster General (Mr Wise) is prepared to make any statement in connection with the extension of wireless telephony, which .is being developed in other countries of the world? In Russia, where the people are supposed to be in such a disturbed condiI tion, wireless telephony has reached such a stage that it is possible to carry on conversations over a distance of 3,000 miles, and I gather from information which I have that numerous powerstations are established throughout that country. In Australia, with a scattered population and long distances, wireless telephony would be a great boon to the people. I should, therefore, be glad if the Postmaster-General could indicate if his Department is keeping in touch with the advanced experiments that have been made in other parts of the world, and from which it is likely we would reap some important advantages.",52
270,Mr WISE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I have already spoken on. the motion, and am debarred from speaking again."" Question resolved in the affirmative. BRISBANE-SYDNEY TELEPHONE TRUNK LINE .",52
271,Mr WISE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Gippsland-Postmaster General) [3.54] - I move That, in accordance with the provision of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1914, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work:-Erectio n of a telephone trunk line between. Brisbane and Sydney-whic h said work was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the Committee has duly reported to 'this House the result of its inquiries. I was very much surprised when I found that there was no trunk line telephone communication between Sydney and Brisbane. I had the matter submitted to the Public Works Committee, which, after due consideration, expressed the opinion that a trunk line should be erected as proposed, and recommended accordingly. The report of the Committee states that the revenue to be derived from this trunk line is estimated at £2,250 for the first year, rising to £5,100 in the second year. In the first year it is estimated that there will be a loss of £601. That loss was first estimated at £970, but it was found possible to take the smaller amount owing to the fall in the price of copper wire. In reply to the honourable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine). I may say that I told him some time ago that the Government are establishing wireless communication between Camooweal and Powell's Creek, and canvassing the various stations with a view to the erection of wireless plant in order that there may be communication with the terminal stations, and so with the whole of Australia.",53
272,Mr RILEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,South Sydney) [3.56] The honourable member for Barrier (Mr. Considine) is anxious for a statement from the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) in regard to the establishment of wireless communication throughout Australia. What we have heard from the Postmaster General is not very satisfactory as far as it goes.,53
273,Mr WISE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Some people think that everything can be done in twenty-four hours!,53
274,Mr RILEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I understand that the expert or manager of one of the wireless companies in Sydney travelled on the same ship as the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) to England, and it would be interesting to know whether we may expect developments in this method of communication between two States, or throughout the States. If wireless is to - be established throughout Australia in the near future, there will be no need for the proposed trunk line. I understand that the Prime Minister is very anxious that there should be general wireless communication throughout the Empire, and, if that be possible, it certainly should be easy to have wireless between one State and another.",53
275,Mr MARE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It is wireless telephony we require.,53
276,Mr RILEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That method of communication could also be undertaken; and if developments of the kind are about to take place, I do not see why we should go to'the expense of constructing a trunk line between Sydney and Brisbane. Have the Government any plans in this connection, or are they simply waiting for ""something to turn up""? I should say that wireless is the more effective and less expensive system.",53
277,Mr WISE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Wireles s is by no means the more effective j it has a long way to go yet.,53
278,Mr RTLEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The telephonic communication at the present time is not very effective.,53
279,Mr WISE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I think the wireless would prove even less so just now.,53
280,Mr RILEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Of course, I do not oppose the motion, because if it is not the intention of the Government to install wireless in the near future, it is only right that Sydney and Brisbane should be connected by telephone, in view of the fact that Brisbane is extending a little and the Queensland population increasing.",53
281,Mr HIGGS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Capricornia) [4.0] - It is with some reluctance that I offer a little criticism on this proposal of - the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise). I feel that reluctance because I believe that the Department is a better paying proposition at the present time than it has ever been, and that the Postmaster-General is certainly endeavouring to meet the requirements of country districts. According to the evidence of Mr H . B. Templeton, Deputy Postmaster-General, Queensland', before the Public Works Committee, that gentleman does not consider "" there is any likelihood of a large increase of business as between Brisbane and Sydney, and intermediate towns ""-as a result of the construction of the proposed line- "" beh cause the commercial transactions between Brisbane and Sydney are nothing like those taking place between Sydney and Melbourne.""",53
282,Mr BAYLEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Mr Templeton further stated that relatively the Brisbane-Sydney business would be as great as the Sydney-Melbourne business.,54
283,Mr HIGGS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I admit that Mr Templeton's evidence does not appear to be altogether consistent. In reply to Senator Newland, Mr Templeton said I consider the erection of a trunk line telephone between Brisbane and Sydney is desirable, and will be remunerative. But he also said in reply to Mr MackayI do not wish this work to be postponed, but if I had to choose between providing an important service like the proposed Albion automatic exchange and this trunk line, I would stand by the Albion work as being the more urgent and the more important from a revenue point of view. It is a matter of comparison. This trunk line is most desirable if the funds to provide for it can be found without any interference with necessary urgent work. Finally, he said before the CommitteeIt is problematical whether the line will become payable. My experience is that more business is obtained nn trunk lines between correlated centres than in the case of a trunk line such as this uill be between two distinct centres. I should like the Postmaster-General to consider whether he caunot expend pub-' lie money in a more remunerative way than in the construction of a telephone line between Sydney and Brisbane. Where services can be established and become immediately payable, they ought to be established before the Department undertakes works such as that proposed, especially when we find the Publio Works Committee estimating the loss on the first year at £ 6 0 1 . I understand there are many Quesusland proposals, telegraphic and telephonic communications that would pay immediately, and it is to these that attention should be devoted, and not to others, where success is problematical. seem strange for me to take up such an attitude; but the great work before us is the settlement of people on the land and in our country towns. We see huge cities like Sydney and Melbourne growing, while country towns are being depleted; and, after all, this trunk line will only.tend to still more centralize business in Brisbane and Sydney to the f u r ther detriment of the inland centres. If there is any urgent business as between Brisbane and Sydney, it can now be done by telegraph. Although the evidence given by th© Deputy Postmaster-General, Brisbane, is not altogether consistent, that gentleman finally told the Public Works Committee that it is problematical whether the proposed line will ever pay.  dence tendered to the Committee was to the effect that the undertaking would ultimately be a paying one.",54
284,Mr HIGGS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I shall not vote against the construction of the l in e / but I consider that if the Postmaster-General can find any business proposition which will pay better, he certainly ought to defer the construction of the proposed line for the present.  [ 4 . 7 ] - I do not think that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) can have read very much of the evidence taken by the Public Works Committee in regard to this particular matter. That evidence was overwhelmingly in favour of the construction of the proposed line. If the honourable member will take the trouble to caref u l l y read the evidence, he will see that every witness called by the Committee was in favour of the erection of this particular line. The facts and figures which were submitted convincingly prove that the undertaking will prove a sound financial proposition from its very inception.",54
285,Mr HIGGS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Then how did the Committee come to report a probable loss of £601 upon the line during the first year,?  honourable member will read that statement in conjunction with the other evidence which was tendered to the Committee, he will see that there is not much in it . But even if the work did not pay for the first year, the honourable member would scarcely condemn it upon that account, so long as it proved a sound finanI t may cial proposition thereafter. Mr HECTOB. LAMOND - We should be ten years ahead of public requirements, instead of twenty-five years behind.  doubtcdly. All the indications are that the line will be a paying one.",54
286,Mr WISE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"And the evidence tendered to the Public Works Committee shows that it will not only serve the interests of city people, but will provide facilities for the residents of country districts.  principal reason which should actuate us in approving of the line is that it will not merely provide facilities'for the residents of two cities, but that it wil l confer material benefits upon people who reside between them.",54
287,Mr GROOM,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It will link up communication with places as far north as Gympie.  evidence the Deputy Postmaster-General, Brisbane, statedThere is no doubt that an arrangement could be made by which calls from Ipswich, Toowoomba, and other important centres along the line would take tlieir turn in the circuit. Calls will be transmitted in the order in which they are lodged, no matter whether they be lodged here or at Toowoomba or Sydney. In addition to benefiting Brisbane, this trunk line will benefit country towns' along the route. That is why the proposal appeals to me so strongly. It will provide outback residents with facilities for communication, and thus enable them to enjoy some of the benefits of civilization of which they have been too long deprived.",55
288,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Hunter) [ 4 . 1 1 ] am not quite sure of the route which the proposed line will traverse, because the Minister, in submitting the motion, did not make that matter clear. But I re-collect that the Leader of the Country party, when speaking in this chamber the other day, emphasized the necessity which exists for the construction of a line which -""could traverse the north coast of New South ""Wales.",55
289,Mr WISE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,This particular line will go through Warwick and Wallangarra.,55
290,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Why cannot we construct a line to Brisbane by the shortest route, one which will serve all the north coast district?",55
291,Mr CAMERON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,This line is already built to Wallangarra.,55
292,Mr GROOM,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It is quite possible that later on there may be a line traversing a route down the other way.,55
293,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Onl y the other day the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) wa's stressing the need which exists for a line to Brisbane through the north coast of New South Wales. I agree with him that the construction of such a line is a necessity.,55
294,Mr JOWETT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,It is not the fault of the Country party that there is no such line.,55
295,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I know that. am speaking on behalf of the Leader of that party, who represents constituency adjacent to my own. Quite recently, too, I noticed in a newspaper published in Gloucester an article setting out how necessary it is that a railway along the route suggested by him should be built.",55
296,Mr MCDONALD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Ultimately , we shall have to build a line to Brisbane through the north coast.",55
297,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,There is no doubt of that.,55
298,Mr MCDONALD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Such a line would shorten the distance to be traversed by 100 miles.,55
299,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Exactly. We should thus be practising true economy. What is the position of the north coast of New South Wales ? It is only during the past nine or ten years that that district has come into prominence. For years the residents there struggled to obtain a railway, and eventually the Government of New South Wales decided to construct, one. Since the construction of the north coast railway the district through which it passes has gone ahead by leaps and bounds. Settlement has - I greatly increased there, and many big estates have been cut up. That railway wil l eventually link Sydney with Brisbane, and the telephone line between the two cities might well follow it . The honourable member for Cowper advocated this before he entered the House, as he has done since, because he knows the justice of it , and I , who represent a portion of the district through which the line would pass, hold the same view about the matter. At present, the people of that district cannot get the telephone communication that they need.",55
300,Mr GROOM,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,But the line that is proposed is absolutely needed.,55
301,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I do not say that * a telephone line between Brisbane and Sydney is not needed. My argument is that it would be cheaper to take it along the route of the north coast railway, which will ultimately be the direct route to Queensland, because it is more than 100 miles shorter than the present route. I believe that it would be well to send back the proposal to the Works Committee for the investigation of this suggesr tion -"" ",55
302,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The direct line between Sydney and Brisbane would be of no use to the north coast districts, which must I have a line of their own to Sydney.",55
303,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Where would that a line terminate?,55
304,Mr GEEENE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Probably at Murwillumbah.,56
305,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That would be an unsatisfactory arrangement, because there would not then be a direct communication with Queensland. right through to Brisbane would serve for communication both north and south.",56
306,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Intermediat e could not cut into the"" through line. There must be a north coast line.",56
307,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"My contention is that if this line were taken through the north coast districts by the direct route to Brisbane, it would not be necessary to have a through line following the New England railway route.",56
308,Mr GROOM,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,The honourable member forgets the big towns along this route.,56
309,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I do not ; but the adoption of the route w h i c h ' I suggest would' mean a. saving in distance and a 'corresponding saving in cost, and would prevent the congestion of telephone business.",56
310,Mr GROOM,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member is - right in urging the construction of a north* coast telephone line, though not to the exclusion of that now proposed.",56
311,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"This matter should have received more consideration. I do not take exception to expenditure which is absolutely necessary, because I believe in giving all the facilities for communication that can be given to the people in the country districts, and the necessary connexions between capitals should be made; but I .still think that it would have been better to take this line along the more direct route to Brisbane. hope that the Postmaster-General will - give consideration to. the suggestion that a line should be carried along that route.

The Committee points out that theproposed Jine would be, utilized for both telephone and telegraph purposes, the interest on its capital cost being divided between the two services; and that it would pay from the beginning. The report says that the Committee, after carefully considering all the facts placed before it , was unanimously of the opinion that the line should'be erected as early as possible. Question resolved in the affirmative. PERTH - EUC LA TELEGRAPHLINE .",56
315,Mr WISE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Gippslandr-Postmaster General) [4.25] - I m o v e That, in accordance with the provision of the Commonwealth Public Works' Committee Act 1913-1914, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work :-Erectio n of additional telegraph line from Perth to Eucla, v i i ' the transcontinental railway route-whic h said work was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the Committee has duly reported to this House the result of its inquiries. The report of the Public Works Committee on this matter has been before the House for a long time. It contains the I following statements: The Committee took evidence in regard to this matter in Melbourne, and constituted a Sectional Committee to take further evidence in Western Australia. .. In the course of the Committee's inyestiga? tions, it was ascertained that this Perth to Eucla line really forms a section of the through Inter-State line between - Perth and Adelaide; and that the existing lines are insufficient to dispose of telegraph business within a reasonable time. The actual number of telegraph - messages carried daily during 1920 is stated to have been 3,216, and, as the indications are of that this traffic is rapidly increasing, it is urged that necessity exists for the erection of out the a new line to deal with this traffic. The coast line, which it ^ s proposed to re* place by the line now under consideration, is l,00fi miles in length, and was brought into use in the year 1878. It is an iron wire of a weight of 400 lbs. to the mile, and this fact of and the fact that it is in close - proximity-to the coast leads to heavy leakage of current, which has the effect of: considerably slowing. down the traffic. Inquiry was made as to the feasibility of re-erecting the existing line, but it was pointed out that to do this would cost approximately £85,295, as .against £4*2,030 for the present proposal. It was further pointed out that,' in case of breakdown, the existing line .is difficult of access, and the result messages are often considerably delayed before repairs can be effected. If approval be given to construct the line now proposed, it is intended to recover or abandon the material of the existing line between Israelite Bay and .Eucla, and to recover 170 miles of wire, insulators, spindles, and. brackets between Albany and Hopetoun. Financial Aspect - Estimatin g the cost of construction at £42,030, and allowing 10 per oent. to cover interest on capital, depreciation, and maintenance, it will be seen that the annual cost of this new line will be £4,203. As against this, it is estimated that the saving on the cost of maintenance of the existing service will be £3,731, and that the estimated increased annual revenue will amount to £2,000, or a total amount of £5,731; so that the annual saving on this project will 'amount to £1,628. It is pointed out that, in estimating the cost of construction of this line, the price of copper wire was taken at £180 per ton. Since that time the price of electrolytic copper has fallen, so that the wire will now cost approximately £130 10a. jxir ton. Consequently, the original estimated cost may now be reduced by perhaps £0,000. * W-hile on this subject, the Committee desires to' point out that prior to the war copper was obtained for departmental purposes at the current price of electrolytic copper, plus £17 per ton to cover manufacture and freight. Since that time a plant for the manufacture of copper wire has been established at Port Kembla, New South Wales, and the wire now costs the Department £57 10s. per ton more than the quoted price of electrolytic copper. Inquiries were made by the Committee as to whether, in the case of lengthy telegraph lines of this nature, it would be possible for settlers along the route of the line to be allowed to make use of the line for the purpose of sending telephone messages, but it was stated in evidence that, as the line will be used for sending telegraph messages practically for the whole of the 24 hours of the day at fast speeds, the. effect would .be to create a buzzing noise, which would render it impossible to hear a telephone message. The Committee, however, thinks this question merits further consideration, and hopes the Department will devise some method .of enabling facilities to be given to remote settlers to use the line for telephone purposes for a short period during the most convenient time of the day. After a careful consideration of the facts, the Committee is of opinion that the erection of the proposed line is justified, and recommends that the work be put in hand as early as possible.",56
316,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Hunter) [4.29] We have had a little more information from the Minister on this motion. ,57
317,Mr WISE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I did not want to weary the House by reading reports which I presumed that every member had read.,57
318,Mr CHARLTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"My difficulty is to know exactly where we are going. I is that do not want to agree to anything that will plunge the country into expenditure, especially at this juncture., when the Treasurer is so economical. Many publio works are standing still today because we have not the money for them. The question is whether the line is to traverse a satisfactory route. I read all the Committee reports that come before the House as far as possible, but during the last three mouths, when we have been deal-, ing with the Tariff, I confess that I have not been able to keep in touch with them all. The Minister states that the present line has broken down, and that there is no communication at present between the two places. It will take £85,000 to repair the existing line, and the Committee recommend the construction of the new line for £42,000, which shows a big saving. The Public Works Committee have done good service, and are justifyin g their appointment. In this case they are saving the country a good, deal of "" money. They report i h at the work isabsolutely necessary, and that to patch up the existing service would cost, practically twice as much as will be required for the new service. As members whose districts are traversed by the line have said nothing in opposition to it , I presume it is in the best interests of their constituents, and, therefore, I shall do nothing to prevent the recommendation of the Committee being given effect to.",57
319,Mr RILEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"South Sydney) [4.32] I take an entirely different view of the matter. It is the duty of the members of the Works Committee, while their report is before the House, to assist the Minister. I should like to hear from some of them who have heard the evidence on this matter. They should be here to back the Government up. The chairman of the Committee is a Western Australian, and, no doubt, would recommend that the work should be carried out.",57
320,Mr BAMFORD,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,You can expect a perfectly fair deal from the chairman of the Committee.,57
321,Mr RILEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"H as the honourable member, as a member of the Committee, anything to say in support of the report ? I shall sit down if the Postmaster-General will promise me one or two post-offices in my electorate. I get from him plenty of nice letters, but no bricks and mortar. On the whole, the Works Committee are tc be commended' for the great work they have done"", and I hope some of them will be able to justify the reports they have submitted. I shall support the motion.  [4.35] - The remarks made by the honourable, member for South Sydney (Mr. Riley) were offered in a jocular spirit, but when they appear in cold print they may be taken literally. As a member of the Public Works Committee, I therefore tell the House that we exhausted' every channel of information, and had before us witnesses who had been all over the route. We were absolutely uninfluenced by State considerations, and were convinced that the line would pay. What is more, it will afford settlers between Eucla and the transcontinental line an opportunity to get in touch by telephone with doctors, business people, and friends, and will prove a very great boon to them. These people are living in absolute isolation, and I would afford them a facility of this kind even if I thought the line would not pay. Public convenience .should take precedence over all questions of .profit, so far as the services of the Postmaster-General's Department concerned. I repeat, however, that the Committee exhausted every avenue of information on the subject, both at Adelaide and Perth, and was convinced that the line would not only afford great facilities to the people, hut prove a payable proposition.",57

328,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is quite apparent that honourable members opposite do not want to provide for public works.

331,Mr HEOTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Illawarra) [4.451 - Before we adjourn, I desire to direct the attention of honourable members to a recent decision of the House Comthe mittee, which I believe was arrived at at ceived. a very small meeting of the: Committee, and which interferes very considerably with the privileges of honourable members who do not reside in Melbourne. The matat 4.60 p.m. ter should have been brought forward at an earlier stage, as many honourable members representing New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia have left to catch their trains, and, consequently, are not able to express their opinions. B*or mauy years past, honourable members have had the privilege during tha recess of using offices at the other capital cities in which to transact their official correspondence. The accommodation provided is somewhat similar to that available in Melbourne; but the Honse Committee, for some reason' or other which has not been disclosed, has seen fit to say that those members - who do-their work in other cities shall be penalized, whilst those who reside in Melbourne can take advantage of the facilities provided in this building. It is a highly improper proceeding on the part of the Committee.",59
332,Mr BUROHELL,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"There is nothing T>henoanaiial in that, as we have never had privileges such as you have had in Sydney.",59
333,Mr HEOTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALTH WOOLLEN,"Probably that is due to the fact that Western Australian members spend most of their time in Melbourne, and, therefore, do not require sueh accommodation. New South Wales .members have to do their official work in the offices in Sydney.",59
