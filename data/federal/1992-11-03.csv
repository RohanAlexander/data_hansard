1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 2 p.m:, and read prayers.",10
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! We will have no jockeying for positions today; otherwise the Whips will be around, I would imagine. NA NA Mr SPEAKEa-I advise honourable members that, following the decision to televise the House, I received a number of representations from press photographers for pennission to take photographs during the proceedings of the House. They suggested that by denying access to print media we were favouring the electronic media. I have sought the views of the party Whips on the proposal. They were generally in agreement that we should allow access to photographers. I have agreed for a trial period for up to four photographers to be present in the public gallery during Question Time and other times of significance. Entry to the gallery will be subject to conditions which similar to those which apply to camera operation and television broadcast. There will not be flash cameras or things of that sort. NA",10
3,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Mr Kerin, will be absent from Question Time this week. In his absence, questions will be directed to the Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett. I also inform the House that the Minister for Tourism and Resources, Mr Griffiths, will be absent from Question Time today and tomorrow. In his absence, questions on tourism should be directed to the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Family Support, Mr Simmons, and questions on resources should be directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, may I say with your indulgence that I did not hear: when is Minister Griffiths coming back to apologise for his Hong Kong conduct?",10
4,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Order! The Leader of the National Party will resume his seat. Are there any questions without notice? NA Suspension of Standing Orders,10
5,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition moving: 'That this House censures the Treasurer for his attempted cover-up of the breach by the Victorian government of its global borrowing limits as set by the Loan Council for the financial year 199f-92'. I move that motion because it is imperative that this House immediately bring the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to account. He ought to resign now for the greatest scandal, the greatest cover-up, that we have seen in this country in recent history.",10
6,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,After Question Time.,10
7,Mr REITH,TREASURER,You are running scared.,10
8,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,No; we do not want to let you off without making you account for what are you have said in the break. Thank you.,10
9,Unknown,TREASURER,Opposition members interjecting,10
10,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The House will come to order. Is the motion seconded?,10
11,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,I second the motion. Question resolved in the negative. NA Victoria: Borrowings,10
12,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that a director of a company in the private sector who concealed the full extent of the liabilities of that company and produced a set of accounts he knew to be false and misleading could be charged with criminal offences and could in fact end up in gaol? I ask the Treasurer: is this exactly what he has done in the Victorian loans affair? Why should he not resign forthwith?,10
13,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the honourable member is seeking a legal opinion.",10
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,11
15,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There was no concealment on the part of the Commonwealth.,11
16,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,11
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,11
18,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten what he should have known when he was advising the former Treasurer about these particular matters. He would know that, in relation to Budget Paper No.4, the Commonwealth is required to publish the information that is provided by the States. Indeed, the crucial point in all this is that the Loan Council guidelines specify as follows: Loan Council delegates to its members responsibility for administering the global limits in respect of their own authorities, although members consult with each other and with the Loan Council secretariat (located in the Commonwealth Treasury) on new types of proposals. It is up to the members of the Loan Council to report to the Commonwealth their own records as far as their Loan Council borrowings are concerned. That is what Victoria did, and that is what we published in the Budget Papers. This suggeStion that Budget Paper No. 4 was the most significant area in which public sector borrowings were reported is, of course, wrong. Again, as the Leader of the Opposition ough- to know, it is in statements 1,2 and 6 in Budget Paper No. 1 that the Commonwealth provides information on public sector borrowings. In those papers, the public sector borrowings were reported on the basis of the Statistician's advice and, of course, they included all the borrowings of the Commonwealth and all the States, including Victoria. Industrial Disputes",11
19,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Prime Minister tell the House what the level of industrial disputation has been during 1992? Are there any threats to the industrial peace which has prevailed under this Government?,11
20,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted to be able to tell the House that the· rate of industrial disputation for the year to October 1992 is expected to come in below 100 working days lost per 1,000 employees, the lowest rate since monthly figures on disputation were first collected 33 years ago. Indeed, under this Government the average annual rate of disputation is 60 per cent below the figure of the Fraser years. Ms MCHugh-How much?",11
21,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sixty per cent. I might add that this atmosphere of industrial peace has come at a time when we are seeing a quite rapid increase in productivity. In the year to June, productivity grew by 2.6 per cent, and we are seeing strong increases again this year. So there it is: high productivity, low disputes and a cooperative union movement, which is at the forefront of change in the workplace.",11
22,Mr GOODLUCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are all on your side.,11
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Franklin!,11
24,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But now we are seeing a return to the bad old days of industrial confrontation., the days we thought we had all left behind 10 years ago. The Victorian Government has introduced legislation to cancel awards and replace them with employee contracts. The annual leave loading has been cancelled, weekend penalties on which many struggling families depend will be cancelled, and wages and working conditions are up for grabs. This was the deception that was perpetrated in Victoria, as the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Flinders publicly conceded on the weekend. Their slogan was, 'What you now have you keep'. But the big threat to Australia is much greater than this. The big threat is the threat of the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong to go one better than Victoria and introduce an even harsher and more unjust system, and do it nationally. It is not a matter of what they promise; it is a matter of what they will do. They will replicate Victoria nationally, but they will do it more malevolently and vociferously. They promise to introduce a system of individual contracts for 73/4 million Australian workers. The employer has a unilateral right to cancel an award at any time. Under common law, the employer will have the right to dismiss any worker, at any time, for any reason. The coalition noW wants to pretend that Victoria has nothing to do with it. But right the way through we have seen clear elements of the one policy being brought together nationally. We saw this in the quotes of the honourable member for Bennelong of a week or so ago. Mr Gude said: Given a coalition success at a national level we will not hesitate to abolish the State industrial system and go on to a single system right throughout Australia. On 29 October, the Victorian Treasurer then said: I don't think there's any doubt at all that the Federal coalition will also want to remove these sorts of luxury impositions.",11
25,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,12
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,12
27,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There you have it, Mr Speaker: a national plan to strip away all sorts of benefits, such as penalty rates and annual leave loadings. They can take no notice whatsoever of the notion, 'What you have, you keep'.",12
28,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,12
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise.,12
30,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that if you sign the boss's contract you can lose your current pay rate, your holiday loading, weekend penalties, overtime penalties and other conditions and allowances. You can fall right down to the lowest hourly rate in the award which formerly covered you. It is simply a big con which the Opposition has now had revealed by the Victorian Government. But it is intending to press on with the pretence that the change in its industrial relations policies will do something other than, as we all know, maintain benefits as they currently apply to Australian employees. Mr Downer-Oh,you are so irrelevant.",12
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! If the honourable member for Mayo continues to walk around the House interjecting I will deal with him. NA,12
32,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon a parliamentary delegation from Sweden led by the Speaker of the Swedish Parliament. Also present in the gallery is a delegation, from Western Samoa led by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. On behalf of the House, I extend a warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Victoria: Borrowings",12
33,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer and I refer him to his lilst answer. I refer the Treasurer to the fact that table 19 of Budget Paper No.4 this year did not have a footnote referring to Victoria's breaching of global borrowing limits, even though they told the Treasurer that they were in breach. I ask the Treasurer: if that is normal practice, why does the equivalent table in the 1989-90 Budget Papers have a footnote C saying, 'Victorian borrowiflgs for 1987-88 exceeded the State's global limit for the year by $158m'? Furthermore, would you give us an explanation why it is that in the 1985-86 Budget, in Budget Paper No.7, the Commonwealth Treasury actually put its own estimates into that table? Opposition members-Ooh!",12
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members of the Opposition will cease interjecting. The Treasurer will be heard in silence. Dr Kemp interjecting,12

36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting, as will the Prime Minister.",12
37,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"His plummeting popularity is finally getting to him. If there is any dead meat around here it is on your side, not ours. You are aware of that.",12
38,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,13
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,13
40,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is yet another attempt by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to breathe a bit of life into an issue which is well and truly dead. This issue has been well canvassed and, indeed, the papers which I· have released publicly explain what I· knew, when I knew it and what I did about it.",13
41,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,13
42,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,13
43,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The papers are here and I will table them at the end of Question Time. Dr Kemp-Table them now.,13
44,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Included in those papers is a note from the Secretary to my Department in which he explains the context in which table 19 was prepared. At point 3, he says: The Commonwealth is not in a position to attest to the veracity, of the data reported by the States and published in the above table. They are the responsibility of the States consistent with provisions governing the global limitS. Unless the States agree that a transaction has been incorrectly reported there is no provision for the Commonwealth to report a differing figure. Mr Reith-You knew this was wrong.",13
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,13
46,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I go on to say that there was an issue in dispute between the Commonwealth and the VictorianS at that point, a dispute which has only today been resolved. The Victorian Government has acknowledged the fact that there was a breach. Mr Reith-It took a week.",13
47,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The extent of that breach is still unknown to the Victorian Government. There are still some aspects which it wants to discuss with us. So, Mr Speaker, there was absolutely no intention on my part, or indeed on the part of the Treasury, which prepared the table, to deceive anyone in this regard. Opposition members-Ha, hal",13
48,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What we did was to provide the information that had been provided to us. Here we have an attempt to frustrate the relationship between Victoria and the Commonwealth, a relationship which has been established as a result of our discussions last night. Mr Costello-Look, they cannot stop laughing.",13
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Higgins!,13
50,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, all I have been seeking to do in relation to this matter is to reach an understanding with Victoria about how its arrangements could be regularised and hO\y its situation could be overcome. Indeed, what happened last night-and of course members of the Opposition wish it had not-was that we were able sit down with the Victorian Premier and the Victorian Treasurer and do what I had been seeking to do for some time, and that is discuss with them a medium term financial strategy to deal with their particular question. Let me not give an assessment· of what happened last night. Let me just record what Mr Kennett said this the long standing morning. He said: I came away from that meeting last night very much reinforced in my view that there is something bigger than politics at work at the moment . . . That is something which he may well advise his colleagues about. Mr Kennett went on: ... and that is a common interest by ourselves and the detennination by ourselves and the Federal Government to do the right thing. He went on to say: From our point of view, Mr Stockdale's and mine, our priority is to get it right for Victoria. There is no value in us at all looking back. There is no value in us all getting into a political argument. We have a responsibility to rebuild and we intend to do that. Whatever our federal colleagues do is a matter for them to decide upon and to pursue. So, what he is really saying is that members of the Victorian Government sit down with the Commonwealth Government prepared to do the right thing, to put politics aside, to do the right thing by Victoria. What do their colleagues here want to do? What they want to do is to damage Victoria, to behave irresponsibly, to put aside the national interest in the pursuit of their own shabby and squalid political objectives. Industrial Awards",13
51,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the Minister advise the House of the extent of coverage of industrial awards? What is the importance of these awards and what will be the consequences of their removal?,14
52,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,In response to the honourable member for ReidMr Tuckey interjecting,14
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will cease interjecting.,14
54,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The importance of industrial awards is that they provide publicly available, legally enforceable documents which set out the minimum conditions of employment that apply to employees s-bject to those awards: Of course, they have different minimum wages for emplqyees according to their classification. We do not have one minimum wage. We have a whole series of differing minimum wages, depending on classifications. So the importance of awards is that they provide a safety net, a guarantee that, whichever employer one works. for, the award conditions of employment at least must apply. There are over 2,000 such Federal awards covering around 1.8 million employees; in State award systems there are about 2.6 million; so all up there are about 4.4 million employees covered by awards-about 80 per cent of total employees. Of course, the consequence of rempval from awards would be the loss of a very comprehensive safety net which currently underwrites their conditions of employment. It should be of great concern to all employees in this country that the Opposition has a proposal to force them out of awards over a period of time-and perhaps a lot of them very quickly through the proposals released recently-and onto a system of individual employment contracts. They should certainly have that concern, given the few basic entitlement. ments that the Opposition would require in such contracts. They are: four weeks annual leave, two weeks sick leave, 12 months unpaid maternity leave, and a minimum hourly wage for adults equal to the base hourly minimum rate for ordinary time earnings excluding penalties, allowances and loadings applicable under that award. It is not entirely clear what the base hourly minimum rate is, but it would seem to be the lowest rate that can be found in the award. Most awards, or many of them, have supplementary payments to cover private sector employees. Presumably the exclusion of penalties, allowances and loadings means that they do not apply either. You take the lowest classification rate, and that can mean that the minimum rate is vastly lower than the minimum rate which would apply to employees in higher classifications at present. For instance,. taking the metal industry award, a professional engineer at present has a classification rate of $23 an hour. Under the Opposition that· would drop to a minimum rate Of $7.50 an hour. The $23 minimum rate would drop to $7.50 . That is the minimum rate",14
55,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The worker haters.,14
56,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is extraordinary.,14
57,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,14
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise.,14
59,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It would be $8.56 if you added supplementary payments. But apparently you do not want to do that. We know that the Opposition's recipe for youth is to slash youth wages to $3 an hour for those aged 15 to 17 and $3.50 for those aged 18 to 20. That would be $114 to $133 a week for a 38-hour week. The average award rate for juniors at present is around $285 a week. The Opposition would cut it to - a minimum rate of between $114 and $133. There is an extraordinary loss of basic protection there for juniors. Casual employees would have a 15 per cent premium on their hourly rate of pay. The average award has a rate of around 20 per cent as the premium for casual workers, so again there would be a further loss of entitleThese are the areas where there is some entitlement expressed. Of course, a whole host of entitlements is not there-they will just disappear and be negotiated away entirely, or forced away in effect. They include basic things such as the standard working week. The eight-hour day has gone; the 40-hour or 38-hour week has gone. You can be required to work any number of hours .. There are no penalty rates for overtime, weekend work or night work; they all go in terms of a requirement that must be met. There will be no redundancy notice or redundancy pay. At the present time awards require redundancy notice of one to four weeks and pay of four to eight weeks. There are minimum entitlements on redundancy. All of that goes because there is no provision for it. Of course, we know that the holiday leave loading of 171/2 per cent goes. Shift workers generally get an extra week's annual leave, but there is no provision for that in their entitlements. There is no such thing as meal breaks, tea breaks or rest days-any kind of requirement for decent working hours at all. All of those go. There is no requirement for payment for public holidays. What this policy says is that",14
60,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why don't you make a ministerial statement on this?,15
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mitchell!,15
62,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"they would rely on State legislation for long service leave and for public holidays. But in relation to public holidays, State legislation simply declares what the public holidays are; it does not say that you have to get paid for them. Mr Reid interjecting Mr Hand-Are you going to give up your public holidays?",15
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Bendigo and the Minister for Immigration will cease interjecting. Mr Hand interjecting,15
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Minister!,15
65,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Whether you get paid for public holidays or not depends on your award. Mr Reid interjecting,15
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Bendigo!,15
67,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is what gives workers payment for their public holiday. 1:'he Opposition tion is proposing to take away even the entitlement to payment for public holidays in its agreements. This is the most incredible attack on workers of this country, the most outrageous elimination of basic entitlements. Honourable members opposite are sitting there laughing and smirking.",15
68,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You put them out of work.,15
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise.,15
70,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They do ""not care about the fact that they would be eliminating all of these crucially important protections for workers in this country and opening many of them up to gross exploitation as a result. The Opposition says that, if an employee does not come to an agreement with the employer, there is the protection of the award entitlement; that is, that the award conditions would become the agreement in the event of there being no formal agreement between the parties. But that is no protection at all because the employer can simply say, 'Here are my conditions of employment. If you want to work here, then these are the conditions. Take it or leave it'. There is absolutely nothing in this policy to stop that being the attitude of the employer. The employer can say, 'Just take it or leave it. If you want to work here, these are the conditions. Sign on the dotted line or see you later'. That is what this policy is all about. It is a recipe for employers to simply sack anyone who will not work for the conditions that they deem appropriate. It will enable many employers to exploit their workers and to make them work for much less than award conditions. To say that there is a protection through the award flowing into the agreement is to mislead the work force as to the degree of protection that people would really get. This policy is not Jobsback; it is 'job sack'. Victoria: Borrowings",15
71,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Treasurer: why in 1988 did your predecessor, the now Prime Minister, consider a threatened breach of Loan Council guidelines by the Ahern National Party Government sufficiently serious for him to go public and to introduce legislato reduce that Government's financial assistance grants, whilst in 1992 you and the Prime Minister were content to stand by and watch an actual breach by the Kirner Labor Government? Is it not a fact that this is just a gross case of double standards for you to cover up for your Labor mates in Victoria?",15
72,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows that the circumstances are entirely different. Mr Reith-No, you answer for your actionsl",16
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,16
74,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you would like the Prime Minister .to explain his actions at the time, I am sure he would be happy to do it. Mr Reith-No, you answer my question.",16
75,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me give .you another exampleMr Reith-No, answer the question!",16
76,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You don't boss us around, pal; you get what we want t6 give you.",16
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will both cease interjecting. The Treasurer will be heard in silence.,16
78,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You cannot use your little suburban solicitor tactics in here, mate.",16
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Orderl The Treasurer will refer to the Deputy Leader by his title.,16
80,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Where was the Opposition after the Tasmanian election in 1989? Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Treasurer is refusing to answer the question. If he is not prepared to answer the question, you should sit him down on the grounds of relevance.",16
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order I There is no point of order.,16
82,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Where was the Opposition when it was revealed after the 1989 Tasmanian election just what a messMr Reith-You are squirming.,16
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Mr Reith-Squirm, boy, squirm!",16
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,16
85,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,the Gray Government had made of its finances in Tasmania.,16
86,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Cover up!,16
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mitchell!,16
88,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Where was the Opposition then as the then Treasurer sat down with Premier Field and tried to do something about the shocking mess that the Gray Government had produced in Tasmania-a mess which was larger in relative terms than that which confronts Victoria at the moment? There was not a word from the Opposition then, no attempt to condemn the activities of the Gray Government about how it had cranked up its level of debt to an unsustainable position. It is not surprising that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has such difficulty in understanding Budget Papers. Let us recall what happened to him on the Sunday program this week when he said, in discussion with Laurie Oakes: In respect of taking away the leave loading, the annual leave loading, that is a case of the Victorian Government acting in its capacity as an employer. Mr Oakes interjected and said: But it's going to legislate to cover privately employed people as welL Mr Reith came back and saidMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This diatribe by the Treasurer offends against standing order 145. He is now making more than a passing reference. It has no relevance to the question asked. You should bring the Treasurer back to the question. Government members-Sit down!",16
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. The Treasurer will answer the question.,16
90,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So Mr Reith saysOpposition members-Oh!,16
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The House will come to order. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. You have directed the Treasurer to answer the question. He is going on with a statement about leave loadings in Victoria. He is defying you as Speaker and he ought to cease to continue to do so.",16
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will hear where this takes u.s. Opposition members-Oh, no!",17
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Higgins will resume his seat. Members on my left will cease interjecting. The Treasurer will come to the question.,17
94,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This goes to the question of the Deputy Leader's ability to understand Budget Papers. Mr Beale-Oh! How about it!,17
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,17
96,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He said: Firstly, the position in respect of priva- employers under the Victorian legislation is that that is a matter for negotiation. As I understand itMr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Treasurer has just conceded that he is not answering the question that he has been asked. He says he is going to a question of the shadow Treasurer. The question has been asked of him in relation to these matters. He is now making a statement and reading out a transcript that relates to holiday leave loadings in Victoria and has nothing whatsoever to do with the question that he has been asked.",17
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer can illustrate his answer but he should come to the question and come to it now.,17
98,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will. He said: As I understand it, they have notOpposition members-Oh, he is defying you.",17

102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,17
103,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is entirely gennane because what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is saying is that he understands what is in the Budget Papers; in fact, he says publicly that he has read the Budget Paper in Victoria, which says: The Government will legislate so that, for all Victorian workers, both public and private sector, not covered by Federal awards, leave loading will not be payable on leave taken after 28 October 1992. Mr Costello-He is ignoring you.",17
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. Mr MCGauran-:-He is mocking you.,17
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland will cease interjecting.,17
106,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said this in answer to the question of whether he has read Mr Stockdale's Budget: 'Yes, I have read parts of it'. Obviously he did not read the bit which Mr Oakes was talking about. It is little wonder under those circumstances that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is totally incapable of understanding the Budget Papers. On this issue of the recording of the Victorian position, I quote from a letter I received today from Mr Stockdale: - . . . . the funaing of the deficits was treated as temporary and was not reported for Loan Council purposes pending clarification of Loan Council treatment. That is not my observation. Opposition members-You! You!",17
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise.,17
108,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the observation of Treasurer Stockdale on the reporting of the Victorian position in July of this year. If you want to dispute the position of Mr Stockdale, go right ahead. Dr Hewso.n-You wrote to him on it.",17
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,17
110,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But Mr Stockdale today has said that the reason it was reported in that way was that there was a need to clarify the position-a position with which I concur. There did need to be a clarification. It was a clarification I was seeking from Mr Stockdale's predecessors and a clarification I have been seeking from Mr Stockdale-a clarification I have now received.,17

112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise. Enterprise Bargaining,18
113,Dr CATLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the progress of enterprise bargaining in recent weeks? Can he provide details of the nature of enterprise bargaining under this Government? Can· he indicate whether the Government has any intentions of changing its current approach to workplace reform?,18
114,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to be able to report that there are now 441 enterprise bargains registered with the Industrial Relations Commission-nearly double the number of a few months ago-and there are more every day. I will give you an instance. Dulux Australia's Clayton site in Victoria recently completed its third workplace agreement. Over the past three years, these agreements have reduced the time taken to produce a batch of paint from 120 hours to 40 hours. As another example, Mission Energy at the Loy Yang B Power Station, Latrobe Valley, has recently registered an agreement. It provides single union coverage at a greenfields site, provides for a wholly trained, multi-skilled work force, it reduces the number of employment classifications and it provides for the development of career paths which cut across traditional demarcation barriers. That is what is happening in Australia in terms of flexibility at enterprises under what is called enterprise agreements. There was a time when the honourable member for Bennelong and the Opposition believed .in enterprise bargaining. They promised the nation a policy of enterprise bargaining and have now abandoned it and delivered instead an individual contract system. They propose no enterprise bargaining; ito discussion about the needs of an enterprise; no bargains of a collective nature with a work force in a collective way so that the business managers can talk about the business, talk about the work force as a group, and agree to change the business in certain ways that improve productivity and lift benefits to employees and the profits-in other words, the whole notion of an enterprise bargain. No enterprise bargaining will now come from the Federal coalition. What it has in place is an individual contract system where the contracts have nothing to do with the enterprise and everything to do with the individual and the boss. In other words, it is just a one-to-one relationship built around a contract system which has nothing to do with enterprises. Now the only party in Australia offering a system of enterprise bargaining is the Government. This is the only party which has a system under which those who talk about the operations of a business, the needs of the work force, the way the work force operates within the business, the collective bargain and the collective bringing to bear of all those things in a business can do so under a system of enterprise agreement. And the only basis for enterprise agreement in this country. is provided by the Government. Mr Riggall-Tell us about the SEC in Victoria.",18
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for MCMillan! .,18
116,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There was a time when the honourable member for Bennelong supit ported enterprise bargains achieved by collective agreement. He has now changed his tune. It is now not about enhancing productivity collectively and making enterprises better; it is about making the individual employee worse off, as my colleague. the Minister for Finance demonstrated a few minutes ago; The greatest threat to the proliferation of enterprise bargains is the Opposition itself. It has embraced a policy of cancelling these bargains and cancelling the awards. Under its policy, the employer can walk away from them whenever he or she wants. The idea is to replace awards and agreements with a system in which each and every Australian eJriployee would have to enter into individual contracts with employers. In other words, just on eight million Australians are going to be asked to bargain for themselves and sign their own common law contract. Of course, there is no such thing under the common law as unfair dismissal. All dismissthe as are fair so long as the employee gets an hour's pay in the case of an hourly worker, a policy. day's pay in the case of a daily worker or a week's pay in the case of a weekly worker. There is no comeback, Mr Speaker. You can go and see the Liberal Party's proposed government union, the employee advocate, and the employee advocate will open the head! book and tell you that there is no protection against an unjust dismissal. So whether the advocate exists or not, when the governmentestablished, government-run trade union-a bit like the old Soviet Union; a bit like days in the sorts of countries those opposite once used to laugh at and are now emulating in policy-the government-sponsored, governask ment-induced, government-provided union, takes these matters on, workers will be told that they have no rights under the common law. Even the Victorians in their legislation, which is bad enough, give a magistrates court the right to hear a case of harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal. But there are no such provisions in the Opposition's policy. So when an employee is offered a new contract after the award is cancelled it will be, as Minister for Finance has said, the contract or the sack. There will be no appeals to indusarrangements. trial tribunals and there will be no background in industrial law. There will just be a atic unwinding of all the conditions AustraFor lians have come to know in their work relaproposal tionships. That is why the Opposition's is now vastly different from anything it ever discussed before. Enterprise bargaining is not on offer by the Federal coalition; a system of individual contracts",18

Defenc- Force: Equal·Employment Opportunity",20
134,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Can the Minister inform the House of the steps he has taken to review equal employment opportunity for women in the Australian defence forces as recommended in the Halfway to Equal report by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee of this House? What more does he believe should be done?,20

136,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. There is no point of order. Mr BILNEYThe Government is committed to the principle of equal employment opportunity for all Australian citizens, and in the Australian Defence Force not least. The Defence Force comprises some 67,000 full time people in uniform-29,000 part time-which represents about one per cent of the Australian work force, so it needs to reflect the principle of equal employment opportunity no less than other employers. But it is not just a matter of principle; it is also a matter of keeping the defence forces in tune with the mainstream of the Australian community by optimising the contributions of all members of the community-not just half of them. Mr Beazley interjecting",20
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the House will cease interjecting.,20
138,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As far as defence is concerned, this year the Government recognised the principle of equal rights and equal opportunities for all of its citizens by lifting the restrictions on women and Aboriginals in the Defence Act. The effect of those changes was to ensure that in defending Australia there are genuinely equal rights and equal opportunities for women in the event of a direct threat to our territory. The ADF has a very proud record as one of the most responsive services in the Western world to the aspirations of women for military service. Amongst the English speaking countries, only Canada, which lifted its ban on women in combat duties, is more advanced than Australia. In May of 1990 I announced that women would be allowed to serve in combat related positions in the ADF. The effect of that decision was to suspend a provision of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 which granted exemption to the ADF in respect of combat related duties. As a result of that, by the end of the last financial year, 94 per cent of positions in the RAAF were open to women; only air crew in FA18s, PC3s and FIlls, along with air defence guards, have to be men. In the Navy, the share of positions open to women was around the same, and that will increase once appropriate accommodation modifications are made to surface ships. Only submarine crews and clearance divers are still required to be men, and that may well change with the operation of the new Collins class submarines which have better accommodation provisions. Obviously the Army is a different story, with about 55 per cent of positionS open to women, the exclusions being for armour, artillery, infantry and combat engineers. In June of 1991 the Navy, Army and Air Force gave me progress reports on how the integration of women in those combat related positions was going, and they each had the same message. Those messages were that women were doing the job just as well as their male counterparts without any detriment to operational effectiveness or professional military standards. The honourable member for Fisher's report recommended that we now go on to look at the employment of women in combat positions. In fact, prior to the Lavarch report, I had already asked the Chief of the Defence Force, General Gration, to complete the review of the employment of women in combat related positions and to go on to examine that very question of combat employment for women. As the Prime Minister announced in September in his major statement, the report from the CDF will be completed in the J}.ear future, and well in time to enable the Government to make decisions on that controversial question by the end of this year. That review is on track, and the key criterion in the review for this Government will continue to be that combat effectiveness will not be compromised by any decision of that kind. Mr Downer-Why did you have the Cabinet agenda amended?",20
139,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I emphasise to the interjecting Opposition spokesman that not all women are physically or emotionally capable of combat activities in the armed services. But, as I look at the Opposition, it reminds me to say that nor are all men. Mr Downer-Nor are you, cobber. Have a look at yourself in the mirror one day.",21

170,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,OrderI Uruguay Round,22
171,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the Government's intentions regarding the continuing deadlock in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations? In particular, can he say what level of support the Australian Government has received for the message conveyed to the G7 last night?",22
172,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last night on behalf of a large and diverse group of countries I sent a message to G7 leaders, the President of the European Commission and the Director General of the GATT, urging them to intervene now to overcome the continuing deadlock in the Uruguay Round. A total of 29 countries formally associated themselves with this message, Mr Speaker. As you might have seen from today's press they included Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Korea, Hong Kong, five of the ASEAN countries, New Zealand and the four Nordic countries. The message stresses that the economic and trade interests at stake in these negotiations are not those of the G7 alone; that is, there are bigger interests than just simply the major industrial nations, and the interests are those of the entire international community. I called on G71eaders to fulfil the commitment they made at the Munich Summit to complete the Uruguay Round by the end of the year. Australia is dismayed that major countries have demonstrated neither the flexibility nor leadership needed to resolve what we understand are relatively small outstanding differences. We are particularly concerne4 that the European Commission has not been prepared to agree on reasonable understandings on agriculture. In a meeting this morning with the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Kiejman, I urged his Government to show the necessary breadth of view and political leadership to resolve the remaining differences. I hope that, with the US Presidential election behind us in a day or so, the G7 will come down and agree to a set of sensible things on agriculture. There is the notion that the whole of the international trading system and the other elements of the Round-such as intellectual property rights, trade in services, et cetera-should be held hostage to agriculture, while we have some European countries trying to protect what they think is basically a way of rural life. We have made it quite clear that, if they wish to protect their way of rural life, let them protect it with income support rather than production subsidies. It is my view that the Europeans are prepared to agree to reductions in production export subsidies, but that has been countered by other people interested in French politics and the issues of the French constituencies. As a result, we have not seen the sort of conclusion of the Round which we should have. The Americans have made, in my view, every reasonable attempt to get a result on agriculture, and the delay is now basically with Germany and France-France in particular. We can only say to these countries that, if .they want to participate, be part of the international community and live up to their position of leadership inside the international community, they should come to a sensible conclusion around the concluding period of the GATT. We should not lose six years of effort and should not see six years of effort go up the flue while we see the most well-off nations in the world selfishly positioning themselves to exploit international markets and while other countries-not just the Cairns Group associated with Australia but other Third World countries which have little to sell bar agricultural produce-are given their place and their access and opportunity in the international trading system as well. Australia urges all G7 countries to act urgently in order to successfully conclude the Round and thereby strengthen the multilateral trading system. We must know that the great growth in increments to living standards worldwide has come from the free trade and freer trade which came in part because of the Kennedy Round in the 1960s in the trade in goods. We want to see that now extended to services and intellectual property rights into agriculture. It ill becomes any community to hold up reasonable agreement on these things which can not only materially advantage the whole world but, in· our case, particularly check the disadvantage Australian farmers are suffering as a result of these kinds of policies. Farm incomes of Australia have dropped in the last couple of years in substantial measure because of the unfair trading practices of other countries. This is a chance to finish it; this is a chance to get the policy running the right way. It is a golden opportunity after six years of negotiation. It is incumbent upon the leaders of the major European countries and the new Administration of the United States to seize the opportunity and drive the qhange home. Victoria: Borrowings",22

200,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Motion of Censure",26
201,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"by leave I move: That this House censures the Treasurer for his attempted cover-up of the breach by the Victorian government of its global borrowing limits as set by the Loan Council for financial year 1991-92. Mr Speaker, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) brought down a Budget which included figures on the debt position of Victoria that he knew were wrong. He covered up a blowout of over $1 billion. For that he should resign. He grievously misled the Parliament, the Victorian electorate, the Australian public and the financial markets. He failed to' discharge his responsibilities as Chainnan of the Loan Council and as Federal Treasurer. He failed to protect the integrity of the Loan Council, which he was advised to do above all else by his own Department, the Department of the Treasury. So grave are these allegations that today the Parliament is abuzz with rumours that this Government is to go to an ear!y election. One of the reasons it would go to an early election is to obscure and to prevent the establishment of a parliamentary committee. One of the reasons that the Government would go to an early election on 12 December is to avoid the consequences of a further inquiry into this matter by a Senate committee, a course of action to which the Australian Democrats have agreed today. There have been many calls for the resignation of the Treasurer and for a censure of the Treasurer. There have been many condemnations of the Treasurer. Alan Wood, a respected columnist in the Australian, was very critical of the Treasurer today. Bryan Frith in the Australian today made the obvious comparison between the responsibilities of the Federal Treasurer and those people who have been running organisations in recent years where there has been a lack of disclosure to their shareholders. It is an extraordinary claim for the Treasurer to make that he should somehow escape responsibility when he, in his own Budget, presented figures which were clearly, and are now demonstrably shown to have been, wrong. If you were a private sector company director, you would be facing criminal charges for that very conduct. For that reason . you ought to go. If you do not have the decency and honesty to go, Treasurer, you ought to be sacked, and sacked today. As well as those two articles I have mentioned, which I just plucked out of the papers today, the editorial in today's Herald-Sun was very critical of your performance. The Sydney Morning Herald was also highly critical of your performance. The editorial in today's Australian Financial Review made the point again that in the real world, where you and this Parliament have laid down a standard of conduct for private sector directors in that situation, you have broken your own standard. Daryl Dixon, who is well respected in Australia, said, 'This cover-up is absolutely disgusting', to use his words. And so it goes on. David Chessel, the former head of that section in Federal Treasury which is responsible for Commonwealth-State relations, said that you, Treasurer, were guilty of the greatest improprieties. One of the members of the Loan Council, the Premier of New South Wales, has in fact demanded that you be sacked because you cannot be trusted as Chairman bf the Loan Council. This is an open and shut case. The Loan Council affair strikes at the very heart of a central issue in this country. In any democracy it strikes at the very heart of honest government. We live in an open society. We have open markets which demand open information, and those markets-and hundreds of thousands of Australians-rely upon the Federal Government being honest in its dealings with the public at large. If the finandebt cial markets cannot get an honest appraisal of the true level of public sector debt from the Federal Treasurer and the Commonwealth Budget, where can they get that honest appraisal from? If all the members of the Loan Council and all the State Premiers in this country cannot get an honest statement as to the level of debt of one of the members of the Loan Council-and in particular if they cannot get honest and reliable information from the Chairman of the Loan Council, the Federal Treasurer-one would obviously ask who in this country they can get honest and reliable information from. What is at issue in this Loan Council affair is the credibility of the Treasurer. Today I want to lay down chronologically for the Parliament how it is that this man set out on a course to deliberately deceive and mislead both this Parliament and the Australian public. Let me just say by way of explanation that the Loan Council is a meeting of the Commonwealth and the State Premiers. Every year they.sit down and decide how much the States can borrow. That goes to the heart of national economic management in Australia. On every occasion the States are given a limit, a cap, on how Ip.uch they can borrow. This is called the global borrowing limit. To stress the importance of it, the Treasurer himself has said that this goes to the heart of our prospects for national economic recovery. It could not be a more serious matter: it goes to the heart of the way in which we run this country. In this case the Victorians breached two obligations. The first obligation members have is to tell the other members of the Council what they are doing. They have to be honest about what they are doing. Secondly, they are not· allowed to breach the limits which they have agreed to in that meeting called the Loan Council. Victoria did this, and not by some trifling amount. It was a huge amount$1.2 billion, about twice what it should have and Victoria was entitled to borrow. The chronology of this is that everybody knows that the last Victorian Government, the State Labor administration, could never be trusted with money. It has been building up at an alarming rate. Back in 1989-90 it needed an extra $276m to balance the books; $204m in the next year; and $786m in 199192. It has been pushing out many reports on what you could actually do to cheat on the global borrowing limits. On 27 March the current Treasurer wrote to the Victorians. He was worried because the Victorian Government was going to flog off police stations as a means of - raising more money after having already sold the trams once or twice to the Japanese. By 1 May the Victorians had borrowed $1.2 billion just on 30 days and 60 days terms. That was becoming an unstable arrangement, so they decided to go for the big whack: to go to the bank manager and get a three-year loan to roll all the money that they owed into one big loan. On 1 May this year they borrowed $1.2 billion. They converted their short· term borrowings to medium term borrowings. Under the Loan Council guidelines, if you borrow some money this week and pay it back next week that is okay. But if you borrow money on a longer term basis, then you have to tell the other members of the Loan Council and before you borrow the money you have to get their approval. The Victorian Government did not do either and in due course this man, the Treasurer, knew so but failed to disclose it in the Federal Budget. On 1 May the Victorian Government disclosed the money; on 27 May the Treasurer again wrote to the Victorians spelling out his concern that the Budget situation was becoming very alarming. On 17 June the Victorians sat down with representatives from the Federal Treasury. We know this because the Treasurer told us in a minute which was given to him by Treasury in October this year, which states: On 17 June, Dr Smith met with the Secretary and Mr Fraser to discuss Loan Council matters. It was at this meeting that Treasury was first told of the rollover of short-term financing of budget for the years 1989-90 to 1991-92 into medium-term borrowings of $1267m. Dr Smith raised the question of Victoria seeking Loan Council approval for a special addition to its 1991-92 global borrowing limit. That is iniportant because it is a recognition by the Victorians right at the start that they have broken the rules and that eventually they would have to do something about it. The minute continues: It was pointed out to Dr Smith that any consideration of this proposal would need to be in the context of more fundamental budgetary reform. The minute goes on. On 17 June these people knew what was going on; they were told by the Victorians. On 6 July the Federal Treasurer, according to his own minute, was told the details of that meeting with the Victorians and the whole position was revealed to him. On 23 July the Treasurer got a minute from Treasury which said that there are three general possibilities: firstly; you can just agree to the extra $1.2 billion; secondly, you can agree to it with conditions; and, thirdly, you can knock it back. The minute goes on and makes the point-this is one of the. many critical points-that the Treasurer ought to protect the integrity of the Loan Council. The first advice given to the Treasurer was to protect the integrity of the Loan Council. Treasury then said, 'You ought to write to the Victorians and set out the position'. The Treasurer did that in a letter which followed on 27 July. That is a critical letter in this saga because in that letter, which I read parts of during Question Time, the Treasurer says to the Victorians, absolutely in black and white-there is no question about it whatsoever-'You have borrowed this extra money'. He explained how they had come to borrow that extra money, which is important because he knew the facts. He then said, 'I am sure you appreciate that Victoria's actions and your proposal are not consistent with either the spirit or the letter of the Loan Council arrangements'. It is as clear as day. He knew for a fact that what they had done was wrong, so he wrote to them and told them. On 29 July he had a meeting with the deficits Victorians. This was the big powwoweverything on the table with a full explanation. He sat down with the Victorians and discussed a further course of action. Some more time passed until on 7 August another letter was written by the Treasurer. We should remember that, all the way along the line, in the public arena the Victorian Governmentthe discredited Kirner Government, probably the worse Government in Victoria's historywas saying, 'Debt is not a problem; we are fixing it'. That was its argument all the way along the line. The Treasurer knew for a fact that that was a lie and the issue had to be resolved. On 7 August you wrote another letter to the Victorians, urging them to submit a formal application for approval of that additional $1.2 billion. In your earlier correspondence you noted the fact that it was a foreshadowed request. Virtually every letter and everything that was said was an admission of the fact that they were in breach of the global borrowing limits, but today at Question Time you had the incredible gall to say that this had never been settled until you finally received the letter from the Victorians today. On 12 August the Victorian Budget came down. Your claim has been, 'We were waiting to see how the Victorians would address the issue in the Budget of 12 August'. In your own press conference on 28 October you said that you opened up the Victorian Budget documents and were disappointed to see that rather than fixing the problem they had exacerbated it. Here you are negotiating with the Victorians and they basically tell you where to get off. I am being very generous to you, Treasurer, because 1 think you should have acted right from the word go. The fact is that you turned a blind eye to support your crazy Labor debtridden mates in Victoria. A week later you brought down a Federal Budget and circulated a document as part of the Budget Papers. The inside cover says specifically that this document is part of the Budget Papers. You are responsible for these Budget Papers. These are the same Budget Papers that you and the Prime Minister sat down and rewrote with your secret tax agenda in the last few days of this Budget. This is definitely yours; it has your fingerprints all over it. Furthermore, it says that it is circulated by you for the information of honourable members on the occasion of the Budget 1992-93. You brought in this document and presented a table which purported to show the state of Victoria's debt in respect of the global borrowing limits, knowing that that figure was absolutely wrong. Not only that; your claim then was, 'We only put in here what the Victorians give us'. But on 24 July they faxed to you a statement of Victoria's debt which had a footnote to it, which should have sent alarm bells ringing from one end of the country to another, to tell you that they were over to the tune of $1.2 billion. It is highlighted in yellow, but there it is in black and white. Even the Victorians put it in as a footnote, but you decided not to. Then you add the ridiculous claim: 'It is not normal practice for us to do so'. You did it in 1988 with the Queenslanders. In one year you actually put your own Treasury estimates in, and in the Queensland affair you qualified the Budget with a specific reference to the Queensland position. It is an open and shut case: you brought down a Budget which you knew for an absolute fact was wrong.",26
202,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,They made it - rong.,29
203,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"In fact, they made it wrong. You had a very clear obligation to this country as a whole to come clean on the state of Victoria's finances. Let us have a brief look at your defences. Then you run this defence",29
204,Dr HEWSON,TREASURER,A Watergate defence.,29
205,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I have a more local version. You run this defence: 'One, we had to keep it confidential; and, two, under that umbrella of confidentiality we were going to do everything possible to fix it'. That is basically the line: 'One, we had to keep it quiet; and, two, we were going to do everything possible'. Mr Downer-That was Khemlani.",29
206,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"1 thank the honourable member for Mayo for his interjection. The last big scandal we had on this was Khemlani. When Whitlam was first asked about Khemlani, do you know what he said? He said, 'I can't tell you because it's confidential'. Exactly the same line! The fact is that in 1988 we had a precedent on virtually the same matter-there are a lot of parallels-in dealing with the National Party Government in Queensland. In that case, the Queensland Government did not actually breach its limits. It just said that it was not going to accept a cut and that, therefore, it might breach the limits. These blokes opposite came down on it like a ton of bricks. There was no talk about confidentiality. Keating went out and gave a press conference, belted the Queenslanders and actually came into the Parliament and changed the law so that he could enforce the threat, just on the offchance that the Queenslanders might breach the global borrowings limits. Yet on this occasion those opposite say, 'These are our Labor mates; we go quiet on that'. The next year they did not put the power to cut the grants in the legislation. The then Minister, acting on behalf of the Treasurer, stood up in the Parliament and said, 'We are not giving ourselves the power to do this this year, but 1 tell you what, if it ever happens again, we will legislate to make people toe the line'. It was a crystal clear statement from the Government about what its policy was, and you have broken that precedent yourself as a cover-up to what has gone on on this occasion. The confidentiality argument, 1 must say, is also demolished by a number of things. First of all, this bloke has been all over the shop on this issue. Last week, on 28 October, he gave a press conference and said that· he wanted a public exposition of the issue. Now he is saying he wants confidentiality; then he said he wanted a public exposition. Then last Sunday-this was a doozey-he gave a press conference in Perth or somewhere where his line was, 'It was all there in the Budget in the first place'. One minute he says, 'We had to keep it confidential'; the next minute he says, 'It was all there in the Budget in the first place'. Then, just to boggle the mind, we read the part of the Budget that he refers to and find that it is not there, .because it does not dis aggregate the State figures. Then yesterday-to show what a confused fellow the Treasurer is-he went on the Neil Mitchell program. He was asked this question in Question Time today and, by the way,· his answer was quite wrong, and I will give him the transcript of what he said. Asked about confidentiality, he said, 'But the markets knew about it all along'. So one minute it had to be kept quiet; the next minute everybody knew. One minute it had to be kept quiet; the next minute he had revealed it in the Budget itself. The other line is, 'Beyond this defence and behind that cloak of confidentiality, we have done absolutely everything possible'. Of course, that is just wrong. It was interesting that when he was asked about the Queensland precedent in Question Time today he could not answer the question. I invite you to give us a reasonable response, which you have so far failed to do. Secondly-and this is critical - you never put the threat in confidence to the Victorians like you did to the Queenslanders. There is no excuse for that. The confidentiality argument has no basis because your first requirement was to notify in confidence the other members of the Loan Council. It hardly needs to be said that there is no excuse for lying in the Federal Budget. There is no excuse for deceiving the Australian public. The Victorian Government has been elected for a week, the matter came into the public arena and the matter was fixed within a week, which just shows that if we had had some public disclosure right at the start we would have had some public pressure which would have actually resolved this matter. It is an absolute disgrace that you should set yourself on a course to deliberately deceive and mislead the Australian public. We cannot in this country have a Treasurer in which nobody has any confidence regarding his integrity. You ought to resign. (lIme expired)",29
207,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,I move: That the honourable member's time be extended. Mr Reith-How long are you going to give me?,30
208,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,Seven or eight minutes; we are going to watch the Cup. Question resolved in the affirmative.,30
209,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I thank the House. I am sorry the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) does not yet find himself ready to answer the questions we put and wants another eight minutes, but I will be very happy to put a few more matters to him. Let me round off my conclusion and then come back to a few of the points. It is very telling that we get a new broom in Victoria and the Victorians honestly state what the position is. Last night they sat down and, of course, you had to agree to their request anyway; you were not going to pull the plug on the State anyway. But it is very interesting that within a week you have endorsed the regularisation of that $1.2 billion. The fact is that for about four months since June, until it was revealed, you sat mute because it suited your political convenience. I think you have done a great disservice to this country in undermining our reputation as an honest trader in world affairs. Given the extra time, let me pick up a few of the detailed points which I do think need to be expanded upon. Firstly, there is this question about the argument, 'Look, we just put in whatever we want to put in, whatever we are given by the States'-the explanation for which this document is clearly misleading. That is a very interesting point. I would like some more information from the Treasurer on this, because I am told that his Treasury officers in their briefing yesterday with the Democrats admitted that there was a problem with the reliability of the accounts of the various States. In fact, they told the Democrats that their standard recommendation to Treasurers was not to include that material. On this occasion, Treasurer, I would like to know exactly what was the recommendation to you on this issue. I find it hard to believe that the Treasury officers did not cover their backs on this question. You have not yet replied to my freedom of information request. The reality is that there will be a piece of paper that goes with every meeting and every letter that you have sent. We would like all of that correspondence revealed. We would also like all of those minutes revealed and all of the minutes that came with the advice· to the then Treasurer back in 1988, because I find it very hard to believe that the advice that was given in 1988, which was, basically, to hit the Queenslanders with a ton of bricks and legislate, would in some way differ from the advice you have been given on this occasion. I seek from you, Treasurer, a full release of all the documents. You have released a number already. You say it is in the public interest for them to be released; therefore, it ought to be in the public interest that the balance of the documents be released. But your claim is this, 'We put into the Federal Budget whatever we are given by the States, regardless'. The fact is that that is simply true because in 1985-86-and I will provide you with that part of the Federal Budget in that year-you actually put in Treasury's own estimates of the Queensland borrowing situation. On that occasion-and you did not answer that question in Question TimeTreasury's hand went to the Budget table which was produced in that year. At page 52 of the 1988-89 Budget, there was a quite clear, specific reference. A paragraph relating to the Queensland position notes that at its 12 May 1988 meeting, Loan Council members, other than Queensland, agreed to an aggregate new borrowing limit for State authorities, et cetera. So that specification of the Queensland situation. There was specifically a footnote to that year's Budget which noted that the global money limits agreed at the May 1988 Loan Council meeting were as specified by all members, except by Queensland. We had another reference to that situation occurring which I put to you, Treasurer, in Question Time. The argument that you just put in whatever you are given has been shot to pieces. You have given no answer to that, nor have you given any answer regarding the fact that, with that 1988 circumstance with Queensland, the following year the honour who was then the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, made a statement in the Parliament which was to the effect that any additional breaches would be dealt with very severely by the Federal Government. In his second reading speech on the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1989, he said: One further change from the arrangements put in place last year is that under this Bill the payment of general purpose assistance has not been made conditional on State observance of the global borrowing limits. Such a provision was included in the States Grants (General Revenue) Act 1988 in response to the refusal of Queensland to agree to the resolution of Loan Council which set the limits for 1988-89. All States have agreed to the resolution for 1989-90. Then he said, and I emphasise it again: However, should any State in the future fail to commit itself to the global limits or fail to use its best endeavours to observe them, the Government would be prepared to propose the reintroduction of not the provision to this or future legislation. It is absolutely open and shut. It is game, set and match on that point, Treasurer. You made it very clear in 1989 that the Government's policy was that any government in the future that attempted to breach the global borrowing limits would be dealt with. That legislation was introduced into the Parliament not so long ago. Conspicuous by its absence was the fact that there was no such parallel provision which you had threatened back in 1988. I will pick up again on the point about whether or not the Government had done everything. I made the point at the end of my first remarks that, firstly, that argument is gave a completely met by the Queensland precedent-and I have just reinforced that. Secondly, the Government never put the threat to the Victorians. It is taking the line that it all had to be confidential, but the truth is that the internal dealings of the Loan Council can be, and often are, confidential. There was a requirement on the then Victorian Government to notify, and it failed to notify. The Treasurer has acknowledged that in his letter of 27 July. But there was a further obligation. Not only did the Victorians fail to notify, but the Treasurer, knowing that, himself then failed to notify other members of the Loan Council. So his claim about confidentiality on the Loan Council's operations has absolutely no basis, because they are confidential. There are confidential discussions about, for example, Loy Yang B, the financing arrangements and privatisation, and we do not have any quibble with the view that there ought to be some confidentiality in the actual detailed arrangements on some of these commercial transactions. That is not the point. The point is that there is a clear requirement on States to stay within their global borrowing limits, and on this occasion Victoria failed to do so. You"" Treasurer, in your own correspondence actually made the point-and I think it was in the letter of 7 August: I do not accept that the requirement to conduct transaction in a discreet manner justified the borrowings being undertaken without Loan Council approval. That is as clear as day. You knew that Victoria was in breach. You knew that it had failed to notify you. You knew that you had an obligation-you have it there in your own letter-to advise the other members. Your defence of confidentiality is completely demolished by your own letter, mate. In a sense, you can put the other issues to one side and just focus on that one responsibility of yours as Chairman of the Loan Council, which was to deal openly and honestly with other members of the Loan Council in confidence. Just that one point alone ought to drive you from office-for failing to discharge your responsibilities as Chairman of the Loan Council. As I said at the start, there is a rumour around the Pa-liament todaY-'-the place is abuzz with rumours-that Labor is going to an election on 12 December. That would not surprise me. We have always said that the Government will go early. The principal reason is that it believes that unemployment could be higher next year than it is now. But there is a very important, subsidiary, secondary argument which would propel it to an early election-that is, that the Senate today or tomorrow will agree to establish a parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of the Loan Council. The last thing you want, Treasurer, is a further investigation. I was very pleased that the Acting Premier of New South Wales made it clear that he wants to see all the dirty laundry out in public, so that in future the public, the markets, and the international community can have 'some confidence in the Treasurer of Australia. You ought to resign. (1fme expired)",30
210,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,32
211,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,"What a pathetic performance from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). A censure motion is one of the most the serious motions that can be brought before the House. On this occasion, I listened attentively to the Deputy Leader and found nothing new. Nothing new was revealed that he had not raised, that others had not raised, and that I had not answered in the course of this public debate. For that reason, I move: That all words after ""that"" be omitted with a view substituting the following words: ""the House censures the Opposition for playing politics with normal Commonwealth/State relations in Loan Council arrangements in direct contravention of the wishes of their colleagues in the Victorian State Government who have supported the Commonwealth's handling of their loan arrangements. Before I turn to my amendment, let me just deal with a couple of the matters which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has raised today. First of all, he talks about whether or not the practice was adhered to in relation to the publication of the State's figures in Budget Paper No.4. He says, in his contribution, that he does not believe that this matter was not drawn to my attention, that the Treasury did not cover its backside, as he said, in relation to the figures covered in Budget Paper No.4. He has been running around saying that there is this secret minute dated 5 August about Budget Paper No.4. Let me just read to the honourable member what the Treasury actually put to me in that context. It said: Attached for clearance are drafts of the above sections of Budget Paper No 4,that is, the preface, chapters I and IV""Commonwealth Financial Relations with other Levels of Government 1992-93"". You will note that the discussion of borrowings universities in Chapter IV remains in square brackets at this stage. We have been in consultation with PM&C, Finance and DEET-which we understand is seeking guidance from its Ministerand hope to be able to remove the brackets by the end of the week. Other than that, there a controversial nature in these chapters. So much for this rubbish that you have been going on about. Mr Reith-Table all of them, John.",32
212,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,I will table the document. Mr Reith-Ate they new?,33
213,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,I have already said that I will table these papers. I will do it right now. Mr Reith interjecting,33
214,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Treasurer; either the Deputy Leader wants me to respond to this debate or not. He has been running around talking about the fact· that there is this secret minute which brought to my attention matters relating to the figures in Budget Paper No.4. That is the minute on which it was says: cleared. Nothing of the sort was included in that minute; nothing relating to the figures. The Deputy Leader goes on to 'But what about the footnote in 1986-87?'. was The thing about the footnote in 1986-87 in relation to Queensland was that and the Commonwealth agreed on the footSo note. The reason for agreeing on the footnote was that the Queensland Government intended to sell the World Trade Centre but the deal had not gone through by the end of the Therefore there was a technical breach, and there was a footnote, the contents of which rary. were agreed to by the Queensland Government",33
215,Dr HEWSON,TREASURER,Did you read the footnote?,33
216,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,Why don't you just be quiet.,33
217,Mr HOWARD,TREASURER,Are you ignoring the footnote?,33
218,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order!,33
219,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,"So there was a technical breach in that case, which Queensland acknowledged, and it was put in in that context. by There was no such acknowledgment by Victoria that there had been a breach.",33
220,Dr HEWSON,TREASURER,That is what the footnote says.,33
221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The is little of Leader of the Opposition!,33
222,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,"They indicated that their only requirement was to report to us that which they decide is within their global borrowing limit. They put in a footnote, but they said that this matter had still to be settled, this matter was in dispute as to its categorisation of being temporary borrowings. If it was temporary borrowings it did not have to be included in the report of their globals. As I indicated in Question Time today, we received a letter from the Victorian Treasury yesterday or today. I said it was from the I .should have said from the Treasury. What does it say? Let me read this whole note. The status of the borrowings was . in dispute with the Victorian Treasury at that time. This is confirmed in a letter dated 2 November 1992, where the Victorian Treasury Victorian ... the funding of the deficitsask, for which these borrowings were madetreated as temporary and was not reported for Loan Council purposes pending clarification of Queensland Loan Council treatment. not only did the Victorians not agree with us that these were other than temporary borrowings, but this is what has been referred to by the Victorians now as to why they were year. not reported in that way, because the so Victorians maintained that they were tempoThe point about this whole debate is that if I were the Victorian Treasurer, if I were Mr Sheehan, this debate would have some semblance of relevance. But I am not the Victorian Treasurer now, nor have I ever been, nor do I ever want to be. Mr Reith-But you have a responsibility as Commonwealth Treasurer.",33
223,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence. He will not continue to make his speech while the Treasurer is on his feet. This is a serious matter. I suggest he should treat it so.,34
224,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,Of course those opposite do not think it· is serious. They think it is a totally put up stunt. That is quite obvious from their attitude now. They realise that they have lost this debate. They realise that I have provided all of the papers which are relevant to this consideration. An honourable member interjecting,34
225,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,Is that relevant? What has that got to say? You were the one who was saying it had. Mr Reith-Look at what the press says.,34
226,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,34
227,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,"I have produced relevant papers which go to the heart of this matter. They have been released publicly and they have now been tabled in this Parliament. This turns on the conduct of the Victorian Government. I am not here, as my letters reveal perfectly clearly, as an apologist for the former Victorian Government. In fact, this matter did not come to note because the Victorians came here voluntarily confessing what they had done; this matter came to note because we summoned them to Canberra to tell us what they had been doing. We said to them, 'This matter should be regularised; it requires an application. But don't bother putting in an application unless you include with it a medium term strategy for dealing with your overall debt problem'. They' said they were going to produce that in the context of their Budget. In the event that they did I wrote to them telling them that they had not, by which time, of course, they were in no position to respond to anyone or to negotiate with anyone because of their caretaker status. So we then had to wait for the election of a government which was prepared to face up to these issues in the way that Mr Kennett revealed last night. The Opposition does not appreciate that what we were trying to achieve all the way along was what we achieved last night: a medium term strategy for dealing with Victoria's debt problem. One of the things which I find particularly offensive in this debate is that somehow I have been involved in deception or in dishonesty. Of course, it is those opposite who are the experts in this area. They are the ones who have set the standard for political dishonesty over the years. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who, apart from the fact that I am going to move the gag, would participate in this debate, was the one who knew that in the 1983 election the deficit was $9.6 billion. When he was running around in the 1983 election, what was he saying about the size of the deficit? He said it would be $6 billion, when he had a note from Treasury telling him that it was $9.6 billion. Did he face up to that? Did he come clean with the people of Australia? Of course he did not. He kept that matter secret because he knew that it would be damaging to his chances. We have more recent examples of their colleagues in Victoria, who said at the time of the election, 'No person in employment will suffer any loss of award wages or conditions'. We now know, only three or four weeks laterMr Downer-What has this got to do with the Loan Council?",34
228,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,"This has to do with the fact that no-one knows more about deception than those in the Liberal Party who actually practise it. The Victorian situation has been one of alarming proportions. It was one which needed to be dealt with sensibly, not in chaos, as the Opposition would have us believe. That is why we said that this matter had to be dealt with in the Loan Council context and in the not, public context with. a medium term strategy with which to deal with these underlying problems. We now have that situation. What the Opposition has to face up to is the need to provide an explanation for its conduct in this matter. I was interested that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in his speech that what needed to be done was to solve this problem. That is one thing on which I agree with him. What was needed was a solution to this problem, and we cannot get a solution from a caretaker government. What we were waiting for was a government that was prepared to deal with this matter and, thankfully, last night we were able to have presented to us a medium term strategy for dealing with Victoria. The Deputy Leader now brings New South Wales into it. New South Wales has behaved scandalously in this regard. Mr Fahey should have known beUer. He displayed either total ignorance or total dishonesty in his contribution last week. He said that these matters had been brought to the attention of the Federal Government by Greiner. That is untrue, and he deceived his own Parliament by saying it. He did have the decency to say that if I had acted on advice then he would withdraw his criticisms and apologise. I am still waiting for that apology from Premier Fahey. We will see just how red-blooded he really is, whether he h- the guts to apologise in the way in which he said he would. ' Mr Downer-You are the one who should be apologising. You owe Australia an apology.",34
229,Mr DAWKINS,TREASURER,"I have nothing to apologise for. The apology which we want is from the Opposition for the scandalous way in which it has been abrogating the national interest, trying to cause, in a very irresponsible way, chaos on the financial marketschaos which has in fact already cost the Victorian taxpayers $30m and has cost taxpayers around Australia comparable amounts because of its activities. What happened last night revealed just how strong these arrangements can be between the Commonwealth and State governments, just how well intentioned governments can work together in solving these problems. That is what we are bound to do with this Government in Victoria, and that is what we have said we will do. lt is very interesting to read what Mr Kennett had to say about there being something bigger than politics in all of this. Why do you not appreciate what he is saying? There is something bigger than politics. lt has nothing to do with you; it has to do with the interests of the people of Victoria. That is what we are standing up for, and that is what he is trying to stand up for as well. He says what a highly satisfactory meeting we had last night, what a fine outcome we were able to get from that meeting and how we are going to work together in a way which you would not comprehend to try to deal with these matters confronting Victoria at the moment. Despite everything that the Opposition has done, it has failed today to substantiate any kind of a case whatsoever. It has failed to introduce any new matter. All it has done is once again reveal its total irresponsibility, its total preoccupation with squalid political objectives, and that is the reason we are censuring it. I move: That the question be now put.",35

Whether you have them or not they have not been tabled. Will the Treasurer seek leave to table the documents he wished to table during his speech? Mr Dawkins-Yes, I table them.",35
240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"Good. The question is that leave be granted. Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to",36
241,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,No. You cannot speak to them. Mr Reith-But I have these documents,36
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"No, you cannot speak to them. The debate is continuing. You cannot speak to them. The original question was that the motion be agreed to.

256,Mr KEATING,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to be able to move the introduction of a piece of legislation which will significantly improve and extend the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. It is unusual, Mr Deputy Speaker, for a Prime Minister to introduce legislation. I do so today to emphasise the importance of these amendments and to take the opportunity to restate and re-emphasise the Government's commitment to constant vigilance when it comes to improving the status of Australian women. The amendments I introduce today are part of the Government's response to a number of the recommendations made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, chaired by Mr Michael Lavarch, MP, known as the Lavarch Committee, in its report of its inquiry into equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia. The Committee's report, entitled Half Way to Equal, was released on 30 April 1992. The Lavarch Committee engaged in one of the most wide-ranging and comprehensive inquiries ever conducted into the status of women in Australia. During its inquiry the Committee received over 600 submissions, held 19 days of public hearings in which it heard testimony from 181 witnesses, held four two-day public seminars and released four discussion papers. DAY Consequently, the Committee's report presents one of the most detailed pictures of the position of Australian women ever to be made available. It also represents the first comprehensive evaluation of the operation and effectiveness of the Sex Discrimination Act since it commenced in 1984. The Committee has done a fine job and is to be congratulated. 1992 The Committee made a substantial number of recommendations, including many worthwhile and practical suggestions for amending the Sex Discrimination Act and improving the functioning of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This Bill contains a number of amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act which implement those recommendations. The Bill will - also amend the Industrial Relations Act 1988 as part of a new mechanism to allow review of awards and certified agreements which are discriminatory on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy. The Bill also contains, where appropriate, amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 and the recently passed disability discrimination legislation to bring these Acts into line with the amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act. Details of the amendments contained in the Bill are set out in detail in the. explanatory memorandum, which I present to the House. Let me briefly summarise their provisions while at the same time informing the House of the reasons for the Government's speedy response to the Lavarch recommendations and the other initiatives contained in the legislabargaining tion. We as a government recognise the import- - women. ant contribution to the Australian economy made by Australian women, and we do all that we can to encourage their greater particiin pation. Women have in fact taken up the majority of new jobs created since Labor came to office almost a decade ago. We also recognise that there are still barriers to women's full and equal participation and sex discrimination and affirmative action laws were designed to help re!1ledy this. Women by and large still earn less than men, despite legislated provisions for equal pay, because women and men tend not in the same jobs. Women encounter barriers to promotion-the so-called glass ceiling. Sexual harassment remains an' unwelcome feature in many women's working lives. Where' such barriers can be addressed by legislation, we will continue our proud piothis neering record. Today represents such occasion. There is no doubt that the Sex Discrimination Act has helped change attitudes towards discrimination and has made us understand how widespread-al\d unacceptable-sexual harassment is. But, like most laws, to be scrutinised from time to time to ensure that they are in tune with' current realities. The Lavarch report provides us w-th the opportunity to revisit this legislation, and the amendments I introduce today represent the Government's respo,nse to the report's recommendations concerning anti-discrimination legislation. The Lavarch report also contained a great many other recommendations which did not involve anti-discrimination legislation. These recommendations are at present being studied by the Government and we hope to be in a position to provide a further response to the Lavarch Committee by the' end of November. Today, let me outline our response to the legislative recommendations. Industrial Awards We have 'decided to extend the Sex Discrimination Act to Federal industrial awards. Concern has been expressed by women's organisations that' the advent of enterprise and the new certified agreement provisions contained in the Industrial Relations Act may have an adverse impact on While the 'no disadvantage' test contained the certified agreement provisions is intended to protect well-established standards such as maternity leave and parental leave, the Government accepts that. it will not necessarily pperate against provisions which our discriminate against women. The proposed changes will underline the social justice safeguards in the Government's industrial relations framework.' They will signal to all workers, especially women, that the shift to a more decentralised system is a part of a to be managed and,responsible process. Discriminatory acts done in direct compliance with an award are currently exempted from the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act. The Lavarch Committee received a number of submissions which were critical of exemption. In response, we have develan oped a mechanism so that complaints concerning a discriminatory award will be able to be made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under proposed section 50A of the Sex Discrimination Act alleging that a person has been discriminated these need against under an award. If the Sex Discrimination' Commissioner forms a view that the award is discriminatory, the Commissioner must refer the award to Australian fudustrial Relations Commissionconduct unless the Commissioner is of the opinion that the complaint is vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance. If a complaint is referred to the Australian fudustrial Relations Commission, the Commission will then reconvene the parties to the award or certified and agreement. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner will then have standing to appear before the Commission. If the Commission is of the view that the award operates in a discriminatory way; it will be required to take whatever action is necessary to remove the discrimination, unless it considers that a variation would not be the public interest. If the complaint concerns a certified. agreement, the Commission must give the parties to the agreement an opporfined tunity to amend the agreement so as to move the discrimination, before taking the necessary action to remove the discrimination. Sexual Harassment Division 3 of Part II of the Sex Discrimination Act, the sexual harassment provisions, currently applies only to sexual harassment employment and haraSsment of students by real staff in educational institutions. The current definitions of sexual harassment also require that the complainant suffer disadvantage, that the complainant had reasonable grounds for believing that she or he would suffer detriment, if she or he objected to the harassThe ment. I believe that most members of the general community would now accept that a person can be subjected to sexual harassment even she or he suffers no further detriment disadvantage in connection with her employment or education. Accordingly, this Bill will amend the definition of sexual harassment to remove the requirement that the complainant demonstrate disadvantage. Under the' new definition, the test will satisfied if the complainant felt offended, humiliated or intimidated by unwelcome of conduct of a sexual nature from the respondAct ent. The test also requires an objective ment: that is, a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the complainant would be the offended, humiliated or intimidated by the that is the subject of the complaint. The Bill extends the ambit of the sexual harassment provisions to the provision of goods, services and facilities, the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs, dealings in connection with land and the provision of accommodation. Consequently, it will now, for example, be unlawful for a landlord to sexually harass a tenant. The existing proscription of sexual harassment in education will also be extended to cover situations where a member of the staff of an educational institution is sexually in harassed by an adult student, or where one adult student is sexually harassed by another adult student - Adult student' has been deto mean a person of 16 years of age or reover. Sexual harassment of a student by a staff member will continue to be not subject to any age restriction. Victimisation The Lavarch Committee also expressed concern that the' effectiveness of the Sex in Discrimination Act could be put at risk by a fear of victimisation of complainants. The Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Human Rights and Equal or Opportunity Commission Act will be amended to allow complairits of victimisation to be considered through a process of c.onciliation. existing provisions which allow complaints of victimisation to be prosecuted in court will remain. This is the model that has been used in the recently passed disability if discrimination legislation and is also the or model used in State and Territory antior his discrimination legislation. Representative Complaints The representative complaints provision of the Sex Discrimination Act, the Racial Discribe mination Act and the disability discrimination legislation will be replaced by new provisions part IVA of the Federal Court of Australia 1976 which came into force earlier this eleyear. These amendments will make it easier for a representative complaint to be made. The procedure for dealing with such complaints will also be flexible enough to ensure that they are handled efficiently and that the procedure is not ab-ed. Determination The amendments contained in this Bill will put in place a new mechanism for enforcing determinations by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission under the SDA, the RDA and the disability discrimination legislation. At present, a complainant who wishes to enforce a determination of the Commission must bring proceedings in the Federal Court. In practice, this has meant that the Federal Court has had to hear the matter afresh. This duplication obviously increases stress on the parties, as well as increasing the financial cost borne by the parties and the taxpayer. The standing of the Commission is also not enhanced by the fact that the parties to a determination can disregard the determination and attempt to circumvent it by leading evidence in the Federal Court which was not adduced in the Commission. Understandably, the existing enforcement mechanism has been subject to judicial criticism-for example, comments made by Wilcox 1. in Maynard v. Neilson (1988) EOC p.92-226. Under the new mechanism, a determination will be registered in the Federal Court and will have effect as if it were an order of the court, unless the respondent to the determination applies to the court within 28 days for a review of the determination. In the absence of such an application, action can be taken through the usual processes of the court to enforce the determination. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am confident that these amendments will strengthen and streamline our anti-discrimination laws. They will ensure that women, and men, can get on with their lives, their working lives, their education, able to seek redress against discrimination and disadvantage should that be necessary. This Government is committed to preserving women's ability to make choices about their lives. Women value their new independence and ability to take part in all areas of society. We will ensure that no obstacle or barrier stands in their way that we have the power to remedy. We stand for the full equality of women and men. This legislation goes a long way towards furthering that aim. Again, I congratulate the Committee on its work. I am very pleased that Michael Lavarch and members of the Committee are present in the House at the moment. I again thank them for their efforts. I commend the Bill to the House. I also present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on .motion by Mr Smith) adjourned.

257,Mr DUFFY,OPPORTUNITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill contains amendments to the Commonwealth's human rights legislation to of create the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner and to proscribe dismissal of a worker on the ground of his her family responsibilities. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner This Bill provides another example of this Government's commitment to implementing its undertakings to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people arising from the mendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. There were many aspects to the report of the Royal Commission. The fact that the Commission governments. was required at all and the extent of the recommendations made clearly indicate need for there to be an ongoing overall report on the exercise of basic human rights by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The extent of the disadvantage suffered by indigenous Australians was graphically lighted by the work of the Royal Commission. The response of all gc;>Yernments to the recIslander ommendations of the Royal Commission has been very positive. But there continues to exist a need for us as a· nation to focus on the extent to which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are able to exersioner cise the basic human rights that the rest of nation take for granted. The creation of this office and the production of a yearly report will provide this focus. I hope that all vernments will actively cooperate in the of the Commissioner to allow for that office to be part of the ongoihg push to improve everyday lives of the first Australians. The Commissioner will have an opportunity to continue the work already done by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in highlighting the plight of government agencies will be su - ect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the years. My colleague the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who has worked strenuously the creation of this new office, will also speak in this debate and will elaborate in more detail on some of the work done by the criminal Commission. One of the often least appreciated aspects legislation is the potential of that legisla. tion to educate public opinion and attitudes far in excess of those who may actually bit or directly affected by it. In the area of human rights generally .this is particularly critical. The Government has a very proud record in relation to human rights refonn, commencing with the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, the recently passed Disability recomDiscrimination Act 1992 and now these reforms. This is not to mention our work on ratifying numerous international instruments during the tenn of the Hawke and Keating The legislation creates a new part to the a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act to establish the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. The Commissioner's major function is to be the preparation of a yearly highreport on the enjoyment and exercise of human rights by Aboriginal and Torres Strait people. That report is to be tabled in the Parliament and sent to all States and Territories. It will, therefore, be a public regularly document available to all. One of the ongoing tasks that the Commiswill undertake as part of the production the of his or her report will be to review the overall implementation by all governments of the recommendations of the Royal Commisgosion. The Commissioner is to be a full memwork ber of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and will have all the the powers necessary to carry out his or her functions- In particular, the Commission.er will have the power to seek and obtain information and documents from government agencies. Commonwealth, State and Territory b this power but a State or Territory Attorney General will be able to provide a certificate that release of the information would not be in the public interest, for a number of reasons for set out in the Bill. These include that release would prejudice investigations, that it would show the deliberation of the Cabinet or Executive Council of a State or Territory, et cetera. Similar power already exists in the Act for the Commonwealth Attorney-General. The Commissioner is also prevented from seeking details which would identify individuals unless they consent. The Commissioner will also have functions relating to promoting and encouraging respect for the human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Commissioner is to be appointed by the Governor General for a period of up to seven years and is able to be reappointed. The legislation requires that a person appointed must have significant experience in the community life of either Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. The Commissioner will also be required to consult with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and may consult with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations as appropriate. Workers with Family Responsibilities I am pleased to be able to move the introduction of legislation on a matter which so deeply affects the lives and opportunities of people with family responsibilities. Life in Australia at work and in the family has undergone profound changes over the last three decades. The expectations of the social and economic roles of men and women are broadening. This attitudinal shift is supported by increases in the participation of women in the work force and education; a growing recognition and understanding of the value of carers of families, people with disabilities, our sick and elderly; and the ageing of our population. The Government has recognised that the interaction between work and family responsibilities has implications for the achievement of social justice for our citizens, as well as having a critical impact on the efficiency and productivity of our economy. In March 1990, Australia ratified International Labour Organisation Convention 156 - A Convention Concerning Equal Opportunities and Equal Treatment for Men and Women Workers: Workers with Family Responsibilities-and it came into effect in March 1991. Prior to ratification,. Australia already had a number of measures in place which comply with the principles underlying ILO 156. However, our ratification of ILO 156 relies on the flexibility provided by its staged implementation process, and the Government plans to undertake further action to supplement these measures in order to ensure full compliance over time. In March 1991 an interdepartmental committee, an IDC, was established to coordinate the development of the strategy chaired by the Department of Industrial Relations. The overriding principle embodied in ILO 156 is that of equal opportunity for all in employment through, where possible, the removal of discrimination on the grounds of family responsibilities. To this end, the IDC endorsed the following legislative strategy, in two stages: one for immediate implementation and the second with a view to implementation within two years. The first legislative stage is to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the SDA, to proscribe dismissal from employment on the ground of family responsibilities. The second stage is to enter into wide ranging consultations with a view, at this point, to a further amendment to the SDA to prohibit more generally discrimination in employment on the ground of family responsibilities. It is this first stage which is the subject of the Bill before Parliament. This amendment seeks to give effect to article 8 of ILO 156, which provides that family responsibilities shall not, as such, constitute a valid reason for termination of employment. I turn now to a more detailed description of the amendments. This amendment is intended to be narrow in its scope in that it provides protection only against discrimip.ation on the grounds of family responsibilitieS which takes the form of dismissal. 'Family responsibilities' is defined by reference to the terms of ILO 156, which applies to workers with family responsibilities in relation to their dependent children as well as the care and support of other members of the immediate family. This definition is not intended to be exhaustive. The provisions of this Act are intended to apply to a situation in which an employee has assumed the responsibility for, and therefore could be said to have a special relationship with, any other member of his or her family with regard to their care and support. 'Discrimination' is defined to include less favourable treatment-that is, direct discrimination. This new provision will apply only to a dismissal on the ground of the existence of family responsibilities or of a characteristic that appertains generally or is imputed generally to persons with family responsibilities. is not intended to cover, for example, the dismissal of an employee because the employee is unwilling to change a shift, or has a period of unauthorised leave, even though both may be due to family responsibilities. While some members of the community may be concerned that this amendment does not go far enough, I am confident that it points the way to a much broader direction being pursued by the Government, with the assistance and views, of both employers and employees. We look forward to a time when workers with family responsibilities will be able to work without being subject to discrimination and, as far as it is possible, without conflict between their employment and those family responsibilities. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) adjourned. NA First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Duffy, and read a first time. Second Reading",44
258,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Corporate Law Reform Bill implements major reforms on directors' duties, related party transactions, corporate insolvency laws, and stock exchange settlement procedures. The Bill is the most significant piece of legislation, in terms of the content· of Australia's corporate law, introduced during the life of this Parliament. Financial Impact The Bill is not expected to have any significantfinancial impact on government. The expUmatory memorandum details the potential impact of the Bill on business. The Content of the Bill This is a long Bill because it has much to It say. One of the key areas of reform relates to directors' duties. On that matter, the Bill says that directors should be under an obligation to show the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person in their position would exercise. At the same time, the Bill' and its supporting material make it clear that the courts should never apply hindsight to the decisions of directors, .but should judge those decisions based on the information which was available to the director at the time the decision was made. The Bill also·provides that where a director breaches his or her duty, but is not acting with any dishonest or fraudulent intent, the director should no longer be exposed to criminal. sanctions and possible gaol terms. But it also says that shareholders should be protected against breaches by the substitution of appropriate civil penalties, including pecuniary penalties and disqualification in the case of serious breaches. . On related parties, the Bill will ensure that 1992 companies do not give benefits on less than commercial terms to directors or holding companies without shareholders having an opportunity to say whether the benefit should be given. It says that directors who have a material personal interest in a matter before the board should disclose that interest and should be prevented from participating in board consideration of that matter unless their fellow directors are prepared to agree to them participating. In relation to companies in difficulty, the Bill makes it plain that there ate ways to deal with a company which is facing solvency difficulties that are more constructive and efficient than current remedies. It will ensure that receivers are accountable to shareholders and creditors for what they are doing while controlling a company. It says that mortgagees should not be able to avoid being accountable by taking possession of an asset through an agent rather than appointing a receiver. The same accountability should apply whenever a mortgagee has taken over a company. In addition, the Bill will prevent directors from avoiding liability for insolvent trading by deliberately refusing to take any part in management of the company. It substitutes alternative defences which protect diligent and reasonable directors without giving comfort to the reckless. The Bill will also enable directors who act honestly and reasonably to be absolved by a court from liability for insolvent trading, but such directors will also be specifically encouraged to take early action to tackle emerging difficulties such as through the appointment of an administrator under the new voluntary administration procedure. Under the Bill, liquidators will be able. to more easily reverse transactions where companies have paid out moneys to related parties just prior to a company's insolvency. This process will be assisted by ensuring that there are no technical restrictions on what a liquidaissues tor can examine in trying to ascertain what has actually happened with a company which has failed. The Bill also makes it clear that it is not good enough to provide for corporate law by making obscure and difficult cross references to the Bankruptcy Act and substitutes clear provisions adapted specifically for companies. Companies will no longer be able to resist statutory demands on purely technical grounds such as a minor misstatement of the quantity of a debt. Demands will be able to be set aside only where injustice would otherwise be caused. The Bill will also enable Australia's stock exchange settlement procedures to continue to remain on a par with the world's best and meet the standards of quick settlement that are nowadays demanded. And, finally, the Bill will ensure that Australian and New Zealand accounting standards will as far as possible be brought into alignment so that investors dealing with a company from the other country will be able to accurately assess the financial information with which they are provided. The context of the Bill This Bill needs to be seen in the context of the Government's overall agenda for corporate law refonn during the life of this Parliament. In 1990, the Parliament passed a Bill which established the national scheme for corporate regulation that we have enjoyed for the first the time in this country since 1 January 1991. The next element in the Government's corporate law agenda was a series of shorter Bills dealing with particularly urgent issues of refonn such as consolidation of accounts and the compulsory application of accounting standards, the implementation of the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on insider trading, measures to deal with the liquidity crisis which emerged in the unlisted property trust industry last year and measures to secure greater international cooperation in corporate law enforcement. This Bill represents the next stage in the process of corporate law refonn, a stage which involves tackling very significant and fundamental of refonn in a number of different areas of corporate law. The history of the Bill These reforms have not emerged from a vacuum. On the contrary, as is the case with all of the Government's corporate law refonn initiatives, the four main elements of this Bill have their origins either in a major law refonn report or in calls by industry for the introduction of particular changes. For example, the insolvency reforms in this Bill result from a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission. It is now some nine years since the inquiry which led to that report commenced; The Commission first published an issues paper and received submissions on it. This was followed by the publication of a 351-page discussion paper, which generated some 204 more detailed submissions, and a 620-page report. The Bill - so includes provisions which implement the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the social and fiduciary duties and obligations of company directors. That report itself followed the receipt of many submissions by the Committee and public hearings in a number of cities. The related party transactions provisions in the Bill result from a report by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. which followed a twoyear period of public consultation with the public release of first a report and then a draft Bill. When the Corporate Law Reform Bill was released for public exposure in February this year, the provisions in this part of the Bill were criticised on the basis that they were too long and complex and failed to give the kind of clear guidance in this area which seemed necessary following the many disastrous related party transactions which took place in the 1980s. In response to those concerns, the Government has arranged for the provisions to be redrafted in a simpler form-one which focuses much more directly on the general principles involved, supports those principles by examples where appropriate, and eschews any attempt to provide, by long black letter formulations, a precise description of how the law should apply. in every particular case. The stock' exchange settlement reforms in the Bill result from recommendations of a high level clearing and settlement steering committee established by the Australian Stock Exchange to look at implementation' of a report by The Group of 30, a private international organisation concerned with major economic and' financial issues. These reforms will enable the Australian Stock Exchange to keep up with world best practice. As is appropriate for a Bill of its significance, unprecedented consultation has been associated with every aspect of the development of the Bill and major efforts have been made to, as far as possible, meet all of the concerns which have been raised. Even before the Bill was drafted, my Department circulated discussion papers to interested peak organisations and professional. bodies for the purpose of testing their reaction to the general approach which might be taken in. the Bill. Mter the Bill was released for public exposure in February this year, this consultation process intensified. My Departinent and the Companies and SecUrities Advisory Committee jointly sponsored a series of practitioners' forums on the Bill, each of which was attended by a large number of business and professional people. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities held hearings in a number of cities. I have spoken at a number of seminars and other gatherings organised to consider the' Bill and I have arranged for officers from my Department to attend as many as possible of the many professional seminars which have considered the Bill during the year. Over 200 submissions were received on the Bill and these have been carefully analysed and many changes have been made to the Bill that was exposed. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill outlines the more significant changes that have been made. There have also been many minor technical improvements, which have resulted from the welcome willingness of many within the business and professional communities to involve themselves in the consultation process. It is a process that has been far more thorough than has ever taken place before in Australian corporate law and, I dare say, is one of the most thorough processes of consultation that has ever taken' place on any Bill in this country. Main features of the Bill I now want to outline a few of the most important features of the Bill. A more detailed survey is set out at the start of the explanatory memorandum. - directors' duties The Bill amends subsection 232(4) of the corporations law to reinforce that an officer's duty of care is an objective one, requiring the officer to exercise the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person in a like position as an officer of a corporation would exercise in the corporation's circumstances. In the case of a business corporation, the proposed standard will reflect the fact that corporate decisions involve risk taking. The courts have in the past recognised that directors and officers are not liable for honest errors of judgment. They have also shown a reluctance to review business judgments taken in good faith. Thus, in Harlowe's Nominees Pty Ltd v. Woodside, 121 CLR 483 at 493, the High Court said: Directors in whom are vested the right and duty deciding where the company's interests lie they are to be served may be concerned with a wide range of practical considerations, and their judgment, if exercised in good faith and not for irrelevant purposes, is not open to review in the courts. In addition, the courts have exercised their discretion to excuse directors who have acted honestly and who ought fairly to be excused. The corporations law already contains a provision of this nature, section 1318, and the application of that section is effectively being extended by clause 17 of this Bill. The Government endorses this approach and does not intend any change in the law by the revised wording of subsection 232(4). No attempt has been made in the Bill· to enact a US style of business judgment rule since no State in the USA has adopted a legislative statement of the rule. Instead, the matter has been left to the courts to develop. Similarly, the Government considers that the development of similar principles in Australia is better left to the courts. The Bill also decriminalises certain key directors' duties provisions by providing that breaches of those provisions are no longer subject to criminal sanctions ·unless the breaches are committed with a dishonest intent. In the course of. a planned general review of the penalty provisions in the corporations law, the Government will be considering carefully the extent to which the decriminalisation initiatives in this Bill should be taken further. Civil penalties are substituted in respect of breaches which are committed without a dishonest intent. The Bill provides that a pecuniary penalty of up to $400,000 may be imposed. However, no pecuniary penalty may be imposed unless the court considers that the breach is a serious one. The Bill also allows the court to disqualify a director; however, the court may only do so where it concludes that the director is not a fit and proper person to manage a corporation. - related party transactions In my view, perhaps the most iniportant provisions in the Bill are the provisions which of deal with related party transactions, such as and how loans to directors and loans between companies in a group. The corporations law is currently almost silent on related party transactions. Certainly, the general duties and fiduciary principles which are reflected in some of the more general provisions in the law do .have relevance in this area. There is also a complex and rather outdated provision which deals with three types of benefits which can be given to directors. But there is nothing which sets. out clearly, and in a coherent fashion, what this Parliament has to say on the matter generally. In particular, there is nothing in the corporations law which says specifically that money should not be given to holding companies without minority shareholders having an opportunity to consider the transaction. There is nothing in the corporations law which says specifically that remuneration for directors must not be unreasonable. There is nothing in the corporations law that says specifically that directors cannot act in concert with others to pillage a company's resources. In all of these respects, areas where investors in so many Australian companies have suffered so badly in recent years, the corporations law is cUl'rently silent. This Bill IDls that void. It will represent this Parliament's view about what ought to have happened in all those cases. It does so in a reasoned and principled way. It does not seek to deal with every conceivable situation and to provide a specific rule for that situation. Many feel that that kind of approach only encourages the search for loopholes. Equally, the Bill does not impose undue compliance costs. Generous exceptions are allowed to the rules in the Bill, and even where the policy of the Bill dictates· that a shareholders meeting should be held to approve a particular transaction or type of transaction, the Bill is concerned to ensure that those meetings can be held in a manner that is as inexpensive as possible; yet still consistent with the need to ensure that shareholders are fully informed. - insolvency reforms In relation t- the m-lti-faceted insolvency reforms, special mention should be made of those relating to companies in financial difficulty. It is often said of our insolvency laws that they are so. inflexible and expensive to use that it is impossible for a company to - eek - o reco.ver throug? an insolvency adminIstration without facmg the likelihood of liquidation. This is because most cUrrent forms of administration suffer from the fatal flaw that individual creditors can disrupt them to the point where they become unworkable. What is really needed, when a basically sound c-mpany faces solvency difficulties, is a capacity for that company to obtain a br.eather. n,us Bill offers that opportunity. Dtrectors Will be able to appoint an administrator, who will have the benefit of a moratorium o- actions against the company while formulatmg a plan of action for consideration by the creditors. The emphasis is on informality and flexibility. The emphasis is also on speed of action. The procedure does not allow the indefinite administrations which can occur, for example, under the United States chapter 11 approach. The emphasis is also on appropriate protection of creditors' interests s- that they will find that they are not unduly disadvantaged by the short moratorium proposed. It has been suggested that, in addition to new voluntary scheme of administration consideration should also be given to a foof insolvency administration that can be readily invoked by unsecured creditors. That is.some-g I.have some sympathy for, and Will examme m the light of the experience with the voluntary scheme. What comeS after the Bill Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, a word about the future. As I have indicated on previous occasions, this Bill, and· the proposed Enhanced Statutory Disclosure Bill will bring to completion a stage of the Government's corporate law program which has been concerned to redress deficiencies in the law which were exposed by the problems of the late 1980s. During this stage of that program, the Government has addressed issues such as the lack of guidance in the law on rdated party transactions, the lack of rigour in application of accounting standards, the lack of ongoing disclosure by listed companies and inflexibility in our insolvency laws. B-t we also need to look forward and to build on the achievements. attained during the life of this Parliament. In particular, we need to forge the odd mix of corporate laws that we have inherited from the cooperative scheme into a streamlined engine for economic progress and development. We need to give Australian business the kind of corporate law that it will need for the twenty-first century. Some months ago, I said that I would be looking to commence a process of simplifying and modernising our corporate law as soon as the current Bills were finalised. That next stage of the Government's corporate law program is about to commence. I know that there are many elements of the· business and professional community that are eager to get started. I know from experience this year that they will make valuable contributions, and they know also from experience this year that the Government will involve them very closely in the process. Conclusion In accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and t?e Northe?I. Ter,ritory on corporate regulathe tion, the Mmtstenal Council for Corporations has been consulted on the Bill and has approved its introduction into Parliament. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and I commend the Bill to the House. Debate- (on motion by Mr Costello) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Mr DutTy and read a first time. ' Second Reading",47
259,Mr DUFFY,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the Trade Practices Act to improve its operation and enhance its role in the building of a competitive Australian economy. The amendments are among the most· significant reforms to the restrictive trade practices provisions since the Act's inception. The Bill provides for a strengthening of the provisions which prohibit anticompetitive mergers, while ensuring that the potential benefits of mergers, including the potential for increased export earnings, are duly considered. Penalties for non-compliance will be increased substantially. The practice of parties giving undertakings to the Trade Practices Commission will be legislatively recognised and provision will be made for the enforcement of such undertakings. The statutory prohibition on unconscionable conduct, which is currently limited to what are essentially consumer transactions, will be extended in modified form to cover commercial trans:"" actions. The Bill also makes minor amendments to clarify the provision which prohibits misuse of market power. The Trade Practices Act was enacted in 1974 under the auspices of the then Attorney-General; Mr Lionel Murphy. It has become a central pillar in the operation of efficient and competitive markets and is a law of which the Australian Labor Party justifiably may be proud. In 1974 the Act revolutionised the way in which Australian business was conducted. It signalled the beginning of the elld for the. old comfortable but inefficient practices such as resale price maintenance and market sharing arrangements. It was one of the most advanced competition laws in the world, and the reforms contained in this Bill will ensure that it remains so. These reforms· will encourage competition and further discourage inefficient or unfair business practices. As the Federal Court has expressed it, the Act deals with 'matters of high public policy' and is 'vital to the presence of free competition and enterprise and a just society'. Part IV, which contains the restrictive trade practices provisiOns, signed to facilitate and promote competition. This is based on the premise that competition will yield the best allocation of economic resources, the lowest prices to consumers, the highest quality of goods and services and the greatest national progress. Conduct which is anti-competitive therefore is seen as contrary to national economic well-being and to the interests of us all as consumers. The amendments highlight the Government's commitment to the preservation and enhancement of competition and complement the continuing process of micro-economic reform. They will help to improve the efficiency and fairness with which Australian business is conducted, thus helping to improve the living standards and quality of life of all Australians. The amendments made by this Bill follow an extensive period of public consultation and debate about how best to update the Trade Practices Act to meet Australia's economic challenges, now and in the future. In particular, the provisions of the Act have been closely examined by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, known as the Griffiths Committee, and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, known as the Cooney Committee. Many of the recommendations made by the Griffiths and Cooney reports are embodied in this Bill. In addition to the present amendments, the Government has announced its intention to introduce a premerger notification scheme, to be the subject of later amendments, and has commissioned an independent inquiry into competition policy in Australia, with special emphasis on areas cUrrently outside the scope of the Act. The development and adjustment of the Act is strong evidence of the Government's determination to achieve business laws which are adapted to the needs of the Australian economy and to the Australian people. I turn now to examine the major provisions of the Bill. Mergers and Acquisitions Merger control is an important element of any law aiming to preserve levels of competition. Mergers can lessen competition, potentially providing increased scope for price rises is deor collusive behaviour and lessening dynamic factors such as the rate of innovation. These possible detriments provide the rationale for government intervention in the area of mergers. On the other hand, mergers can be a valuable source of increased efficiency or other public benefits. Such possible benefits require that a line be drawn between those mergers which are likely to be beneficial and those which are likely to be detrimental to community as a whole. For some time now, debate on the merger provisions .has focused on where the line should most appropriately be drawn between acceptable and potentially unacceptable mergers. In its current form, section 50 prohibits mergers or acquisitions which create or substantially strengthen a position of nance in a market, unless authorised by the Trade Practices Commission. Authorisation is available where there are sufficient public benefits to outweigh the anti-competitive detriments of mergers which would otherwise breach section 50. After much consideration the Government has decided to amend section 50 to prohibit mergers or acquisitions which are likely to substantially lessen competition and which have not been authorised by the Commission. In an Act which seeks to preserve competition it is appropriate that the merger test should focus on the effect on competition in a market rather than on the dominance of a particular firm. The effect of the amendment will be to broaden the range of transactions which can be examined under section 50. This can only be procompetitive. The changed merger test will also apply to section 50A, which deals with certain mergers outside Australia which have an effect on markets within Australia. Merger Test Factors To miilimise possible uncertainty that may be associated with the introduction of the new merger test, this Bill provides for the inclusion in section 50 of a non-exhaustive list of factors to which regard is to be had in determining whether a merger substantially lessens competition. The presence of these f-ctors will help businesses to understand the new test and generally add certainty as to the policy intent underlying the changed merger test. The factors cover a wide range of matters which bear upon the issue of whether a given merger is likely to substantially lessen competition. In particular, the list includes reference to the actual and potential level of import competition in the market. There is to be no the doubt that, where Australian firms seek to merge, regard should be had to the degree to which the conduct of the merged entity is likely to be constrained by overseas competitors. Matters to be Considered in Merger . Authorisations There has been some concern that a more domistringent merger test could impede firms' abilities to achieve the necessary scale to develop export markets or to compete effecti:vely with imported products. To allay these concerns this Bill contains amendments to the merger authorisation· provisions. Section 90 provides that a merger may be authorised if there are sufficient public beneflts. Without limiting the range of public benefits which the Commission and the Trade Practices Tribunal may otherwise examine, these amendments provide that a significant increase in the real value of exports, or a significant substitution of domestic products for imported goods, is to be regarded as a public benefit. The Commission and the Tribunal will also be required to take into account all other relevant matters that relate to the international competitiveness of any Australian industry. These matters' will also be taken into account by the Trade Practices Tribunal in relation to offshore mergers covered by section 50A. I Time Limits for Merger Authorisations New time limits in merger authorisation cases are designed to improve the efficiency with which the Act is administered. The time taken by the Commission to determine applications for authorisation of mergers is to be shortened from 45 days to 30 days, although in particularly complex cases the Commission will be able to extend the period to 45 days. The Tribunal will be required to determine appeals from the Commission in merger authorisation cases within 60 days, although this time limit will not apply if the matter is particularly complex or other special circumstances arise. Current penalties for breaches of the Act ate inadequate. Penalties for the competition provisions in part IV have not been updated since 1974 and penalties fori the consumer protection provisions in part Vhave not been updated since 1986. The deterrent value of the penalties no . longer reflects ;e seriousness with which the Government an the community view corporate misbehavio and there has similarly been judicial comment to this effect. By way of example, in a case involving resale price maintenance the Federal Court said: ... one can only suspect'that the penalties have not been taken very seriously. Their deterrent effect has been insufficient, it appears, to counter-balance profit apparently derived from protecting recommended prices against the effect of competition. . . Where compliance with the Act is dependent on the threat of penalties there is clearly a need to increase the current level of penalties. But, where compliance is achieved efficiently and effectively by other means, the need to increase penalties is not apparent. In the case of secondary boycotts under sections 45D and 45E, no penalties under the Trade Practices Act have ever been imposed by a court or sought by the Minister or the Commission who alone are entitled to seek a pecuniary penalty. Conduct which breaches these provisions is consistently and adequately dealt with by other remedies. Because of this, the Government considers that penalties for breaches of the Act &hould be increased, with the exception of breaches of sections 45D and 45E, for which penalties should be retained at their current levels. This Bill will increase the maximum penalties for breaches of the competition provisions in part IV, with the exception of sections 45D and 45E, to $10m for corporations and $500,000 for individuals. Maximum fines for breaches of the consumer protection provisions in part V will be increased to $200,000 for corporations and $40,000 for individuals. The new maximum levels of penalty have been set having regard to the levels of penalties in other industry legislation such as the maximum $lOm penalty under the Telecommunications Act, and the level· of penalties overseas. The United States and Canada have Penalties maximum fines of $lOm for breach of their competition laws, and fines of up to $A115m have been imposed for offences against European competition law. It is necessary to set maximum penalties at a level which will counter the potential profits to be obtained from conduct which breaches the Act. The new penalties will help to ensure a high level of compliance. It must be stressed, however, that these are maximum penalty levels. The appropriate level of penalty in any particular case remains, as always, a matter to be assessed and set by the court. . Enforceable Undertakings It has proved efficient in some cases for the the Commission to avoid prolonged litigation by accepting undertakings from businesses to cease particular conduct or to take action which will lessen the otherwise undesirable effects of their conduct. This approach has been used in appropriate cases for several years and has avoided considerable cost to both the Commission and the businesses concerned. At the same time the outcomes have been demonstrably advantageous to affected third parties and consumers generally. Recognising the importance and desirability of affording the Commission a flexible approach to the resolution of trade practices matters, the Government has decided to provide legislative recognition of this practice. This will promote a greater public'awareness of the range of options available in the administration and enforcement of the Act. By providing for the enforceability of undertakings, the scheme will remove the need to rely on means outside the Act to enforce undertakings that people have given, should this prove necessary. Unconscionable Conduct A new provision is to be inserted which will prohibit unconscionable conduct not already covered by current section 52A. Section 52A is confined to unconscionable conduct involving goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption, and· is thus generally concerned with consumer transactions. The new provision will prohibit unconscionable conduct by corporations in trade and commerce and thus will extend, but in modified fonn, the prohibition now in section 52A. Unconscionability is a well understood equitable doctrine, the meaning of which has been discussed by the High Court in recent times. It involves a party who suffers from some special disability or is placed in some special situation of disadvantage and an 'unconscionable' taking advantage of that disability or disadvantage by another. The doctrine does not apply simply because one party has made a poor b-gain. In the vast majority of commercial transactions neither party would be likely to be in a position of special disability or special disadvantage, and no question of unconscionable conduct would arise. Nevertheless, unconscionable conduct can occur in commercial transactions and there is no reason why the Trade Practices Act should not recognise this. Both the new provision, which will· be numbered as section 51AA, and existing section 52A, which will be renumbered, are placed in a new part IVA. The new provision will not extend the equitable principles of unconscionability beyond their current limits. The new provision refers to 'conduct that is unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law, from time to time, of the States and Territories'. All transactions covered by the new provision are already covered by the equitable doctrine. The advantages of prohibiting in the Act what is already addressed by equity lie in the availability of remedies under the Act,. the potential involvement of the Commission, including the possibility of representative actions being brought by the Commission in cases where it seeks an injunction, and the educative and .deterrent effect of a legislative prohibition. Minor Amendment to Section 46 Section 46 prohibits a business with a substantial degree of power in a market from taking advantage of that power for certain anti-competitive purposes: eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor; preventing the entry of a person into a market; or deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in a market. There have been some suggestions that the section in its current fonn does not prohibit conduct with a purpose aimed at a class of competitors or persons aimed at competitors generally or persons generally. These amendments remove any such doubt. Financial Impact Statement The amendments which lower the threshold of the merger provisions will require the Commission to examine a somewhat greater number of mergers for anti-competitive effect, and may conceivably require more court actions to enforce the new law. These amendments, in conjunction with the proposed premerger notification scheme, have been estimated to require an additional five staff for the Commission, and additional funding has been allocated for this purpose. Additional resources for the enforcement of the new unconscionable conduct provision which are not capable of advance estimation will be decided on a case by case basis if necessary, if and when the Commission institutes proceedings under the provision. The amendments to the time limits which apply in merger authorisation cases will reduce administrative delays, and thus lessen the costs to business of compliance with the Act. More generally, the amendments made by this Bill will improve the efficiency and fairness with which Australian business is conducted, to the benefit of all Australians. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Bruce Scott) adjourned. DATA-MATCHING PROGRAM . (ASSISTANCE AND TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Dr Blewett, and read a first time. Second Reading",51
260,Dr BLEWETT,TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Data-Matching (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 commenced on 23 January 1991. It provided for the establishment of a DataMatching Agency to match data provided by agencies participating in the data-matching program with a view to detecting incorrect payments of Commonwealth benefits or incorrect provision of certain other Commonwealth services. It also provided for the detection of instances of tax evasion. S'ubsequent amendments clarified that the program could be used also to discover where certain people are not receiving Commonwealth assistance for which they may be qualified. Progress with implementation of the datamatching program has been slower than anticipated in 1990 because of the time it has taken to allot a tax file number to every recipient of Commonwealth assistance, a prerequisite to the full scale operation of the program. Despite this, the program generated savings of $25.3m for the Department of Social Security alone in financial year 199192, and is expected to generate savings of $146.9m for the Department of Social Security in 1992-93. . The Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 provides in section 21 for the cessation of the data-matching program on 22 January 1993. This sunset clause was included to allow a review of the operation of the Act after it had operated for a time. This Bill provides for the repeal of the .sunset clause and the consequent continuation of the data-matching program on an indefinite basis. I believe that experience with the program for the best part of two years has shown that, while for the reason outlined earlier, savings have been less than anticipatvision ed, substantial savings will be generated by the program with, at the same time, strong privacy safeguards applying. The House has had before it since 15 October 1992 a progress report by the Department of Social Security and the Data-Matching Agency, a report required under guideline 12 of the schedule to the Act. That report establishes the case for continuation of the program on cost-benefit grounds. I commend the report to honourable members. This Bill also takes this opportunity to make minor modifications to the datamatching program, assuming that Parliament agrees to repeal the sunset clause. The first modification is an extension of the time allowed for income and payment matching from 24 hours to seven days. This will assist in the· generation of more accurate results. On occasion it has appeared that more accurate results could be. achieved if .preliminary matching results could be tested and the DataMatching Agericy's algorithm changed if necessary to eliminate false positive or false negative results. The Privacy Commissioner has no objection to action such as this extension if it is designed simply to enhance the results. The second minor amendment will alter section 11 of the principal Act Section 11 requires that, in most cases, notice of intended adverse action resulting from a data-matching result must be given to an affected person. He or she then has up to 28 days in which to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken. Commonwealth assistance to the person continues during the show cause period. This amendment would allow an assistance agency to cease providing Commonwealth assistance and to take immediate remedial action where the discrepancy is solely attributable to the agency's own administrative error. This is intended to minimise the total amount of money. to be recovered from the affected person. The Privacy Commissioner supports this amendment. This data-matching program was introduced with a maximum of consultation. It· has operated under the constant and active superof the Privacy Commissioner and his officers. I take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner and his staff for their work on this project. I commend its continuance and refinement to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bruce Scott) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1992 First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Dr Blewett, and read a first time. Second Reading",55
261,Dr BLEWETT,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill introduces the substantial enhancements to the social security system announced in the Budget. It continues this Government's responsible and soundly based social security programs, which continue to deliver support where it is most needed but within Budget parameters. Rate increases in pensions and bendits as a result of indexation will be available two months earlier by advancing the 20 March 1993 indexation to 28 January 1993. This means a maximum rate increase of $6 a fortnight for someone who is single and $5 a fortnight for each member of a couple. This will ensure that the Government's commitment to maintain the basic pension rate at or above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings is sustained. A series of reforms of rent assistance will target those who most need support in the rental market. The fla.t $25 a week rent threshold which applies at present will be replaced with four different thresholds based on family situation and marital status. These thresholds will be indexed to CPI movements. The rate of rent assistance will increase from 50c to 75c for each dollar of rent paid above the threshold, and the maximum rate of rent assistance paid to someone with no partner or dependent children will increase by $2 a week. This will mean an increase in rent assistance of up to $8.50 per week for a single pensioner without children. Existing rent assistance recipients who would be entitled to a lower rent assistance payment as a result of these changes will continue to receive their .current level of rent assistance. A range of measures aimed at carer pensioners reflects the Government's commitment to support these people who fulfil such an important role in our community. Carer pension will now be available to people caring for severely disabled people aged 16 or over who are not pens loners because they cannot meet the full residence requirements. Under current arrangements, payment of carer pension continues while the carer temporarily stops providing care for up to 28 days. This respite period is to be increased to 42 days and carers will not need to remain in Australia during the period. Furthermore, carers will be able to participate in employment, education or training for up to 10 hours per week without affecting their payment. The earnings credit provisions will be extended to them, and the bereavement provisioll$ which apply on the death of the person being cared for will be applicable where the person was not the carer's partner. Mobility allowance assists people with disabilities with the costs of transport if they are engaged in employment or vocational training and are unable to use public transport without substantial assistance. This Bill will index mobility allowance in line with the CPI from 1 January 1993 and will also increase mobility allowance by $10 a fortnight. People who are undertaking Job Search as part of a disability panel activity plan will now have access to mobility allowance, as will people working for at least eight hours a week in a voluntary capacity for charitable, welfare or community organisations. To reduce the pressure on our young people who live away from the family home, a young person under 18 falling within the definition of 'independent young person' will need to have lived away from home for only 18 weeks-rather than the current six months - to attract the higher rate of Job Search allowance or other payments payable in these circumstances. Full time voluntary work is a useful vehicle for unemployed clientsespecially those who are long term unemployed or in particular age groups-to gain work experience, update their skills and make useful employer contacts. The system is being relaxed to allow clients to participate more in voluntary work without affecting their payments. Job Search allowanceredpients for three months or more and aged under 18 will now be able to undertake voluntary work for up to 30 days in a year, rather than the current 20. Recipients aged between 18 and 49 will have a similar concession extended to them. The modified voluntary work rules currently applying to over 55-year-olds, which allows up to 65 days of full time voluntary work in a calendar year without affecting payment, will now apply from age 50. People aged 50 and over on either Job Search or Newstart allowance will benefit from the relaxed reporting requirements which currently apply to the over 55-year-old age group and benefit from the rule for the same age group that the activity test is satisfied if the person earns at least 35 per cent of average weekly earnings from employment entered into on or after 1 January 1990. The Bill introduces several beneficial changes to employment and education entry payments from March 1993. The employment entry payment for disability support pensioners is being increased from $200 to $300, and qualification for it will no longer depend on continuous receipt of payment for at least 12 months. An education entry payment of $100 will be introduced. for disability support pensioners.· Widow B pensioners and sole parents who are special beneficiaries rather than sole parent pensioners because of lack of residence will now also have an employment entry payment and an education entry payment available to them. Permanent Australian residents and holders of certain temporary entry permits who arrive in Australia on or after 1 January 1993 will have to serve a 26-week waiting period before Job Search,Newstart or sickness allowance is paid. For permanent residents, special benefit will be available if they satisfy the hardship test. The new restriction will not apply to people granted permission to enter Australia before the announcement of this measure in the Budget on 18 August 1992, to people entering Australia as the partners of Australian residents of more than 26 weeks standing, for people entering under the refugee, humanitarian and special assistance programs or people who are accepted as refugees under a domestic protection temporary entry permit. A migrant access package will improve services for clients of non-English speaking background. The existing three-tier social security appeals system of internal review, Social Security Appeals Tribunal and Administrative Appeals Tribunal is to be streamlined. People will no longer have access to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal unless they have first gone through the formal internal review mechanism which involves review by an authorised review officer. Several amendments taking effect in March 1993 deal with managed investments as they affect the operation of the income test. The rules governing managed investments will be simplified by removing the categorisation of these investments into accruing return investments and market-linked investments. Income for income test purposes will be calculated by mUltiplying the current value of the investment by its growth rate over the previous 12 months. Any losses assessed on managed investments may be offset against gains during the same period on other managed investments. Offsets will also be available against gains on listed shares and other listed securities from September 1993 when the managed investments rules are extended to listed shares and other listed securities. The income test will take account of growth on the managed investment only for the period during which the investor was a social security client. Superannuation benefits are also dealt with in this Bill. Money in a complying superannuation or roll-over fund will be disregarded for income test purposes until age pension age or until an annuity or pension starts to be paid. Once the person reaches age pension age, the investment will be handled under the managed investment rules. If an annuity or pension becomes payable, the rules on annuities or pensions will apply. If a withdrawal is made before age pension age, that part of the withdrawal representing growth while the investor was receiving pension, benefit or service pension will be assessed as income for 12 months. From royal assent, allocated pensions and other pensions and annuities where the payment can be varied at the recipient's discretion will be subject to the assets test and will be income tested by multiplying the current asset value by the earning rate of the fund. As from April 1993, Commonwealth fringe benefits currently available to pensioners who satisfy the fringe benefit income and assets tests will be available to all pensioners and to long tenn beneficiaries or allowees aged 60 or more. Eligibility for pharmaceutical benefits will be extended to recipients of mobility allowance from March 1993. There are. other initiatives in this Bill in such areas as the maintenance income test, indexation of the parental income threshold, Job Search and sickness allowances for certain lS-year-olds, review of special benefit, remote area allowance and service of notices of decisions under the Act. The Bill will also make some minor and technical amendments to social security and related legislation, including consequential changes arising from the introduction of family payment from 1 January 1993. I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bruce Scott) adjourned. RURAL ADJUSTMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",57
262,Mr CREAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Hotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (5.41 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Rural Adjustment Bill 1992 provides for changes in the rural adjustment scheme. The revised scheme is a cornerstone of the Government's overall rural policy approach for achieving a more sustainable, productive and profitable fann sector. The Government's vision is a farm sector which is able to thrive in a highly variable economic and natural resource environment, without relying on government assistance for survival and growth. The Government sees its role largely as a facilitator of a rural sector that is industry community driven. We will ensure that the operating environment within which farmers' work is conducive to sound business decision making, and that the messages farmers are receiving from us are consistent, with an emphasis on self-reliance and risk management. We will encourage fann business managers to equip themselves with the necessary skills and training to make the most of their opportunities and we will ensure that the Government's rural policies and programs, such as the national drought policy, the income equalisation deposits scheme and the rural adjustment scheme, function in an integrated way and encourage good management practices. This Bill will have, over the remainder of this decade, a significant impact on the development of a stronger, more resilient and more competitive farm sector. It will drive the process of structural adjustment necessary to address the formidable economic and environmental problems facing the sector. In achieving this, the Government recognises the need to balance structural change and social justice. For this. reason, the Bill is complemented by the Farm Household Support Bill 1992 which, in addition to assistance under the rural adjustment scheme, provides the means for farmers with no future prospects in farming to leave with dignity. The Government has taken into account criticisms of the existing rural adjustment scheme, which was introduced in 1988, in making the changes presented in this Bill. The 1988 scheme contained more devolved arrangements than previous rural adjustment schemes. This had the advantage of greater flexibility and it allowed the State rural adjustment authorities to respond to local conditions and local needs. The scheme also provided an avenue to respond to drought and downturn through measures such as the debt reconstruction with interest subsidy and the crop planting scheme. Although this flexibility has· been very valuable and has allowed the Government to respond quickly to the needs of the fann sector as they have arisen, successive amendments to the 1988 scheme have increased the and emphasis on assistance rather than structural adjustment. The changes to the scheme outlined in this Bill will restore a strong structural adjustment focus. They follow a comprehensive review by independent consultants and extensive consultations with the States and the farm sector. The new arrangements will be introduced on 1 January 1993. There will be a focus on improved farm productivity, profitability and sustainability through structural adjustment and more effective management of the farm business. The new scheme will still allow the Government to respond to crises, but in a consistent, structured way rather than through ad hoc policy changes. The provisions for exceptional circumstances will allow us to respond quickly and appropriately to severe downturns without undermining the direction and purpose of the scheme as a whole. It is intended that the rural adjustment scheme should support the commercial financial system rather than act to usurp or compete with commercial institutions. The Government's expectation is that State rural adjustment authorities will work in cooperation with farmers, their financial advisers and financiers, and rural counsellors in the assess- tives. ment of the financial situation of farmers, and in the provision of appropriate financial packages. In nonnal circumstances, eligible farmers will be able to obtain interest rate subsidies up to 50 per cent on commercial finance to enhance the productivity, sustainability and profitability of their businesses. Farmers will also be able to obtain grants to improve their skills and to assist with the cost of obtaining financial, planning and other advice relating to their farm business. Such financial assistance will be funded on the basis of the Commonwealth contributing 90 per cent of the assistance and the States contributing 10 per cent. This funding arrangement will also apply to agreed State administration costs. Where exceptional circumstances such as severe drought or substantial commodity price downturns are found to exist, interest subsidies may be extended beyond 50 per cent, with the Commonwealth and the States sharing the costs of the assistance above 50 per cent equally. In the operation of the scheme, the Commonwealth will provide sufficient funds as working capital to those States which do not have adequate reserves. Thereafter, payment to the States will be on a quarterly acquittals basis. This will ensure greater accountability of Commonwealth funds. As indicated, the States have the important role of administering the scheme and this is appropriate because of their knowledge of their fanners' circumstances and requirements. In their administration, they will need to be aware of the objectives of the rural adjustment scheme as spelt out in this Bill. I will also be negotiating an agreement with the States on the operation of the scheme and they will be required to administer it within policy guidelines that the Commonwealth will develop in consultation with the States. In order to continue to improve the effectiveness of the rural adjustment scheme, the Government believes it is necessary for there to be strategic oversight of the scheme and its operations. This will allow the scheme to be adjusted according to changing circumstances and ensure that it addresses national objecA Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council will be established to provide advice to me on the operations of the scheme from a national and strategic perspective. It will of recommend to me an ongoing three-year strategic plan and a proposed annual program for the rural adjustment scheme. The Council will also provide advice to me on the appropriate level of funding for the scheme and the appropriate level of funding as between States under the scheme. A significant function of the Council will be to provide advice to me, on request, as to whether exceptional circumstances are affecting farmers and whether additional support is required in those circumstances. This would include advice on the types and terms of support which should be provided. In undertaking its functions, the Council will consult with interested parties, including the States. It will be able to establish specialist subcommittees to assist in its work. The Council will be required to submit an annual report to me on its operations. This report is to include information on the operations of the rural adjustment scheme and will be tabled in the Parliament. The Council will consist of up to eight ministerial appointees. The members will include a representative of the National Farmers Federation; a representative of the Commonwealth; at least one representative of the States; and up to three persons selected for their expertise in farm management, financial administration, training, economics and sustainable agriculture. I will consult with the States regarding their representation on the Council. The new rural adjustment scheme will support those farmers with good prospects for long term profitability to increase their productivity and sustainability. In a competitive environment where farmers are faced with the challenge of constantly improving productivity, the Government believes that taxpayers' money is best invested in those farmers who have the capacity to make the most of government financial support and to become inde., pendent of that support within a reasonable time. For those farmers without future prospects in farming, enhanced farm exit provisions will be introduced. These include an increased re-establishment grant of $45,000 under the rural adjustment scheme for eligible farmers who decide to leave the sector. The grant is able subject to an assets test on the sale of their productive assets. The farm household support scheme, which I mentioned earlier, will replace the household support provisions of part C of the existing rural adjustment scheme and will provide support for farmers who are unable to access commercial finance to meet daily family requirements. It is intended that the scheme will be reviewed after four years and will come to an end after eight years. This will provide time for farmers to adjust to the requirements of individual risk management and increased self-reliance which will be the hallmarks of the successful farmer in the 1990s and beyond. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Bruce Scott) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (RURAL ADJUSTMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",59
263,Mr CREAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Hotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (5.51 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill amends several provisions of the current rural adjustment scheme, which was introduced in January 1989. The rural adjustment scheme as it operates at present provides financial support to farmers for a range of purposes, including the purchase of land and equipment, as well as through carry on finance for farmers in short term financial difficulties. All honourable members are well aware that a large number of farmers are suffering from severe and prolonged drought, particularly in the western districts of New South Wales and south-western Queensland. However, the carry on finance available under part B of the avail- current rural adjustment scheme has not proved sufficient to meet the needs of these farmers. With this in mind, the Government allocated $14m in the Budget to support these drought stricken farmers. To enable immediate access to this assistance, the provisions of the rural adjustment scheme agreement have been amended by agreement between the relevant State and Territory Ministers and the Commonwealth. The New South Wales and Queensland Ministers of agriculture have agreed to all three amendments, and as from 1· September 1992 the rural adjustment scheme authorities in each State began assessing applications for this assistance and advancing grants. It is now appropriate to bring these amendments before the Commonwealth Parliament. These amendments to the agreement specify that finance shall be made available so that farmers may acquire livestock, restructure debt, improve productivity and for carry on purposes. Commonwealth funds may be used to pay no more than 75 per cent of interest subsidies, but each State may choose to pay the remaining 25 per cent to provide for a subsidy to cover the wh.ole interest bill of the farmer. On 21 September 1992 I announced a new set of farm adjustment and assistance measures that promote a more productive and profitable farm sector and provide improved assistance to farm families suffering hardship. These measures will be incorporated in the new fUral adjustment scheme which will be introduced on 1 January 1993. The drought assistance measures I have announced today will contribute significantly to the effectiveness of the current rural adjustment scheme and they will reappear in the new rural adjustment scheme in a broader format. Exceptional circumstances, not just drought conditions, will be provided for, removing the need for ad hoc responses to particular circumstances and ensuring that any assistance provided is consistent with the Government's overall rural policy approach. The new rural adjustment scheme will address the pressure exerted by a range of circumstances such as drought, flood and economic downturn that cause particular hardship. This will be done in a consistent manner and one that has been agreed beforehand with State governments. As well as responding to the plight of farmers in New South Wales and Queensland, the assistance provided through these amendments will provide a demonstration of how the new national drought policy will operate, through the rural adjustment scheme. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Bruce Scott) adjourned.

The Government has recognised the problems in the rural sector associated· with structural adjustment and to address these, it has refocussed the rural adjustment scheme on productivity improvement, and long term sustainable profitability. The Gove-ent also recognises that there are a number of farmers who have no long term prospects in farming, and consequently have not been able to obtain commercial carry on finance. Many need support simply to put food on the table. The new farm household support scheme is therefore targeted at providing support to this group of farmers who are unable to access carry on finance and require assistance in meeting the day-today living expenses of the farm family. While the rural adjustment scheme is concerned with the farm as a business enterprise and is focused on productivity and profitability, the farm household support scheme is concerned with the welfare of the family. The Government recognises that, although it has a responsibility to facilitate the adjustment of the farm sector and improve productivity, it also has a responsibility to the people engaged in farming as families and individuals. The Government does not want. to see needy farmers or their families suffer because they miss out on standard welfare payments because of the size of their asset bases. Standard assets tests as applied to other welfare payments are not appropriate for a number of reasons and this is one of the issues addressed by the introduction of farm household support. The new scheme will ensure that the re1992 vised rural adjustment scheme with its sharper adjustment and productivity focus is complemented by a more generous and broader household support component. This means that the support requirements of all farmers will be met. Farm household support replaces the household support provision of part C of the old RAS. The legislation is within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio and will be administered by the Department of Social Security on an agency basis. Administration by DSS has the advantage of a network of established offices throughout rural Australia, at which the fanner will be able to apply for fann household support. To facilitate the smooth operation of the new scheme, farm household support has been designed to be administratively as close as possible to schemes with which DSS officers are already familiar. The fann household support payment will be income tested to ensure that it is targeted at those in genuine financial hardship and a non-fann assets test will also be applied. We have excluded fann assets from the assets test in recognition of the assetrich/income-poor status of many fanners. Our concern with assets is simply to ensure that we are not providing support to families who have significant off-fann assets and are able to support themselves independently. The fann household support scheme will fulfil the family support needs of two groups who are unable to access commercial finance: firstly, those who have taken the decision to leave the sector will receive support while they sell the property; and, secondly, those who believe they have a future in the industry and wish to obtain carry on finance to help them weather a bad patch. In both situations, fann household support will be available as a loan for up to two years. To assist those who take the often difficult decision to leave in that two-year period, the first nine months of fann household support received will be converted to a grant. They may also be eligible for the re-establishment grant through the rural adjustment scheme. Fanners will not need to offer their property for sale in order to receive fann household support. However, special incentives are available for fanners to sell quickly and to leave. We wish to encourage those who cannot exist on their fann without government help to seriously consider leaving farming. To increase the incentive to leave quickly the full nine-month grant is cashed out if the fanner leaves in under that time. That is, fanners who complete the sale of their property within the grant period of nine months will receive the balance of the grant amount as a lump sum. The cash-out will be· provided at the' maximum payable Job Search allowance rate to increase the incentive to sell within the nine-month period. Fanners who do not leave at the end of two years, whether through a return to profitability or reluctance to leave, will not qualify for the grant period and will have to repay all of the farm household support received. Farmers will only be required to submit an application for fann household support with the Department of Social Security every six months, and the rate of fann household support set at that visit will be current until the next six-monthly review. However, the rate will not be set in concrete. Fann household support recipients can seek a reassessment of their entitlement at any time due to changed circumstances, such as a greatly reduced income. Farm household support will be available at the equivalent of the Job Search allowance to which the farmers would be entitled, taking into account their income and off-fann assets. However, as fann household support is a loan after the first nine months, individual fanners will have the flexibility to nominate how much of the allowance, up to this entitlement level, they feel they need or wish to take on as new debt. The Job Search allowance will still be available to fanners and their spouses under the normal and hardship provisions. Some families will find themselves eligible for both schemes and will need to decide whether they wish to access fann household support or Job Search allowance. Fann families who .choose to access Job Search allowance will lose their access to the rural adjustment scheme re-establishment grant once the fanner or his or her spouse has received nine months of Job Search allowance payments. This nine-month period will be calculated from the introduction of the fann household support scheme. With the introduction of fann household support, the modified provisions of the Job Search allowance which were introduced for fanners on 1 December 1991 will no longer be available to new applicants. Those already on modified Job Search allowance will continue to receive their allowance until they are no longer eligible or until the modified Job Search allowance is sunsetted in December 1993. They will have the option of transferring to fann household support. An extensive publicity campaign will be run by my Department in the lead-up to the introduction of fann household support to ensure that fanners are aware of their options and of the implications of selecting fann household support or Job Search allowance or transferring between the two. Current recipients of household assistance under .part C of the old rural adjustment scheme will be transferred automatically to fann household support when it is introduced but they will be treated as a separate category to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by the transfer. In fact, this group will be receiving a bonus three-month grant period over that offered to them under the present part C. If part C recipients wish to access the flexibility under fann household support of detennining the rate at which they wish to be paid, they can opt to transfer to fann household support, in which case they will be treated as new fann household support applicants. Time spent on part C will be subtracted from the two-year period available under fann household support. Pann household support presents the soft edge of the changes to the rural adjustment scheme. It provides a safety net for those fanners who are unable to access commercial finance or rural adjustment scheme support and need help in meeting their daily living expenses. At the same time it does not undermine the achievement of our goal of a productive and sustainable fann sector. Pann household support will provide fanners who have an uncertain future with a breathing space in which to consider their options. If they decide to sell and leave farming there is a generous package of support available, up to $55,000 in grants for fanners eligible for the re-establishment grant. The cost of fann household support will be met from within the forward estimates for the rural adjustment scheme. The combination of fann household support and the rural adjustment scheme ensure that the support needs of all groups of Australian fanners will be met while the sector adjusts to the challenges of improving productivity in the face of declining tenns of trade and corrupt world markets. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mrs Bailey) adjourned.

265,Mr CREAN,INCOME EQUALISATION DEPOSITS,"Hotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (6.07 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends several provisions of the current income equalisation deposit or lED scheme which was introduced in July 1989. These amendments follow a review undertaken by the Government. The Government is encouraging the adoption of sustainable development principles in fann management. This will involve producers improving their financial planning and risk - agement skills; including managing for drought. To assist them, the Government has introduced improvements in its policies and in the links between its policies. These changes include an improved income equalisation deposit scheme. There are also important links with the new rural adjustment scheme, the national drought policy and the national Landcare program. What we doing here is going further down the track of assisting fanners to fend for themselves by building cash reserves. In achieving this, we must equip fanners with the necessary tools. I believe that an attractive lED scheme can go a long way towards assisting and encouraging fanners to build cash reserves for use during downturns. The improved lED scheme, including the new fann management bond, will play a key role in doing this by assisting fanners with their management of finlUlcial risk. The minimum amount that can be deposited in an lED has been reduced from $5,000 to $1,000. This will allow the small to medium fanner to put aside a small amount frequently rather than wait until he or she is able to put together what would be for some, a relatively large amount. It could be regarded as similar to making a deposit in a saving accountmaking a provision for the future. The maximum amount that can be held in IEDs has been increased to $300,000 from $250,000. The figure of $250,000 applied when the current scheme was introduced in July 1989. The increase to $300,000 will enable fanners to maintain deposits in real terms. In the main, the large fanner has the resources to make provision for downturns without Government assistance and, of course, many of them do so. However, deposits of $300,000 will provide a valuable reserve for all fanners. As a further encouragement for fanners to increase their reserves, depositors will be able, if they wish, to reinvest interest earned on deposits. The option to reinvest interest is a standard practice in the commercial sector and I believe that fanners should be able to take advantage of this in respect of IEDs. IEDs are deductible from. taxable primary production income, but are included in taxable income when they are withdrawn. In the current situatio- when funds are withdrawn, a withholding tax of 29 per cent is applied unless the depositor self assesses otherwise. My view is that fanners would, on average, be in a lower tax bracket than 29 per cent as they would be more likely to be withdrawing funds during times of hardship and low incomes. This would, in particular, be the case in respect of fann management bonds as they can only be drawn on in times of hardship. Accordingly, the withholding rate has been reduced to 20 per cent. The withholding tax rate is changed by regulation. As part of the new lED scheme, we have provided for the introduction of fann management bonds, FMBs. These bonds will provide additional encouragement for genuine fanners to build cash reserves for use during contingencies such as drought. Interest is paid on the investment component of the deposit. For ordinary IEDs this is deemed to be 61 per cent. However, for the new FMB the investment component will be 80 per cent. The improved return on FMBs is intended to encourage fanners to build reserves for use during hardship arising from natural events such as drought, fire, flood, et cetera, and hardship arising from significant falls in commodity prices. There is a need to ensure that FMBs are used for the purpose that is intended. In order to achieve this, fanners when applying to withdraw funds from FMBs will have to provide evidence in support of the grounds on which they wish to do so. However, they will still be able to withdraw funds even if the circumstances I have previously mentioned do not apply, but the deposit in respect of the amount they wish to withdraw will be regarded to have been an ordinary lED from the date of deposit. The implications of this are that interest will be paid on 61 per cent and not 80 per cent of the deposit and excess interest paid or reinvested will have to be repaid or deducted from the funds returned to the fanner. In respect of commodity prices, a request for withdrawal must be accompanied by evidence of prices received for sales of commodities comprising the major part of the depositors income for the 'last four years. In detennining whether or not a significant fall in prices has occurred, there is an assumption that unless special circumstances apply, a significant price fall occurs when the average of prices received in the year of application is at least 25 per cent lower than the average of the prices received for the previous three years. However, this will not restrict the evidence, information or the considerations to be taken into account when deciding if a depositor is suffering hardship arising from a significant fall in commodity prices. The existing legislation contains a provision whereby depositors, when requesting a withdrawal on grounds of financial hardship within 12 months of deposit, can appeal against a determination to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This will be extended to determinations made in respect of requestS for withdrawals of FMBs made on the ground of natural events, significant falls in commodity prices and financial hardship caused by other factors. The existing legislation also provides that additional information may be sought within one month of the date of receipt of the request to assist in a decision being taken and this will also be extended to FMBs. There is an additional provision that a decision must be taken within a month of receipt of the further information or within two months of the original request to withdraw, whichever is the sooner, irrespective of whether or not the additional information has been received. In order to correct this anomaly, the provision will be altered so that a decision does not have to be taken until the additional information has been supplied. This will have the effect of preventing an Administrative Appeals Tribunal review taking place before the additional information has been supplied. As I have - lready mentioned, only genuine farmers will be able to make deposits in FMBs. This will mean that only those with taxable non-farm income of less than $50,000 will be able to deposit funds in FMBs. The farm sector faces certain risks that other sectors of the economy are not exposed to and I believe it is. appropriate that farmers be assisted in managing those risks. A limit of $80,000 on the amount that can be deposited in FMBs will be sufficient to allow farmers to do this. Some 3,500 farmers have funds in IEDs. They will be able to directly transfer them into FMBs at any time provided they meet the eligibility requirements of FMBs. This will ensure that existing owners of IEDs are not disadvantaged. The changes to the IED scheme provided for in this Bill are part of an integrated set of policies, including changes to the rural adjustment scheme, the national drought policy, the farm household support scheme and others which the Government has put in place to develop a more resilient, sustainable, self-reliant and internationally competitive rural sector. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mrs Bailey) adjourned. NA MANAGEMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1992 First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Crean, and read a first time. Second Reading",64
266,Mr CREAN,NATURAL RESOURCES,"Hotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (6.18 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to be able to introduce this legislation because the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Bill 1992 will provide a statutory basis to enhance the arrangements for Commonwealth involvement in activities and programs related to natural resources management. The primary objective of this Bill is to encourage the efficient, sustainable and equitable management of the nation's natural resources. The Bill will bring within the one piece of legislation the authority for the Commonwealth to develop integrated approaches to land, water and associated vegetation manageshould ment issues with community groups, the States and Territories and other organisations. In effect, this legislation captures, in many respects, the 'putting into practice' of some central aspects of ecologically sustainable development. The legislation is the means by which the Commonwealth will continue to provide funding for Australia's Landcare groups. The impressive growth of the Landcare movement, with the active support of both farm and conservation groups, is evidence of the increasing acceptance by members of local communities of their role in helping to overcome land degradation and to develop and adopt more sustainable resource management practices. Landcare groups now number over 1,300a dramatic rise from the 76 such groups that existed in 1985. Estimated membership is now over 39,000 or about 30 percent of Australia's farm population. In recent years a growing proportion of Commonwealth funding has gone to support Landcare groups because we have recognised that community based action by resource users is an increasingly important and effective means of dealing with land degradation problems. Since taking up the portfolio, I have met many enthusiastic Landcare group members from around Australia. Last year When concerns were put to me about the diversity and complexity of government programs, and their lack of integration, I decided to merge the Government's land, water and related vegetation programs administered by my Department. I was concerned that individual programs did not recognise sufficiently the linkages between these resources and between the industries and communities that use and depend on them. Accordingly, I circulated in April of this year a discussion paper outlining my proposals for the future direction of natural resource management programs and foreshadowing this legislation. This paper was circulated widely among key stakeholder groups and the comments received indicated wide support for a more integrated approach to natural resource management. The integration of these programs within a sustainable natural resources management package provides another element to the national Landcare program that I established earlier this year with the Minister for the Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to improve access and assessment arrangements and bring a more integrated approach to land, water and vegetation management programs administered by' both of our portfolios. In addition, I have recently obtained the agreement of my State colleagues to amalgamate three ministerial councils, for agriculture, water resources and soil conservation, to bring a more integrated focus to our consideration of policy issues. This Government has demonstrated a major long term commitment to improvement in the management of the nation's natural resources. For example, it has committed $320m to Landcare and related tree planting and remnant vegetation conservation during the Decade of Landcare. In this year's Budget. I obtained $77m for Landcare and related sustainable natural resource management activities, including the Federal water resources assistance program. This legislation will repeal two Acts under which financial assistance for soil conservation and water resource programs has been provided-the Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act 1985 and the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Act 1978. The programs that were conducted under these Acts have made a significant contribution to the national soil conservation effort and improvement to the management of Australia's water resources. In particular, the national soil conservation program introduced by this Government in 1983 has been crucial to the successful growth of the Landcare movement and the bringing together of production and conservation interests to achieve more sustainable land use. Through the Federal water resources assistance program, we have shifted the emphasis from resource development towards resource management, focusing on issues such as more efficient use of water resources, comprehensive flood plain management and improved water quality. This Bill will establish the authority for the Commonwealth to enter into agreements with the States and Territories and members of the Arts, community to pursue activities that can address the major issues, such as land degradation and water quality, that action under these Acts and programs sought previously to independently address. This legislation will allow programs to be developed more in accordance with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. These have been enunciated by the Government, reported on by the ecologically sustainable development working groups and further publicised in the draft ESD national strategy. Agreements under this Bill between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories are to be developed as partnership agreements. These will constitute a formal expression of Commonwealth-State-Territory agreements on a shared list of priority strategic outcomes and on the package of complementary initiatives to achieve them. The agreements will include details of the manner in which assistance will be provided for community Landcare projects in each State or Territory. As well as establishing the objectives and intended outcomes of natural resource management strategies, the agreements will set out the conditions of financial assistance and establish the respective contributions by the partners. These contributions may include commitments to joint funding of activities and contributions in kind, and may extend to commitments to policy reform in areas such as institutional arrangements and resource pricing. The partnership agreements will also establish monitoring, evaluation and review arrangements for agreed strategies. This is a significant aspect of the partnership agreement approach. It ensures strategies and programs of activities are assessed in terms of their effectiveness and against their strategic objectives. It also provides information on which future strategies and activities can be modelled. It is intended that agreements negotiated under this legislation would commence in the 1993-94 financial year with the level of assistance determined in the Budget process for that year. The Bill will also authorise agreements with other persons, bodies, authorities, institutions and organisations that would not be parties to partnership agreements with States but who have the capacity to develop and implement programs and projects to achieve natural resource management objectives. Organisations in this category could include research institutes, the CSIRO and other Commonwealth research bodies and major non-government organisations undertaking projects of national significance. Payments for activities conducted by these agencies are to be made from the Natural Resources Management Fund which will replace the National Soil Conservation Program Fund established under the Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act 1985. This will give the flexibility required to fund activities that for a variety of reasons, including financial or seasonal, do not coincide with the Commonwealth's Budget cycle. The Bill establishes the basic conditions of financial assistance and the means by which the Commonwealth can ensure that financial assistance is used efficiently and for the intended purposes. Further details of financial assistallce and how it is to be provided will be contained in agreements and include details of financial and project reporting and acquittal of advances. The Bill will allow for the establishment of the 'National Landcare Advisory Committee to provide advice on national issues, strategic directions and policy priorities to be addressed in the national Landcare program and provide the means through which community views on Landcare related issues can be provided to government. Membership of the Committee will comprise community and government representatives. It is the intention of both the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories and me, as Ministers responsible for administration of the various components of the national Landcare program, that nongovernment representatives, induding the chairperson, will form the majority of the Committee's membership. This reflects the growing importance of community based action for the successful implementation of many natural resource management and nature conservation programs and initiatives. This arrangement is consistent with the general balance of representation on the State and Territory committees that have been assembled throughout Australia to provide initial assessment of projects for national Landcare program assistance. The intention is for the National Landcare Advisory Committee to be chaired by an independent person with standing in natural resources management or a related field. Other members of the Committee will be drawn from groups involved in or affected by natural resources management and will inelude representatives and individuals from the farming community, conservation organisations, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and other community based representatives with experience in or knowledge of natural resources management and representatives from the three spheres of government. Because of the interest of my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories in the activities of the National Landcare Advisory Committee, I will consult with her on matter- concerning the operation of the Committee. The transitional provisions in the legislation are to ensure that reporting and auditing obligations to the Commonwealth for projects entered into under agreements within the legislation to be repealed are observed. This legislation underlines the Government's continuing commitment to achieving better outcomes from the use of the nation's water, soil and related vegetation resources. It is a demonstration of the Government's commitment to the goals of ecologically sustainable development in trying to better integrate decision making and policies affecting not only Australia's agricultural sector but the natural resources related to that sector. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mrs Bailey) adjourned.",66

268,Mr CREAN,CHEMICALS AMENDMENT BILL,"Hotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (8.01 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the House the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Amendment Bill 1992. The purpose of this Bill is to introduce amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988, which are necessitated by the introduction of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Bill 1992. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 established the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council, the AAVCC, together with that Council's powers and functions. As a next step in implementing a national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals, the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals will be established to take over the powers and functions of the AAVCC. In amending the existing legislation, provision has been made also for the board to encourage the development of uniform national procedures for control-of-use activities and to coordinate a program of compliance; that is, ensuring the products on sale are registered and consistent with the conditions of registration. Both of these initiatives have been agreed to by my State and Territory colleagues. Also, the Bill widens the scope of advice which the Authority may provide on its own initiative or at my request. This will allow the expertise of the board and the Authority to be brought to bear on the major issues facing the agvet chemical industry. The principal amendments of this Bill are therefore to replace the AAVCC with the National Registration Authority. Continuity of operations and policy is assured by declaration that applications, decisions and any other act or things done in 1992 relation to the Council are deemed to have been performed in relation to the National Registration Authority. As provision was made in the Budget for the establishment of the NRA on 1 January 1993 and for Commonwealth funding of a compliance program up to point of retail sale, the Bill will not have any significant impact on government expenditure or revenue. The amendments of this Bill are part of an ongoing program of reform of the regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned.

269,Mr CREAN,AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY,"Hotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (8.04 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. 1t gives me great pleasure to also the House the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Bill 1992. This Bill will establish the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. Honourable members may be aware that since 1967 the inter-governmental arrangements for the clearance and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals have evolved. This led in July 1991 to the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments agreeing to replace the existing eight State and Territory registration bodies with a single national scheme to register agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Since the decision in July 1991, there has been considerable progress in implementing the scheme. Indeed, from 1 July 1992, under an agreement between the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, the Commonwealth has taken over from the States and Territories all the evaluation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals with the States and Northern Territory only undertaking the administrative action of issuing the registration certificates. The establishme-t of the National Registration Authority is the next step in the development of the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals and a clear indication of the Government's commitment to an ongoing program of micro-economic reform of these regulatory arrangements. This Bill establishes an institutional framework for the National Registration Authority. The main features of the Bill are to establish the Authority as a statutory authority and to make provision for a board which will be more widely based than the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council. The Bill provides for the Authority to replace the current Council which, since its establishment in 1988, has established procedures which are widely recognised as professional, impartial and comprehensive. By establishing it as a statutory authority, the Government is providing the Authority with a framework to handle the registration activities in a more flexible, accountable and business-like manner while still maintaining the credibility of the introduce in registration process. I would emphasise that this Bill does not in itself change the arrangements for the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Legislation for the new operational procedures for the national registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals will be introduced as separate legislation in the autumn sittings next year. Establishing the Authority before the main legislation relating to the national registration scheme will allow the board of the Authority to contribute to the development of the legislation it will administer. An extended period of consultation with all stakeholders on the registration arrangements is planned. I now turn to the provisions of the Bill. In regard to its powers and functions, the Authority will take over those of the current Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council as amended by the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Amendment Bill 1992. The Minister will have the power to direct the Authority in exceptional circumstances, but it will be a requirement that such direction be presented to both Houses of parliament and reported in the Authority's annual report. Part 3 of the Bill provides for the Authority to have eight directors. All will be part time and will be chosen to bring the necessary range of expertise to the Authority. Directors will be appointed by the Minister for a term not exceeding three years, but will be eligible for reappointment. Board membership will be drawn from the major stakeholders involved in the regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals including State governments, the agvet chemical industry, the rural sector, the trade union movement and consumer organisations. This reflects the views expressed during the comprehensive consultation process which has preceded development of this Bill that decisions on agricultural and veterinary chemicals should be made by the people affected by them. Part 3 also establishes the basic meeting procedures for the Authority. The Authority may also appoint committees to assist it in discharging its duties. These committees will have such membership as the Authority considers appropriate. A Chief Executive Officer will be appointed by the board to manage the operations of the Authority according to the policies and directions of the board. Over the next four years, the Authority will move to fully recovering its costs from the agvet chemical industry. To provide the board with the maximum flexibility to allow it to operate in a business-like manner and to respond to changing demands, the Bill will give the Authority the power to set the terms and conditions of employment of its staff. Staff may also be employed by arrangements with the Commonwealth, State or Territory administrations. As well as normal provision for an annual report to Parliament, the Authority will be required to submit both a longer term corporate plan and an annual operational plan to the Minister. The Minister may approve or seek a variation to these documents. As provision was made in the 1992-93 Budget for a statutory authority for the registration agricultural and veterinary chemicals to be established on 1 January 1993 and for payments to the States and Northern Territory for a compliance program, this Bill will have no impact on government expenditure. The establishment of the National Registration Authority is the next step in the Commonwealth's ongoing program of microeconomic reform of this important regulatory function. Together with the national registration legislation foreshadowed for the autumn sittings next year, the establishment of the National Registration Authority will result in a process which is more accountable, transparent, open and efficient. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned.

270,Mr CREAN,NATIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY,"Hotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (8.11 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill and its complementary levy Bills is to establish administrative arrangements and more effective and equitable cost recovery for the national residue survey. The national residue survey has a unique role in Australian food production and trade, scientifically monitoring and compiling information on chemical residues in Australian produce. Samples of Australian produced animal arid plant food products are analysed each year for residues of a wide range of contaminants, with meat being the main product monitored. Specific studies on residues in food commodities are also undertaken as the need arises. The national residue survey is planned and managed by the Bureau of Resource Sciences within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, with most of the testing being of carried out by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories on a fee for service basis. Other similar surveys conducted by State and Commonwealth authorities complement the NRS but, because of their differing scopes and more specific purposes, do not necessarily fulfil the important national role that NRS provides. Consumers worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the chemical residue status of the food they eat. While recognising that agricultural and veterinary chemicals ar- needed to produce food efficiently, consumers expect assurances that chemical residues in agricultural products do not pose a health risk. The national residue survey results are accepted widely in Australia and overseas as scientifically authoritative. They indicate the residue status of the food commodities exported from Australia is first class. Residue monitoring is an important part of any strategy to minimise unwanted chemicals in food and underpins Australia's position as a clean food producer. The national residue survey reliably assures consumers and trading partners on the residue status of Australian produce valued at many thousands of millions of dollars each year. Australian meat exports to several countries, including the USA and the European Community, are conditional on the continued availability of NRS results and testing programs to their government authorities. The survey was funded wholly by the Commonwealth until 1987 when the scale of the testing was increased substantially and 60 per cent cost recovery then became applicable. The recovery was effected by way of fees and charges under the export inspection arrangements. The recovery arrangements have either already changed or will change in future. In the interests of sustaining a stable program which meets obligations, it is no longer appropriate to continue using those fees and charges. Separately, the Government has decided that, as producer industries are the main beneficiaries of the survey, cost recovery should apply to the fullest extent possible from 1 July 1993. The National Residue Survey Administration Bill provides for a trust account to be established, which will enable funds and obligations to be carried over beyond the end of the financial year. Payments into the account will mainly be receipts of the levies imposed under the complementary levy Bills. Provision is also made for other contributions to be received from industries, which allows them flexibility in the means of raising the funds other than by way of levy collections. Where desirable, other industry contribution arrangements can be implemented for a particular product, thus obviating the need for collection of any levy. The inclusion of a product within the survey is dependent on funding being available, either by levy or other means. For those products which are required or requested to be included in the survey the levy imposition that Acts allow collection of money to be made in an equitable and simple manner. Authoritative reporting on a range of commodities enhances the status of the survey internationally. However, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, no product will be proposed for inclusion in the survey unless the Minister is satisfied that its inclusion accords with the wishes of the relevant industry. It is recognised that under full cost recovery some industries which were previously included in the survey may wish to be excluded or to adjust the size and scope of their commodity program. Conversely, those industries wishing to have their products included in the survey, but previously lacking a means to fund their inclusion, will in future be given the means to do so. To encourage full participation, the levy arrangements will take into account the different needs and interests of the commodity industries. Under full cost recovery, few payments into the account from parliamentary appropriations under clause 7 (e) are expected. Turning to payments out of the account, there will be a significant change from current procedures·in the administration of the survey. Under clause 8 (a), payments may only occur when the survey program for the year has been approved by the Minister. For the first time, the Minister will be involved formally in approving the program. This additional level of planning will result in improvements in the breadth, scope and operation of the survey. The administrative planning will be assisted by a small non-statutory committee comprising persons with knowledge of chemical contaminants and the needs of the producing industries. The committee's charter will allow for NRS management to be accountable to industries without compromising the independence, authority and credibility of the NRS. The survey Itlanagement will be accountable to the Parliament through the Minister by way of the tabling of an annual report on income and expenditure, which will· include a description of the survey activities undertaken. The ability to carry over the account balance will provide the survey management with the flexibility to reduce problems of over or under recovery. This will enable the programs to proceed smoothly in the face of fluctuations of levy receipts, both within and between seasons. Provision for ongoing program costs will need to be taken into account in annually reviewing and setting the operative levy rates. Increasing the level of cost recovery for the NRS from 60 .percent to 100 per cent, together with increased administrative efficiency, is expected to result in a saving to the Commonwealth of approximately $2.7 million per annum on current costs. Levies for the recovery of survey costs will be imposed under the individual levy Bills that are complementary to the National Residue Survey Administration Bill. As far as practicable, the imposition of the NRS levies is to be in the same fonn and at the same stage of the production and marketing process as other, more substantial, levies collected under the existing provisions of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. These procedures will simplify the payment, collection and administration of the levies and reduce costs. Additionally, an opportunity is provided for direct contributions to be made by industries, subject to satisfactory arrange- first time. ments being agreed upon. This alternative will be of particular value to industries whose products have no levies in existence as yet and need to be included in the NRS to help develop or preserve valuable markets. The schedule to this Bill specifies the maxim- rates of levy that can be imposed on all products shown and operative rates to be in effect at the commencement of the Act.

MUTUAL RECOGNITION BILL 1992 First Reading Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Free, and read a first time. Second Reading",79
289,Mr FREE,NATIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY,"Lindsay-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.44 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Mutual Recognition Bill 1992 is to establish a scheme for the mutual recognition of regulatory standards for goods and occupations adopted in Australia. Mutual recognition is an initiative arising out of the series of meetings of Commonwealth, State and Territory heads of government which have been conducted over the past two years with the objective of achieving better intergovernmental relations to improve the operation of the national economy and the quality and effectiveness of services governments provide. 1992 The principal aim of mutual recognition is to remove artificial barriers to interstate trade in goods and the mobility of labour caUsed by regulatory differences among Australian States and Territories. Mutual recognition is expected to enhance greatly the international competitiveness of the Australian economy and is a major step forward in the achievement of micro-economic reform. It involves a recognition by heads of government that the time has come for Australia to create a truly national market-a goal which the founding fathers of this nation enshrined in the Constitution but which the parochial politics of successive State and Territory governments have frustrated for almost 100 years. At the Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane in October 1990, heads of governrilent agreed to apply mutual recognition of standards in all areas where uniformity was not considered essential to national economic efficiency. Heads of government gave their in-principle support to models of mutual recognition for goods and occupations at the Special Premiers Conference held in Sydney in July 1991, subject to the outcome Qf a national cominunity consultation process. National consultation between July and November 1991 involved the release of a discussion paper entitled The Mutual Recognition of Standards and Regulations in Australia and a series of seminars in each capital city conducted by the Hon. Neville Wran, AC, QC. Input was sought from business, industry, trade unions, the professions, standards setting bodies, consumer and community representatives on any necessary refinements to the mutual recognition models. Some 200 written submissions were received. Results of the consultation process were considered by Premiers and Chief Ministers at their meeting in Adelaide on 21 and 22 November 1991. Whilst there were different views expressed at the seminars and in the submissions, the concept of mutual recognition was widely embraced as a means to overcome regulatory impediments to a national market in goods and services. The majority of submissions did not call for substantial changes to the models, although some expressed a preference for uniformity instead of mutual recognition. On that point, it is important to note that mutual recognition is intended to complement the efforts of regulatory authorities in achievwith ing nationally uniform standards. It will not impede those efforts where it is agreed that uniform national standards are necessary. On the contrary, the agreed scheme includes mechanisms for facilitating their adoption, and I expect that mutual recognition will hasten the successful resolution of such endeavours. On 11 May 1992, heads of government signed a final agreement relating to mutual recognition requesting and empowering the Commonwealth to pass an Act to give effect to the principles of mutual recognition by overriding any State or Territory laws inconsistent with these principles. The agreement requires the States and Territories to use their best endeavours to pass the necessarylegislation by 31 October 1992, and the Commonwealth to use its best endeavours to pass legislation by 1 January 1993. It is an indication of the common sense which underlies the concept of mutual recognition that these proposals have had the clear support of governments of all different political persuasion from the outset. ) Principles The legislation is based on two simple principles. The first is that goods which can be sold lawfully in one State or Territory may be sold freely in any other State or Territory even though the goods may not comply with all the details of regulatory standards in the second State or Territory: if goods are acceptable for sale in one State or Territory, then there is no reason why they should not be sold anywhere in Australia. It was not so long ago that it was virtually impossible to market cooking margarine nationally in one package. Western Australia required margarine to be packed in cube tubs, whereas the familiar round tub was acceptable everywhere else. Under mutual recognition, producers in Australia will have to ensure that their products comply with the laws only in the place of production. If they do so, they will then be free to distribute and sell their products throughout Australia without being subjected to further testing or assessment of their product. This ensures a national market for those products. Similarly, goods manufactured or produced overseas which comply the relevant standards in the jurisdiction through which they are imported will be able to be sold in any jurisdiction. The second principle is that, if a person is registered to carry out an occupation in one State or Territory, then he or she should be able to be registered and carrY on the equivalent occupation in any other State or Territory: If someone is assessed to be good enough to practise a profession or occupation in one State or Territory, then they should be able to do so anywhere in Australia. A person will only need to give notice, including evidence of his home registration, to the relevant registration authority in another jurisdiction to be entitled immediately to commence practice in an equivalent occupation in that second State or Territory. Local registration authorities will be required to accept the judgment of their interstate counterparts of a person's educational qualifications, experience, character or fitness to practise. I stress that the occupations between which a person seeks to move from one State to another have to be substantially the same. The underlying premise for mutual recognition is that the existing regulatory arrangements of each State or Territory generally provide a satisfactory set of standards. Thus, on implementation of mutual recognition, no jurisdiction will be inundated with products that are inherently dangerous, unsafe or unhealthy, nor will there be an influx of inadequately qualified practitioners. Implementation Mechanism The mechanism for itnplementing mutual recognition is an innovative one. The States and Territories have agreed to request and empower the Commonwealth to pass a single Act which, once enacted by the Commonwealth, will override any State or Territory Acts or regulations that are inconsistent with the mutual recognition principles. The States and Territories will effectively cede power to one another through the mechanism of Commonwealth legislation. The additional powers of the Commonwealth will be limited. States and Territories are not granting extensive new powers to regulate goods and occupations. Rather, the Commonwealth is being empowered, to the extent to which such powers are not otherwise iJ.tc1ude- in its legislative powers, to pass a smgle p1ece of legislation which will override inconsistent State and Territory legislation. Amendments to the Commonwealth Act will require unanimous agreement among all participating jurisdictions. Operation of the Scheme The focus· of mutual recognition is on the regulation of goods at the point of sale and on entry by registered persons into equivalent occupations in another State or Territory. Mu-u-l r-?gnition will not affect the ability of Jur1sdichons to regulate the operation of businesses or the conduct of persons registered in an occupation; nor is it intended to affect the registration of bodies corporate. It is also important to note that laws that regulate the manner in which goods are sold, such as laws restricting the sale of certain goods minors, or the manner in which sellers conduct their businesses are explicitly exempted from mutual recognition. For occupations, the legislation is expressed to apply to individuals and occupatiotis' carried on by them. A registered practitioner wishing to practise in another State will be able to notify the local registration authority of his or her intention to seek registration in an equivalent occupation there and provide the required evidence. The local registration authority then has one month to process the application and to make a decision on whether or not to grant registration. Pending registration, the practitioner is' entitled, once the notice is made and all necessary information provided, to commence pra-tice immediately in that occupation, subject to the payment of fees and compliance with various indemnity or insurance requirements in relation to that occupation. No other preconditions can be imposed on the entitlement to commence practice. To avoid costly and lengthy appeals processes in State and Territory courts, the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal will hear appeals against decisions of local registration authorities and will have the power to declare an occupation to be nonequivalent. States and Territories have agreed t? vest the AAT with this additional jurisdichon. In areas where national uniformity may be appropriate, particularly public health and safety and the environment, the intergovernmental agreement provides for a concerned State or Territory to refer a matter relating to a particular good or occupation to the appropriate ministerial council for a decision on whether or not to develop and apply Ii uniform standard. It is expected that, where a ministerial council decides that a uniform standard is - eq-ired in respect of a particular occupation, 1t wlll apply the relevant national competency standards if such standards are available. Heads of government asked that the process of developing such standards be accelerated so that by the time mutual recognition comto mences, national competency standards should be developed for all regulated occupations and professions. In the area of occupational health and safety, heads of government, in the context of mutual recognition, have directed relevant Ministers to achieve uniform occupational health and safety standards and uniform standards in relation to dangerous goods by the end of 1993. The unnecessary costs for producers in accommodating minor differences in regulatory requirements of States and Territories in relation to goods will be removed. Genuine competition across State and Territory borders will be encouraged as a result of producers having more ready access to the Australian market as a whole. Labour mobility will be enhanced with the removal of artificial barriers linked to registrachild tion and licensing laws. As a result, we will be able to make better use of the skills of the labour force. These major improvements in the regulation of the sale of goods and the mobility of labour are expected to enhance greatly the international competitiveness of the Australian economy and represent an important step forward in the achievement of micro-economic reform. Mutual recognition is an outstanding example of what can be achieved when all governments in Australia cooperate and work together in the national interest. The Commonwealth Government would like to acknowledge the positive contribution made by all heads of government in fostering and promoting this important development. 1 present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and commend the Bill to the House. 1 also seek leave to table the international agreement relatingto mutual recognition for the information of honourable members.

290,Mr BALDWIN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Sydney-Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.58 p.m.) - I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 contains the amendments to the child support scheme announced in the Budget, a number of other changes being made to correct some drafting errors, and a number of other improvements in the operational effectiveness of some areas of the legislation. As announced in the Budget, the child support formula is to be changed in cases where one parent has substantial access to a or children who are included in the assessment. A new set of formula percentages are to be inserted in the 'Modified Table of Child Support Percentages' to take account of the change. At present an allowance is available in the formula only if one parent has a child for at least 40 per cent of the nights in the child support year in which case the parents are deemed to be sharing the child equally. A modified formula applies in these cases. The revised formula will recognise a level of shared care to be known as 'substantial access'. This level will arise where a parent has the care of a child for at least 30 per cent and less than 40 per cent of the nights in a child support year. In the example where there is only one child in a family and substantial access is established, the parent with substantial access will be able to make a claim for child support against the other parent who has the major access on the basis they have 35 per cent of the care of the child. The major access person will only be able to claim on the basis of 65 per cent of the care. New formula percentages of 8 per cent and 14 per cent rather than nil and 18 per cent will apply. In the event that the major access person has income below the disregard amount and therefore has no liability to the other parent, the lower child support percentage will still apply in the assessment and provide some relief to the substantial access parent. This measure will apply to all child support assessments raised on and after 1 July 1993. There are two other changes announced in the Budget which will have effect from 1 January 1993 that are included in this Bill. The first is to modify the penalty provisions for unpaid child support to remove the upfront flat rate penalty and to leave the ongoing per annum rate as the only penalty. This is being done to simplify processing of penalty cases and to enable clients to be kept infonned regularly of the penalty balance on their account. The other is to extend to new recipients of additional family payment from 1 January 1993 who receive maintenance under a court order or court registered agreement the same one time option to receive their child support privately and directly without being required to have the liability registered and collected by the Child Support Agency. This option was first made available to DSS recipientS under stage II of the scheme from 1 July this year - I move: A penalty for understating taxable income, in cases where an estimate of current year income is used, is to be introduced for child support assessments that have effect on and after 1 July 1993. The penalty will first in the 1994-95 child support year after a comparison is made between the estimate of taxable income provided in 1993-94 and the actual taxable income returned for that year. The Registrar will allow a tolerance.of 10 per cent to be applied to the difference between the estimate and the actual taxable income before the penalty is imposed. There are also several amendments in this Bill which correct and clarify certain provisions relating to the administrative review of child support assessments. The other changes being introduced are mainly of a machinery nature. One is to widen the grounds for departure from an administrative assessment and another is to give the Registrar greater flexibility in the detennination of a taxable income amount to be used in fonnula assessment cases when one is not readily available from taxation records. Another is to reduce the minimum life of an income estimate from three months to two to allow more flexibility and to allow regulations to be prescribed which outline the effect of income estimates on child support assessments. I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains a more detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (FOREIGN INVESTMENT) BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Baldwin, and read a first time. Second Reading",82
291,Mr BALDWIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Sydney-Minister for.Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.02 p.m.) That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is the Government's third major piece of legislation in its program to refonn the taxation of foreign source income. This arise revised Bill contains the necessary new provisions for inclusion in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to give effect to the Government's approach in relation to the taxation of foreign investment funds. The foreign investment fund measures contained in this Bill will take effect on and from 1 January 1993. The development of this body of tax refonn law, with its many rounds of consultation with affected taxpayers and their advisers, demonstrates this Government's commitment to tackle the hard issues of tax minimisation and deferral opportunities available to Australians through some types of offshore investment, while recognising some taxpayers' legitimate need to invest offshore to achieve portfolio diversification. The precise targeting of the foreign investment fund measures, as contained in this Bill, is the result of extensive consultation over the last 12 months. Numerous responses to the release. of the broad design features of the foreign investment fund measures contained in a Budget press release of August last year, a detailed information paper of April this year and the initial Bill introduced into this·House on 25 June 1992 have contributed to the Bill before honourable members today. In addition, an independent assessment of the initial Bill that was commissioned by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has provided significant input to the final Bill. . I would now like to .discuss briefly the nature of the consultancy and the major tion findings of this assessment contained in the Arnold report and adopted by the Governcoupled ment, as outlined in the Government's reactivity' sponse. Both these papers were released by the Treasurer last month. The brief for the consultancy announced by the Treasurer on 25 June 1992 involved the consultant in discussions with affected taxpayers and their advisers in relation to the implementation of the Government's approach to the taxation of foreign investment funds. was required that the report make recommensource dations on implementation issues, as well how to minimise further tax avoidance opporbiased tunities in this area of offshore investment. The consultant appointed was Professor tralians Brian Arnold of the University of Western Ontario, Canada. Professor Arnold is a well known and respected· expert in the area of international tax law. The Arnold report profits. acknowledged the need for the foreign investment fund measures proposed by this Governoperated ment and endorsed the basic approach taken to implement these necessary measures. The adoption of the bulk of Professor Arnold's recommendations reflected in this Bill is demonstration of this Government's commitpaid. ment to refine the scope of the foreign investgenerally ment fund measures to target areas of tax minimisation and deferral and, where reduce compliance and.administration costs. Before providing a brief background and outline of the foreign investment fund ures contained in this Bill, I would like draw attention to a new exemption from these measures. In cases where only 5 per cent less of a taxpayer's aggregate interests in foreign investment funds would give rise taxation under these measures, because the other 95 per cent or more of the taxpayer's interests are. exempt under another of the exemptions, then the entire interests in investment funds will not be subject to these measures. This exemption recogruses the need for balanced investment portfolios. Taxpayers with minimal investment in 'black list activity' offshore companies and in offshore trusts do not put the revenue at risk and are rightly excluded. The inclusion of an exempfor those taxpayers with balanced investment portfolios in foreign investment funds, with the change to a 'black list approach to provide an exemption for active business companies, as recommended by the Arnold report, has targeted more closely the foreign investment fund measures at offshore investment that provides tax minimisation and deferral. The need for the foreign investment fund measures, as well as the foreign tax credit It system introduced in 1987 and the foreign income measures introduced in 1991, as arose from a tax system that was heavily in favour of investments in low tax countries. The system also encouraged Austo source artificially profits in offshore tax havens and, in cases where Australians could control th- distribution policy of a foreign entity, to defer remittance of The foreign tax credit system which has since the 1987-88 income year replaced the system that gave a general exemption from Australian tax to income that was earned offshore that had been subject to a foreign tax, regardless of the amount of tax The foreign tax credit system provides for foreign income to be subject to Australian tax, with a credit being allowed for possible, any foreign tax paid. The foreign source income measures which took effect from the 1990-91 income year measintroduced an accruals system of taxing to foreign source income. The accruals taxation element of this legislation is directed at or passive income and other fonus of tainted income that is derived in low tax countries by to Australian controlled foreign companies and accumulated offshore, avoiding Australian tax. It also applies to certain non-resident trusts to which Australians have transferred property foreign {)r services for less than full value. The Bill before the House introduces legislation to counter avoidance opportunities that remain after the introduction of the foreign source income measures. These are the cases where a foreign company or trust, although not generally controlled by Australians, is nevertheless an attractive investment vehicle because it allows for the accumulation of income offshore, especially in low tax countries, allowing the investor to minimise and defer Australian tax. Australian residents who have invested in offshore life bonds or other foreign life policies with an investment component will also be subject to the foreign investment fund measures. This new approach to the taxation of foreign source income will ensure. that Australians investing offshore pay their fair share of tax. This Bill will also amend the existing provisions in their application to non-resident trust income. These amendments will supplement the foreign source income provisions in areas where the foreign investment fund measures will not apply. A minor technical amendment to the controlled foreign company measures is also included in this Bill. I will now turn to the more detailed aspects of the Bill. The Foreign Investment Fund Measures Foreign Companies and Foreign Trusts . The foreign investment fund measures will apply to Australian taxpayers who have an interest in a foreign company or a foreign trust. For a foreign company, these will generally be taxpayers who hold shares in the company. Similarly, fora foreign trust, the measures will apply to taxpayers who have an interest in. the corpus or income of. the trust, most commonly units in a unit trust. In designing the foreign investment fund measures, the Government has carefully targeted those non-controlling interests in foreign entities that provide the greatest scope for tax avoidance. The particular focus of the measures is on long term interests in multitiered, offshore investments that enable the deferral of Australian tax through the accumulation of low taxed income offshore. That income is usually converted into concessionally taxed capital gains on the disposal of the interests. The measures include a range of exemptions to ensure that they are properly targeted. Interests held for less than 12 months will in general not be subject to foreign investment fund taxation. In addition, foreign investment fund taxation will not apply in the year of disposal of a taxpayer's entire foreign investment fund interest regardless of how long that interest haS been held. An exception is made in the case of a foreign life policy, which will be taxed until the point of disposal. A small investor exemption applies where an individual taxpayer has offshore investments not exceeding $50,000. The active business exemption will ensure that there is no tax hindrance to portfolio diversification or joint venture participation trust by Australians who wish to invest directly into a foreign company that is principally engaged in active business. These active businesses provide no or little scope for tax minimisation and deferral. The 'black list' of activities not eligible for the exemption currently includes banking, general and life insurance, real estate, financial services, certain investment business and management of funds. However, banking, insurance or real estate conducted in a company that is publicly listed and whose shares are widely held will be exempted . A further exemption will ensure that Australian investors have access to markets where a country prohibits direct investment on its stock exchanges. This is provided by excluding from the measures investments made direct in certain approved country funds in those countries. These measures will not apply to short term visitorS whose stay in Australia does not exceed four years and who have not applied for or been granted permanent residency. Foreign life assurance policies The foreign investment fund measures will also apply to taxpayers who have a life assurance policy where that policy is issued by a non-resident. However, policies that provide life cover only are excluded from the measures. Policies issued before 1 July 1992 which cannot be cancelled, surrendered or redeemed are also excluded if they are not materially altered after that date. Non-resident trusts At the time of introduction of the foreign source income measures, it was recognised by the Government that avenues still remained for the deferral of Australian tax on trust income of foreign trusts. The foreign investment fund measures will address those cases in which trust income is accumulating for the benefit of a resident even though the trust may not be controlled by Australian residents. The Bill will also introduce changes to the method of calculating the beneficiary's share of the income of a non-resident trust for foreign trusts not taxed under the foreign investment fund methods of taxation. These changes will align the taxation treatment of those beneficiaries with the taxation treatment for non-resident trusts that will operate under the foreign investment fund measures. The Bill will make changes to the way the interest charge currently applies to distributions to Australian beneficiaries of accumulatfactured ed income of non-resident trust estates- The principal change will be to exclude from the interest charge distributions made by nonresident public unit trusts. Financial impact The revenue gains of the foreign investment fund measures will generally be realised after the end of the 1992-93 financial year. It is estimated that these measures will yield a revenue of about $90m in the 1993-94 financial year and $200m in the 1994-95 financial year. These estimated revenue figures have been revised to take into account the new commencement date of 1 January 1993 and the recent release of new data on portfolio offshore investment. 1 present the explanatory memorandum for· this Bill. 1 commend the Bill to the House.

292,Mr BALDWIN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Sydney-Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.14 p.m.) - I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) deals with three matters: firstly, the reintroduction of sales tax on swimming pools that are constructed in situ; secondly, a 12-month extension of the exemption from sales tax of ultra high frequency transmitters; and, lastly, those a number of minor amendments to the new sales tax laws due to come into effect on 1 January 1993 to ensure they operate as intended. In situ swimming pools Earlier this year the High Court held that legislation purporting to impose sales tax on swimming pools constructed in situ was of no effect. A result of this decision is that manupools that are goods are subject to sales tax, while no tax is payable on pools constructed in situ. In conjunction with the other Bill in this package, the Sales Tax Imposition (In Situ Pools) Bill, the Bill will remove the inequity by reintroducing sales tax on swimming pool, spa pool and hot tub shells that are constructed in situ. A pool builder or ownerbuilder will be liable for sales tax immediately after construction of an in situ pool shell is completed if, in the case of a builder, the pool contract was entered into on or after 1 January 1993 or, in the case of an ownerbuilder, cOOstruction of the shell commenced on or after 1 January 1993. Ultra high frequency transmitters To ensure that the broadcasting equalisation program is fully implemented, the Bill will extend the availability of the sales tax exemption for UHF transmitters to 1 January 1994. Minor changes The Bill will also effect a number of minor changes needed to bed down the new law. These changes are explained in more detail in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. 1 present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House.

294,Mr BALDWIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Sydney-Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.18 p.m.) - I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. The Bill will introduce many of the measures outlined in the Security in Retirement-Planning for Tomorrow Today statement by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) of 30 June 1992. In that statement the Treasurer outlined how the Government's retirement incomes framework now combines three central tiers. The age pension and social security. system interacts with both compulsory and voluntary superannuation arrangements, with the compulsory tier of the superannuation guarantee charge operating largely through the existing tax assisted arrangements. The statement also reafftrmed the Government's commitment, on grounds of equity and social justice, to assist lower income workers to live better in retirement through a combination of the age pension supplemented with tax assisted superannuation. Several major initiatives were announced·in the statement affecting both the voluntary and compulsory tiers of the superannuation arrangements. These measures will be introduced in this Bill. They will reinforce the existing fundamental features of the Government's retirement incomes policy. Rebate and deduction arrangements for personal superannuation contributions The Bill will replace the existing deduction and rebate arrangements for employees who have employer superannuation support with a new rebate. The new rebate will be simpler and directed to low and middle income employees with employer superannuation support. The rebate will be 10 per cent of personal superannuation contributions of up to $1,000 made to a complying superannuation fund. The maximum rebate begins to be phased out when the contributor's assessable income exceeds $27,000, and is unavailable to people whose assessable income is $31,000 or more. The new rebate is not only simpler but also fairer than the previous arrangements. Eligibility for tax concessions is no longer dependant upon the level or type of employer superannuationsupport received. All taxpayers in equivalent circumstances are treated equally. The Government recognises that the level of rebate is modest and that some employees will face reduced tax concessions on their member contributions. However, employees will benefit significantly from the other tax concessions provided for superannuation. Firstly, rebatable contributions will not be taxed in the superannuation fund. This measure combined with the maintenance of the concessional 15 per cent tax rate on the earnings of superannuation funds will contribute very substantially to the magnitude of end benefits received by employees in retirement. Rebatable contributions will also form part of the contributor's undeducted tions even though the contributor has received a tax concession for them. Secondly, the introduction of the SGC has extended access to the superannuation tax concessions to a wide range of employees. The value of these tax concessions will grow in line with increases in the prescribed minimum rate of the SGC. In this context, the cost to the Commonwealth in terms of revenue forgone in 1993-94 as a result of the introducexpected tion of the SGC is around $400m, in contrast with savings of $230m arising from the changes to the taxation treatment of member contributions. The existing deduction arrangements will continue for employees without employer superannuation support and selfemployed people. The proposed amendment will apply to payments made on or after 1 July 1992. Limits on deductions for superannuation contributions The Bill will implement proposals to limit the amount of deductions available to an employer or self-employed person for contributions to a superannuation fund. The purpose of these amendments is to restrict the amount of superannuation benefits which can be funded in a superannuation fund. These amendments will replace the existing arrangements which restrict funding through the two fund rule and the complex minimum funding standards applying to superannuation funds. From the 1994-95 year, the total amount of deductions available to an employer for contributions to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an employee will be restricted to certain age-based limits. For the 1994-95 the limits will be $9,000 for an employee under 35 years of age; $25,000 for an employee between the ages of 35 and 49; and $62,000 for employees aged 50 and over. However, if an employer has 10 or more employees at all times during the year of income, the employer may elect to use a standard contribution limit. In such cases, the employer's total deductible superannuation contributions will be limited to the amount calculated by multiplying $25,000 by the least number of employees employed at all times contribu- during the year of income. From the 1994-95 year, the maximum deduction a self-employed person can make will be the lesser of $3,000 plus 75 per cent of the amount over $3,000, and the person's age-based limit. The age-based limits and the standard contribution limit will be indexed annually. These measures will also apply from 1 July 1994. Combined with the measure relating to reasonable benefit limits they are to increase revenue by $20m in 1995-96. Reasonable benefit limits The Bill introduces amendments to transfer responsibility for the administration of the reasonable benefit limits from the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to the Commissioner of Taxation from 1 July 1994. The Bill also contains measures to simplify the operation of the RBLs. From 1 July 1994 a person's RBL will be a set dollar amount. For the 1994-95 year the set dollar amounts will be $400,000 for the lump sum RBL and $800,000 for the pension RBL. These set dollar amounts will replace the existing complex calculations based on a person's highest average salary. The amounts will be indexed each year. Transitional measures will ensure that taxpayers who already have accrued benefits that are within the existing RBL but are in excess of the proposed limits will be able to retain their entitlementindexed to AWOTE. These transitional measures will be set out in regulations. The Bill contains a number of other minor RBL simplification measures including the removal of the need to commute the amount of a pension or annuity which exceeds a year, person's RBL. These measures apply from 1 July 1994. Combined with the measures limiting deductions for superannuation contributions they·are expected to increase revenue by $20m in 1995-96. Taxation treatment of redundancy, early retirement and invalidity payments Under the present law, 5 per cent of bona fide redundancy payments, approved early retirement scheme payments and invalidity payments are taxable. There is no limit on the amount of these payments eligible for concessional tax treatment. The Bill will provide a limit on the concessionally taxed amount of bona fide redundancy payments and approved early retirement scheme payments to avoid scope for abuse by people able to manufacture the necessary circumstances. The limits will be $4,000, plus $2,000 per year of completed service with the employer concerned. These amounts will be indexed in later years. Amounts within the limit will be fully exempt from tax. They will be excluded from the definition of eligible termination payment and will not be able to be rolled over. Amounts in excess of the limit will be treated as ordinary ETPs from employers. The Bill will also exempt the whole of an invalidity payment from taxation. However, invalidity payments will continue to form part an ETP and will be able to be rolled over. The Bill also requires the disability of recipient of an invalidity payment to be verified by two legally qualified medical practitioners. This measure will prevent the treatment of redundancy and early retirement scheme payments from being abused, while accommodating the vast majority of genuine arrangements. The proposed amendments apply to payments made on or after 1 July 1994. The proposed limit on bona fide redundancy payments and approved early retirement scheme payments will generate an indeterminate but not significant revenue gain. The exemption from tax of amounts within the limit and invalidity payments will cost $2Om in 1995-96. Rolling over eligible termination payments Under the present law taxpayers can elect the amount of each component of their eligible termination payment they want to rollover. This allows taxpayers who have pre-July 1983 service the ability to avoid much of the tax on the post-June 1983 components of their eligible termination payment. The Bill will remove this tax avoidance loophole. Under the new arrangements taxpayers can continue to elect the amount of their undeducted contributions and concessional components they want to rollover. However, a number of steps will need to be followed to identify the extent to which the amounts rolled over consist of the other components. Because of its anti-avoidance nature and the ease with which this loophole can be used, this measure will apply from 1 July 1992. This measure is expected to result in a small increase to tax revenue. The Bill will also amend the income tax law to remove the current 90 day roll-over period so that benefits must be rolled over directly from the source to the destination fund. The new arrangements will substantially reduce the administrative complexities associated with rollovers. They will also help eliminate the scope for abuse that currently exists. Direct rollovers of benefits will also help to ensure greater amounts remain in the superannuation system by removing the temptation to 'fritter' moneys away during the roll-over period. This measure will apply from the 1 July 1994. It is expected to have an insignificant effect on the revenue. Rebate on superannuation pensions and roll-over annuities Annuities and well designed pensions provide a simple, certain retirement benefit. To improve the attractiveness of pensions and annuities, the Bill will amend the income tax law to replace the existing complex rebate arrangements with a 15 per cent rebate on superannuation pensions paid from taxed superannuation funds and on annuities purchased wholly with rolled over eligible termination payments. The flat 15 per cent rebate will mean that no tax will be payable on rebatable superannuation pensions and annuities under approximately $17,300 in today's dollars. The rebate will apply to the whole amount of the pension or annuity included in assessable income up to the maximum amount allowed under the reasonable benefit limits. The new rebate will apply from 1 July 1994. It is expected to have an indeterminate but not sigIiificant cost in the short term. Longer term costs could be greater if the measure is successful in encouraging greater use of pensions and annuities, with this cost offset by lower age pension outlays. Undeducted Purchase Price The Bill will also limit the undeducted purchase price of rebatable superannuation pensions and rollover annuities to the recipients' post-June 1983 undeducted contributions. This will ensure consistent treatment between superannuation pensions and annuities. The Bill amends the definition of 'eligible termination payment' so that the unused undeducted purchase price of a commuted pension or rollover annuity can be rolled over direct to a rollover fund or to another pension or annuity benefit. These changes will apply from 1 July 1994 and are expected to have an indeterminate effect on the revenue. Pensions and Annuities The Bill will also introduce definitions of 'pension' and 'annuity' into the income tax law to ensure that allocated pensions and allocated annuities receive appropriate tax treatment. This change has no revenue implications. Amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act The Bill also proposes several amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987. The terms 'pension' and 'annuity' will be defined in terms of conditions that income payments must meet to be regarded as tax concessional pensions or annuities. Furthermore, complying funds within the meaning of that Act will be restricted to providing benefits meeting those conditions. Retired people will be given greater freedom of choice in benefit provided by an amendment to allow them to transfer benefits into superannuation funds from other superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, life assurance companies or registered organisations. From 1 July 1994, those people considering rolling over superannuation benefits will be able to require their fund to delay payment of their benefits for up to 90 days. This amendment will complement related tax amendments which will require rollovers to be made directly from the source to the destination fund. With the transfer of the reasonable benefit limit function to the Tax Office, the RBL provisions will be removed from the Act with effect from 1 July 1994. However, transitional arrangements will permit benefits paid up to 30 June 1994 to be processed after that date in accordance with the existing rules. Amendments to the Superannuation· Guarantee Legislation The Bill will also make several amendments to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. The amendtllents will ensure that if an employer's superannuation contribution under an industrial award in place prior to 21 August 1991 is based on the earnings of a standard employee, the earnings of the standard employee can be used to calculate the employer's requisite contribution for SGC purposes. This measure will also apply if an employer's superannuation contributions are made under a law in place prior to 21 August 1991. The Bill also iIicludes an amendment to exclude payments of salary or wages from the SGC where those payments are prescribed in the regulations. A complementary regulation will be made to prescribe certain categories of payments which are alternatives to social security payments. These amendments will apply from 1 July 1992 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the revenue. In addition, some minor technical amendments will be made to clarify issues that have arisen since the commencement of the SGC. These amendments will generally apply from the date of introduction of the amendments. Other Proposals The Treasurer's Security in RetirementPlanning for Tomorrow Today statement foreshadowed other amendments to the taxation laws, including amendments relating to death benefits and overseas superannuation funds. Those amendments are expected to be included in a Bill to be introduced later in these sittings. I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill, and I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Beale) adjourned.

295,Mr BALDWIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Sydney-Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.35 p.m.) - I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It includes measures to implement changes announced in the 1992-93 Budget, as well as changes to the prescribed payments system announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in July. Budget announcements to be given effect by this Bill are changes to tax deduction arrangements for occupational clothing, changes to dividend streaming arrangements, and new arrangements to treat limited partnerBudget ships as companies for tax purposes. Other minor amendments proposed by the Bill relate to the gifts provisions and consequential amendments following the introduction of the family payment advance. 1 turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. Occupational Clothing The Bill will give effect to the Budget decision to deny a tax deduction for expenses incurred in relation to certain corporate unifonns or wardrobes. This measure will ensure that the taxation laws do not confer unfair advantage on some employees by pennitting tax. deductions for clothing which may not be essentially different from that worn to work by other employees for which no deductions are allowed. The effect of the amendment is that em-' ployees will be able to claim tax deductions for expenses incurred in purchasing, cleaning and repairing items that comprise a uniform or corporate wardrobe only where the wearing of such clothing is expressly required by the employer as a condition of employment. Government has decided to target more closely the areas of potential abuse in this area. The Government will not prevent noncompulsory uniforms or wardrobes from being deductible in cases where the clothing is clearly identifiable as a corporate wardrobe. The Treasurer will develop strict guidelines to establish whether non-compulsory uniforms or wardrobes, as sets of clothing, are eligible for taxation deduction. These guidelines, which will be published as soon as possible after this Bill receives royal assent, will prevent the clear cases of abuse of the existing requirements that have come to the Government's attention. The Government proposes to amend the Bill in the committee stage of its passage to give effect to this proposal. It is important to note that the new rules will not operate to deny a deduction for clothing worn to protect employees from injury, or their normal clothing from damage. The savings cannot be estimated at this stage. Because of the changes to the announcements, the Government has decided to postpone the implementation of these measures until 1 July 1993. Dividend Streaming Arrangements The Bill gives effect to the announcement in this year's Budget that the income tax law is to be amended to ensure that the dividend streaming provisions work as intended when applied to international dividend streaming arrangements. The changes affect only those companies that are a party to international an dividend streaming arrangements. The vast majority of companies will not be affected. The amendments will result in a resident company being able to preserve a portion of its available franking credits to be offset against the franking debit that arises under the dividend streaming provisions when a nonresident associate pays a related dividend under the streaming arrangement. This change will apply to franked dividends paid by resident companies on or after the date the Bill receives royal assent and will have an insigThe nificant impact on revenue. Taxation of Limited Partnerships as Companies As announced in the 1992-93 Budget, limited partnerships formed on or after 19 August 1992 will be subject to the same taxation provisions as companies. The proposal is consistent with the Government's equity objectives for the taxation system. The Government has taken measures before to ensure business structures comparable to companies are accorded comparable tax treatment. In 1985, provisions were introduced to ensure public trading trusts were taxed as companies. The previous Government had introduced similar measures in relation to corporate unit trusts. . A limited partnership has more in common with a company than with a conventional partnership. Where partners in a conventional partnership are individually and collectively liable to meet partnership debt and make good partnership losses, the liability of limited partners is limited generally to their investment. Limited partnerships formed prior to 19 August 1992 will be subject to the same taxation provisions as companies from the 1995-96 year of income. Limited partnerships formed prior to 19 August 1992 may continue to be treated as partnerships for taxation purposes until the 1995-96 year of income. If they do not continue to carry on the same business, or if their ownership changes beyond a limited extent, they will be treated as companies for the year of income in which they change and all later years. Limited' partnerships that are subject to the new arrangements will be known as corporate limited partnerships. The new arrangements are likely to have a revenue benefit; however, a reliable estimate cannot be made. TIPs is because in some States legislation authoris- - I move: ing the formation of limited partnerships has been enacted only recently. Prescribed Payments System The Bill also contains the amendments to the prescribed payments system which were announced by the TreasUrer on 1 July 1992. The amendments are designed to reduce the administrative burden on taxpayers, payees and the ATO. The amendments, which will not directly affect the revenue, replace the current monthly reporting arrangements for payers with annual reporting. The amendments proposed will also modify the current arrangements for deduction variation and exemption certificates and approvals to quote reporting exemption numbers. Gifts The gift provisions of the income tax law are being amended to reflect a change in name of the College of Pathologists of Australia to the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. The change will have no impact on revenue. Exemption for incom- tax of family payment advance From 1 January 1993, the recipients of family payment will be able to have the payment made in a lump sum up to six months in advance. This Bill will amend the income tax law to exempt the family payment advance from income tax. As the regular instalments of family payment are already exempt from income tax, there is no cost to revenue. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Beale) adjourned.

The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the rate of Medicare levy as announced in the Budget Statement. For 1993-94 the rate of Medicare levy will be increased by 0.15 percentage points to 1.4 per cent of taxable income. It is proposed to amend the PAYE schedules to take account of the increase in the levy from 1 July 1993. All taxpayers who are liable to pay the levy and who have it deducted in PAYE instalments will be affected from that date. Other taxpayers will be affected on assessment. The benefit to revenue of the increase in the ly levy is estimated to be $300m in 1993-94. The increase will fund outlay measures for health and aged care announced in the BudgStage' et.

297,Mr DUNCAN,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Makin-Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (9.44 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1992 will amend several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio. The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature and makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation. None of the amendments concern major new policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. They are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. However, it is expected that once the amendments to the Judiciary Act 1903 are in place and the Attorney-General's Department has consolidated its existing in-house expertise and made it available to all clients, the amendments will in fact lead to greater accountability and better resource control within the Government. The Bill amends the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 to include in legislation providing for right of review of administrative decisions a requirement that persons affected by such decisions be notified of the decision and of their rights of review. This substantialgives effect to recommendations of the Administrative Review Council in its Report No. 27, Access to Administrative Review One: Notification of Decisions and Rights of Review. The proposal formalises in administrative practices which are in place in major review jurisdictions. It reflects a recognition that a review is of no assistance to a person who does not know that such a right exists. Decisions which are reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are to be subject to the requirement· of notification several stages before review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This includes primary decisions, internal review decisions and decisions offirst tier review tribunals such as the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, Veterans Review Board and Student Assistance Review Tribunal. At each stage of the process, the decision maker will be required to notify the persons concerned of the decision and rights of review. The Bill provides a nuffiber of exemptions to the obligation to notify decisions and rights of review, including where there are provisions in other legislation for notification of decisions and where the decision does not adversely affect a particular. person, such as a decision not to impose a liability or a penalty; an adjustment to the level of periodic payments to a class of persons, for example, following a change to pension levels; and if an enactinent establishes several categories of entitlementS to monetary benefits-a decision that determines a person to be in the most favourable of th-se categories. The operation of the legislation was identified by the Australian Securities Commission as a major problem for its operations. To enable that identification to be examined and proper deCisions on exemptions taken, the Bill provides six months temporary exemption in respect of decisions under the corporations law and after that period exemption will only apply to those decisions under the corporasection tions law that are declared by regulation exempt from the requirements to provide reasons. The purpose of the exceptions avoid unnecessary waste of resources. It is also proposed that the AttorneyAct General be empowered to determine in writrevoke ing a code of practice for the purpose facilitating the operation of the provisions. person must have regard to any such code practice which will be a disallowable instrureasonable ment and therefore subject to the scrutiny the Parliament. The Attorney-General shall table the code which will set out standards relating to the contents of notices of rights review, staging of notifications, use of plain English and similar matters. The abolition of agencies, the introduction of the concept of commercialisation and the reorganisation of agency responsibilities requires amendment of the schedules to the or she sits. Freedom of Information Act 1982 to reflect these changes. Part I of schedule 2 of the lists bodies which are not subject to the and is to be amended to delete bodies which have been abolished. Part II of schedule lists bodies which are exempt for particular documents and is to be amended to delete bodies which have been abolished and to insert other bodies. Part II is also to be amended to delete bodies which are estabamendment lished under legislation which will be includAttorney-General ed in the new part III of schedule 2. Related amendments will be made to section 7 of the neys-General. Act to provide that corporate bodies established under the legislation listed in the new part III will be exempt from the operation of the Act for documents about their competitive commercial activities. Consequential amendments are also to be made to section 16, which provides for transfer of requests for documents, and to section 51C, which provides for transfer of requests for amendment or annotation of personal records. The Commonwealth has established database which will contain data obtained from State and Territory land titles registers. In order to obtain the agreement of the States and Territories to supply this data to the Commonwealth, it is necessary to amend 12 of the Freedom of Information Act to be to protect State and Territory revenue by preventing people obtaining this data comis to paratively cheaply under the Act. Section 58A of the Freedom of Information requires a Minister who decides not to a certificate conclusively determining of that a document is exempt under the Act, A despite a finding by the Administrative of Appeals Tribunal that there do not exist grounds for such a certificate, to of give notice of that decision to the applicant for the document and to provide a copy of that notice to each House of the Parliament. of To ensure that publicity is given to such a notice and that the contents of the notice are available to the public, section 58A is to be amended to require a Minister who decides not to revoke such a certificate to read the notice to the House of parliament in which he Amendments will also be made to the Act Judiciary Act 1903. Subsection 40(1) of that Act Act allows the Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Attorneys-General to seek, 2 as of right, removal of a cause involving a constitutional issue to the High Court. At the time of self-government, the subsection was not amended to give the Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory this right. The of subsection 40(1) will put the of· the Australian Capital Territory on the same footing as other AttorOther amendments to the Judiciary Act deal with the right of lawyers in the Attorney General's Department to appear in Federal, State or Territory courts, and the recovery of the costs of the Department due to the introduction of 'user pays' by the Department. The Australian Government Solicitor is presently authorised to act as solicitor for the a Commonwealth and its officers. For the purpose of so acting, the Australian Government Solicitor is 'entitled to practise as a solicitor in any court and entitled to all the rights and privileges of a solicitor in each State or Territory'. Lawyers from the Office of the Australian Government Solicitor, which is within the Attorney-General's Department, are admitted variously as barristers, solicitors, and barristers and solicitors or legal practitioners-effectively barristers. and solicitors. These lawyers appear regularly in courts and tribunals across Australia, from magistrates courts to the High Court. In jurisdictions which have a fused profession they appear frequently as counsel. These amendments are necessary to ensure that all lawyers of the Attorney-General's legal practice who carry out work of a legal professional nature are subject to rights and privileges, duties and obligations of private sector lawyers, and that they are entitled to charge for their services. The Australian Government Solicitor itself, the Commonwealth's 'legal firm', is to be authorised to practise as a barrister, solicitor or barrister and solicitor. For the purpose of acting for the clients described in subsection 55E(3) of the Act, the Australian Government Solicitor will be entitled to practise in any court and to all the rights and privileges of a barrister, solicitor or barrister and solicitor in each State or Territory. This approach is consistent with the approach of sections 15 and 16 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983. It is necessary also to ensure that the personS who could be regarded as the 'partners of the firm', namely, the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department and persons appointed by the Secretary to act in the name of the Australian Goveriunent Solicitor, have the same rights and privileges as the Australian Government Solicitor. In practice, a deputy secretary-locally designated as the Australian Government Solicitor-the directors of regional offices and office and division heads in the central office of the Department are appointed to act in the name of the Australian Government Solicitor. Similar provision is to be made for other practising lawyers within the Department. As well as giving to those whom the Attorney-General has called the 'partners of the firm' the right to practise as a barrister, solicitor or barrister and solicitor, it is important to ensure that they and the lawyers who work with them observe the duties and obligation which go with those rights. They are thus placed on a similar footing to lawyers in private practice. There are several areas in Attorney General's legal practice in which lawyers give advice and provide other legal services to clients, but in doing so do not act in the name of the Australian Government Solicitor. They also carry out work of a legal professional nature within the Department. These lawyers include: the Chief General Counsel who appears frequently in the High Court for the Commonwealth; lawyers in the Office of General Counsel who advise clients on a range of legal issues; lawyers in the Office of International Law who advise on the legal aspects of treaties and have the conduct of cases on behalf of Australia in the International Court of Justice; lawyers in the Civil Law Division who advise on administrative law, family law, freedom of information, human rights, anti-discrimination law, privacy law and enforcement of overseas judgments; lawyers in the Business Law Division who advise on commercial matters including the corporations law, trade practices law and intellectual property and international trade law; and lawyers in the Criminal and Security Law Division who advise on criminal law, extradition law, mutual assistance in criminal matters and matterS concerning law enforcement and security agencies. As the Attorney-General's Department moves into a user pays system for many of the legal services, it is necessary for the Australian Government Solicitor and the Commonwealth in respect of its lawyers not undertaking legal professional services for the clients of the Australian Government Solicitor to have a legislative basis to charge clients for its services and to recover costs. The amendments will enable this to happen. The proposed amendments will not only enable the Department to develop its current in-house counsel expertise, they will also enable the Department to provide a full range of services to clients and, at the same time, give clients more value for money. Amendments are to be made to the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 in relation to special Federal matters. These are matters arising under Federal law which the Cross-vesting Act requires, save in exceptional cases, to be heard in Federal rather than State courts. These amendments have been considered and approved by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. States and Territories will shortly be enacting complementary amendments to their cross-vesting legislation. The Bill will add to the existing list of special Federal matters the giving of consent by the Family Court under the Family Law Act to step-parent adoption proceedings. As the purpose of obtaining such consent is to ensure that adoption orders do not improperly override custody or access orders made under the Family Law Act, it is appropriate that the Family Court rather than State Supreme courts should detennine such matters. The Bill will also amend the cross-vesting Act to make improvements to the procedure for detennining whether a State or Federal court should hear a proceeding involving a special Federal matter. The amendments to be made by the Bill will ensure that where proceedings involving a special Federal matter come before a State court, that court will have regard to the general policy that special Federal matters be heard by a Federal court. It will only be in exceptional circumstances that a State court will decide not to transfer a special Federal matter to a Federal court. The Bill will make it clear that exceptional circumstances do not include the convenience of the parties. The amendment to section 18 of the Privacy Amendment Act 1990 is necessary to overcome an oversight in the drafting process, as a result of which that section is, in part, meaningless. The schedule will also effect amendments to both the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to provide for a more appropriate and efficient fonn of review of decisions made on complaints. At present, complaints made to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that an act is unlawful under either the Racial Discrimination Act or the Sex Discrimination Act are first investigated by the Race Discrimination Commissioner or Sex Discrimination Commissioner. If the Commissioner decides not to inquire into an alleged unlawful act, there is a right of referral of the complaint to the Commission for inquiry. This is so even in cases where the complaint is stale, frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance or where those aggrieved by the act no longer wish the Commissioner's inquiry to be held. The amendments will replace the present system with a right to have the Commissioner's decision not to inquire reviewed 'on the papers' by the President of the Commission. Decisions by the Commissioner not to inquire into a complaint will still be referable to the Commission for inquiry in cases where the Commissioner's decision is based on a finding that the act, the subject of the complaint, was not unlawful. Further amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act are proposed to implement recommendations of the Commission's report Insurance and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. At present, insurance policies are exempt from the operation of the Act for any sex discrimination in them which is based upon actuarial or statistical data on which it is reasonable to rely and having regard to the data and any other relevant factors. The amendments will remove the catch-all phrase 'and any other relevant factors' as a basis of discrimination in insurance, requiring that sex-differentiated premiums be justified by actuarial or statistical data. The exemption for discrimination in insurance based on such data is to be retained, but will generally apply only where insurers supply or make available the statistical or actuarial data used as a basis for sex-differentiated insurance premiums to persons seeking insurance who request access to that data. The new provisions are balanced by an extension of the power of the Commission under section 44 of the Act to grant administrative exemptions from the prohibition on discrimination. The amendments, which will strengthen the responsiveness and accountability of the insurance industry to clients, are broadly supported by peak insurance bodies. , Subsection 11(1) of the StatutoryDeclarations Act 1959 currently provides that a person who wilfully makes a false statement in a statutory declaration is liable to a fine of $200 or imprisonment for not more than six months where the offence is prosecuted summarily, or four years imprisonment where the offence is prosecuted upon indictment. These penalties have not been amended since 1966 and have therefore fallen behind current criminal law' policy as expressed in the Crimes Act 1914. The proposed amendment to section 11 accords with current criminal law policy. The Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 is also to be amended to remove a typographical error in the heading to section 14. I table the explanatory memorandum for the Bill, and I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. NA",93
298,Mr BEAZLEY,STANDING ORDERS,"by leave-I move: That the following amendments to the standing orders be adopted with effect from 9 November 1992: (1) standing order 101 (Routine of businessThursday) be amended by omitting ""commencing no later than 10 a.m.,""; (2) standing order 102A (Committee and delegation reports) be amended by omitting ""until 10 a.m."", and ' (3) standing order 102C be omitted and the following standing order substituted: Precedence to motions regarding committee and delegation reports I02C. Following the presentation of reports pursuant to standing order 102A, the resumption of proceedings on motions relating to committee and have precedence until 11 a.m. according to the order of priority and times allotted for debate determined by the Selection Committee, each Member speaking for a period not exceeding 10 minutes or any lesser period determined by the Selection Committee. There is not much really to say on this. It adds a degree of flexibility to the early part of private members' business, which was requested of me by those responsible for organising private members' business. It does mean that more time will be allowed, potentially anyway, for the presentation of committee reports. Those reports are enormously important to the effective functioning of this Parliament, and to strictly enforce the provisions that are currently there in the Standing Orders to some extent diminishes their appropriate role.",97
299,Mr SMITH,STANDING ORDERS,"On behalf of the coalition I concur with the motion moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). This matter originated, I understand, from the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), the Chainnan of the Selection Committee. It was dealt with by the Standing Committee on Procedure, of which I note that, you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are a member. The Chainnan of the Procedure Committee has written in terms that the Leader of the House has just mentioned. The central issue being proposed here is that the Procedure Committee is concerned to ensure that committee and delegation reports receive appropriate recognition in the House and that members are given an opportunity to debate the merits of significant reports. This proposal is merely to facilitate that arrangement. It enhances private members day in a positive way, and for that reason this motion will enjoy the support of both sides of the chamber. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA 48A",97
300,Mr BEAZLEY,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDER,"I move: That standing order 48A (adjournment of House) be suspended for the remainder of this period of delegation reports shall sittings. This is a motion with which the House is thoroughly familiar. We have been operating. for most of the last few weeks of sittings under the suspension of this standing order. It permits the House to sit. later than 11 o'clock. That will obviously be required for the remainder of this session, as it has been for the last few weeks. A great deal of legislation has to be considered. At the same time, we do not want to legislate by a process of exhaustion. I would not expect the House to sit much later than 12.30 on any night over the next couple of weeks, but it will probably get pretty close to that every night if the House carries this motion.",97
301,Mr SMITH,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDER,"I will not delay the House on this motion. There is another motion about which I will probably have some more to say. Certainly, we took some steps earlier on to move the time to midnight so that we could deal with the Appropriation Bills in an appropriate fashion to give honourable members an opportunity to debate those matters. We do not have major objections to this at the present time. Question resolved in the affIrmative.

Leave granted. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That, in relation to the proceedings on the following Bills, so much of the standing orders suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of all the Bills: Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1992; Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1992; Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1992; Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992; Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill 1992; Antarctic (Environment Protection) Legislation Amendment Bill 1992; Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1992; Banking Legislation Amendment Bill 1992; Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992; Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1992 Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 1992; Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992; Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Levy Bill 1992; Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Levy Collection Bill 1992; Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1992; DAY Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1992; Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1992; Income Tax (Dividends and Interest Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 1992; Tax Legislation Amendment Bill, and Taxation Laws Amendment (Fringe Benefits Tax Measures) Bill 1992. MrSMITH (Bass-Manager of Opposition Business) (10.07 p.m.)-This isa guillotine motion. It is a proposal to declare urgent a range of Bills. I understand from the Government that some 70-odd Bills will need to be dealt with ultimately under urgency motions. As is the case when these matters come forward generally at this time of the year, the Opposition wants to make the point that what we are seeing again is an abuse of the terms of the House because we are being asked to deal with these Bills under truncated debating be times-very limited times-and many of these matters deserve more consideration· than the Parliament is going to be able to give them. That is why we will oppose this matter when it is finally put. The last time. I had to rise to. my feet to argue about this with the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) on behalf of the Government, in May this year, I said that we had looked at some of the statistics-which are worth citing again-and that in the period from 1976 to 1982 only 17 Bills were declared urgent. In the period from 1983 to 1991,401 Bills were declared urgent-that is, under this Government's administration-but last year, 1991, 101 Bills were declared urgent. The Leader of the House will remember that in May this year a series of Bills was declared urgent under two separate motions, at the beginning of the week and then later in the week. At that time. I pointed out that the legislation that was declared urgent and therefore with a limitation on debate related to the sales tax changes. We felt at that time that it was totally inappropriate to impose the guillotine on those Bills. . There has been a lot of argument over a long period in this place about guillotine motions. I merely point out that more and more Bills are being declared urgent, partly because of the way the Senate treats the legislation following an amendment known as the Macklin amendment. As I understand it, on this occasion that amendment is not going to be imposed, but we are in fact working towards a 30 November cut-off, because the Senate can effectively still require that, if government legislation is not in that chamber by that date, it will not be dealt with by it. I said in May that, be that as it may-and we are in the certain knowledge that we will have that difficulty with the Senate-it is incumbent upon the Government to manage its legislative program far better than it is currently able to. In the approach that the Government is taking tonight we are seeing yet again a failure of its management procedures. The Government has a Cabinet legislative committee that determines its priorities and, if the Government knows it is going to run out of time, it ought to be saying to Ministers, 'Get your material forward far earlier than is currently the case'. Everyone is disadvantaged by the process of legislation by exhaustion; and that is basically how we will end up. None of us relish it. Many honourable members would like to speak on these Bills and will now be denied that opportunity. I again plead with the Minister and the Government to do what they can to alleviate the obvious trend towards declaring Bills urgent and denying the opportunity for them to be debated in detail. The Parliament is becoming a cipher for the Executive. If the Government can rush legislation into this chamber and shoot it out the other end without any debate whatsoever, or with very limited debate, without proper processes for committee consideration, the whole process and reasons for parliament are being undermined. I do not think any of us would want that to be a continuing feature of this Parliament, but I warn the House that we are again heading down that path. There could be other reasons for the Government to be pushing this legislation in this way. Indeed, the speculation that was referred to in the course of debate today about the possibility of elections and so on may itself be an explanation; I do not know. The Minister may want to respond. Certainly, we do not want to see the Parliament treated in this way. There have been some rather bizarre happenings over the last 24 hours which indicate that there may well be an election in the offmg. We do not want this place to become a theatre for the absurd. There was an extraordinary article on the front page of yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald alleging reports by a man called Mr Mackay-Mackay Research-which was subsequently found to be totally false. It was dressed up in the form of comments about the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). That report saw an apology to Mr Mackay tucked away in the newspaper today. But there was no apology to the Leader of the Opposition for the scurrilous way in which that article had been written and put together, attributing it to the wrong person. It was just outrageous.",98
303,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,I thought it was pretty good.,99
304,Mr SMITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"It is interesting that you say you thought it was good because that brings me to my next point. 'The Sydney Morning Herald gave no apology for and did not step back from having given that article the prominence that it did. The first sentence in the letter sent by Mr Mackay to the Leader of the Opposition tells it all: Knowing that you would have seen the totally false report on the front page of this morning's Herald, I want to reassure you that the material attributed to me is not mine.",99
305,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member should confine his remarks to the subject before the Chair.,100
306,Mr SMITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I thank YOti, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was trying to point out that the guillotine may well be imposed because of the prospect of an election. This is but another example of building a scenario for an early election. But there is one other matter connected with this and with the Sydney Morning Herald article that I wish to raise. I refer to the excellent article that appeared the other day in the Australian by Paddy MCGuiness about that celebrated visit by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and two of his minders, Messrs Ryan and Thrnbull, to the meeting with Mr Mulholland, chief of Fairfax. They there pleaded for the continuation of Fairfax independent bureaux here in Canberra. He questions whether there will be a situation where the Fairfax journalists have to turn around and show their appreciation for the intervention of the Prime Minister to save their positions. That is a serious allegation. I also noticed an article in .the Sydney Morning Herald by Tom Burton on 24 the October where a similar point is drawn. One of the outrageous matters referred to there able. was the suggestion by the Prime Minister that the Opposition had promised Mr Conrad Black that he could have 100 per cent ownerHouse) ship in Fairfax. When he was challenged by Mr Mulholland he said that Mr Black had told him. I do not know anything about that. I think it is an outrageous allegation and would totally reject it. Mr Baldwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. What on earth has this to with .the Jilatter·before the House?",100
307,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,--I have already necessarily drawn the attention of the honourable member for Bass to the fact that he needs to address the question before the House. I urge him to establish quickly the relevance of what he saying or move to another subject.,100
308,Mr SMITH,URGENT LEGISLATION,"In debating the matter of and whether or not we should be proceeding with an urgency motion I got on to other matters that I deemed to be urgent. I have certainly strayed from the point and I apologise for that. But I think my point is well made, demonstrated by the need for the intervention by the Minister at the table. I conclude by saying that the Parliament is . again being thrust iIlto a position where it has to consider weighty matters of legislation in a very quick time. That is not something that we relish in this place. It is not something that is necessary if the Government's business is managed properly. It could be tantamount to pre-election moves. Who knows? I hope that the Minister is now able to reject that totally. Certainly, here we go again. The figures indicate that there has been a massive increase in the declaration of urgent Bills. The allocation of time is such that many members will the be denied the opportunity to debate these matters in the chamber, and that is to be regretted. I again say on behalf of the coalition that we do not support this process. This process is not good government; it is not good parliamentary ,practice. I plead with the Government to address the problems of the management of its program, taking account of needs to meet the requirements of the Senate, which I still say are totally unreason",100
309,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"in reply-One of the useful things about debates on the guillotine, which happen with considerable frequency each session, is that it is the one occasion in I the Parliament where we actually talk a bit about how we operate as an institution and whether we are doing things rightly or wrongdo ly. In so far as there is anybody out there at all interested in the fate of this place, and there ought to be-those people will not be listening to it but they might read about it-they will be infonned by what we say to each other in the course of these debates. In the debate we had a bit earlier in is this session in which we dealt with taking a whole lot of material out of sessional orders putting it in the standing orders at the recommendation of one of our parliamentary committees, we managed to put a fair bit on the record as to how we feel about this place and how it functions. There are a number of pressures operating on government now. One is the better organisation of this place in fact, and that to the extent that there is now much greater time permitted for private members' operation in the House. This is a body dominated by the Executive. It must be for government to be able to function. There is a way of avoiding that, of course, and that is to cease to have the Executive operating in Parliament-take it out and effectively operate a presidential system. Then the operations of this place would come to resemble much more those of the Senate, and members of parliament and the public generally would find things very different. But that is not the case here. We operate the Westminster system. We operate the Westminster system in its most brutal form. Basically, we operate it in a Federal system, which is a system based on a constitution, which means that virtually everything that we do at the national level, and for that matter at the State level, must be legislated. The burdens of that system have grown exponentionally on the Commonwealth since the Federal Government was created. That means that in the course of a year we must get through 300-odd pieces of legislation. There is no avoiding that. If we actually go through the legislation, we see that it is not all associated with the fact that we have a fairly hefty social reforming government in operation and have had for the last 10 years, but is also due to the leftovers of previous social reformers. There is a plethora of agricultural legislation on the books which we must replicate every six to 12 months or so, which is a legacy of successive National Party governments over the years. They have left a very substantial legacy of Commonwealth legislative activity. We cannot, try as I might, bind Ministers into producing legislation at exactly the point at which we want it for the simple reason that one of the most effective checks on the Executive-and this would apply whether or not we were in government-is in fact not this Parliament but the back bench of the Government side. There is an obligation to take legislative material thrQugh a number of committee processes at a ministerial level and also at a parliamentary party level. It is no different for us than it is for the is Opposition. If the Opposition were in government, it would experience, as it did in the period it was in government, the same thing. Its back bench operations are not as tough or as diligent in their scrutiny as ours; nevertheless, they exist. Therefore, the Opposition would be obliged to go through exactly the same processes as we are going through here. There is no difference, I do not think-I could stand corrected, give or take the odd half-dozen Bills-between the situation in which we find ourselves this year and that which we have found ourselves in for the last four or five. One cannot, I think, attribute any particular credence or whatever to an argument that perhaps this guillotine owes itself in some way or another to the Government's efforts to complete the program of this entire Parliament in time for a December election. Of course, Prime Ministers call elections when they feel like calling elections. But the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), more than any Prime Minister I can ever remember, has given the clearest indication of his thinking on when an election will be held well in advance. I have yet to hear the Prime Minister say anything other, apart from the normal caveats - it is up to the Prime Minister to choose, and that he has in common with every other Prit;lle Minister-than that he believes there ought to be full value in parliaments. He has said that quite emphatically. Full value in this Parliament means that this Parliament will conclude on 8 May; that will be the last day of the functioning of this Parliament. I would have thought that on that basis one would anticipate that the election would be towards that end of this next six months as opposed to towards this end of the next six months. The speculation about early elections has been generated entirely by Opposition members who, like all members of Parliament, are totally confident that they will not be privy to a decision to call an election. I am in no different position from that of the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), in that regard, and never have been.",100
310,Mr FILING,URGENT LEGISLATION,You've been out door-knocking with him.,102
311,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I have been door-knocking for the last three years, so you cannot take that as much of a· hint of any particular activity. As I said, the Prime Minister has spoken repeatedly about full value in parliaments. So it has come specifically from the Opposition looking for inspired leaks here or there that might indicate something emanating from the Prime Minister's office, and there has been nary a one in the entirety of the last six months. Generally speaking, when oppositions speculate on whether or not elections are about to be called, it is because oppositions are experiencing internal difficulties is a requirement on the Leader of the Opposition to keep the troops in serried ranks all in a row behind him. I hesitate to think that such troubles may be afflicting our opponents at this stage of the year, but I do note around the place one or two of those comments in the nature of an inspired leak. I know this too: when somebody uses expressions such as, 'I am 100 per cent behind him', or, 'They would walk over hot coals for me', we know there is a bit of trouble brewing on the horizon.",102

313,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I happen to be loyal to the Leader. The Parliament and the Party have elected him, so on. we go. Any leader needs to be very careful when somebody behind him says he is in fact 100 per cent behind him, because me thinks he doth protest too much. Mr Baldwin-Or whether they will fit into the second last ditch.",102
314,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Yes, the second last ditch; that is right. That has not come through yet. Perhaps that is a hint as to why we have an incredible, intenninable speculation about early elections from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). He need not fear in any way-andrtor ought the Manager of Opposition Business-that anything that we intend doing with this guillotine proposition has anything whatsoever to do with any election timetable; it is merely the nonnal timetable for concluding business. The honourable member rightly referred to the problems that emerge from Senate cut-off dates. It is true that the Macklin motion is not being replicated this year. More subtle means have been devised to achieve exactly the same end, so we are left with an obligation to finish as much business as we want transacted this year by the end of next week.

NA BILL (No.4) 1992 Second Reading [COGNATE BILL: INCOME TAX (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1992] Debate resumed from 25 June, on motion . by Mr Baldwin: That the Bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Rocher had moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:. ""whilst not opposing the passage of this Bill, the House notes the current high levels of taxation in Australia, and the high compliance costs resulting from the Government's taxation policies"".",102
316,Mr WILSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"We are now debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1992 and the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1992, and I want to deal with certain aspects of the latter. This Bill is one of a series of Bills which has been introduced over a period of time. The Bills bring into legislation some until agreements which have been entered into by this country with other countries based on the desire to avoid double taxation. I want to until draw to the· attention of the House the fact that these Bills have been drafted on the basis of a far too narrow policy parameter. They are based upon the desire to avoid double taxation; they are based upon the desire to prevent tax avoidance. It is my view that this legislation should be drawn far more widely and that the sorts of agreements that we are entering into should be based on more principles than those referred to. They should be based also on a desire by this country to ensure a fair and proper allocation of taxes between the treaty countries, and they should be based upon the principle that a level of certainty trading and investment arrangements is most desirable from the point of view of Australian investors and those who invest in Australia. But for many years the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of the Treasury have simply trotted out the early agreements entered into which date back to 1967 and before. Those early agreements were based upon negotiations which took place between a number of countries. The major group of countries which developed the model tax agreements were the countries in the OECD. But the great majority of countries in the OECD are exporters of capital. We in this country are net importers of capital. We should, therefore, be looking at the agreements to see whether there is a fair and proper allocation of taxes between us, one of the treaty partners, and the countries with whom we are entering into these agreewe ments. The agreements do achieve a measure of double tax avoidance and a measure of prevention of tax avoidance itself. But it my view that they do not achieve a fair and proper allocation of the total taxes which collected by the treaty partners. It is my view that all too often Australians contribute more to the treasuries and exchequers of other countries than other countries in a similar position contribute to Australia's Treasury. One of the difficulties with this sort of agreement is that the taxation of income can be approached on the basis of residence or the basis of the source of the income. The OECD, ill its model agreement, says that primacy of taxation should be on the basis residence. Australia, as a net capital importing country, would get a fairer result if taxation were dealt with from the point of view of the source of the income. It is interesting to note that, whilst most of the OECD countries still apply the OECD model, the United States America has varied the model quite signifishould, cantly to take into account some of the points that I have been making. My concern tonight is to draw the attention of the House and, hopefully, of the Governmatter ment, in the limited time that it might have tax available as a government, to the model agreement that applies. The Government in should review and amend that model agreement and apply an updated agreement more suited to Australia's economic situation, one which is fairer to Australian taxpayers and which gives Australia a fairer share of the tax cake that is divided between our tax office and the tax offices of the treaty countries. It shows a blindness on the part of Australian treasury and tax officials who assume that all that they are to do is stop the double taxation of Australian residents or prevent the double taxation of overseas residents who draw income from Australia. That is a very narrow view of the purpose of a double taxation agreement. The other purpose should be for Australia to stand up and ensure that it collects a fair and proper share of the taxation that can accrue as a as result of these double taxation agreements. We should be asking ourselves, 'Why should give the benefits of a double taxation agreement to prevent the double taxation of foreign residents if all we are doing is inis creasing the share of the cake going to the revenue of the exchequer of the country with are which we have entered into that agreement?' It is my view-and I have said this on far previous occasions-that Australia should claim that it has a primary right to tax all income derived in Australia, that where we use withholding taxes we should set a much higher rate of withholding tax. A rate closer to corporate tax should be the basic rate that on we set. Then we should reduce it from the corporate rate of tax according to whether we are dealing with a treaty country or with a of country that has a tax system somewhat similar to our own, even though we have not entered into a treaty with it or we are dealing with some other country which may, in all the circumstances, be taking considerable advantage of what is today our low withholding tax of regime. The lower rates of withholding tax therefore, be made available only when we are sure that we are getting a fair' share of the tax cake. The other area that is related to this whole is corporate taxation. In the case of corporate taxation, we should be looking to make sure that foreign companies operating in Australia pay, in Australia, tax based on the income that they derive from Australia. To ensure that our revenue is protected and that we get a fair share of that cake, we need to go beyond the books as they appear and look at the real income derived by. foreign companies.",104

The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in the One Nation statement, announced the Government's intention to tax income derived by offshore banking units, or OBUs, from borrowing and lending to nonresidents at a concessional income tax rate of 10 per cent. Of course, as all honourable members are aware, OBUs are currently subject to normal company tax rate on profits arising from their overseas activities, The Government believes that the 10 per cent tax rate will certainly act as an opportunity for these operations to establish and to set in train-in my view at least-an opportunity for Australia to develop as a major financial services centre for the Asia-Pacific region, In fact, measures that the Government is proposing in this legislation will promote the development of this viable offshore banking centre in Australia ·at a time when such activities are likely to be shifted from some other major financial· centres, such as Hong Kong, to elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, for the reason that there is some degree of uncertainty about the future of that particular city, with 1997 looming very quickly. DQring the last couple of months I have had the opportunity to talk with the business community about this particular matter, because I have been pursuing, on behalf of the Government, .the issue of developing Sydney in particular as a financial services centre, but equally, of course, I have been pursuing the opportunity for other major Australian cities to be developed as overseas headquarters for those multinational companies, particularly in the United States and Europe, that might be looking for a regional step-off base to the Asia-Pacific area. The Government has been pushing very strongly for that base to be Australia. A view has been suggested that the Government's intention, signalled as it was in the One Nation statement and now translated into this legislation is, in fact, to give that impetus for regional headquarters to be located iri Australia. Yes, we in Australia enjoy a lot of benefits: the fact that the English language is spoken, and English, in fact, is the international language of business; the fact that there is a stable political environwith ment; the fact that we have an enjoyable lifestyle; the fact that there is vacant office space available; the fact that in many ways, we have a very highly educated community; and the fact that there are skills available, there are legal services and telecommunications and so on. All these make Australia a very attractive location for regional headquarters of multinational companies. The OBU regime is one way in which that is viewed as being a forerunner to something further. . It is interesting that in the last· several months, there has been a great deal of attention turned to this matter by a number of private accountancy firms and the New South Wales Government whereby it has been suggested that whilst this goes part of the way to addressing the issue of regional headquarters, there are other issues in the area of taxation that need to be addressed. This is a matter, of course, which has been subjected' to some degree of controversy. The opposite view is that with this particular legislation and . the decision taken in respect of a major company in the airline industry transferring its reservation system to Australia, there will be no need for this legislation to proceed. It is something which I think is necessary, and I look forward to the support of the committee.",106

321,Mr MARTIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Macarthur-Parliamentary Secretary. to the Minister for Foreign Afairs and Trade) (10.51 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a third. time. I was saying during the committee stage that, this legislation, there is interest in the development of regional headquarters in Australia. In the remaining couple of minutes, I just want to conclude those comments. When we look at the various issues contained that in the OBU legislation, we see that there is a pattern which would have some relevance for multinational companies. There has been extensive consultation with the business community on this legislation. The banking .and finance industries and government instrumentalities have looked at it very closely and very carefully. I know that within the finance industry particularly the view has come forward that,' as part of the overall process of financial deregulation in Australia, this is a matter which has been sorely needed. Together with other legislation which will be debated tomorrow in this place dealing with foreign banks, it reinforces the view taken by the Government that we are at the forefront in opening up our financial markets to the scrutiny of the world and that we are world leaders in that respect. I think that is appropriate because Australia has many advantages. As I have indicated, it has a major finance community here already, and it has an environment, both in an economic and in a social sense, which is conducive to attracting multinational companies. I think that, as a government, in fact as a country, we should be doing all we can. Interestingly, figures that have come to hand in recent days indicate that the employment opportunities that go with attracting regional headquarters to a country such as Australia are quite massive. That is not to say that we do not face some competition; we do. Singapore, obviously, is a major competitor in our region through a variety of tax incentives that are offered there, such as holidays from tax and other similar approaches. It would clearly be important for us to recognise that we have a competitor of considerable strength in our immediate north. But that is not to say that we do not have an equally just claim on endeavouring to establish regional headquarters. As I have indicated, through the OBU legislation contained in this Bill we will move very quickly to assert that Australia does have something to offer. We should get out and actively look for those regional headquarter activities so that we can provide a springboard into Asia We should not only be looking to attract those regional headquarters of. multinational companies from around the world to Australia, we should be maintaining those that are already here so that they do not move offshore to take advantage of what they would see as being a better opportunity somewhere else. Activities are occurring in other countries in Asia, such as Thailand and Malaysia. These countries are looking for ways in which their economies might benefit from having competitive taxation regiIDes and other matters in place which would be attractive to foreign multinationals wanting to establish there. We must equally be on our toes and we must offer a real degree of competition. This legislation is important because it should send appropriate signals into the marketplace as to what the Government's intentions are. As I have indicated, it reduces the income tax rate which is applicable in this case to 10 per cent. There will be an estimated cost to the Government of some $3Om, but if one looks at the employment opportunities and other revenue, I think that this is a reasonable cost.",111

323,Mr MCGAURAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT," Other Opposition members have outlined in detail the Opposition's stance on the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill. In view of this, I would like to use the short time at my disposal to address other aspects of the function and performance of the Australian Taxation OffIce. As we know, the ATO has enormous power to impinge directly on the lives of ordinary Australians. The perceived integrity and credibility of the ATO, therefore, is integral to its ability to meet its charter as a department of state. Consequently, the ATO has a greater than usual responsibility to ensure its practices and activities are carried out transparently and with a clear public interest rationale. This responsibility extends not only to its dealings with the taxpaying population, but also to its own internal practices. Having said this, I would like to bring to the attention of the House a reply to a question on notice I directed to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on 25 February this year regarding various activities of the ATO. Allow me to say, firstly, that I consider the question on notice system to be an important mechanism under the Standing Orders of the House to ensure the proper scrutiny of the Government by the Parliament. Honourable members on both sides of the House place a great deal of effort in utilising the system to advance their own understanding of the relevant ministries and of their policy activities. It ought, therefore, be of concern to those with a wider view of the role of the Executive in the parliamentary process when that system is treated with contempt by the Executive. Consider the response to the question on notice I directed to the Treasurer on 25 February of this year. In the first instance, it took the Treasurer some 10 months to reply to the question. The answer to the question was received on 12 October-a couple of weeks ago. I accept that departments and ministerial offices all have their priorities that work and resources are always stretched to some degree, but a delay of 10 months in responding to a question which did not demand a great deal of information hardly demonstrates a respect by the Treasurer for the Standing Orders of the House. Let me explain to the House the nature of the inquiries I made of the Treasurer and the ATO. On the basis of information brought to my attention, I wished to know what the ATO's policies were in respect of the provision of resources dedicated to counselling ATO staff who had been made redundant or who had been displaced. This was not a fishing expedition. It was not a political to tie up the ATO in some purposeless task for no good reason; it was an inquiry of legitimate interest and concern. It bore directlyon the seeming largess of the ATOin providing public funds for counselling support for staff-an issue of great sensitivity and concern for those who have been pushed onto the unemployment queues and have to make do on the basis of their own resources and private efforts. Specifically I asked the Treasurer the following questions: did the ATO make a payment of $9,900 to the Melbourne based outplacement counselling services firm Davidson and Axmith Pty LtdMr Martin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have been listening very carefully to the contribution of the honourable member, but I raise the question of relevance. The legislation we are dealing with today is concerned with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4). It is fairly specific on measures which have been. introduced into this Parliament, and is particularly concerned with the One Nation statement and dealing with offshore banking units. I respectfully request that the honourable member who is contributing, to the third reading debate should refer to this particular issue.",112
324,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I agree with the honourable member's point of order. The Bill is about an amendment to the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill. I would ask and the honourable member for Gippsland to come back to the subject of the Bill.,113

328,Dr KEMP,OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE,"The Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1992 addresses itself to one part Government's policy for overseas students. It is not the main part; indeed, it is a part diminishing importance. To understand the significance of this piece of legislation, necessary to see it in the perspective of overall policy which the Government has in place in relation to overseas students. While there are many aspects of the Government's education policies which have failed in one significant aspect or another, there is probably no aspect which has been so dramatically mishandled as the policy overseas students. Events of recent weeks, in which 22 private colleges offering courses were suspended for failure to comply with requirements of the Act relating to education services for overseas students and to provide details of the special accounts required by Act, show that there are still significant problems in this area. There is considerable discretion within the Act for the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) to decide on appropriate action in this area. Such a signifipoint cant number of suspensions inevitably raises the question whether the Department of Employment, Education and Training has acted in the most appropriate manner, and whether it has done all in its power to ensure that colleges have been fully informed of their obligations under the Act and, where necesthey sary, assisted to comply with the Act. Whethpaying er the suspensions were justified or not time will tell. There is no doubt that they are good news for Australia's already tarnished reputation overseas; a reputation tarnished the Government's previous appalling mismanthat agement in this area of policy. It is vital that policy in this sensitive area should be handled in a way which builds Australia's reputation as a source of education and training of international standard. There is potentially a very large demand within the Asia-Pacific region, in particular for the kinds of skills training and higher education which Australia has traditionally offered. Australia has the capacity to be a significant international supplier of education services, and as such a substantial contributor to the development of the economies and the deof the mocracies of the region. The overseas student charge is applied to of students studying in this country under the subsidised student program, which is now it is being phased out. This program ceased to the enrol students from 31 December 1989. Since that time the overseas students program has essentially been a full fee paying program. The student charge on the remaining students in the subsidised program, of whom there are some 1,400 still studying in Australia, is the mechanism by which these students contribute on to the cost of the places they occupy. As the number of subsidised students has declined, the number of fee paying students the has increased. Since 1985 the number of fee paying international students has increased to almost 50,000 per annum. Some 17,000 of the these occupy full fee places in Australian universities; places which are denied to Australian students under the Government's policies. Let me make it clear that the coalition welcomes overseas students to Australia. The that I have just made in no way implies that there are too many overseas students in this country. On the contrary, there are too few. Overseas students do not take places from Australian students. Indeed, the fees that they pay enable better provision by universities for all students. The justified demands feel entitled to make because they are fee have been a valuable pressure within the universities for· innovation to meet the not needs of an important group of students. My comment that access to these places is by denied to Australian students simply means it is the view of the coalition that Australian students are entitled to the same access to universities in this country as .are overseas students. The failure of the Government to provide this access is inexcusable. I shall have more to say about this later in my remarks. At present, Australia's share of the international education and training market is less than 2 per cent. Given the r-lative strength and potential of Australia's providers and Australia's comparative advantages, 5 per cent would seem to be a much more appropriate share. The global market for higher education students alone is some 1.2 million students, of whom some 350,000 study in the United States. By contrast, some 22,000 only are currently enrolled in Australian universities and in colleges of technical and further education. There is plainly enormous potential here. There are serious and legitimate questions to be asked as to why Australia is not being more successful in attracting students to this country, particularly given the long history of tertiary education that we have. After all, Australia does have a number of comparative advantages in exporting education services, if I can use that term, to the Asia-Pacific region. These advantages include: environmental amenity, the English language, a similar time zone to many Asian countries facilitating easy home communication, geographical proximity, and facilities for pursuing cultural and religious activities. Australian costs for many, but not all, courses have been lower than those in competitor countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, though recent trends show some slippage in this regard. There is no doubt that in recent years the attractiveness of Australia as a country in which to study has been damaged by the fiasco accompanying the introduction of the fee paying overseas student scheme; the scheme which replaced the subsidised student scheme to which this Bill relates. Australia was unfortunate that at this critical moment in the development of its policy for overseas students, the Minister responsible was none other than the present Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). This Minister is known as a person who lives by the bright idea but who has very little interest in following it up to the boring stage of implementation. Unfortunately for Australia, and for the Australian taxpayer, the then Minister got it into his head that if he pumped up the education export industry very rapidly, he could build his reputation as the man who solved-or contributed to solvingAustralia's balance of payments problem. The notion that the present Treasurer is likely to make any contribution to solving the balance of payments problem is an improbable one. Years later, the balance of payments remains a major issue of economic management. The Government's general failure to introduce the essential economic industry and taxation reforms which this country needs has ensured that this problem is not solved. Nevertheless, the Minister thought that something might be gained by forcing the pace in the development of education exports. Unsuspecting providers in the private sector had their arms twisted to get out and sell, and to rapidly build up their facilities to take the large numbers of students anticipated. The Chinese students especially were seen by the Government as a very promising market and, as a result of government pushing, Chinese students applied in their thousands and eventually in their tens of thousands. There was just one fly in the ointment. Evidence rapidly accumulated that many of these so-called students in fact saw the scheme as a backdoor means of immigrating to Australia. Their attendance at courses in Australia once they had arrived was sporadic, to say the least. While there were some criminal elements which took advantage of the arrangements, most of these students became innocent victims of a government policy which, from their point of view, simply looked too good to be true. Eventually, of course, the inevitable happened. The Government pulled the plug. Realising that the scheme had turned into an enormous rort, and with a mounting war going on between the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, thousands of Chinese students who had prepaid their fees ahead to the colleges of their choice were suddenly denied visas to enter Australia. Unfortunately for them, many of the colleges had used the prepaid fees to build new facilities, and the money was no longer available for repayment. The sudden halt in the flow of money in turn l-ft many providers, who had gone into debt to finance the expansion, in an untenable position. A number went out of business, throwing the students out onto the street. :At the same time as this was occurring, China was racked by the tragic events in Tiananmen Square. The then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, had developed a fantasy concept of Australia's relations with China. In one of those emotional moments for which he will long be remembered, he decided to treat all the Chinese students in Australia at the time as refugees. Australian immigration control effectively broke down and some 20,000 Chinese students were placed in an invidious and uncertain position which has persisted to the present day and for which my colleague the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), has consistently recommended an appropriate approach, which the Government has refused to take. As one would expect, the effect of these and sorry events has been quite damaging to Australia's reputation as a provider of education to the region. The Australian taxpayer has been presented with a bill for some $65m to repay the students who had sent their fees ahead and then were refused eptry. The private providers have been attacked and denigrated by the Government in a frantic and counterproductive search for scapegoats. Australia's reputation has been damaged among many of the students who have come, paid their fees and undertaken their courses good faith, by the dominance of the obvious commercial motivation with which the Government has pursued its policy. Students rightly resent being treated as fodder for the balance of payments. They believe that they have something which it is worthwhile to bring to this country from their own culture and experience and that they should be treated as guests and not just as clients in this country. In these concerns they are undoubtedly right. It used to be a matter of pride for Australia to welcome as students, under schemes such as the Columbo plan, many who later returned to their home countries and became leaders. Australia was the beneficiary of their time here in a very real sense. Likewise, universities today which have offered places to overseas students frequently report that these students add considerably to the educational experience of Australian students and that these students are frequently amongst the brightest and the best. Putting Australia's policy for overseas students on a sound footing requires that the whole culture and climate surrounding the visits to this country of these students should be reviewed. The Minister's response to the fiasco was twofold. The first step was to tell all the world that the fault lay not with his policy and its mismanagement but with the private providers. The second was .to introduce a draconian piece of legislation which, had it been enacted, would have damaged further Australia's capacity to provide effective education for overseas students. This legislation was brought forward without any consultation with the industry and was condemned sad in hearings before th- Senate. It suffered some 18 amendments before finally being passed in a form which was acceptable to the industry. The aim of this legislation was to assure students that' their prepaid fees were in protected accounts and that, if the college failed or the students did not receive a visa, the funds would be available for repayment. It offered no protection against mismanagement of colleges; rather, it offered the Government protection against futrire claims by students in resulting from further U-turns and flip-flops in Government policy. The main aim of this legislation was to enable the Government to tell the markets to our north that the losses suffered by students would not be repeated. Any piece of legislation such as this is only as effective in achieving such reassurance as the quality of its administration. It is this legislation which has recently been applied to suspend 22 colleges. Time will show whether lhis is an effective step towards achieving the objectives of the legislation or simply another happening in the chain of events emanating from this Government which continue to damage our reputation abroad. The .Industry Commission, in its report entitled Exports of Education Services, has drawn attention to one of the major reasons why Australia has failed to attract the number of students to this country which it is capable of attracting-that is, the overregulation of the higher education system. Last year the Commission urged the Government to move swiftly to alter current arrangements and remove impediments standing in the way of universities accepting the number of students which they might well be able to. The Commission recommended that universities not exclude acceptable overseas students for whom they have a capacity to cater. Under current policy, they are excluding such students. The report identified impediments to the growth of education and training exports arising not only from the structural inefficiency affecting domestic education but also from the inappropriate immigration regulations and unsatisfactory marketing of Australian education. overseas. It noted in its overview that problems had arisen on two main fronts: one concerning the issue of immigration; the other being structural impediments. According to the report: . . . a dynamic market oriented export sector uneasily within the existing highly regulated education system. The Industry Commission suggested that regulation in the area of immigration may now have become unnecessarily rigid and too strict, with the need to strike a balance between the need to minimise costs of excessive illegal immigration and the need to minimise the intensity of checks on student applications so as to discourage as few genuine students as possible. This regulation has developed in an environment which has traditionally seen government as a quasi-monopolistic supplier of services without consideration as to better and more efficient ways of achieving these goals. The provision of education services in this country takes place within a highly regulated environment. This overregulation by government directly through the policies of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and through the industrial relations arrangements which have been imposed on institutions in many cases deprives institutions of their ability to cater effectively for the needs of Australian students, let alone to provide opportunities for overseas students. Labor's attempt at central planning of higher education is obviously a major obstacle to the development of world-class education for domestic students and for the international provision of services.. While a system of regulation based on rigid price controls, the rationing of places to domestic students, the centralised control of institutional profiles and nationally uniform staff conditions remains in place, serious shortages of places, academic staff and resources will persist. Australia will remain hamstrung in its efforts to compete internationally. Overseas students are required to reach entry standards at least as high as those of domestic students. The report said: The number and allocation between disciplines of places for Australian students is rationed under current government policies and the Government does not permit Australians who miss out to purchase a place. Together these policies mean that there is a de facto limit on the number of places available for overseas students. sits That is the conclusion of the Industry Commission. Universities are rejecting suitable overseas students because of the equity concerns over similarly placed Australian students. The size of the sector is being artificially limited. At a time of rising demand for tertiary places, such as in a weaker employment market-as we have at present-there is a tendency within this regulated system for tertiary entrance scores to rise if an equal number of new places is not provided by the Government to match the demand. This is happening. As demand rises, places to domestic students are increasingly .awarded only to students with higher and higher entry scoresa situation that, according to the Industry Commission and to the logic of the administration of the system, also acts to restrict overseas student entry to those students who have similarly high scores. In other words, as the demand rises in Australia, paradoxically the number of overseas students who can be admitted declines, even though these students are paying the full cost of places. As the Commission points out, this system is creating a significant potential loss of education exports, and overseas students are being driven to seek their education in other countries. The Industry Commission also found it anomalous that a market oriented export industry was grafted onto a highly regulated domestic sector. It reached a very important conclusion which exposes the underlying cause of many of the major problems that are being faced in this area, both domestically and internationally. This is the conclusion of the Governmenes most expert advisory body: The current· arrangements for funding higher education for domestic students are flawed. Without a mechanism which takes account of the costs and value to society and to the student of education services, decisions by government and institutions as to how many places there are and how they are allocated will very likely be wrong. The Government received that advice. It received advice that it should act urgently to change the situation well over 12 months ago. Of course, there has been no constructive response by the Government at all, despite the fact that the system is showing every sign of breaking down-a huge unmet demand, an inability to recruit appropriately qualified staff, continuing overcrowding and a declining and deteriorating basic infrastructure. All of these problems arise because we have an effort to lock higher education in this country into an entirely inappropriate funding and regulatory framework. Those are not the words of the Opposition; they· are the words of the Government's most expert advisers, yet nothing is done to correct the situation. Instead we now have ad hoc adjustments made, it seems almost on a weekly basis, as the Government in panic tries to show the public that it is responding to the problem of unmet demand. Yet this problem lies at the very heart of Why the ability of Australian institutions to admit overseas students remains very unsatisfactorily limited. Overseas students bring real educational benefits to Australian students as well as economic benefits to institutions and to the country. As Ross Gamaut noted in his report: The education of foreign students in Australia p.fovides the economic benefits of an export industry. But it does much more than that It increases the range of courses that it is economically feasible to provide in Australia, and so improves the services available to Australians. It builds close interpersonal and institutional links that are important in economic, political and cultural relations with students' home countries. And it is an important means of familiarising young Australians with their East Asian environment The·challenge is before the Government. It is not only restricting access to education to Australian students and particularly school leavers. It is also, by means of the very same policies, restricting access to Australian institutions to students overseas. As a result of that, we are not achieving what we could achieve internationally, we are not becoming the major regional centre for education that we could become, and we are at the same time disadvantaging tens of thousands of Australian students whose ability to undertake tertiary education is being threaten and truncated by the Government's policies. There is a· need for a very substantial change of direction in higher education and in tertiary education generally by the Government if these problems are to be remedied. At the moment, we see no sign from this Government that it is.prepared to make these changes. Instead,. we get a constant ideological barrage from the Government that it is impossible to undertake the freeing up of the system which its chief advisory bodies recommend. It is impossible because the Government believes, and this Minister believes particularly as a result of his approach to politics as a member of the Left faction of the Labor Party, that it is better that all those 50,000 students be equally deprived rather than some being able to gain additional places and thereby contribute additional resources to the system. It is an approach which sees equity in equality of deprivation, and that is really what the Government is about. We have seen in recent weeks an attempt to suggest that somehow or other the open learning initiative will correct the problem and provide places for these students who cannot get into university. What a mess of contradictions we are seeing. The Government is prepared to allow Australian students to pay fees for offcampus courses, but not for on-campus courses; The Minister is prepared to extend HECS to students for off-campus television delivered courses, but not for courses delivered on campus in Australian universities. Does anyone believe that this extraordinarily inconsistent policy can possibly be maintained? The answer is that of course the framework that the Government has put in place and this Minister has committed himself so vigorously to defending is collapsing. It is collapsing week by week as the public· demand to open up the universities to Australian students grows ever more irresistible. If the Minister could only see that in opening up the universities to Australian students he would be also opening up enormous opportunities to Australian institutions to provide education internationally, we might at last begin to approach a rational policy area of which this country could be proud. Unfortunately, there are no signs on the horizon that this is likely to happen under the current administration.",114
329,Ms CRAWFORD,OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE,"I rise to speak on the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1992 and to look at the whole issue of overseas students and the extension of our own universities. I find it quite extraordinary that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) talks about opening up our universities and at the same time raises questions of student payment. Those of us who remember the titDes when we had students paying full up-front fees recognise. how very closed those particular institutions were. Indeed, I think in many ways that is one of the great difficulties the Opposition has and which is why it denigrates Labor lawyers, Labor doctors and various other members of the Labor PartyMs MCHugh-Not to mention the Left.",119
330,Ms CRAWFORD,OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE,"Not to mention the Left-who have in fact achieved a university education. Is this not terrible? The poor have actually got to university and in many ways have shown that they are cleverer and more talented than those people who bought their way in. When we talk.about opening up universities and opening up tertiary places, we see that no government has done that more than this one. Nowhere is that better reflected than in our own .Austudy figures. Austudy assistance doubled in five years but trebled in 10 with the rapid increase in school and university student numbers. I would like to draw the Opposition's attention to the fact that the total number of students assisted by Austudy in 1992 is 464,900. Almost half a million Australian students are assisted by Austudy when as recently as 1987 the figure was a mere 224,000 and, way back in 1983, a mere 152,000. I find it quite extraordinary that we have these pleas by people in the Opposition to open up our tertiary sector and open up our universities to people. When we have in fact done that, they have then said, 'No, this is in this wrong. You have not done it the way we wanted you to do it'. We know the way they want us to do it, and that is quite simply by charging fees and suggesting that those people who can pay go, and those who cannot do not go. We are not in that business. We are in the business of opening up tertiary places and we are in the business of expanding and opening up tertiary institutions. Indeed, I think the question of school retention rates has been quoted many times in this place as well. In 1983, a mere 30-odd per cent of children stayed on until year 12 and this year, 1991, over 70 per cent of our students are staying on to year 12, after which they then expect to go on· to our tertiary institutions-which they have every right to. Indeed, while we recognise. some unmet which demand, very many of our students now in the tertiary sector will in 1993 be able to find places because of the kind of expansion that has occurred, not only in the university sector but also in our very own TAFE sector. We know the kinds of institutions we want and we have seen them opened up. We have seen them opened up to a whole range of students. We have seen the opportunity become available for very many mature age students who never had the opportunity for tertiary education. Very many of those people are women who in earlier years never had the opportunity of gaining a tertiary education because of the kind of community and family values which persisted in that families had only boys educated, or could afford to have only boys educated, particularly in a climate where full up-front fees were essential to kind of education. I find it quite extraordinary that on one hand we hear members of the Opposition talk about opening up our tertiary sector, but on the other hand we hear them talk about how the private providers of education to overseas students were not offering the kind of education which they suggested they were. The Government intervened and provided regulation, but we now have a suggestion that the sector is over-regulated. On one hand we have Opposition members decrying us for the kind of treatment that was meted out to some of our overseas students, but on the other hand suggesting that regulation should not occur. It is quite extraordinary. With the growth in the tertiary sector has come a growth in the number of international students in Australia. In the last five years, that number has risen from 22,000 to 54,000 students. Some of these students come to Australia under the Government's subsidised program for overseas students, to which this Bill relates. We recognise that, while the program is being phased out and no new students have been enrolled since 1989, it continues to bring in revenue, as international subsidised students contribute up to 55 per cent of the cost of their courses. We have seen an expansion in the number of those overseas students. The Government's rationale for promoting international education is based on the policy of mutual advantage. For Australians, the advantage is in a new education delivery. It means broader curricula and wider ranges of languages, and adds to the diversity of culturpanding allife and world knowledge. Many of our exstudents, particularly those from our neighbours in Asia, have returned to their own homelands. That has provided real export opportunities for Australia and an enormous number of trade relationships, as well as personal relationships, in terms of Australia's connections in that part of the world. For international students, it means access to Australia's high quality education and research institutions in a safe and secure environment. A safe and secure environment is crucial for very many of our students. We that have many students from Africa and parts of Asia-places which do not enjoy the kind of political stability which we enjoy in this country. It is crucial for them to be able to participate in a democracy and to live in a country where safety and security are assured. We have also seen our institutions create a different kind of export area in the opening up of campuses in a range of places. A number of institutions in Queensland have campuses in Singapore and in some parts of China. Other Australian institutions have offshore campuses in near neighbouring countries. That is an important way in which we can offer, and have been offering, overseas students access to Australian institutions, and access to the stability, strength and growth which this brings. We will continue to do that, because we believe that continued and balanced growth of international education can occur in a stable policy environment. The honourable member for Goldstein ranted and raved and, as the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) suggested, denigrated people in various groups within the Labor Party. It is quite extraordinary that he should berate our Minister for ad hoc delivery of policy in this area. The Government's policy and its policy directions in this area have been quite clear. Since we came to office, we have pursued the expansion and the growth of the tertiary sector in· a range of ways. As I said, simply because we have not pursued the kind of course that the honourable member for Goldstein wanted, that does not mean to say that the kind of course which we are pursuing is not opening up and exour tertiary sector and providing real opportunities for overseas students. I was also interested to hear his denigration of the Open Learning Centre. I find that quite extraordinary from a person who is supposedly committed to education and the provision of opportunities for people in our community. I find his denigration of that centre in the same sentence as his use of the word 'equity' somewhat amazing. The Open Learning Centre has been welcomed by a range of people throughout Australia. It has been welcomed by many' students who live in places where they are unable to access tertiary education and who are currently struggling with courses on a correspondence basis. People whose family commitments, or particular family situations, do not enable them to participate in either or part time education at our institutions will have a real opportunity to participate for the first time in their lives through the Open Learning Centre. I would have thought that the ability to take up what is now modern technology and to use it for the benefit of our community as a whole is something for which we should be applauded. It is being applauded by many people in the community. People with disabilities, those with family commitments, people in rural Australia, or people who are uncertain of their own abilities in terms of being able to particiits pate in the tertiary sector, for the first time will have an opportunity to take up the challenge that tertiary education offers. One would assume that everybody in Australia who wishes to will now have an opportunity under that Open Learning Centre to participate in tertiary education. The model of the open university in Britain has been welcomed by all sorts of people in that conununity as something to be prized. On this side of the House, we prize education. We value it. We see it as the right of everybody to have access to education. We have continued to take down the barriers for students in our community. to access our tertiary sector. The Open Learning Centre is simply another way in which that can happen. I was somewhat surprised to hear the honourable member denigrate that, because some of our mining companies are currently using that kind of technology to train apprentices in middle management. For example, Karratha Community College trains many apprentices for Western Mining and CRA in Paraburdoo and Mount Tom Price and other places. It does so through technology. It works exceedingly well. On a smaller scale, that is precisely what is intended for our open university. Making technology work for us as a community and turning it to the needs of our very own community is the challenge. This Government has risen to the challenge in terms of the whole question of our tertiary education sector and providing access to it. The Open Learning Centre and the provision of education through open learning and through technology is going to provide a full means for overseas students to access our institutions. As we know, and are well aware, technology is moving at quite a considerable rate. Cable television, which is currently envisaged-and, of course, the other technological advances in terms of satellites and so on-will provide access not only for Australia but for part of Asia. People from Asia who have not been able to afford and access tertiary education will be provided with an opportunity for the very first time through the expansion of this technology. Whilst the Open Learning Centre will be in infancy next year, so too will that kind of technology. With the advances that are being made so rapidly, we would expect that that would provide a real opportunity for Australia to operate within the international market. We do wish to make a strong contribution to the internationalisation of education, concentrating on the development of internationally relevant skills and collaborative networks for international participation in business, industry and professions. As we seek to playa role in the Asia-Pacific rim and within our own area, education will become a vital link in the way in which we develop and look to the kinds of skills which we will need.",119

333,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"The coalition supports the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill underpins the Aboriginal education policy, about which I will speak briefly. The Bill itself is a nery one and does not have contentious provisions. It also picks up two recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, to which the coalition has given in principle support. Prior to the introduction of the Aboriginal education policy, there was good evidence that 10 to 15 per cent of Aboriginal students in compulsory schooling years were not participating in primary and basic secondary schooling. This was despite the expectation that school age children would receive such schooling. In addition, participation rates of Aboriginal people in post-compulsory schooling was only about one-third of that for other Australians. These concerns led to the development of an Aboriginal education policy, which came out of the Hughes report of 1988. This report found that, in spite of improvements over the past two decades, Aboriginal people remain the most educationally disadvantaged people in Australia. The need to develop a comprehensive and coordinated national education policy for Aboriginal people was a priority. Based on these findings, the Aboriginal education policy was developed. This involved agreement between the Commonwealth and all State and Territory governments. It has the support of all political parties. The key consideration in establishing the Aboriginal education policy was to define the respective roles of the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. The Commonwealth adopted a strategic planning and monitoring role, and the operation and implementation roles are mainly the functions of the States. I would suggest that this is a model that could certainly be looked at in other Aboriginal programs. This is one of its particular strengths; there are others. It is a strength that such a policy works on the basis of agreed goals. It has a high degree of Aboriginal input into decision making and works on a triennial basis, which gives a high degree of predictability and planning. Unfortunately, the strength of the policy is not matched by the strength of the department that administers it. Over recent years the Audit Office has been machicontinually critical of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Successive audit reports have found deficiencies with DEBT in relation to eligibility, verification procedures, enrolment and attendance checks, dependent spouse rebate, duplicate applications, liaison with other departments, applicant processing, manual payments, data entry control and overpayments. Time permits me to comment on only some of these. In relation to verification checks, all audit reports since 1988 have found that no verification checks to determine Aboriginality, age, independent status, parental income or enrolment for tertiary studies are conducted by the Department prior to payment. This has been a continuing concern of the Audit Office. In an Auditor-General's report back as far as 1988, the Department advised that a 10 per cent random check on the age of students had occurred and yet, two years later, in the 1990 audit, the Audit Office could find no evidence that such verification checks had occurred. In relation to enrolment and attendance checks, although a key control to determine eligibility, Audit Office reports have consistently found that checks to determine enrolments are not made. This problem of enrolment and attendance checks has been a recurring one over several years, and the Department's response is usually the same, namely, that verification of attendance and enrolment will commence. It is interesting to look back on the Department's responses over several years. In 1988 the Department said formal checks would be initiated in that year. In 1989 it said they were currently being undertaken. In 1990-91 the Department informed the Auditor that a check on all Abstudy recipient enrolments was being performed during that year. Yet, this year, the Department says that they are about to commence. There have been four different stories over four different years. In relation to the dependent spouse rebate, the amount of student benefit is affected by the income of his or her spouse. The Audit Office found that, where an applicant stated the dependent spouse income was· nil, there was no departmental check to verify this. The interesting thing is that, in a reply to an Estimates committee question in 1991, the Department actually said that these departmental checks were in place at that time. In relation to duplicate applications, the 1991-92 audit report found that the Department's ability to identify and check duplicate applications was limited. Four years ago, the 1988 report found: The Department's ability to identify and reject duplicate applications was limited. It has found the same thing for every year of the last·· four years. Back in 1990-91, the Department's explanatory notes stated that there was to be an increase in resources to improve and control activities. If that increase in resources !ictually took place, there has been no measurable effect from it. In relation to liaison with other departments, the Abstudy user manual states that if an applicant states he or she is receiving a benefit from DSS it must be documented, and then the department must inform the DSS by way of a clearance form. The auditors found that this has been less than satisfactory and that no liaison has occurred with other funding bodies. It goes on and on-a department completely out of control, and in the end the people who suffer are Aboriginal people. The Aboriginal education strategic initiative programs work mainly by way of operational plans. These operational plans are conducted either directly with government education authorities, through the Catholic education system, with government and non-government preschools, with Aboriginal post-school education providers and with Aboriginal education consultative groups. They largely work to provide help with curricula, community liaison workers and Aboriginal education workers. It is difficult to understand quite how important this is until we actually spend the time and travel through some of Aboriginal Australia. . 1\vo weeks ago I was in Aurukun in Far North Queensland. Aurukun is a place that has had significant bad reporting in recent years because of the problems with violence, with young people and with alcohol. The people in the community there said two things: that there had been a significant deterioration in the community over the last decade, and that this was due largely to a breakdown in the schooling. It was young people who were causing the violence; young people who were disillusioned, disenfranchised and withdrawing. The person who was explaining this to me put it down to one simple fact-that really the issue rested with the State Government because the curriculum being provided in the school was completely irrelevant to the needs of this Aboriginal community. So these operational plans are important and they offer some real hope. This Bill picks up two recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The first relates to Aboriginal language initiatives. Many Australians do not realise that today we still have 50 Aboriginal languages spoken. There are some 20,000 Aboriginal people who speak an Aboriginal language as the language of first choice in the home, and there are some 2,000 people who do not speak any English whatsoever, in spite of the fact that they may even be multilingual-in central Australia, speaking up to seven or eight Aboriginal languages. This has particular implications for school age kids, because there are children coming to school not with English as a second language but English as a foreign language. This came home to me last year when I visited a place west of Alice Springs called Ipolera. There were 15 kids and a teacher from Newport primary school in Melbourne who had been there for two weeks. She spoke no Aranda and none of the 15 kids spoke any English. The class was in complete but quite enjoyable chaos. It has been found that, where a significant bilingual program exists, Aboriginal kids progress to much higher levels of education. In this respect, the Northern Territory has led Australia in bilingual education programs, but there have been consistent problems with developing curricula. The number of language speakers we are talking about might be very small. It might be as few as 500 or 1,000 people. Indeed, there are only three Aboriginal languages that have more than 10,000 speakers. Curricula development is expensive, difficult and may have to be unique to a particular school. But it is important because it may affect a whole community of children, the next generation and the future of that school. If that community does not get the-e kids progressing through to higher levels of education, the community itself will suffer in the longer term. So I welcome these language initiatives and hope they meet the desired effects. If there is any weakness in this policy, it is that information about it is very difficult to come by; it is not in a form the public can readily access; the review of the program is still to come forward to this Parliament-211z years after it started we do not have any clear understanding of how it is actually workingand it is the tendency for some of these costs to be transferred over into capital. These things should all be remedied. If they are, it will mean that the Parliament can, with confidence, have a multiparty approach to this matter. I want to finish by quoting Charles Perkins, a significant person because he was the first Aboriginal man to graduate from university in Australia. Last year he stated: Aboriginal education has not received the focus it justifiably demands. It has been our greatest blind spot over the years in not realising the vital ment of good education. We have usually left this to others or we have let our academic Aborigines tinker at the fringes with the Federal Government ... The reality is we are in the majority, unskilled and uneducated, and as such, at the mercy of governments, bureaucrats, pathetic politics and the rise and fall of the economy. So we have a policy here that is goal·driven, cooperative and works on the basis of determining respective roles of Commonwealth and State governments. It is for these reasons that we support it, because it offers hope and some real future for Australia's Aboriginal people.",122
334,Mr LES SCOTT,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Oxley) (11.53 p.m.)This Bill will amend the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989, which will provide grants for financial assistance to State and Territory governments, nongovernment school systems and Aboriginal education institutions. Under the legislation, funding for Aboriginal education will be $241.35m over the 1993-95 period. An amount of $17.33m will be spent to directly address recommendations of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. This funding will be used to employ additional Aboriginal education officers and provide extra preschool places for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. An amount of $16.793m will also be spent on the Government's Aboriginal language and literacy programs. All members of this House would, I am sure, have found the injustices suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as outlined in the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, to be completely unacceptable. The Royal Commission found that the principal reason for the relatively high number of Aboriginal deaths in custody was the underprivileged position of Aborigine and Torres Strait Islander people within the Australian society. One of the principal reasons that many Aborigines have been locked out of mainstream society has been their lack of access to the education system. Because of Aborigine and Torres Strait Islanders' lower levels of education achievement, many suffer from low ele- self-esteem and, of course, low selfconfidence. Out of the 99 cases of deaths in custody looked into by the Royal Commission, 40 did not get beyond primary school and only two finished their secondary education. In addition to assisting Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in increasing their level of education, work has to be done to increase understanding of Aboriginal culture amongst the non-Aboriginal population. Up until recently, many school courses on Aboriginal history were based on the premise that history in this country began in 1788, completely ignoring the 40,000 years that preceded it and completely ignoring the 200 years of genocide suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The sister schools program, a Government initiative recently annou,nced by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), will go some way towards addressing this problem. The sister schools program aims to increase the level of understanding between young Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. The program is part of the national reconciliation and schoolcurricUlum ing strategy and will encourage. a penfriend and sister school network between schools throughout Australia. Other elements of the reconciliation and schooling strategy have included an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies project which will result in the introduction of an Aboriginal studies project being introduced into the curriculum of schools throughout Australia; the local history project that encourages Aboriginal schools to research local histories to make the Aboriginal studies curriculum of their schools to be more relevant to the local community; and the development of a strategy to improve education and training for Aboriginal prisoners to the likelihood of them reoffending. Racist attitudes are generally formed at a very young age, with millions of non-Aboriginal Australians never meeting an Aborigine or Torres Strait Islander, meaning that they are completely ignorant of Aboriginal culture. Sister schools will play a valuable role in breaking down the walls of ignorance that separate Aboriginal· and non-Aboriginal people. It is only when all non-Aborigines understand the past and present injustices suffered by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders that true reconciliation can be achieved. As Aborigines receive increased respect, they will become more willing to stay on to finish their education. While this is a start, other work needs to be done to increase participation in education by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. The measures contained in this Bill are important in achieving this goal. Since 1990, $214m has been provided to improve education levels achieved by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, and under this Bill this level of funding will be increased to $241m. The Government is also committed to the introduction of the national Aboriginal language and literacy strategy, the first part of which is the Aboriginal language education strategy which will begin in January next year. ALES will be directed towards teaching Aboriginal languages in schools and will include bilingual and bicultural programs; Aboriginal language development and materials production, languages other than English programs for children at predominantly Aboriginal schools and other bilingual and bicultural programs. These programs will do much to ensure the preservation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. The Aboriginal literacy strategy, which will also begin in January next year, will improve the English literacy. of Aboriginal students, a move that will break. down many of the educational barriers faced by Aboriginal people. Together, these two strategies will give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the ability to have an increased role in non-Aboriginal society without resulting in reduce the destruction of Aboriginal culture. One of the principal reasons why advances in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs have been achieved over recent years has been the fair measure of bipartisan support for the policy undertaken by the Government. However, unfortunately, since the honourable member for Wentworth .(Dr Hewson) took over as Leader of the Opposition in 1990, there have been moves away from this bipartisan support on the part of the coalition. .One of the more disturbing remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition was that he thought that 'red tape, green tape and black tape' were the main reasons for Australia's recent economic downturn. It is shameful that the leader of one of the two major parties should make such a remark in 1992. Just as ominously, the policy of the Liberal Party on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs is one of the most negative ever, containing proposals to cut programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by $90m. The extremist policy prescriptions that have unfortunately been adopted by the coalition would undermine many of the gains made by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people under the Hawke and Keating governments. They would unfortunately increase the disadvantage these people experience. Of the $90m in funding cuts proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, $66m come from general programs of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC. An extra $20m would come from the community development employment program, which is referred to as CDEP, administered by ATSIC. This is widely recognised as the most successful employment project currently run by the Federal Government. The proposed $66m cut to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission would cut the Commission's budget by more than 10 per cent and would make the organisation's task of addressing this country's most important social justice issue that much harder. The proposed cut would be a disaster for .the reconciliation process between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians at a time when the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody showed the need for more government programs to overcome the terrible injustices suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, yet those who control the policy agenda of the Liberal and National parties at the moment wish to slash the budget for such programs. Some of the programs which would be targeted by the Leader of the Opposition include: $25m from the Aboriginal housing fund; $21m from Aboriginal education and employment programs; $2Om from the CDEP; $5m from the ATSIC Development Corporation; $4m from ATSIC as an efficiency demand; $3m from Aboriginal land purchase; $3m from Aboriginal Legal Aid; $3m from the community deVelopment support program; and $3m from the enterprise program. And that is to name just a few. No genuine reason is given in Fightback for most of the cuts proposed by the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition and his team of economic rationalists did not undertake any study of the effectiveness of the programs they have targeted. One has to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that the coalition does not fully understand the damage that could result from program reductions and that the cuts are not made out of vindictiveness or spite. Let us look at just one of the programs that the Leader of the Opposition would cut: the community development employment program. The CDEP is one of the most successful of all programs for Aboriginal people and communities. The program is the single most effective weapon against Aboriginal unemployment and a source of great pride and self reliance for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It waS strongly endorsed by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Yet in spite of these facts, the coalition's policy proposes to cut the CDEP by some $2Om. The Opposition is totally ignoring the value of the CDEP. If the program were abolished, people currently participating in this sch-me would simply be eligible for unemployment benefits, not· only wiping out nearly all of their savings but also having a detrimental effect on theif self-esteem, resulting in the increase of problems such as alcohol abuse. In addition to this savage cut, Fightback would cut $21m out of other Aboriginal education and employment programs. Time does not permit me to. go into all of those programs, but they cover such things as Abstudy and the Aboriginal student support and parent awareness scheme, just to name a few. These cuts would reduce the effectiveness of Aboriginal education programs and dramatically reduce the level of assistance given to Aboriginal people. If the reconciliation process is ever to be successful, the support of all the major political parties in this country is definitely required. I call upon members of the Opposition to mount a challenge within their own parties and recognise the need to take a bipartisan approach to this matter. I urge those opposite to reconsider their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policies, to consider devastating effect that those policies would have on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and to move towards a bipartisan approach on this most important of all social justice issues in this country today. The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992 continues this Government's record of reform in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak tonight, at this very late hour, in support of it. I commend the Bill to the House. Wednesday, 4 November 1992",124
335,Mr RIGGALL,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I rise this morning to contribute to the debate on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992. I am rather disturbed to follow the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) in what ought to be a bipartisan debate. The honourable member had a cheap shot at the coalition in his speech. It seems to me that he is mixed up about compassion. He seems to think that compassion can be measured in dollars; but I can tell him that it is measured in results. He and I both serve on the House of Representatives Standing Committee. on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and we both know that the results out there are not good enough. What the Government has done in the last 10 years is, in many ways, a bandaid solution which has not come to the crux of the real problem. To suggest that we are not being compassionate is complete and utter humbug. The honourable member mouths off about Fightback but he has not read it. He does not realise that some things will not be touched: housing, infrastructure, training, health, and education as per this Bill. There was also our in-principle support for the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. All these things are there and are set in concrete, that is what is important. We know quite well that that portfolio can be administered far better, as the rest of Australia can be. I remind the honourable member for Oxley that we are in the worse recession for 60 years and all parts of Australia will have to tighten the belt so we can get out of it. He knows that as well as I do. I am disappointed the that the honourable member for Oxley would try to take such a cheap shot, I also remind him that, over the two years I have been in this place, there has been genuine bipartisan support for this portfolio. I am very disappointed that he tries to go down this track. In speaking to this Bill, I wish to raise a more practical application of education. I was very pleased to the see the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) introduce the link scheme between schools. I assume it was aimed more to those in the south of Australia than to those in the north so that school children from the two areas could start to learn the dignity of both cultures. It is through dignity and education that the solution will be found to raising the general standard of Aboriginal people. It will not happen quickly; anyone who thinks it will has no idea of how vast the problem is out there and of the despair that is felt generally in the Aboriginal community. I was approached some time back by people from the Gippsland campus of the Monash University, including Murray Cree, Jeff Wrathall, Richard Hartshorn, Marlene Drysdale and Doris Patton. The last two people are of Koorie descent and are involved in looking after Koorie studies. They came to me and said, 'We want to do something to empower the local Aboriginal community to look after their own business interests'. They put forward a proposition to train Aboriginal people in business studies. It was an excellent proposition and the moment I saw it I realised it had national significance rather than local significance. Since then, a delegation has been brought to Canberra and we are looking at ways of implementing this program. The Gippsland campus has three distinct areas of study, including the School of Business, which is flexible enough to design a program particularly for Aboriginal people; and a Koorie Studies section. When Aboriginals go into that campus, they feel they are with their own people, they have an infrastructure and support system vital to the capacity of learning. The third area, and perhaps the one that was most interesting to me, is that of distant education. It seems that, from what I have been told and the little I have been able to find out about it, Aboriginal people learn to use computers very quickly. They adapt well to sitting down and studying at a computer screen, as they do in distance education through CD-ROMs and other such technology. We find that their culture and this form of learning are very compatible. We find that the classroom style of system is very confronting to an Aboriginal person, especially to an adult who is confronted with it for the time. This particular program has been put together to empower the Aboriginal people to take charge of the various sections of their own structure. There are ATSIC councils and land councils. We are seeing land grants, the transfer back to the Aboriginal people of various parcels of land, holdings and businesses. It is absolutely vital that this money is used wisely and for the betterment of Aboriginal people. I point out to honourable members opposite that while it is seen to be compassionate to throw money at a particular problem, they have to realise where this money comes from. Largely it comes from the taxpayers of the white community and those people ask that the money which is spent compassionately is also spent wisely. One reason I support this Bill is that it is wise to spend money on education and help to raise the dignity of the Aboriginal people and heighten the understanding between the Aboriginal community and the white community.",127
336,Mr NUGENT,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, I must say that it was with some sadness and disappointment that I heard your speech on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill. You made some rather unfortunate comments about the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson).",128
337,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION, The honourable member for Aston should refer to me as the member for Oxley.,128
338,Mr NUGENT,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Absolutely, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was with some sadness and disappointment that I heard the honourable member for Oxley make some statements a short while ago which, quite frankly, I think were unworthy of him. He attacked the honourable member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition, and specifically·,talked about things like 'red tape', 'green tape' and 'black tape'. I think that one of the dangers in politics particularly in an area such as the one thHouse is debating, which can be something of a. minefield, with emotions and so on' is that, If people's comments are taken out of context first often that can do more damage than thoriginal comments. The remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth were certainly made in the context of trying to get business development going and I think there is no doubt that .the processes-many of them, of course, qUlte proper processes, but the processes that have to be gone through in this country to get business going-can be lengthy and expensive and often a deterrent. Those remarks were made in that specific context and I think that for the honourable member for Oxley to have used them in the way they were used was very disappointing indeed. In relation to the general comments by the honourable member for Oxley about proposed cuts in this portfolio under a coalition government, I would make the point that, if the honourable member had taken the trouble to read the green discussion paper issued by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), some two or three months ago, he would have seen precisely not only where the dollars were going to be cut but where they were going to be saved in other areas and where better utilisation would in fact, mean that there would be no degradation of services. Rather, there would be a lot of cutbacks in a lot of the bureaucratic areas. One of the things that I, the honourable member for Oxley, the previous speaker the . honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Riggall), and others in this place have experienced in the last 21/2 years, as we have travelled around this country with the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, and one of the things that I have experienced as a coalition representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, as members of the Council have gone to every State, the Northern Territory, the Torres Strait Islands and large and small towns, urban and rural, has been the good and the bad, but the recurring theme, quite clearly, is that if there is no job, there is no income. That means there is poor housing, which often results in poor health. That can then lead to break-up of family, substance abuse, loss of self-esteem and therefore, obviously, no interest in education. People do not go to school and therefore they do not get qualifica- as well. tions. If they do not have qualifications, they do not get a job, and so it go goes on in that circle. This, of course, applies to all economically deprived groups, and the Aboriginal comn1unity in this country is over represented proportionately in the economically deprived groups. This cycle applies to all economically deprived people, but it is worse for the indigenous people in this country because they have the additional problem of what is quite often rampant racism and certainly the culture conflict which, unfortunately, is also something that causes ongoing day-today problems in so many areas. So we need action in the areas of housing, health and employment. Often we have to teach the indigenous community about management of communities. We have to change attitudes in the police forces, but perhaps education is the single most important thing that we can do to start to change the situation. Of course, the purpose of this Bill is to provide money, largely in response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I welcome the money .that is to be spent as a result of the passage of this Bill. There is no doubt that money is needed, but there are also other things that go with money. Just as we all know to our cost, throwing money at a problem, whatever the problem is, does not always fix it. As the honourable member for Chisholm said in his comments earlier-I was going to say this evening, but it is now morning-late last rught, in many cases there is a need for better supervision and more accountability. There is also a need for the States-and I have said this in this place before-not only to acknowledge their responsibilities in terms of the recommendations of the Royal Commission, but also, to use that rather clumsy but very effective phrase, to put their money where their mouth is. They must not just talk about it, but be prepared to put money on the table too. It is important to recognise the relevance of language in the educational process of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and the cultural significances One of the things that I have particularly noticed as I have travelled around, as I am sure. you have, Mr Deputy Speaker, is the sheer impact of distance. We often hear members in this place from rural communities talk about some of the problems associated with distance. When a young child in the Torres Strait has to fly for several hours to go to secondary school, and board out and so on, that really brings it home to one. It is not only a question of travelling, but also a question of often living in not very luxurious circumstances. Many in the non-Aboriginal community are sent off to boarding school, but I can assure the House, having seen a number of the Aboriginal community schools where children board or live nearby, that the standard is nowhere near as good. The other major problem that the Aboriginal community frequently faces is the fact that children are going to schools where, effectively, they are being taught in a foreign language. Having learned their own native tongue, dialect or whatever phrase one wants to use, they have to go away and often have to learn English. A number of points have struck me over the last couple of years. I think the first is that I would place great emphasis on the importance of the Aboriginal community input into the rUnning of school establishments and the development of curricula. Unless there is that input, one finds there is not the community support and there is not the parent support, and if there is not the parent support, the children tend not to go to school or not stay at schoo1. I think you were there, Mr Deputy SpeakerI am sure the honourable member for Oxley was-when we went to Yirrkala near Gove. We saw some particularly effective working examples of that. Another of the major lessons that I have picked up in the last couple of years is the need, where non-Aboriginal teachers go to Aboriginal communities, for them to understand the relevant culture in those communities, rather than just going in with a standard European-type approach to schooling. That is not always the case, and it is very important that we make sure that it happens. It was also very interesting to note on a number of occasions that the rules which governments lay down to control teachers and the running of schools quite frequently, frankly, are irrelevant to the Aboriginal teachers and staff being used in those schools. I remember going to a school near Mission Beach in Queensland where there was an excellent Aboriginal teacher who, because he did not go to a college and have a wider degree, but who, nevertheless, was uniquely qualified to do the job that he was doing, could not receive very high payor get all the conditions and benefits that other teachers got. There was no question that his contribution was as good as any in that school. The other major problem that stands out like a sore thumb when one looks at this area and travels around is that there are many Aboriginal people who have been trained as teachers but who never actually go back to teaching. That is because they get sucked into the bureaucracy or get better paid jobs somewhere else. That certainly has become an ongoing problem. There have been all sorts of reports, inquiries and so on and so forth, but one of the underlying problems, it seems to me, is that we need to be aware of the impact of the break-up of families ov-r the years-the removal of children, and what that has done for the culture within families. Ther- often is not a family or parenting culture; there often is no longer a culture of the need to go to school. Without that right environment at home the ongoing high levels of education are not attained. Therefore, it is most important that preschool is where we put a lot more of our emphasis. For example, 50 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have access to preschool; 90. per cent of the rest of the population has access to preschool. It is something that we must be prepared to put a lot more time and effort into. There are a couple of other little statistics I would like to mention in the very brief time. I have left. What is provided is totally out of kilter with what is needed. Let me quote one example. At Campbelltown in New South Wales there is one preschool with 35 places to service an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population of 8,000. It is, frankly, totally irrelevant.",128
339,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION, Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of the Bill has expired. The question is that the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affIrmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.,130
340,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,The question now is that the remaining stages of the Bill be agreed to. Question resolved in the affIrmative. Bill read a third time. NA Motion (by Ms MCHugh) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Sydney Morning Herald,130
341,Mr CARLTON,ADJOURNMENT,"Mackellar) (12.21 a.m.)I wish to draw - o the attention of the House an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Monday, 2 November, spread across the top of the very front page and headed, 'The sneer factor: Hewson's new poll setback', by Mr Peter Hartcher. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that this quite damaging attack on the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) purportedly refers to research by the respected qualitative pollster Mr Hugh Mackay. It turns out that Mr Mackay was not involved in this at all and that in fact he wrote to Dr Hewson on the same day. I quote from his letter: Dear Dr Hewson, Knowing that you would have seen the totally false report on the front page of this morning's Herald, I want to reassure you that the material attributed to me is not mine. I'm still trying to track down the source false attribution: frankly, the tone of the item doubts in my mind about whether any researcher would have been so intemperate. Apart from the question of tone, the content of the item is puzzling: certainly, none of my research would confirm the harshness of the criticism of you, the suggestion that the coming election about personalities than issues. On the contrary, coming election will be primarily about issues, my view. And it goes on. It is quite astonishing that leading newspaper, which presents itself as serious newspaper, could possibly front page an article without any foundation whatsoever. The material that is quoted these apparently is the work of somebody else. There was no attempt by the author of the article to check back with Me Mackay to see whether he had written this material. The Opposition is absolutely amazed that newspaper could have one of its senior journalists involved in an attack of this kind on the Leader of the Opposition. I draw the House's attention to the fact that only a short time ago the Prime Minister (Me Keating) apparently-it has been reported in the press and is not denied-had a meeting with the new Chief Executive of Fairfax, Mr Mulholland, the South African, because there was some suggestion of a rationalisation of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and Australian Financial Review gallery staff Canberra. It has been reported-and again it has not been denied-that the Prime Minister was successful in saving the jobs of some the journalists in these particular bureaus. I am not suggesting that all the journalists involved in these particular bureaus would influenced by this, but it is astonishing that this case we have this article which was checked out. It was a totally unprofessional piece of work. It was very damaging to the Leader of the Opposition and it has not been fully retracted as far as he is concerned. might say there was an article week by Mr Hartcher which dredged up some Between alleged leadership challenge, for which there appears to be no evidence, against the Leader of the Opposition back in 1991. The Sydney Morning Herald in a small column on the left-hand side of page two has of the an apology to Mr Mackay but no apology to raises Dr Hewson, which we regard as outrageous. We are simply not prepared to put up with this without drawing public attention to it. It also is unprofessional and unacceptable and it is nor simply part of some kind of attack on the is more Opposition. I do not know how much the the Government has been involved in this. The in National Media Liaison Service is presumably feeding material to these people, and the a intervention of the Prime Minister with the a Chief Executive of Fairfax would appear to be print on the linked to this. We are not prepared to lie down and accept kinds of dirty tricks against the Opposition. It is unprofessional and not worthy of this newspaper. I am ashamed that the newspaper which has been the main one in my city for 150 or more years should engage in this a serious type of nonsense. (TIme expired) Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Commercialisation",130
342,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (12.26 a.m.)In recent years the Australian community has been devastated economically and socially. It is no consolation that the alternative government has a range of policies to accelerate the devastation. The recent attacks on the ABC, by reducing funding and forcing commercialithe sation, by both the Government and the in Opposition, are part of this process. The ABC is Australia's most important cultural organisation. Its continuation as a of provider of information, free from editorial and program censorship inherent in commercialisation, is essential to the democratic be process. The Government's ultimatum to the in ABC regarding its proposed television service not to South East Asia-accept sponsorship or there will be no funds-is clearly the beginning of the end. Fred Brenchley was in no doubt about the significance of the change I when he wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald the previous on 24 September: the Asian Service, with its advertisingbased revenues and planned Pay TV joint ventures, there's no doubt the ABC has now gone commercial. The advertising base for an Asian service is a watershed decision for the ABC. It removes the ABC's advertising virginity and, despite the Board's implacable opposition to as for the ABC's free to air service, opens this very possibility. Not only will the television service to Asia be compromised but the credibility of Radio Australia will also be undermined. The integrity of the ABC's board has been shattered by its pusillanimous decision to sell out the Australian community by going along with the Government's direction. The board's supposed opposition to commercialisation as required by the charter is now pure hypocrisy, particularly as northern Australia will also receive South East Asian transmissions. The introduction of advertising or commercial sponsorship to ABC radio and television services will in time degrade the quality of programs and narrow the range of broadcasting in Australia. Ultimately, all Australians will be culturally poorer for this action. It will also drag down the quality of political discussion and help undermine what little democracy we have left. It will do this because commercial pressures will force the ABC into the mould of a commercial broadcaster-an organisation obsessed with the bottom line, ready to kill for ratings, always pitching its efforts at the lowest common denominator, vulnerable in its programming decisions to advertiser and sponsor pressure and cautious and conservative in its programming for fear of offending. It would be a national tragedy for the ABC to assume these traits. It would diminish every Australian. Yet, that is where some members of the Government and, to an even greater extent, the coalition want to push the ABC. The ABC staff elected director on the board recently asked: Why does Australia, with arguably the best range of commercial and public radio and television services in the world have to destroy the one unique element of that dynamic-the ABC? The Government is forcing the ABC to accept corporate sponsorship for the new Asian television service and yet it is not a high cost operation. The start-up cost for the fiist year would be only $5.4m. The operating costs in the three subsequent years would reportedly be considerably less than this figure. This is not a large amount considering that it is an investment on behalf of the whole of Australia in a service that will reach over 600 million people living in our near north. It is not even a large amount compared to the ABC's total budget. The funding should be provided by the Government without strings and especially without any requirement for corporate sponsorship. The Government has baulked at funding the ABC's service to the tune of less than $lOm over four years. It has pressured the organisation to offset the costs with commercial earnings. Even worse is the proposal of the coalition to strip $50m from the ABC's annual government funding. There would then be an immense pressure on the organisation to make up the shortfall. It would be open slather for the ABC to go for commercial sponsorships and anything else that would make a dollar. To initiate a commercial ABC television service to South East Asia not only has little point or benefit to Australia under these circumstances but also represents the effective abandonment of the ABC's fundamental charter. It will irreversibly diminish its role in the Australian community. While it is true that the ABC must constantly adapt to change, we must ensure that it retains its history of independence free of both commercial and political censorship. Environment: Mount Clear Primary School",131
343,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT," lam very grateful to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), who is at the table, for allowing me to speak, given the late hour. I bring to the attention of the House a book entitled Environmental Action which has been prepared by the Mt Clear Primary School and which I would highly recommend. This group of school children for the last three years has been working very hard to bring together some environmental action that is for the benefit of not only themselves but the community. I could do no better than read the foreword to this document, which was prepared by Mr Barry Phelan, the Principal, and Mr Graeme Jackson, the School Council President: This book is for sharing with other schools. It contains practical help to get started in Environmental Education. It will certainly be of interest those people in schools who are already grappling with issues in this relatively new and complex field of education. We trust that the academics will appreciate this addition to the body of Australian literature about 'grass roots' teaching and learning. We are aware of the scarcity of first-hand accounts of work chalkface written by primary teachers. For three years Mount Clear Primary School has been engaged in intensive curriculum innovation in Environmental Education. We have been overwhelmed with encouragement and support for our efforts. We had the time and the money! The additional time was provided by tw,o people, a teacher then on full-time study leave, and a School Community Officer until December 1991. This helped to establish an effective (essential) network of support. The additional money came mainly. from the Victorian Environmental Council and the Department of Conservation and Environment. Busy schools with tight budgets should not feel discouraged. We are sharing the knowledge and experiences of this case study to make your work simpler. A most important feature of our work is that people have pitched into make seemingly overwhelming tasks manageable. Environmental action is like that. It requires the efforts of many an impact. Teachers were committed because of the educational value. Parents approved and worked side-by-side with their children. Experts from outside the school community contributed advice and material assistance to such a degree, that the momentum of school activities increased dramatically. Environmental Education 'snowballed'. At times we thought we had 'a tiger by the tail'. We, at Mount Clear, firmly believe from our experience that burgeoning public interest will ensure that school/community projects are well supported. DON'T JUST THINK IT, DO IT! I would like to pay tribute to a number of people in relation to· the production of this book and, in particular, Jennifer Burrell. Jenny Burrell is actually one of my next-door neighbours. I know that she is deeply committed to the environment and has put a great deal of her heart and soul into preparing this to work. Indeed, as honourable members will know, we keep some pretty silly hours, but more often than not Mrs Burrell's light was on when I got home at midnight or half past 12. She worked very hard indeed. From a school point of view, I congratulate at the the school council, the various Victorian Government agencies and the Shire of Buninyong, which has !llso been actively involved. There are two special people who need to be mentioned: the school captains, Kelly Pora and Luke Dow, who are in grade 6. They are the spokespersons for all students. An enormoUs amount of work has gone into this and the booklet itself inCludes a number of sections such as the whole school environmental education policy, the workplace conservation strategy and the Canadian Creek environmental action project. These children have done an enormous amount of work in the Canadian Creek area. The other sections include cross-curriculum programs, samples of children's work, environmental education resources, professional development for teachers, school-based action research, the Age Curriculum Innovation Award 1991, parent participation and commuto have nity links. In 1991 the school received an award for curriculum innovation in environmental education, and it was one of eight Victorian schools which participated in the greenhouse unit pilot program to develop a whole school environmental education policy. The school, the council, the children and the teachers have worked very hard. If honourable members would like a copy of this document, I would be more than happy to provide them with one.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Statutory Authorities: Employment Goals (Question No. 1525) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minister's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the (a) Australian National Line Limited, (b) Australian Airlines Limited (c) Civil Aviation Authority, (d) Federal Airports Corporation and (e) Qantas Airways Limited giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, in case, (i) how is pre-eminence being given, (ii) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (iii) are there any organisational activities which are inconsistent with maximising employment growth.",132
344,Mr BEAZLEY,NOTICES,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a)(i), (ii) and (iii): NA (ANL) ANL Limited (ANL) and its container terminal subsidiary, National Terminals (Australia) Limited (NTAL) are significant employers in both the shipping and stevedoring industries. The Federal Government's shipping and waterfront reform programs have markedly improved efficiency and reliability in Australia's maritime .industries through restructuring of employment arrangements and improved training and retraining schemes. ANL and NTAL have fully participated in the Jodustry restructuring programs and the associated labour shedding processes. These programs are providing more reliable and cost effective shipping and cargo handling services with the aim of improving the competitiveness of export and import-reliant industries and therefore assisting economic recovery and facilitating employment creation opportunities in the economy. (b) and (e)(i), (ii) and (iii) NA NA NA Australian Airlines and Qantas have operated in increasingly competitive environments over the past few years. The need for both enterprises to demonstrate increased flexibility and ability to respond quickly to market changes has heightened since the Government established the two carriers as Government business enterprises. Both have greatly improved their efficiency in the face of difficult market circumstances, taking advantage of the increased managerial freedom provided by the Government. However, the Government saw the need to provide further scope for the carriers to enhance their efficiency and conseeach quently decided to merge Qantas and Australian Airlines and to sell 100% of the combined enterprise, Qantas formally acquired Australian Airlines on 14 September 1992. The result will be a more efficient and competitive airline enterprise, well placed to participate aggressively in Australia's domestic and international markets. In the longer term this will provide the basis for employment expansion in the airline as it grows to accommodate expected growth in local and overseas markets. There have been some short term job reductions announced in the combined airline and there will be no compulsory redundancieS except in accordance with the Qantas/ACTU redundancy agreement and only where there is a demonstrable staffing surplus. Looking more broadly, there will be major employment gains to the Australian economy generally as the more competitive aviation sector generates increased numbers of foreign tourists and Australians travelling to and within this country. In addition, there are considerable welfare gains for travellers flowing from reduced fares and improved services that airlines (including Qantas/Australian) are able to offer as a result of their improved efficiency. The ability of airlines, including Qantas/ Australian, to deliver such benefits is directly related to the more competitive aviation policy environment that the Government announced in February 1992. (c) and (d)(i), (ii) an.! (iii) NA NA The Government established both the Civil Aviation Authority and Federal Airports Corporation under separate Acts. The Government's intention in doing this was to provide a basis on which both bodies could operate in an efficient commercial manner. The two enterprises have been expected to take full responsibility for planning their major financial and operational goals and the measures required to achieve them, .to work towards pre-set targets and to report against those targets. Both the CAA and FAC have established as an objective the efficient provision of quality facilities and services to industry. The efficiency gains achieved in PUfSuing this objective have been passed .onto operators (such as through reduced airways charges). In 1992-93 the CAA has announced expected savings to the industry of $96 million. The impact of these gains will reduce costs to the airline, tourism and related industries leading to increased demand and expanded employment in those industries, benefits to consumers and the economy generally. In the short term, associated with the efficiency gains, significant reductions in staff levels in the CAA are being implemented. The CAA has stressed that these are being implemented without compromising safety standards. The service and facility development programs of the two bodies are actively facilitating the Government's aviation policy reforms and leading to job creation in their own right. The Federal Airports Corporation's capital works program over this decade will be about $2.8 million. Each of the projects under this program will create many jobs directly and through multiplier effects in the economy generally. Statutory Authorities: Employment Goals (Question No. 1528) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for the Arts and Territories, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minister's pledge .at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the (a) Australia Council, (b) Australian Film Commission and (c) Australian Film Finance Corporation giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, in each case, (i) how is pre-eminence being given, (ii) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (iii) are there any organisational activities which are inconsistent with maximising employment growth. Ms Fatin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Australia Council (i) The Australia Council Act states, among a number of functions for the Council, the objective to promote and encourage provision of opportunities for persons to practise the arts. The corporate plan for all programs of Council reflects the strategies related to this objective across all artforms. The Australia Council has indicated for many years the nexus between arts funding and employment. Generating employment for artists and arts workers is a major outcome of the Council's funding programs. (ii) In 1990-91 the Australia Council paid $50.55 million in arts grants. Of this total, $7.31 million were paid to individual artists, and $43.24 million were paid to organisations. From the total of $50.55 million, about 65 per cent was used for salaries for artists and other arts workers or paid directly to artists in the form of grants. Some of the remaining 35 per cent also was used to buy services which are labour intensive; these include such serviceS as advertising, marketing, accounting, set building, cleaning etc. As a result, the Council's total contribution to employment in the arts industry is very high. A consequence of this funding and other work by the Australia Council, together with an increasing public demand for arts goods and services, is that it stimulates employment in the arts and cultural sector of the Australian economy. In the years from 1981 to 1991 employment in the arts industry increased by 26 per cent, compared with a 10 per .cent employment growth throughout the Australian economy. At the end of 1991 about 75,000 people were employed in the arts comprising theatre and music, art galleries and museums, libraries, film and television and related arts/entertainment. (iii) No. The Australia Council's statutory functions mean that it contributes to employment growth by supporting Australian artists and workers in the arts industry. (b) The principal objective of the Australian Film Commission (APC) is to develop a stable and diverse Australian film and television production industry of quality. (i) The AFC does not give pre-eminence to employment growth; its primary goal is to contribute to Australian culture. However, this necessarily ensures the employment of Australian personnel. (ii) The APC focuses on developing Australian filmmakers and projects with a view to positioning the industry for expansion, and through this, to increasing employment opportunities. It assesses the projects put to it for assistance with the future of the industry in mind. (iii) No. The AFC is a significant contributor to an industry which at last count employed 16,000 people. Its cultural charter means that it inevitably contributes to employment growth by focusing on Australian projects·and personnel. (c) The Australian Film Finance Corporation (FFC) was established to nurture the Australian film and television industry via direct financial participation in Australian projects. (i) The FFC has a purely commercial charter, enabling it to foster commercial opportunities which increase the industry's viability and thus-its capacity to employ Australian personnel. The industry is by nature labour-intensive; the FFC's charter maximises its employment potential. (ii) The FFC only invests in those productions which have been certified by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories as qualifying Australian films under Division lOBA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This limits the foreign elements films can contain. Where there are foreign elements it is practice for the FFC to require foreign investment to cover these; Australian taxpayers' money covers only Australian elements. (iii) No. The FFC, like the APC and the other components of the Government's film support program, operates to nurture Australian culture. This is based on the Government's recognition of the importance to Australians of truly representative cultural products, and inherent in it is an intention to provide maximum opportunities for· Australian personnel. Nursing Homes: Residents (Question No. 1635) Mr Braithwaite asked the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 4 June 1992: (1) Did his Department publish 'Your Guide to Residents Rights in Nursing Homes'. (2) Was a copy of the notice of residents' rights included in the publication; if not, why not. (3) Has his attention been drawn to threats that the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services will harass organisations who do not sign the residents' agreements (a) by increasing the number of standards monitoring team and RCI validation team visits and (b) by not making refurbishing funds available to such organisations. (4) If so, will harassment ultimately hurt vulnerable residents: (5) What consultation has there been with the aged care industry on residents' agreements. (6) Is it a fact that the Minister for Justice has written to catholic homes advising them to take the option of the Minister's notice of residents' rights rather than sign the residents' agreement; if so, why. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) If the Honourable Member is referring to the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities in approved Nursing Homes, the answer is Yes. If, however, the Honourable Member is referring to the Notice of Requirements which will be issued to a proprietor in respect of those residents with whom an Agreement has not been signed, the answer is ""no"" as this is a notice which applies only to the proprietor. (3)(a) No. The Department has not threatened and would not harass organisations in relation to the Agreement. Standards Monitoring visits occur on a cyclical basis and also in response to particular events. RCI validation visits also occur on a cyclical basis and, as well, in response to analysis of statistical data. There are no plans to change this. (b) I am unsure what the Honourable Member is referring to in this question. The Honourable Member may be referring to grants of Commonwealth benefits under section 54 of the National Health Act to proprietors of nursing homes in respect of newly built premises after 1 November 1991. This section of the National Health Act was approved by the Parliament in the Autumn session 1992 and it requires me to take into account a number of factors in deciding whether a proprietor is eligible to receive Commonwealth nursing home benefits. Among the factors which the legislation requires me to take into account in this context is the extent to which resident/proprietor Agreements have been implemented by the applicant organisation. Alternatively, he may be referring to initiatives announced in the 1992 Budget that, if supported by Parliament, will enable provision of additional recurrent funds to proprietors of nursing homes to assist them meet the cost of new or rebuilt homes or substantial upgrading projects. In respect of upgrading, the Government intends to put to Parliament, amendments to legislation concerning the upgrading of nursing homes. In considering such an application for an upgrading grant, it is proposed that the Minister will be required to consider the proprietor's overall of financial management and the standard of care that has been provided to .the residents of the proprietor's homes. (4) There will be no harassment of organisations. In fact, residents residing in nursing homes in which proprietors offer residents Agreements will benefit from this recognition of their continuing right to make decisions and assume responsibilities-in other words, be able to continue to live in our community as independent persons able to make decisions about their lives. (5) As has been the practice of this Government, since 1989 extensive consultation with both industry and consumer groups has taken place about the Agreement. (6) The Minister for Justice has been involved the consultations about the implementation of the resident/proprietor Agreement. In this context, on 21 January 1992 he wrote to Catholic nursing homes to explain that if Agreements were not entered into, the response of the Government would be to issue a Notice of Requirements under Section 40AA(6)(bc)(ii) of the National Health Act 1953 on the individual proprietor concerned.

Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Statistics of coal production in Australia are not recorded on the basis of steaming and metallurgical coal. This distinction is determined by end usage. Production statistics are only available as raw coal production and saleable coal production. in In this question the honourable member refers to (i) coal. I have assumed that this means raw coal. Statistics answering the honourable member's question are set out in the following tables: New South Wales Production figures for open cut mines by district for either raw or saleable coal are not published.

For international comparisons of labour productivity, it is possible to compare saleable output per employee-year, as this takes account variations.in available mine working time. I would point out that such comparisons can only be. indicative due to the influence of factors such the following: . (a) The lack of a uniform definition, with definitions varying between. countries and within countries. There can also be the problem of a lack of a uniform use of units. For example, output be given as saleable or raw, can be for an entire mine or for a single producing section, and can given in short tons, toniles or long tons; labour input may refer·to the total workforce, an underfigures ground workforce, the workforce of a single producing section, the workforce excluding Singleton North West Newcastle West South Total 9.77 12.92 22.22 13.39 13.77 Open cut na na na na 27.19 12.67 .13.72 22.19 14.91 15.12 Open cut na na na na 27.93 Queensland Per Employee Shift, by District (Tonnes) Southern Central Northern Total na na na na Open cut na na na na 14.10 13.29 11.83 13.36 Open cut 43.31 37.99· 36.54 38.36 14.15 16.65 12.49 15.30 Open cut. 47.51 40.91 39.60 41.66 13.30 20.U 14.56 18.10 Open Cut 41.57 36.56 38.45 38.32 12.35 21.56 13.51 19.29 Open cut 40.33 39.04 43.97 41.19 Per Employee Shift, by District (Tonnes) Southern Central Northern Total 6.46 6.30 7.19 6.53 Open Cut 17.76 19.23 19.54 18.99 8.57 9.99 11.33 9.69 Open Cut 32.89 32.02 26.37 29.94 7.34 13.06 11.37 11.09 Open Cut 34.13 35.46 28.60 32.47 8.67 15.72 14.34 14.02 Open cut 32.75 31.7.98 27.13 30.14 8.38 16.81 13.30 15.02 Open cut 31.14 33.29 31.03 31.97 preparation, management trainees or employees at work on capital investment projects, and contractors mayor may not be included; various time units of may .be used such as hour, shift, or year.

Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is' as follows: On the basis that the references to ""coal"" in the question are to ""black coal"": (1) A table showing Australia's resources of All black coal, prepared. by the former Bureau of Mines Mineral Resources' Minerals Resource Assessment Program, follows this answer. 3525 Resources for New South Wales are not classi6345 fied as being metallurgical (coking) or steaming (non-coking) coal. This is because resource data 6745 available from the State does not allow such a 7090 division to be made. Resources are reported in this way because changes in technology in both coke and iron making have allowed the use of some increasingly lower quality (ie non-coking) coals in those applications. Consequently, there is no longer a distinct boundary between cokipg, and non-coking coals. . . Separation of the two categories is presented for Queensland. the"" Queensland Department of Resource Industries categorises coal on the basis of Crucible Swelling Number (CSN). The Department places the boundary at CSlI!"" 4, with those raw coals with a CSN less that 4 being categorised'as non-coking. The Department cautions that raw coals classed as non-coking can often be washed to produce a coking fraction. Coals in Western AuStralia, South Australia, and TaSmania are of non-coking quality only. (2) State Governments do' not have available details of the amounts of coal, if any, that have been sterilised by mine closures. The New South Wales Department of Mineral Resources has advised that none of the mines which have closed were economically viable at the time of closure. Therefore, at the time of closure of the mines, no economic3Ily recoverable reserves of coal were sterilised. The Queensland Department of Resource Industries has advised that in the event that an underground mine was closed, such a decision is made on a commercial basis by the operating company concerned. Decisions would be made at the time of such a closure whether or not to maintain the mine on a care and maintenance basis. Similarly, any decision to reopen any closed mine or for that matter a new mine development must be made on a. commercial basis. Any future attempt to extract the coal resources remaining in the ground would be made with due consideration to all factors and to the potential economic benefit of such an operation. There are no specific requirements under the Queensland Coal Mining Act to maintain access to the coal resources of a closed mine. There is a requirement to provide to the Department of Resource Industries, all information on the mine operations and layout at the time of closure. The Western Australian Department of Minerals and Energy has advised that the last mine to be Location Coking Coal Non-Coking Coal Undifferentiated Coking Coal Non-.Coking Coal Undifferentiated Queensland Bowen Basin 2,826 Galilee Basin 0 Callide Basin 0 Ipswich Basin 0 MuIgiidie Basin 0 Surat Basin 0 Moreton Basin 0 Styx Basin 0 Throng Basin 0 Laura ·Basin 0 Sub-Total 2,826 New South Wales Sydney Basin Southern Coalfield Western Coalfield Newcastle Coalfield Hunter Coalfield Gunnedah Basin Other Areas Sub-Total Western Austra1i1l Collie Basin 0 Perth Basin Hill RiverEneabbll 0 Vasse Shelf 0 Sub-Total 0 closed in WA was in 1969. None of the coal remaining as pillars and barriers in the old underground mines is. considered sterilised. In South Australia, the only coal mine in the State is still in production. The Tasmanian Department of Mines has advised that since 1972 there have been two mine closures. The Kaoota Colliery closed due to deteriorating geological conditions' and the New Stanhope Colliery was mined out. The reserves of coal sterilised by these closures are virtually negligible. (3) The New South Wales Department of Mineral Resources reports that no underground mines in the Newcastle district have indicated to the Department an intention to close before 25 June 1993. The Department has no expectation at this time that any mines will close. (4) As there are not expected to be any mine closures (see question 3), this question is not relevant. (5) As stated in the answer to question 2, none of the mines which have closed in the specified periods were economically viable at the time of closure; the coal remaining in the mines therefore had no commercial value.

(2) How many officers are employed in each unit of the section referred to in part (1) and what is the classification and salary structure of each position. (3) What is the experience in the coal industry of each officer in the section and when was the experience obtained. Mr Crean-The - wer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are two sections of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) responsible for providing information and advice on the black coal industry. These are (a) the Coal Branch of the Coal and Minerals Division, and (b) the Minerals Resource Assessment Program of the. former Bureau of Mineral Resources (BMR). On 13 August 1992 I announced that this section will be merged with the current Bureau of Rural Resources in the Department pf Primary Industries to become the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Sciences. A structure for this organisation has yet to be finalised. (a) Coal Branch The Coal Branch is headed by an Assistant Secretary and consists of three sections.

However, at the Senior Officer Grade B level, the total period of experience of the officers involved in provision of policy advice and program administration on coal industry and foreign trade issues amounts to 28 years. The equivalent period of experience for Senior Officers Grade C is 26 years. ht addition to this specific experience, there is a broad range of experience in the Australian resource industries generally. All Coal Branch officers have had considerable experience in ROlicy development and program administration. Academic and professional qualifications encompass a wide range of disciplines including law, economics, geography, geology, accounting, business administration and taxation; Regarding the former BMR Minerals Resource Assessment Program, one officer, an SPO Grade C Engineering, has had seven years experience in the coal industry as a mining engineer with a number of major coal cOmpanies. The experience of other officers is as follows: Assistant Secretary SES Band 1 Has 23 years experience in mineral exploration including limited experience in coal. SPO A Science Has 20 years experience in the mining industry. SPO B Science Has worked on coal resources and industry matters for the past 12 years in BMR and prior to that had 5 years experience as an exploration geologist in industry. SPO A: Engineering Has 35 years experience in the mining industry. Coal: Reserves (Question No. 1715)  Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 2S June 1992: What specific information is he able to provide on steps being taken by the (a) NSW, (b) Queensland and (c) federal Governments to ensure reserves of (i) steaming and (ii) metallurgical coal are preserved fQr future extraction in the event of underground mines being closed. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) ht regard to this question, the New South Wales Department of Mineral Resources has advised the following: Section 70 (1) of the New South Wales Mining Act 1992 No 29 states: 1/A mining lease is subject to : (a) a condition that the holder of the lease will not suspend mining operations in the mining area otherwise than in accordance with the written consent of the Minister. 1/ The NSW Government has a policy that uneconomic mines should not be forced to continue operations against the owner's wishes. Nevertheless the Minister has to be provided with sufficient evidence that a proposed suspension of operations is bona fide. Some of this information relates to the prospects for extraction of the remaining recoverable reserves and applies to both steaming and metallurgical coal. The mining company must supply reasoned arguments justifying its proposed course· of action including an estimate of the remaining reserves including their nature (pillars, virgin coal), quality and an engineering assessment of their mineable potential. This estimate is then evaluated by technical officers of the Department of Mineral Resources. Other factors which are then assessed are the possibility for rationalisation with adjoining operations, sale as a going concern, or addition to an unallocated area to form a viable project. For example, all of these possibilities were evaluated in the case of the recent closure of Lemington underground mine but none was found to be a practical alternative. If any of the options was considered practical in the case of a mine closure, the Minister would take the necessary action to ensure that the alternative could be implemented and thereby prevent sterilisation of the remaining reserves. (b) The Queensland Department of Resource Industries has advised that: In the event that an underground mine was closed, such a decision is made on a commercial basis by the operating company concerned. Decisions would be made at the time of such a closure whether or not to maintain the mine on a care and maintenance basis. Similarly, any decision to reopen any closed mine or for that matter a new mine development must be made on a commercial basis. Any future attempt to extract the coal resources remaining in the ground would be made with due consideration to all factors and - the potential economic benefit of such an operation. There are no specific requirements under the Queensland Coal Mining Act to maintain access to the coal resources of a closed mine. There is a requirement to provide to the Department of Resource Industries, all information on the mine operations and layout at the time of closure. (c) The Federal Government was instrumental in establishing the Australian Coal Industry Council as a forum where Federal and State Government Ministers and union and company representatives could meet to consider and discuss issues of common concern in the coal industry. In establishing the Council, all parties recognised the desirability 1981-82 1982-83 1983-84 1984-85 1985-86 1986-87 1987-88 1988-89 1989-90 of such a forum given the division of constitutional authority between the Commonwealth and the State Governments in respect of the coal industry. The specific issue raised by the honourable member lies within the responsibility of the State Governments but if Council members considered the issue was impacting on the future health of our coal industry it could be.addressed by the Council in its wider consideration of coal policy. Coal: Steaming and Metallurgical (Question No. 1716)  Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) What quantities of (a) steaming and (b) metallurgical coal were produced in Australia by (i) underground and (ii) open cut mining in each financial year between 1981-82 and 1991-92. (2) What (a) amount and (b) percentage of the total of (i) steaming and (ii) metallurgical coal was (A) used for domestic purposes and (B) exported in each financial year between 1981-82 and 199192. (3) What was the total global production of (a) steaming and (b) metallurgical coal in each financial year between 1981-82 and 1991-92. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Statistics of coal production in Australia are not collected on the basis of steaming coal and metallurgical coal as this distinction is determined by end usage. Production statistics are only available as raw coal production and saleable coal production by underground and opencut mines. I have provided the following figures of saleable coal production in Australia for the honourable member's information: Production of saleabale coal in Australia 1981-82 to 1991-92 Underground ('000) tonnes Open cut '000) tonnes 43,456 47,621 45,848 53,741 42,104 63,449 41,513 76,748 44,790 89,515 50,864 97,870 43,580 92,769 46,126 103,223 52,203 108,210 1990-91 1991-92,(p) Source: Joint Coal Board (P) = preliminary (2) I have answered parts (i) and (ii) of this question because, as mentioned in (1) above, statistics of coal of steaming coal and metallurgical coal.

Employment at Australian black coal· mines at December 1991 totalled 28,599. This was 3.4% less than the December 1990 total of 29,618. Employment at underground mines fell by 805 over 1991 to 13,531 at December 1991. This resulted from further rationalisations at a number of NSW mines. Employment at open-cut mines also fell over 1991 by 214 to a total of 15,068. Projections of employment levels in the Australian coal industry are difficult to estimate with any certainty in the present climate·of major industry reform (the amalgamation of unions, the introduction of award restructuring, the adoption of new work model agreements), poor prices for coal, mine closures and inadequate company retumsagainst the prospect of major growth in demand for coal over this decade. Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (Question No. 1738) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 18 August· 1992: (1) Did a former acting Minister for External Affairs state in an answer to a question on notice (Hansard, 17 November 1959, page 2784) that Australia had not taken action towards ratifying the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (The Hague, 14 May 1954) pending its ratification. (2) Did Australia ratify the Convention on 19 September 1984 despite the USA, UK and China, nuclear powers and permanent members of the Security Council, not having ratified it. (3) Was ratification of the Protocol for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (The Hague, 14 May 1954) considered by Commonwealth departments in 1985; if so, by which departments. (4) Did the Executive Board of UNESCO at its 125th session (September-October 1986) and, in the context of the war between Iran and Iraq, at its 129th session (May-June 1988) urge member states to become parties to the Convention and Protocol. (5) Are 15 Arab and Middle Eastern states parties to both the Convention and the Protocol and 3 similar states parties to the Convention alone. (6) Are 15 states which had forces in and around the Persian Gulf in 1991, other than those referred to in part (5), parties to both the Convention and the Protocol and 3 similar states parties· .to the Convention alone. (7) Did the Parliament enact the (a) Protection Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986, (b) Copyright Amendment Act 1989 and (c) Customs Tariff Amendment Act 1991 preparatory to Australia respectively (i) accepting the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (paris, 14 November 1970) on 30 October 1989, (ii) acceding to the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, . Producers of Phonograms and Broadcastjng Organisations (Rome, 26 October 1961)in June 1992 and (iii) accepting the Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials (Florence. 17 June 1950) and acceding to the Protopel to the Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials (Nairobi, 26 November 1976) on 5 March 1992. (8) Is legislation necessary to enable Australia to meet its obligations if it were to ratify the 1954 Protocol; if so, (a) when did any department or departments last consider such legislation, (b) which department considered it and (c) what was the outcome; if not, (i) what impediments are there to ratification, (ii) when were the- last considered by departments, (iii) which departments considered them and (iv) what was the outcome.. (9) Is the 1954 Protocol the only current and relevant UNESCO convention, other than the Convention on Technical and Vocational Education (paris 10 November 1989), to which Australia has not yet become a party. (10) What is the timetable for Australia to ratify the 1954 ProtoCol. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) An Instrument of Ratification of the Convention was deposited for Australia on 19 September 1984. The Convention entered into force for Australia on 19 December 1984. As at 20 January 1992 the United StateS of America, the United Kingdom of Britain and Northern Ireland, and China, had not ratified the Convention. (3) Yes. The then Departments of Arts, Heritage and Environment; Foreign Affairs; and Attorney General's. (4) At its 125th session the Executive Board urged Member States who had not yet done so to examine the possibility of ratifying the Convention and Protocol or of acceding to them; and, at its 129th session the Executive Board invited States that were not yet parties to The Hague Convention and Protocol of 1954 to examine the possibility of becoming parties to it. (5) As at 20 January 1992 the following 12 Arab and Middle Eastern States were parties to both the of Convention and the Protocol: Egypt, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and Yemen (unification of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Yemen Arab Republic occurred on 19 May 1990). And as at 20 January 1992 the following four Arab and Middle Eastern States were parties to the Convention alone: Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and Sudan. (6) As at 20 January 1992 the following Statesother than those referred to in (5), above-which were participants in the multi-national force that operated in and around the Persian Gulf in 1991 under UN auspices to liberate Kuwait were parties to both the Convention and the Protocol: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Niger, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Senegal, Sweden and Thrkey. As at 20 January 1992 Australia, Argentina and Spain are three similar States which are parties Benin to the Convention alone. (7) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. (c) yes. (8) Yes. (a) 1985. (b) As for (3) above. (c) Further research and extensive consultation would be required on the complex issues which this Protocol raises. The Department of Arts, Sport the Environment and Territories has advised that necessary resources have been committed to other priorities. (9) No. (10) A timetable has not been prepared. The International Council on Monuments and Sites and the Dutch Government will start a review shortly on ways to improve the effectiveness of the Hague Convention and its relationship to the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. It is likely that Australia will respond positively to an invitation to contribute to this review. Framework Convention on Climate Change and Convention on Biological (Question No. 1753) Mr Melham asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Terrritories, upon notice, on 18 August 1992: Which nations have signed the (a) UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and (b) Convention on Biological Diversity and on what dates did they sign them. Mrs KeUy-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . (1) As at 3 August 1992, the following countries have signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change: Mghanistan Algeria Angola Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Australia Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Bhutan Bolivia Botswana Brazil Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cameroon Canada Cape Verde Central African Republic Chad Chile China .

Mr Tickner-The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following response to the honourable member's question: Commonwealth funds are appropriated to various bodies within the Attorney General's and Aboriginal Affairs portfolios to fund litigation. In particular, ongoing funding is provided by ATSIC to Aboriginal Legal Services which may be utilised by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups and individuals to fund litigation relating to criminal and civil law proceedings. Funds are also provided to Aboriginal Land Councils for operational expenses, which can include funding of land claims and other land related litigation. Aboriginals: Prepared Food (Question No. 1788) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 1992: (1) Is he able to say whether (a) an aircraft is dispatched twice daily from Derby, WA to Noonkanbah station with prepared food to sustain the Aboriginal community located there. (2) Is he further able to say whether the Noonkanbah station is a self-supporting settlement; if so what is the justification for the flights referred to in part (1). Mr Tickner-The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following response to the honourable member's question: (1) Regular flights to the station from both Fitzroy Crossing and Derby do occur to supply the Community store with fresh bread and other perishable goods. However, this is part of the nonnal commercial operations of the Community store and similar arrangements exist in other isolated community stores. There may have been the occasional emergency supplies of fresh food flown in during the. wet season when the roads were closed due to flooding. There are no formal arrangements in place for ""meals on wheels"" type flights to the community. (2) A five year plan has been developed for Noonkanbah station which anticipates self sufficiency within the next two years or so. The community store has a similar forecast in its business plan. Yungngorra Community, the community associated with Noonkanbah station, has approximately 250 inhabitants. It is not unreasonable for the community to have in place appropriate transportation arrangements to service its ongoing needs for fresh supplies and mail. Commonwealth Departments: Rent (Question No. 1809) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 19 August 1992: What total sum in rental was paid by each Commonwealth department in each financial year since 1982-83. Mr Beddall-I have been advised that the Department of Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Between 1982-83 and 1988-89 the Department of Administrative Services managed Commonwealth rental payments from a single appropriation. Payments were managed on a total Commonwealth, rather than individual Department basis. Rent was not apportioned to individual departments. Rent was not charged for Commonwealth owned property in this period. The Minister is not prepared to authorise the considerable expenditure required to collate available information into the form sought by the honourable member. Since 1 July 1989, individual Government departments and agencies have been responsible for their property administration. The information sought post 1 July 1989 should therefore be requested from individual departments. Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (Question No. 1825) Mr Truss asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 20 August 1992: (1) Did the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service commission a scientific working party to examine the risk of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) entering Australia through the import of pigs and pig products from Europe and North America. (2) Did the working party recommend that (a) the importation of uncooked pig meat from any PRRS virus infected country be subject to deboning in the country of origin and (b) imported pig meat be processed before release in Australia by a method that ensures that core temperatures reached are equivalent to 60 hours heating at 37 degrees centigrade, or 60 minutes at 56 degrees centigrade. (3) Will the Minister take immediate action to implement this recommendation to ensure that the PRRS virus does not enter Australia through the increase in the importation of pig meat.",136
345,Mr GRIFFITHS,AUSTRALIAN BLACK COAL RESOURCES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. During early 1991, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) requested the Bureau of Rural Resources to establish a scientific working party to investigate the spread, epidemiology, potential quarantine significance and cause of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in European and North American pigs. This request sought independent scientific advice to assist AQIS in its responsibilities for quarantine risk assessment. The scientific working party first convened during May 1991 and has since met two further times in August 1991 and June 1992 respectively. Following each meeting, the working party has provided scientific advice to AQIS regarding related topics including existing and recommended quarantine policies for imports of pigs, pig semen and pig products from all countries. The working party reports have been widely circulated by AQIS for consideration and comment. (2) Yes. The latest report of the working party recommended that uncooked pig meat imports from PRRS infected countries be subject to deboning in the country of origin and heat treatment before release in Australia. n did so against a background that pig meat is an unlikely source of transmission of the PRRS virus to Australian pigs. However, it also felt that some additional quarantine measures may be justifiable for imports of uncooked pig meat from infected countries on the basis of evidence relating to the distribution of the causative virus in the body of infected pigs. (3) Yes. Requirements will be implemented enforcing additional quarantine controls over imports of uncooked pig meat in accordance with the recommendations of a scientific working party convened for this purpose. These recommendations include deboning in the country of origin and processing to inactivate PRRS virus before release in Australia. AQIS has consulted with pig producers and pig meat processors. regarding the details of additional quarantine requirements and enforcement measures. AQIS currently proposes that the new requirements should be based on quality assurance principles. Pig meat importers and processors will be required to submit a manual, which will be subject to audit, defining how they shall ensure that all necessary requirements will be satisfied on an ongoing basis. AQIS will then evaluate each manual for possible approval before importers or processors can be permitted to handle imported, uncooked pig meat from PRRS infected countries. AQIS will be responsible for conducting periodic inspections and audits of approved importers and processors to ensure compliance. The costs to AQIS of its quarantine inspection and audit procedures will be fully recovered from approved importers and processors. Insect Vectors: Arrival in Australia (Question No. 1833) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 8 September 199-: (1) What quarantine precautions are taken: to ensure insect vectors carrying animal and plant diseases exotic to Australia are not brought into Australia by inbound aircraft. (2) Is the practice of spraying insecticides in inbound aircraft mandatory for both passenger and freighter aircraft; if not, (a) why not and (b) under what circumstances are aircraft exempted from being sprayed. (3) What method is used for insecticide treatment and does this method vary. (4) Are cargo holds of both passenger and freighter aircraft treated with insecticides on arrival in Australia; if so, (a) what method is used and (b) is the treatment effective. (5) Has his attention been drawn to concerns that insects could enter Australia within cargo and empty luggage containers; if not, will he investigate this matter; if so, (a) what action has been taken to address the concerns and (b) is there a need to apply insecticide treatment inside containers. (6) Are aircraft treated with insecticide before arriving in Australia; if so, does this treatment occur at stopover points where insect vectors might enter the aircraft. (7) What precautions are taken to ensure insect vectors do not arrive in Australia on inbound shipping, in either (a) cargo holds or (b) containers.",156
346,Mr GRIFFITHS,AUSTRALIAN BLACK COAL RESOURCES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Every aircraft arriving at an Australian airport from overseas is disinsected in a manner approved by the Director of Quarantine for the purpose of destroying insects and disease vectors that are in the aircraft. All the insecticides used are also approved by the World Health Organisation for use in aircraft disinsection. (2) The practice of spraying insecticides is mandatory for both passenger and freighter aircraft. There are no exceptions but two options are available (refer 3 below). , (3) Cabins of aircraft are sprayed before the embarkation of passengers at the last oversea airport with a spray containing 2 % permethrin which has a residual capability. All overhead and sidewall lockers are sprayed at this time, as are galleys, coat lockers"" toilets, crew rest areas and flight deck. The aircraft cabin receives a further knock-down spray of 2% d'phenothrin at top of descent, about 30 minutes before touch-down at the first Australian port. Holds are sprayed at the last overseas airport with a spray containing a mixture of 2% d'phenothrin and 2% permethrin. There is an alternative method in which the aircraft receives a residual spray every 8 weeks with permethrin. In the cabins all the surfaces, carpets and upholstery as well as the toilets and lockers are sprayed-no further spraying is, then necessary except in the holds which are given a modified spray to treat loaded cargo and containers. All Qantas and Air New Zealand aircraft are treated in this manner, as are a few small South Pacific carriers. (4) AB stated in (3) above, holds of both passenger and freighter aircraft are treated at the last oversea airport. Airlines are required to leave tJie empty cans on board the aircraft in a designated area, in the case of most arrivals this is in a container inside the bulk hold, which is checked itnmediately after arrival. Aircraft are only treated on arrival in Australia if the empty cans used for the spray are not found in the designated area on arrival. , (a) If treated on arrival they are sprayed with d'phenothrin which is a knock-down insecticide. At the last overseas port the spray used is a mixture of 2 % permethrin which has a residual capability and 2% d'phenothrin which is a knock-down insecticide. Holds which have been treated with a residual insecticide are required to have half the amount of insecticide sprayed into the holds as those which have not received this treatment. (b) The insecticides used with the mixture of both residual luid knock-down capabilities are effective. (5) I am aware of these claims which arise primarily in respect of those aircraft treated residually; as an additional safeguard an aerosol spray with a residual capability is still required in the holds of aircraft which have been residually treated. The spray thus reaches insects which may be loaded with the cargo or containers and not come into contact with the residually treated surfaces of the hold compartments. It has not been considered necessary to apply insecticide treatment inside containers. (6) The ,treatment process occurs at the last oversea port before Australia. (7) Monitoring and surveillance of wharfs at all major seaports in Australia is undertaken by means of both Ovi traps (which monitor the breeding of mosquito larvae) and C02 traps (which monitor the presence of adult mosquitos). A blanket procedure for all cargo holds or containers is not thought to be either practical or necessary. Instead risk situations are dealt with individually and specific action is taken with regard to insect vectors arriving in either cargo holds or containers. Fish Products: Export (Question No. 1836) Mr 'lUckey asked, the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 8 September 1992: Is it a fact that under new Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service charging rates the inspection costs for orders received for the export of fish products from Australia that are (a) below one tonne can rise to approximately 36 cents per kilogram and (b) over one tonne are an average of 10 cents per kilogram; if so, what is the impact of the charging regime on the international competitiveness of Australian fish processors exporting scale fish.",156
347,Mr GRIFFITHS,AUSTRALIAN BLACK COAL RESOURCES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The, fees charged by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service are predominantly charged on the basis of a rate per half hour for the actual time taken to carry out the inspection of product or 2% consignments of product. An additional quantity charge is, however, imposed on exporters of a range of non-meat products, including fish. The charge for fish products is $13.00 per tonne or part thereof, or an average of 1.3 cents per kilogram. ' (a) The result of these charging mechanisms is that small volume and predominantly high value exports may attract a combination of, service charges and quantity charges which in total could well rise to the amount suggested in the member's question. In such cases, however, the cost of the AQIS services is rarely a significant proportion of the total value of product being exported, and regardless, accurately reflects the cost to' AQIS of providing its services to the exporter concerned. b) Generally AQIS charges would rarely r-e above 2-3 cents per kilogram (based on the usual export consignment of 11-13 tonnes per container, where total service and quantity charges amount to 2.04 cents per kilogram). With larger consignments, this cost for AQIS services (expressed on a per kilogram basis) wouldprogr-ively diminish. AQIS charges impact most heavily on smaller consignments of high value product where, as I have indicated, the total charges are not believed to affect the competitiveness of Australian processors. The charges on larger consignments show significant reductions in the charges per kilogram, accurately reflecting the economies of scale in providing services for such consignments, with the result that again, the total charges are not believed to significantly affect the international competitiveBureau ness of Australian fish producers and processors. Army Units: INOe SLR Rifles (Question No. 1841) Mr Rocher asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 9 September 1992: (1) What Army units down to platoon level imd including Army cadet units have been deprived of the use of INOC SLRRifles for training purposes. (2) Is he able to say how many major crimes have been committed in Australia since 1982 where the use of weapons stolen from Army and cadet units have reportedly been used. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are no Army units, including Army cadet units, which have been deprived of the use of INOC SLR Rifles for training purposes. Drill Purpose weapons have been withdrawn from some units pending a review of their security arrangements but are still available for training. They are used primarily for weapon training. Many of these weapons are marked INOC (innocuous) but do not meet new specifications for innocuous weapons. Innocuous weapons are totally incapable of being restored to a firing condition and are used primarily for display or ceremonial purposes. With some knowledge, Drill Purpose weapons can be restored to a firing condition. (2) Army records indicate that two major incidents since 1982 have unequivocally involved the use of weapons stolen from Army units. Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory (Question No. 1954) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 15 September J.992: Did a. working party commissioned by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service recommend that the importation of uncooked pig meat from any country infected with Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome be subject to deboning in the country of origin and that it be processed at regulation temperatures before release in Australia; if so, will he ensure that the recommendation is implemented and enforced.",157
348,Mr GRIFFITHS,AUSTRALIAN BLACK COAL RESOURCES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes; a scientific working party has been convened on three occasions since May 1991 by the of Rural Resources at the request of the . Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS). The role of this working party is to monitor developments and provide independent technical advice regarding Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS). AQIS's request for formation of this independent advisory body to supplement its on-going consultative efforts with industry, importers, States, experts and trading partners is entirely consistent with the standards of independent advice, professionalism and scientific excellence that have long been a feature of AQIS's quarantine management practices. . At its third meeting the working party concluded that ""... pig meat is an unlikely source of transmission of PRRS virus to Australian pigs."" However, the majority of members felt that an element of caution may be justifiable in the case of uncooked pig meat imported from countries where PRRS occurs. This view was based on the emergence of further scientific evidence that the PRRS virus is present in the bone marrow, blood and other immune-related tissues of infected pigs, that asymptomatic infections occur in pigs and that some recovered pigs become carriers of the virus for at least several weeks. Yes; the working party ultimately recommended to AQIS that ""... the importation of uncooked pig meat' from any PRRS virus-infected country be subject to deboning in the country of origin imd that it be processed before release in Australia. by a method that ensures that core temperatures reached are equivalent to 60 hours heating at 37 degrees Celsius or 60 minutes heating at 56 degrees Celsius."" This Government and AQIS are firmly committed to open consultation and balanced quarantine decision-making, particularly when decisions of Syndrome consequence to Australia's existing and future agricultural trade performance are involved. Honourable members should note that AQIS has gone to considerable lengths to ensure that copies of the working party report, recommendations and support documentation have been distributed to interested parties for their consideration and comment. The majority of respondents and AQIS agree that some additional quarantine controls· over imported, uncooked pig meat are indicated to provide greater assurances against the possible introduction of PRRS to Australian pigs. Yes; AQIS has advised me that it will be implementing and enforcing additional quarantine controls over imports of uncooked pig meat in accordance with the requirements of a scientific working party convened for this purpose. These recommendations include deboning in the country of origin and processing to inactivate PRRS virus before release in Australia. AQIS has consulted with pig producers and pig meat processors regarding the details of additional quarantine requirements and enforcement measures. AQIS currently proposes that the new requirements should be based on quality assurance principles. Pig meat importers and processors will be required to submit a manual, which will be subject to audit, defining how they shall ensure that all necessary requirements will be satisfied on an ongoing basis. AQIS will then evaluate each manual for possible approval before importers or processors can be pennitted to handle imported, uncooked pig meat from PRRS infected countries. AQIS will be responsible for conducting periodic inspections and audits of approved importers and processors to ensure compliance. The costs to AQIS of its quarantine inspection and audit procedures will be fully recovered from approved importers and processors. Leaded Petrol (Question No. 1960) Mr Filing asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, upon notice, on 15 September 1992: (1) Is the continued distribution and sale of leaded petrol necessary. (2) Does the National Health and Medical Research Council determine a threshold atmospheric lead content level beyond which the intellectual development of children is threatened; if so, (a) what is the level and (b) is it being exceeded. (3) Are organisations responsible for petroleum refineries accountable for the level of lead emitted into the atmosphere from the refineries. (4) Is an environment protection authority responsible for monitoring lead emissions from refineries.",158
349,Mrs KELLY,AUSTRALIAN BLACK COAL RESOURCES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Many cars manufactured before 1985, when unleaded petrol was first introduced, will not operate successfully on 92-93 or 95 Research Octane Number (RON) unleaded petrol, and may suffer premature exhaust valve wear and damage if no lead is present in the fuel. Furthermore, not all refiners in Australia can produce enough high octane, 97 RON, unleaded petrol to replace the current demand for 97 RON leaded petrol. Refiners have in place an investment program to meet the demands for unleaded petrol progressively. The use of unleaded petrol is growing at a rate of 15% per annum and by 1994 more than 50% of all petrol sold will be unleaded. In ten years time there will be very little leaded petrol on the market. (2) No. The National Health and Medical Research Council has not determined a threshold atmospheric lead content level beyond which the intellectual development of children is threatened, but has recommended an Ambient Air Quality Goal for lead. Exposure to lead is measured by the lead content of blood. (3)&(4) Organisations responsible for petroleum refineries are accountable for the level of emissions. Refiners are subject to State and Territory regulations and are licensed by State and Territory environment protection authorities. Because of the toxic nature of tetraethyllead in concentrated form it is handled in closed systernsin refineries. Consequently lead emissions from refineries are negligible and not routinely monitored. Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs (Question No. 1979) Mrs Bailey asked the Minister for Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 17 September 1992: (1) Did the International Organisation of Consumer Unions receive $50,000 from the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs in 1991-92; if so, on what projects was it spent. (2) Did the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs provide $USlO,ooo to assist proposed UN regional seminars on consumer protection for eastern Europe and for the African region; if so, (a) how many persons attended the seminars, (b) what sums did other UN members contribute for the seminars, (c) what were the findings of the seminars and (d) was a report presented on the seminars. Ms MCHugh-I am advised that the answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) Yes. The Australian Government has provided $50,000 per annum for three years to maintain the South Pacific Consumer Protection Programme. This programme has been developed for the period 1990-93 in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and the· International Organisation of Consumer Unions (lOCU) Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific. Two consultants, Winnie Laban and Peter Swain, were engaged by IOCU to co-ordinate this programme. They have undertaken a needs analysis of the Pacific Island nations in relation to consumer education and training, and have developed the programme as a result of this research. The two consultants visited Australia in August 1992 and briefed the Minister for Consumer Affairs on the Programme's progress. In addition, a round table discussion was held with officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade including AIDAB, the Attorney-General's Department, the Trade Practices Commission and Bureau officers. The consultants were well received. Australia's contribution in this area has consumer protection to the leaders of the South Pacific nations. The work achieved so far has received endorsement from the two most significant regional bodies, the South Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Commission. (2) Yes, the Federal Bureau of Consumer Mfairs provided $USlO,OOO in April 1992 to assist proposed United Nations (UN) regional seminars on consumer protection for eastern Europe and for the Mrican region. (a) The seminars have not yet been held. The UN is continuing to raise funds for the proposed brought the issue of seminars. (b) This information is not available. (c) Refer (a) above. (d) Refer (a) above",159
