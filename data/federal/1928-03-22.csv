6,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"On 2nd December so, last, wben the honourable member for Swan was to resume his speech after dinner, a quorum was not present, and the summons bells were rung. As, however, bells bad not stopped ringing, honourable members in the precincts of the chamber bad no knowledge that the bells for this chamber were ringing a second time and a quorum was required. Tbat occurred again after dinner last night, when by a strange coincidence the honourable member for Swan was again to resume his speech.

12,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I submit that an honourable member may not address to a Minister a question arising out of an answer just given, and especially he may not frame a question in such a way that it is in the nature of a speech to his constituents on a subject in which they are interested.",14
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is permissible in the' House of Commons, and the same practice has grown up in this House, for a member to ask a question to elucidate an answer to a question just submitted, so long as any further questioning does not amount to cross-examination of the Minister.

26,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"the Minister for Home and Territories, upon noticeWith reference to a question asked by the honourable member foiMelbourne on the 15th instant, to which the Minister replied that "" there are approximately 100,000 acres of freehold land in the Federal Territory that has not yet been acquired from private owners, and no valuation has been made of those areas ""-is this reply in conflict with the Third Annual Report of the Federal Capital Commission, wherein it is stated that "" there are still about 4G,000 acres of freehold land in the Territory, but it is not at present required for an}' public purpose, and there is no immediate need, therefore, to justify its acquisition""? 2. Will the value of such land be increased by delaying its acquisition, or will its price be fixed by the enabling act passed for such purpose?",16
27,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The amount of freehold land in, the Territory is approximately, 40,000 acres; but, in addition, there are over 50,000 acres of land held under conditional purchase or conditional lease tenure from the State of New South Wales, which the holders have the right to convert to freehold at any time upon fulfilment of certain conditions. For the purpose of indicating the area of land in the Territory which had not been valued for acquisition purposes, it was necessary to refer to the whole of this in the answer to the question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne on the 15th March, 1928. 2. For the purposes Of acquisition, no. Section 10 of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act of 1910 provides that in determining the compensation to which the owner of such land is entitled, the value of the land shall be taken not to exceed the unimproved value of the land or the interest therein of the owner on the 8th day of October, 1908, together with the value of his interests in the improvements on the land at the date of acquisition of the land.",16
28,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,Unknown,"On the 16th of March, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) asked me the following questions:1. Is it a fact that the Federal Capital Commission intends to build garage accommodation for fifteen cars at the Hotel Acton, six at the Hotel Ainslie, and twelve at the Hotel Wellington ? 2. Is there already a greater demand for garage accommodation than could be supplied During the by the proposed new provision? 3. Do these hotels lose a great deal of business because motor tourists prefer not to visit establishments where they cannot garage their cars? 4. Does the Commission intend to pursue its practice of failing to supply sufficient garage accommodation ? 5. Is it a fact that the failure of the Commission to supply garage accommodation has already cost motor car owners resident in or temporarily staying at tliese hotels large sums of money for damage and depreciation sustained by cars which are constantly exposed to the weather? I am now in a position to advise him as follows:1. Tenders have been invited for a garage to accommodate fourteen cars at the Hotel Acton, and it is proposed to provide accommodation for an additional six cars. Provision is being made for the accommodation of seven cars at Hotel Ainslie and twelve at Hotel Wellington. 2. At the moment. Yes: but the demand will decrease when Parliament is not in session. 3. I have no information on this subject. 4. It is considered that the provision of garage accommodation for persons permanently located in Canberra is a matter for private enterprise. The provision about to be made is regarded as reasonable in the circumstances. 5. Cars parked in the open must be expected to depreciate more quickly than those which are garaged. Many of the cars, however, were purchased by their owners with a full knowledge that garage accommodation at tli« hotels was not available. NA . (AUSTRALASIA) LIMITED . BEAM SEBVICE. Mr E .

It may be added that the question of the abolition of the passport system was specially considered at a passport conference held at Geneva during 1926, under the auspices of the League of Nations, but the conference came to the conclusion that the time had not yet arrived to abolish the system, as passports afforded valuable means, of identity and right to travel.

Motion (by Mr Bruce ) - (B y leave) - Agree d toThat so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as will enable Notice of Motion, No. 4, General Business, in the name of Mr Brennan, to take precedence for this < J",21
50,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Batman) [ 3 . 2 ] - I move That, in the opinion of this House, the action of the Government in regard to certain notorious income tax evasions known as "" the Abrahams cases"", the history of which discloses improper and unprecedented bargaining on the part of the Government with self-confessed malefactors, and grave failure to safeguard the revenues of the Commonwealth, is repugnant to right practice and out of harmony with correct and settled principles governing the administration of the criminal law. I move this motion on bebalf of the Opposition and with the concurrence of its Leader. It arises out of what was described by the Attorney-General (Mr . Latham) in a speech which he delivered in this House a little over a week ago as "" a series of frauds perpetrated in connection with the evasion of income tax by the three brothers, Abrahams"". The situation was also summed up in the judgment of Mr Justice Starke in these wordsIt is plain on this material that the defendants operated together and possibly witli others systematically to defraud the Commonwealth. Investigations by omcers of the Income Tax Department have been proceeding since 1920 into matters which arose out of an audacious application made by one or more of these brothers to defeat, in the courts, the assessment of their incomes made by the Commissioner of Taxation. From that time what might be described as a guerilla warfare bas been waged upon this firm , its subsidiary companies, dummies and instruments. Surprise visits have been paid to their various places of questionings and examinations have taken place; and proof has been found of the use of faked documents, dummy companies and the names of dead or fictitious persons to defraud the Commonwealth of its dues. Banking accounts have been gone into which have been numerous and complicated enough to baffle even the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. To all these persistent efforts on the part of the taxation authorities to ascertain the facts, persistent and determined opposition and obstruction has been offered by the suspected persons. Even during the investigations these gentlemen have either themselves or through their numerous agents continued to f a l s if y their returns and rob the Commonwealth. The investigation officers have found at their various places of business, butts removed from cheque books, obvious alterations in accounts, and deceptions practised in records contained in ledgers, cash books and other books of account. Whenever one of these three persons has been asked aii awkward question it bas been his practice to say, "" That was a matter entirely within the management of my brother."" If it were not Louis, then it was Charles, and if not Charles then Emanuel; but it did not happen on a single occasion that the person who was questioned was able to give the investigation officer any information. The inquiries were conducted with commendable industry by the officers of the Taxation Department. Eventually on their advice, search warrants were obtained and forcible entries made into certain places of business and' private residences occupied by the principals in tbese cases, or by one or more of their numerous dummies. True to character, when the authorities expressed the determination to blow open certain safes, these gentry or one of tbem stood by and refused either personally or through representatives, to hand over the keys. Even when one safe bad been blown asunder the - man Bartlett, wbo was an agent of tbese brothers refused to hand over a key wbicb be bad in his pocket for another safe, and that also had to be forcibly, opened, to enable its contents to be impounded by the authorities. Scarcely had the last echo of these explosions died away before tbese persistent tax-evader? business; were on their knees begging for terms from the officers of the Commonwealth. One of the most striking features of tbese deplorable cases is that the taxation authorities, having pursued their inquiries w itb keen intelligence and perseverance up to the stage at wbicb they bad in their possession, apparently, the whole of the papers for which they had so long inquired, when the matter came into the hands of the Government, it immediately fell down upon its joh, and began to traffic with these malefactors as though they were citizens of probity and good name and had not been guilty of any offence much less conspiracy against the Commonwealth. The Attorney-General stated that he accepts full responsibility for the action taken by the Government. My answer is, in the first place, that the honourable gentleman cannot escape responsibility, even if he would. I am bound to add that all the responsibility does not rest upon him personally; it has to be borne by the administration as a whole. The speech of the Attorney-General presents for consideration a number of vital principles, the sanctity of which is endangered by the procedure adopted in tbese cases. The honourable gentleman has issued a challenge to this party and to the country, and the Opposition takes up the gauntlet and joins issue with him. I - submit that these - wrongdoers should have been charged with conspiracy or other appropriate charge in a court of criminal jurisdiction before a jury of their own countrymen. Tbey bave committed a serious offence in the eyes of the law. It is provided in the Commonwealth Crimes Act tbatAny person who conspires with any other person{a) to commit any offence against the law of the Commonwealth, or (b) to prevent or defeat the execution or enforcement of any Commonwealth Act or any regulation under, or (c) to effect any purpose which is unlawful under the law of the Commonwealth, or (nt) to effect any lawful purpose by any means which are unlawful under the law of the Commonwealth. or (e) to defraud the Commonwealth shall be guilty of an indictable offence. Penalty: Imprisonment for three years. There are undoubted facts upon which theseaccused persons might have been successfully indicted under almost every one of the several beads set out in that section. Clearly there is an overwhelming case against them. The Attorney-General preferred that the Commissioner should take certain proceedings under the Income Tax Assessment Act; by virtue of an agreement Mr lirennan. entered into between the Crown and these admitted malefactors, they were not charged with a criminal offence in the strict sense of the term. Tbey were made defendants in a highly respectable, quasi-civil action in which their solicitor entered a defence ou their behalf in these simple terms: "" The ' defendants admit the truth of the whole of the plaintiff's case herein."" Tbat was the defence in answer to charges running into twelve to thirteen pages of closely typewritten matter, setting out a long series of allegations of deception, intriguing, conspiring and evading. Mr Speaker, in the course of your own experience as a distinguished member of the profession which you adorn you have probably seen accused persons enter their pleas in quite different circumstances from these. Legal members like the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Maxwell) and others have seen defendants in the dock under the searchlight of public observation, with the public on the ground floor and the press in the galleries, quaking at the knees, confronted with a record of their ill-doing and called upon to answer the question, "" Do you plead guilty or not guilty?"" But by this agreement, these gentlemen were permitted to sit in their offices and listen to their solicitor reading the record of their fraudulent dealings with the country that bas rendered them so much service. Possibly, growing weary before balf the record was read, they said, "" Tut, tut; therenever mind reading further. Admit it all. Let us get on with some other business."" And there, for the moment, for tbem, the matter ended. The Income Tax Act provides machinery for collecting arrears of tax and for imposing penalties upon those who are in default. Tbese provisions are useful, and they are suited to certain cases. Tbey tend to safeguard the revenue and to enable the Crown to secure payments, and additional payments by way of penalty, from defaulting taxpayers. But they were never intended to, and they do not, in fact, supplant the law of this country which deals as a matter of public policy with grave criminal acts, and - especially sucb acts as are alleged in this case against the Commonwealth and the taxpayers as a whole. Yet, while they were permitted to enter their plea in a dignified and perfectly gentlemanly way, as defendants in what I h.ive referred to as a quasi-civil action-on e hardly knows how to describe it, having regard to the oblique methods adopted by the Government-those.wh o assisted them in their wrongdoing were thrown to the wolves. They were charged before a competent court in the ordinary way, and I.have a record of the cases. It was part of the agreement that they should be so charged and that they should plead guilty. A more extraordinary provision was never included in any agreement: that persons, not parties to it, should be required to publicly plead to certain serious charges involving fraud and discredit. Mr W. R. Bartlett, who stood by while the safes were being torn open was one victim. Eor furnishing a false return he was fined £100. Eanny Cohen and Myriam Hyams were similarly charged and fined. Louis Hyams was fined £100 on the first . charge and £50 on the second charge. Other defendants were fined £100. All of them were mulcted in suitable amounts for costs. These were the dummies and underlings, but it was thought unnecessary that their employers-the millionaires-shoul d be dealt with in the same way as these mere instruments. I submit that cases of far reaching and persistent fraud sucb as this come peculiarly within the category of those that should be dealt with under the heading of conspiracy, but even if that is not so, the action of the Government in this case cannot escape the scorching dicta of Mr. Justice Starke, who has pointed out that the arrangement made by the Crown trespassed upon the province of the judiciary. The Government bas dealt with this case politically and at the best on the basis of expediency, when it sbould have been dealt with judicially and from the standpoint of bigb public policy. No one bas ventured to father the opinion that a charge of conspiracy would not lie against persons. I shall show that there is overwhelming evidence that it would lie, and in this regard a very important fact is that the Government bas not ventured to place on the table the opinion of the counsel upon which it acted. I say, to put it mildly, that it is a great pity that etiquette and precedent sbould be weakly pleaded wben a case of this kind comes up for discussion in the ' national parliament; a case wbicb involves, in a certain sense, the very safety of the nation itself. We have been refused that opinion. I shall not place the worse inference that can be placed on that fact, but shall content myself with saying that the Government may not rely on the contents of a document wbicb it does not dare to produce.",22
51,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Has the Government deliberately withheld that document?,24
52,Mr BEENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,It has deliberately guilty declined to produce it .,24
53,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Has any ground been given ?,24
54,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Tb e Government has said that it is not the usual practice to produce counsel's opinion.,24
55,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Tba t is the reason that the Government bas given, but then the case is not usual. If the opinion ' ; i any way justifies the Attorney General's action, he should, in the interests of the Government have tabled it. I take leave to challenge the honourable gentleman to tell this House that be is satisfied that there were no sufficient grounds upon wbicb those persons could have been indicted for conspiracy. Tbat is a daring challenge, and I have sufficient confidence in the Attorney-General to b«3lieve that he would not misuse his position as the leader of the bar to mislead this House upon this question.",24
56,Mr MAXWELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,O r upon any other.,24
57,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"It is now weil established that an agreement to commit an offence is an indictable conspiracy, no matter whether the principal offence is punishable on indictment or not. The principal offence may be a minor offence, yet an agreement to commit it is a conspiracy. In this case there was an agreement to commit, not a minor offence, but a grave series of offences, and that was a conspiracy. The Attorneythese General bas, I think, admitted that an indictment for conspiracy would lie, but he bas made some remarkable statements in explanation of the fact that sucb a presentment bas not been filed. One is that ""where proof is available of the actual offence it is usual to proceed on that charge and avoid the difficulty of proving the agreement or conspiracy. He instanced the case of an agreement to commit burglary. He said, rightly, that when two or more persons break into a house at night that is usually donepursuant to a conspiracy, but the Crown is satisfied with charging the delinquents, if it can lay tbem by the heels, with the crime of burglary, not with conspiracy. Tbat is perfectly true, yet the illustration is unfortunate for the Attorney-General, because the Crown puts sucb men on trial before a jury on the serious charge, and that is exactly what we say sbould bave been done in this case. Further, the Attorney-General said that be was not uninfluenced-whic h I think, clearly means that he was influenced, although that form of speech was designed to temper the crudeness of the declaration-by the fact that he saw no reason why honest taxpayers sbould not receive the benefit of a contribution from dishonest taxpayers. All right-minded persons, whether lawyers or laymen, will agree that that excuse is as dangerous as it is specious. If it were valid, many an embezzler, or conspirator, indeed, possibly many another criminal, would be in the happy position of being able to plead restitution in bar of prosecution; and most of them would have a great deal less to restore than the Abrahams brothers have been required to pay back. But not only is restitution not admitted as a bar to prosecution, but the law sets its face so sternly against any practice of the kind that there bas grown up a separate offence known as the compounding of felony. The' action of the Government'in compounding this offence, whether it be a felony or something .else, is open to serious criticism and censure. The principle to which I have just referred is as old as it is well founded; it rests on public morality and security, and upon that old maxim, not always respected, that there should not be one law for the rich and another for the poor. The Attorney-General made much of the allegation that nothing in the agreement gave to the' Abrahams brothers immunity from 1 prosecution. I presume he meant any kind of prosecution. Mr Brennan. said that be would not bave entered into, or permitted any one else to enter into, sucb an agreement. Of course, be would not; indeed, if be bad made such an agreement, or sanctioned the making of it by any person under his authority, he would, I think, have been guilty of an offence himself. There was no agreement in writing, but an agreement was implied as clearly as if it bad been written and sealed that there would not be a particular kind of prosecution, and that the only kind of prosecution that these culprits really fear. If there were not, bow does the Attorney-General account for the frantic efforts of these tax evaders, bidding in rises of hundreds of thousands of pounds, to settle? According to the agreement, the consideration for which Abrahams brothers disgorged their money so freely, was that their papers sbould be returned and the proceedings brought to a speedy termination. Does anybody believe that that was the real import of the agreement ? Obviously, it was not. Having regard to their eager disgorging, it is evident that the hidden meaning of the document was that these defaulters were to be saved from the dock, and from that they bave been saved. There was not, and, in the circumstances could not be, a written agreement; but, strangely enough, it was with these persons of clouded probity, whom the agents of the Commissioner had been , fighting for six or seven years, who bad defrauded the Crown, treated its officers with contempt, refused to deliver up their keys, or to allow their books to ba inspected-it was with tbese persons that the Minister allowed to be made an unwritten arrangement as between gentlemen. Presumably the standard of gentility recognized by him was that embodied in the saying, ""Money makes the gentleman."" It bas been suggested, although never alleged, . that there was barely sufficient evidence upon wbicb tbese malefactors might have been successfully charged with conspiracy, and the Attorney-General pointed out that such a charge would involve extradition of the fugitive delinquents, and lengthy proceedings during which ""the lawyers would have had the time of their lives."" That cheap gibe about the legal He profession might have come more fittingly from lips other than those of the Attorney-General, the chief lawyer of the Commonwealth. My view is that in making that statement the Attorney-General was playing to the gallery. As to whether there was evidence upon which a charge of conspiracy could have been founded, I shall quote a few sentences from the report of the proceedings before Mr Justice Starke in the High Court. Honourable members should take the opportunity to read from the file in the library this in teresting report, which would for m a very intriguing scenario for a film. Mr . Justice Starke saidThe whole case seems to be based upon conspiracy. Why were they not prosecuted for conspiracy under the Crimes Act?",24
58,Sir EDWARD MITCHELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Because , in the circumstances of the case, as the facts were ascertained after the raid and on the certificate of the Attorney-General, it was determined that there was not sufficient chance of getting a conviction before a jury. 1"" hesitate to say of so distinguished a member of the bar as Sir Edward Mitchell anything more than that that statement is a masterpiece of justifiable evasion-justifiable , because he bad his brief, and had to submit sucb reasons as occurred to b i m at the moment.",26
59,Mr JUSTICE STARKE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,A reasonable inference would be that they might have been committed to gaol.,26
60,Sir EDWARD MITCHELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"There was evidence at the time these facts were discovered from which there may be a strong inference drawn, but subject to great difficulty of proof. Sir Edward bad here weakened slightly.",26
61,Mr JUSTICE STARKE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"That is not for the Attorney-General to decide; that is a matter for a jury. I respectfully concur. The Attorney General told us of the issue of a search warrant, and the raid upon the business premises of the Abraham brothers, and he saidThe search resulted in definite evidence of fraud., Then he added these remarkable wordsDetailed examination of the papers would probably have occupied eighteen months. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman desired that observation to be taken literally; it seems to me in credible. But if the watch dogs of the department, in the course of an investigation extending over a few hours were able to obtain what the Attorney-General described as "" definite evidence of f r a u d , "" what might they not have found during an examination extending over eighteen months ? The matter is placed outside the realm of argument by the further observation of Mr Justice StarkeI t is plain on this materialand that material was before the Crown at all material timesthat the defendants operated together, and, possibly with others, systematically to de fraud the Commonwealth. Mr E . RILEY - That is common sense. Mr BREMSTAlsr - It is more; it is a judicial finding of clear conspiracy, and, but for the risk of overloading the proofs, one might refer to some observations by the Commissiouer, who is referred to in the' preamble of this most questionable agreement as having said that he was satisfied that he was in possession of the whole of the information, and sumcient. to enable him to make the assessments. He could not bave been in possession of sufficient information to make those assessments without having suflicient evidence on which to found a charge of conspiracy against the delinquents. There is in this case the clearest evidence of what the judge described as a widespread conspiracy. Indeed, the defendants in their frantic desire to come to a settlement, made sucb admissions, and such a lavish surrender of money, that if they bad been arraigned upon a charge of conspiracy, it is perfectly obvious that the case would not bave extended over months and years, but that they would have entered a plea of guilty on the first day of the trial. Then if their counsel bad been in a position to say for them standing in the dock, "" Your Honour, these persons bave made ample restitution,"" they - might still have evaded gaol. We would not complain of an exercise of clemency of that kind, and in such circumstances the public conscience would have been satisfied. But we say that clemency sbould bave been exercised by a judicial and not an executive act, and in the full light of day in the courts. But what really happened? Feeling that they did not deserve clemency, as they did not desire trial, tbese men rushed the Government with offers for a settlement. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Theodore) asks me what these bids were. I do not know that I have seen a statement of the precise amounts. The Attorney-General expressed the position in the dignified manner appropriate to his office by saying that first the defendants made one offer that was refused; then they made another offer that was refused, and then they made a third offer that was accepted. When the first offer was made, the Government said "" Get the behind me, Satan."" Wben another £100,000, or let it be £200,000-wha t does it matter? - wa s added to the offer, the Government said "" Get the behind me, Satan; but not so far behind."" When a third offer, of £500,000 was made, then, and not till then, did the Government, accustomed to tliink, act and speak in terms of money prices, say, "" Satan, after all, you're a sport; we accept it."" In this connection I think that I should be permitted to quote from one of the papers laid upon the table of the library by the Attorney-General. It is part of an affidavit subscribed by Mr Birch, apparently a most vigilant, enthusiastic .and capable officer of his department, wbo has been in the forefront of those carrying out these investigations. Paragraph 19 begins in tbese termsShortly after the warrant had been executed, and documents and papers removed as aforesaid, offers of settlement were received by the Crown Solicitor and counsel for the. tiffs from counsel acting for the defendants. Counsel advised the Crown Solicitor, however, that the offers made should not be submitted to the Commissioner until hasty examination of the documents seized had been made aud somo opinion formed as to what evidence had been obtained. The offers were, therefore, refused: but counsel for the defendants persisted in increasing, on each refusal, the amount of his previous offer, until finally an offer was made to pay the sum of £500,000, together with;the sum of £10,000 for costs, and to plead guilty in this honourable court to taxation prosecutions averring fraud, and to abide by such judgment as this honourable court should think fit. I make some comments on this paragraph. My first remark is that every succeeding offer was an additional reason why all offers should bave been rejected, if rightly appreciated and understood. In the second place, wby do we find these words, "" the offers made should not be submitted to the Commissioner until hasty examination of the documents seized had been made""? For seven years Mr Brennan. the department had pursued tbese men, and sought the opportunity that was now in their bands to get their papers. The officers of the department had made these searches. They bad followed tbese men from State to State. They bad suffered insult and ignominy in the discharge of their duties. Yet wben they had got everything in their hands, when they had blown in the defendants' safes, and had gathered in their papers, the Government, I repeat, fell down on its job and declined to press the prosecution home. A "" hasty "" or perfunctory examination was - stipulated of papers which it took years to discover. And why did the affidavit say, further, that counsel for the defendants "" persisted in increasing"" the offer ? There is a note of complaint in that. The suggestion is- "" Tbey should not have made it so bard as they did for the department to resist the offer. Tbey should not have offered us so much. How could they expect us to keep on refusing an offer bounding up by hundreds of thousands of pounds at every leap?"" Then the defendants agreed to ""plead guilty in this honourable court."" I may not be in possession of the full facts, because 1I have not all the papers; but where have they pleaded guilty in this honourable court ? "" I quoted the terms of their plainplea-thei r highly respectable defence in the circumstances that I have mentioned-and I have already shown in what material particulars that plea differs from that with wbicb criminal lawyers are familiar. The underlings were proceeded against by way of information - a criminal procedure; the principals by action- a civil ""proceeding. I leave that aspect of the case for the moment. I say that this tendency of those not represented by honourable members on this side to speak, and think, in terms of price in matters of public morality is to be deprecated. There are some things too precious to be sold at any price, and too dear to be bought at any price. One of those things is the pure administration df the criminal law. After all, what bave tbese prime delinquents suffered ? It is true that the extraction of £500,000 from persons of this type of mind must have been a very painful major operation; but the average man asks"" What is it to part with half a million, when one lives in the serene atmosphere of many millions "" ? Verily, what is half a million in such circumstances?  they were making a lot more.",26
62,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"The interjection is pertinent. In the phrase rendered i m mortal by the Treasurer, they have "" dropped the l o o t "" ; but have they dropped all the loot? That is one of the points that arises, and it is germain to that portion of my motion that speaks of the safeguarding of the revenues of the Commonwealth. It is not unreasonable to suppose that these defendants have garnered into their already swollen coffers hundreds of thousands of pounds in excess of the money that, with penalties-and in some cases double and treble taxation-the y bave so reluctantly, in the first place, and so eagerly at last yielded up. The Attorney-General himself has supplied information and evidence, in this regard. In the speech to which I bave referred be statedHis Honour apparently had not considered the fact that Parliament had expressly conferred upon the Commissioner the power of assessing what may be properly described .as penalties to the extent of double tax. If treble tax is desired, proceedings - must be taken in court, and for a period limited to three years. This fact was pointed out to His Honour in the afternoon of yesterday. Double tax on £140,000 would be £280,000. which would mean a total sum of £420,000 claimable by the department, in addition to the £354,000 referred to. If one adds £420,000 to £354,000, one bas a much larger sum than that which, after all the Commonwealth prides itself on having collected from tbese defaulting taxpayers. There is not the slightest doubt that, if the Government had not grown tired of receiving and rejecting offers in settlement, the defendants would bave offered still larger sums; but the parties reached the stage that is eventually arrived at by all bargainers. The Government began to wonder, as one does in playing a game of poker, looking at the faces of the other players, whether the defendants might be relied upon to go a little higher. One asks whether, if the Government bad put the matter to the test, theset gentlemen who were so eager to settle the case, might not have cheerfully gone up to the amount of £700,000 odd, which, according to the Attorney-General himself, there was pretty clear evidence, was due.",28
63,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,If the honourable member will read on be will find that I spoke to the contrary.,28
64,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I bave not a copy of the honourable gentleman's speech before me; but I bave tried to do b i m full justice in that regard. My recollection is that he said that there was evidence of that. Erom my knowledge of human nature, and the special knowledge that we have of tbese defendants, the inference is not only reasonable that tbese additional hundreds of thousands of pounds were due, but also that still further hundreds of thousands could justly have been collected from them. There are no similar cases; but ] submit that view as a reasonable inference from all the facts, and from our knowledge of cases perbaps remotely parallel. I have said that all. that tbese men bave been called on to do bas been in the nature of a more or less partial restitution of what belongs to the Commonwealth. Not only have we these proofs of successful acts of swindling, which have gone on since the Commonwealth taxation laws were first established, but I am reminded of an interjection made by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), wben the Attorney-General was speaking. Wben the Minister said that there was evidence of these frauds going back to 1915, the honourable member remarked, ""Yes, and much longer than that."" The Attorney-General, without any attempt to score off the honourable member, replied that federal income taxation was introduced only in 1915. \, Honourable members on that side of the chamber, with less knowledge and not so good memories as the honourable member for Melbourne, thought that the Attorney General bad scored at his expense. The honourable member knew perfectly well, however, as I know, that for more than a quarter of a century these men have borne a name synonymous with f r a ud and dishonest dealing in every department in which they have operated, either by themselves or through their agents. The Attorney-General will plume himself on having safeguarded the revenue. I submit that he bas not done so. Does he really contend, in face of the admission made by these defendants, in face of the papers in his possession, and in face of the overwhelming mass of other evidence which be has at his disposal, that be would bave been unable to collect' the amount owing, as a civil debt? I maintain that it would be possible to collect it as sucb, even if the charge of conspiracy should fail upon any technical or other ground, though I cannot see bow it .could possibly fail. Another consideration under this head is, bow did two of the defendants leave Australia wben they were under, suspicion, and while they were being watched by officers of the Home and Territories Department,. and, presumably, of the Taxation Department. Two of them have been hybernating-if that is the correct expression-or should we say lucubrating-abroad. At one stage I .asked the Attorney-General, in my innocence, bow it came that two of the defendants had pleaded guilty in their absence. He said that they bad put in a defence by their solicitors. When I saw the nature of their defence I can easily understand the simple method of their plea of guilty. Perbaps they were not even consulted on the matter; but let us .give tbem credit for having known something about it. They entered their plea of guilty, by joining in. a defence in which everything is admitted. I have not heard any explanation or excuse, however, as to why they were allowed to leave Australia. Is it not a fact that before a person can leave Australia be has to obtain a passport, and is it not a fact that ordinary, common people before leaving Australia have to pay their debts ? How is it that . passports were issued to these tourists? thing becomes more complicated from the fact that a capable officer was appointed to watch Mr Emanuel Abrahams. am told that the watcher and the watched established very pleasant relations between themselves, that they used to foregather and enjoy themselves thoroughly. It has been alleged on oath, and not satisfactorily disproved, that the officer of the Government detailed on this business has been handsomely rewarded for Mr Brennan. his services by the person he was detailed to watch, and that when this taxpayer elected to leave Australia he bade farewell to the watcher on the wharf, waving his hand to him, and saying au revoir. Up to the present it bas been a matter of good-bye not au devoir, because he bas not - returned. So far we bave bad no explanation of the conduct of this representative or instrument of the Government, whose business it was to safeguard the revenues of the Commonwealth.",28
65,Mr RODGERS,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Excep t his dismissal from the Government Service.,29
66,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"It is true that that officer was, we have been told,' dismissed from the Service. There was a departmental inquiry, one of those investigations that are held behind closed doors, and I am not at all sure that full justice was done to Mr Gabriel in the case. I should like to know much more about it, but the Government bas afforded us no information as to wby tbese absconders were allowed to tour, wben they sbould bave been required to pay. The Government, it is true, has hardly been more than an interested spectator of this sideshow, and the Attorney-General, I am certain, got nothing out.of it. Even the Treasurer bas not referred to the case as an explanation of his own financial difficulties. A word now as to the observa- . tion of the Attorney-General that the successful prosecution of these men in the higher, rarer, and purer atmosphere of the courts would bave been difficult or impossible, and that it would bave involved time and expense. It is the boast of our historic institutions that the chariot of justice goes inexorably on disregarding both time and expense. True The it is that in the past, in the name of justice, grave injustices have been done; true it is that in the name of punishment I monstrous and savage penalties have been exacted, but admitting all that, not until this present day and in connection with this present agreement, has a government declared that the way is too bard, the task too great, and the price too bigb to pay for justice. In the preamble to this curious agreement, I read tbese wordsWhereas the taxpayers are advanced in years, have sintered and are suffering in health. and business in consequence of these allegations and proceedings, whereas they express their willingness and desire to end all further inquiries, litigation and expense by settling all claims, demands and penalties. ""Suffering in health "" ! Ye gods and little fishes; "" And in business"". I do not wish to play on the emotions of honourable members, but I have seen, as the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) has seen, old men helped into the dock to wait there weary hours while the machinery of the law worked its way upon them, and no question was ever raised as to their health or their business. I have seen women, the mothers of children, in a like position; and the question has never arisen as to their health or business; much less has it been suggested to the judge on the bench that the position at that stage might be met by restitution and compensation. Even if the prosecution for conspiracy should fail-and it could fail-let it be remembered that there still stand those scathing remarks of Mr. Justice Starke, in which he stated that matters of penalty were confided to the judiciary, and not to the executive, and that the act did not contemplate the Government and any party agreeing together as to the amount of penalty. Such a course, he added, was contrary to the policy and plain intention of the act. It may be said that I am appearing the new role of one who is urging oppresright sive penalties, and that I am acting the part of the sleuth in pursuing these persons, and pressing for vindictive punishment. There has never been a time wheu it has not given me real pleasure to witness the exercise of clemency. But let it be clemency applicable to all. Let it be clemency exercised in the open light of day, above all, let it be clemency that be purchased by the rich man at pense of the community as a whole. I suppose it would be too much to expect that I could be thought to address myself to this subject free from the influences of party politics. I am trying to do so, but I ask honourable members opposite to remember, when they come to pass judgment on this case, that there public opinion developing outside. It found expression in the press, and i finding expression in the streets. Tbis motion has not been fashioned in such a way that it prevents any honourable member upon the Opposition side of the House from recording his vote with the Government if be thinks that the Minister has acted rightly, or prevents a Government supporter from, showing his opinion of the case by voting with the Opposition. It may be in its terms a vote of censure, but it is desired that it sbould express the feeling of this House independent of party. I invite those gentlemen opposite, to whom the traditions of British jurisprudence are sacred, to uphold those traditions by crossing the floor and voting with us. There are many of my fellow practitioners among honourable members opposite, and I ask tbem to search their memories and their knowledge to find a precedent for the case which they are now being asked to consider. There is nothing more sensitive than the public conscience in regard to the administration of the criminal law, ancl if honourable members agree with me in that, I ask them to uphold the best traditions of our race, in regard to its free and fearless administration. I submit that we, as the representatives of the people in the National Parliament, have resting upon us, in a special way, the duty of establishing precedents worthy of following, and of laying down, particularly in cases in which in are involved issues of this description, rules of conduct. I , therefore, invite every member to support the motion.",29
67,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [4.16] - The important motion which the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has submitted to the House has as its object the condemnation of the Government upon the grounds and stated in it, which he hasdeveloped cannot more fully in his speech. I prothe expose to inquire rather more precisely, and in some respects, more fully than the honourable member bas done into the circumstances which have lead him to move the motion. During and since 1918, the taxation authorities have conducted extensive examinations into the affairs of the Abrahams brothers. is a Tbeir transactions were examined in has the first place for the purpose of making t is sure that the full amount of taxation for which they were liable was being paid by thera. Originally, there was no evidence of fraud, but as the investigations proceeded, many suspicious facts were brought to light. Since 1924, the whole time of a very capable officer of the Taxation Department, Mr Birch, and from a later date, the time of another able oflicer, Mr Neale, has been devoted to an endeavour to disentangle the facts in relation to the business transactions of these persons, so far as it was necessary to do so for the purpose of ascertaining the full extent of their liability to Commonwealth income taxation. The position was extraordinarily complicated. One of the affidavits, which is available for perusal by honourable members, shows that it was necessary to make an examination into the financial affairs of 28 separate individuals, seven companies, and twelve partnerships, in order to endeavour to ascertain the exact amount of taxation which the Abrahams brothers should pay. It will therefore be realized that the investigations required a great deal of time and a high degree of skill. By 1924 the omcers of the department had satisfied themselves that serious frauds had occurred, but they considered that there was no evidence available upon which a definite charge could be laid, and that they were only at the beginning of their investigations. The honourable member for Batman asked, in the course of his speech, how it happened that two of the principals were allowed to leave Australia. I have made inquiries into that matter from officers of the Taxation Department, and I am informed that in 1925 the solicitor for one of the brothers notified the Investigation Branch of the department that his client desired to travel abroad. He drew attention to a certain legislative provision which enabled the Commissioner of Taxation to require a deposit on account of liability to taxation from persons who intended to leave the Commonwealth, and asked what sum should be deposited. The Commissioner fixed the amount at £150,000. At that time no charge had been laid against any of the brothers, and no facts were in the possession of the department which justified them in asking for any arrests to be made. But instructions were given to the Home and Territories Department, which controls the issue of passports, that a passport Mr Latham. was not to be granted to any of the brothers without the approval of the Taxation Department. By some means or other, two of the brothers succeeded in getting out of Australia, and their whereabouts bave not since been discovered. Honourable members will appreciate the difficulty which the officers have bad in dealing ' with the case ou this account. The honourable member for Batman has said something about defendants standing in the dock to answer charges. The difficulty has been, and still is, to get the defendants into the dock, for no one knows where two of these persons are. It is all very well to talk about proceeding against individuals when they are available to be proceeded against, but there is no known means of presenting persons on a criminal charge except by putting them in the dock. Diligent inquiries bave been made to ascertain where tbese persons are, but, notwithstanding information which has been received from time to time that they are supposed to be here, there, or somewhere else, they have not been discovered. The investigation into the affairs of these persons continued during 1925, 1926, and 1927, but no satisfactory evidence was obtained upon which the Commissioner of Taxation thought that be would be justified in proceeding. Accordingly, a conference of counsel engaged in the case, namely, Sir Edward Mitchell, K . C , Mr. Owen Dixon, K . C , Mr Dixon Hearder, Mr Robertson, and Mr Gorman was held, with myself, to consider the matter. During the course of the investigations the Crimes Act bad been amended - in 1926-and power was provided for the law authorities to issue search warrants in such cases. It was decided to exercise this new power, and to search eight houses or offices which were occupied by the defendants or their agents in Melbourne. As the honourable member for Batman bas pointed out, extreme steps had to be taken, and most drastic measures adopted, before the persons authorized to make the search were able to complete their investigations.",30
68,Mr MAXWELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Was this after the departure of the two Abrahams brothers?,31
69,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Yes .,31
70,Mr LET,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,The Attorney-General might explain how they came to obtain passports.,31
71,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"It is presumed that they left Australia without passports. It is believed that they went away as members of a crew. That is how it is usually done; but what really happened in this case is not known. I think it will be agreed that at this stage, at all events, the Government Avas not animated by any feeling of friendship towards tbese persons. Tbeir offices and private bouses were compulsorily and thoroughly searched. I was severely criticized for authorizing, in connection with the case, the search of a solicitor's office, but I sidered that the interests of the public justified me in ordering that to be done. ""Wben I was approached by the Law In stitute on this matter, I defended and justified my action. The evidence obtained by means of tbese searches established definitely that there bad been a fraudulent understatement of income to a large amount; and also a fraudulent evasion of income taxation. At the same time, the case was extremely complicated. The frauds were effected largely by means of the establishment of companies which were separate legal entities from their shareholders or the Abrahams brothers, and were used as a means of obscuring the income of all the parties concerned. Very many of the acts done were not done by the individuals personally, but by some other person acting under a power of attorney. This made very difficult the sheeting home of personal responsibility. Difficult questions of law were involved. One of tbese was whether the income of the companies which were formed was all to be regarded as being really the income of individuals. As a general rule, it would be impossible to establish the proposition that the income of a company was to be regarded as the income of an individual. The advice of counsel was taken on this matter, and it was decided to proceed upon the basis that the Abrahams brothers were to be charged income taxation in respect of all the income of the companies which they had formed. It was upon that basis that the Commissioner acted in all subsequent proceedings. An important element in the case, however, is that there is room for serious argument and doubt as to whether it would be held, if the point were contested in a court, that all those [150 ] companies could be regarded as agents for individual taxpayers. If that contention, were not upheld, a large portion of the claim which the Commissioner of Taxation has made upon the Abrahams brothers would disappear. The question then arose as to the proper action to take to protect the public interest. The considerations which weighed with the Government and with myself in advising it upon this matter, were, first, that there sbould be adequate punishment of all the con- individuals - concerned, and' that there should be a complete vindication of the law; secondly, that there sbould be a proper public exposure of all the persons concerned in the fraudulent transactions which bad occurred; and, thirdly, that the revenue should be protected. Tbese matters were considered by the five counsel whose names I bave mentioned, together with the Crown Solicitor, the Solicitor-General, and myself. I advised the Government as to the general course to be pursued, though the multifarious details involved in carrying out that course were left to the Crown Solicitor and to counsel. Two courses were open. One was a prosecution for conspiracy under the Crimes Act, with a penalty of three years' imprisonment or a fine of £300, together with prosecutions under the Income Tax Act. The other was a prosecution under the Income Tax Act only. I considered whether it was proper and possible, having regard to the public interests concerned and to all the circumstances, to prosecute upon a charge of conspiracy, which might result in the imprisonment of those concerned. In considering that various matters bad to be taken into account. Primarily, conspiracy to commit an offence is itself an offence, independent of whether' or not the offence is committed. Conspiracy consists in the agreement to commit an offence. I am not aware of any case where a charge of conspiracy bas been brought in which there has been evidence of the commission of the actual offence. It may be that there are such cases. I was perfectly prepared in this case to advise the Government to adopt both courses if I could see that there .was anything like a reasonable chance of success, and if the procedure was justifiable in the interests of the public and the vindication of the law. As was suggested by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) there are various types of conspiracy wbicb bad to be considered in relation to this matter. There was no direct evidence of an actual - agreement among the three Abrahams brothers to break the law. Was there, then, sufficient indirect evidence of an agreement to justify submission of the case to a jury ? Under our system of jurisprudence it is the duty of Attorney-General, in the case of indictable offences, to determine whether there shall be a prosecution. He determines, upon a consideration of the facts, whether the legal evidence justifies the person concerned being placed upon trial. It is not as the honourable member for Batman seemed to suggest, by citing Mr Justice Starke, for a jury to determine whether a person,should be tried upon a particular offence. That must be determined by the executive authority charged with the administration of the law. Had proceedings for conspiracy been taken it would have been necessary to see that there was evidence against each defendant of his implication in the agreement, wbicb would have been the foundation of the charge. It would bave been necessary to establish against each defendant-ba d we bad all the defendants, which we had not-tb e existence of a conspiracy by evidence admissible against bim, and not merely against his brothers; also the fact that be was a party to that conspiracy. The matter was carefully examined by counsel, by the Crown Solicitor, and by the Solicitor-General. honourable member for Batman stated that tbese opinions had not been laid upon the table of the House and made available for publication, and complained that I had relied on what I described as "" the universal practice of Parliament."" There are reasons wbicb should satisfy honourable members that the course suggested is not a sound one when the Commonwealth is a litigant. The closure of counsel's advice would convey information to the opposing litigant while the case was still the court. It is desirable that the Commonwealth should be .in at least as good a position as any person in the community to obtain absolutely independent advice from the Bar of this country. Mr Latham. independent advice, in accordance with the generally recognized rule, can be obtained only upon the understanding that it is treated as confidential. In the public interest counsel's advice cannot properly be disclosed. Tbat this is well recognized may be seen by reference to the recognized authorities on parliamentary procedure, May and Bonrinot, wbicb clearly state the principle estabthe lished in the House of Commons and the Canadian Parliament. These matters were considered by counsel and by the officers of my department. I acted rightly in obtaining the best advice available, but I must bear responsibility for the action which I advised the Government to take. As the honourable member for Batman justly said, I cannot evade that responsibility. I bave never sought to evade it. I considered all the information available. There were the serious difficulties of proof to which I have referred, arising from the existence of companies wbicb are separate legal entities or individuals; many acts were done by persons acting under a power of attorney, and, therefore, could not be charged as the personal act, of the principal to the power of attorney. Conspiracy is a notoriously difficult charge to prove. Generally it is adopted only as a last resource. Wben it is impossible to charge a person successfully with the commission of an actual offence, and where it is plain that there bas been a breach of the law, a conspiracy charge is sometimes laid, but it is a rare procedure. The In a conspiracy case what is evidence against "" A "" is not evidence against "" B "" and "" C."" In this case two of the three proposed accused were beyond the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, aud it was impossible to stand them in the dock. It may be unfortunate, but that was so. That was the set of circumstances to which I bad to address myself. I bad to act at the time. I could dis- not wait indefinitely on the chance that inquiries which were being made would some day prove successful, by locating before the whereabouts of the other two men. I was also influenced by the knowledge that a delay of many months might bave quite serious results. A full examination of the documents would take many Tbat months. In saying that I am acting on information supplied to me, as I have not personally read the documents. It would have taken a still longer period before the prosecution could have been brought into the courts. One taxpayer, Alfred Abrahams, was here. Honourable members will recognize that, as the matter is still in a sense in the hands of the court, I labour under some difficulty in saying anything which may be used even now against the interests of the Commonwealth. But I am at liberty to say that the evidence of conspiracy-as distinct from fraud-agains t Alfred Abrahams was so particularly weak as to be almost negligible. There was no evidence upon which any responsible law officer could properly bave put the only available defendant upon his trial. I do not wish, in submitting these legal considerations to the House, to give any ground for the suggestion that I bave any doubt as to what the facts were. I bave no moral doubt that there was a great and far-reaching conspiracy. The difficulty was to prove the allegations by legal evidence against the only individual wbo could bave been made to answer the charge. An attempt to reach the other two brothers, wbo were the real principals in the matter, would have involved great delay, enormous expense, and the result would necessarily have been uncertain. When they were found, extradition proceedings would be necessary; and we do not know from which country they would have to be extradited. After many months, or even years, the matter might bave reached the stage of trial. In the meantime all other proceedings would have to be held up, awaiting the termination of the criminal proceedings. It is not the ordinary practice, and it would not be proper to proceed civilly against any person wbo is answerable to a criminal charge in relation to the same subject matter as that with wbicb the civil proceedings deal. Prosecution for conspiracy held the prospect of indefinite delay, and, in the meantime, there would bave been no way whereby the Commonwealth revenue could be protected. I submit to honourable members that that was a circumstance which it was proper for me to take into consideration, although the honourable member for Batman bas seen fit to suggest that in no cir- cumstances sbould it bave entered into consideration.",32
72,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I did not. I said that, in addition to other lapses, the honourable gentleman bad lost money on the transaction.",34
73,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Then I misunderstood the honourable member. Even though we bad searcbe'd safe deposits, and actually bad in our bands a tremendous sum of money in Commonwealth bonds, there was no legal method of obtaining anything on account of the liability as taxpayers if a conspiracy charge had been lodged. All civil proceedings would have had to wait for an indefinite period until the defendants were brought to Australia and duly charged. I decided, therefore, that if there were any other means available to vindicate the law, to expose and punish the defendants, and to secure what was justly owing to the revenue of the Commonwealth, it would not, in the circumstances, be proper to institute proceedings for conspiracy on the remote chance of convicting only one of the principals, and of securing a sentence of imprisonment against him, with an extreme penalty of £200 as an alternative to imprisonment. That conclusion was the result of the best and most earnest consideration that could be given to the case after obtaining advice in highly qualified quarters. It would, I am prepared to concede, be open toanybody else to come to a different conclusion. But my conclusion was as I bave stated. The considerations which weighed in my mind were those wbicb I bave mentioned, and no others. There was, and is, no agreement not to prosecute for conspiracy. The whole agreement is contained in the document which is available to honourable members. An agreement not to prosecute for conspiracy would, itself, bave been an offence under the Commonwealth Crimes Act, which contains a special section dealing with compounding an offence against the Commonwealth law. I am at least sufficiently instructed in law not to render myself liable to a penalty of three years' imprisonment for doing what the honourable member for Batman bas practically suggested that I have in substance, or in effect, done. Nothing of the kind was done at all. With regard to conspiracy, the. question arose whether the acceptance of the offer would be a satisfactory means of vindicating the law, punishing the offenders and giving full publicity to their frauds. Had there been no such offer, it would have been necessary to take the only other means afforded by law. ""The legislature bas dealt specifically with income tax offences, bas provided severe penalties for them, and bas laid down the procedure for enforcing penalties. It is important that honourable members should understand precisely what Parliament has done in relation to income tax offences as evidenced in the legislation of the Commonwealth. The Income Tax Assessment Act of 1915 provided that the Commissioner might, in the case of a person understating his income, charge-an additional 10 per cent., which amount, if thought fit by the Commissioner, might be remitted. Section 60 of that Act reads:Any person who, with intention to defraud, in any return understates the .amount of any income, shall be guilty of an indictable offence. Penalty; £500 and au amount equal to treble the amount of income tax which would have been avoided if the income stated in the return had been accepted as the correct income. Section 61 reads:Any person, who, by any wilful act, default, or neglect, or by any fraud, art, or contrivance whatever, avoids or attempts to avoid assessment or taxation shall be guilty ' of an indictable offence. Penalty; £500 and treble the amount of tax payment whereof he has avoided or attempted to avoid. In both instances the offender would be tried before a jury because the offences are made indictable offences.",34
74,Mr GREGORY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,No imprisonment is provided.,35
75,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Tba t is so. Those were the precise offences of which evidence was discovered in this case. In 1915 Parliament provided that offenders were to be tried before a jury. In 1918 the law was amended by extending the powers of the Commissioner to enable him to impose double taxation upon any person who failed to include any assessable income in his return, or included deductions to wbicb heijwas not entitled. It also provided that the Commissioner might remit the additional tax or any part thereof. Those provisions are contained in section 59 of the consolidated act of 191.5-18.",35
76,Mr MAXWELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Is "" intent to defraud "" - included in that section ?",35
77,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"No . Under that pro* vision a large discretion was vested in and a heavy responsibility imposed upon the Commissioner in the administration of taxation laws. At the same time the provisions relating to "" intention to defraud"" were left unchanged, except that section 61A, a new section, provided that a prosecution in respect of an offence against either two of the last preceding sections-wbic h I have already read-nia y be commenced at any time within three years after the commission of the offence. Accordingly, in respect of the last three years, offences involving fraud were to be prosecuted before a jury, and treble tax would be imposed. The power of the Commissioner to charge double tax was not an arbitrary power. He could only impose double tax when the facts warranted it. The procedure then was to impose the extra tax upon the offending taxpayer, and if he were not content to pay it, the Commissioner would bave to sue for it and would bave to prove his case. Honourable members will see that Parliament entrusted to the Commissioner large discretionary powers in determining the amount of penalty to be imposed for taxation offences. In 1922 the law was again altered, but the provision allowing the Commissioner to impose by way of penalty a discretionary amount up to double tax was retained. Sections 68 and 69 relating to offences involving fraud, were altered, and it was provided that sucb offences sbould no longer be indictable. Tbey were made simple offences. Tbat meant that income tax offences involving fraud which hitherto were tried before a jury were, instead, to take the form of actions for penalties. Tbat is the law as it stands today, and I bad to be guided by it wben considering what proceedings were to be taken. Trial by jury, when involved accounts are under the consideration of twelve men in a box, is not always a satisfactory method of dealing with taxation offences. I presume that that is one reason why the law was altered in 1922. Honourable members will, I hope, perceive the significance of the action of Parliament itself in deciding that income taxation prosecutions were to be tried not before a j u r y but before a judge only and in the for m of penal actions. The three years' limitation still remained in relation to offences involving fraud. ""When the documents had been examined, it was. decided, in view of the provisions of the act and of the fact that the three years' limitation would expire within a day or two, to issue three writs, in order to save the position. Had those writs been delayed, the opportunity of getting treble taxation for one of the years would bave been lost. The defendant's counsel then, as the honourable member for 'Batman has said, approached the counsel for the Commonwealth. The position was that the Commonwealth possessed the accounts and papers, as well as a large sum of money, belonging to the defendants. Ultimately an offer was made of £500,000 for both tax and penalty. At that stage the matter was brought before me. The picture that the honourable member bas drawn of the continued, Government alternately backing and f i ing and toying with the tempter - has no been foundation in fact whatever. I did not know that any offers were being made until I was informed of the offer of £500,000. It was then m y responsibility to advise the Government whether that offer, or indeed any offer, sbould be cepted. As I bave said, I had already considered the question of conspiracy. considered it again. I determined, reasons that I have placed before the House, that it was neither necessary nor wise to prosecute the single availsideration able defendant for conspiracy, . and prosecution the question of accepting the rpffer matter was submitted for the advice of without five counsel and for the considerabeen tion of the Crown Solicitor and Solicitor-General. Honourable members will observe that up to the present II bave contented myself by saying that received the advice of counsel and conceedings sidered it . But in the agreement was prepared by the Crown Solicitor and settled by counsel, the following appear:And whereas the Commissioner has, upon recommendation of counsel employed by him, and of the law officers of the Commonwealth decided to accept the hereinbefore recited offers made by the taxpayers, and to enter into and execute this indenture. o That shows that the agreement was entered into on the recommendation of counsel. I , bave already given to the House the names of the counsel employed by the Commonwealth, and some of them at least are known to every honourable member as worthy representatives of the bar of Australia. Is it likely that those gentlemen would have recommended the Commissioner of Taxation to enter into an agreement possessing the features which the honourable member for Batman has sought to attach to it? Surely ..be mere fact that those gentlemen were prepared to recommend the making of the agreement is in itself very strong evidence, not only of the bona fides but also of the propriety of the action. The omcers of my department and I had no concern in doing anything other than what seemed proper aud i u the public interest. One of the recommendations of counsel, as appears in the agreement, was that public proceedings against the Abrahams brothers and others should be and that there should be a full l l - exposure of tlieir offences. Writs had issued in the High Court for offences against the Income Tax Assessment Act. Tbese proceedings were what Part VIII . of the act describes as "" taxation prosecutions "" ; they were criminal proceedings with a civil form of procedure. Sir acEdward Mitchell in the argument before Mr Justice Starke i u the High Court I stated the position as it appeared to for the counsel in this wayAlthough the Attorney-General, on the conof the facts as given to him, determined that it was not his duty to direct the outside this act, it is a different to say that he would accept £500,000 bringing people like these before the court so that the public would see what has done, and that proper penalties have been the inflicted upon them for doing it. n other words, the Government took such I action as would ensure that tbese prowould receive full publicity. wbicb The Commissioner could, under the powers vested in b i m by Parliament, bave dealt with the matter without taking it to court. Tbat course deliberately and advisedly wa3 not adopted; the legal proceedings preliminary to a trial in court continued, and the defendants agreed to plead guilty. I cannot agree that * the Commonwealth authorities were guilty of any impropriety in accepting such a plea. Seven other persons whose names have been mentioned by the honourable member for Batman as having been associated with the prin cipals in this matter, also pleaded guilty in proceedings before a police magistrate under section 66 of. the Income Tax Assessment Act. The honourable member suggested .that, a distinction was drawn between the Abrahams brothers and their subordinates, in that the latter were forced to run the gauntlet of the police court, whereas the principals were only prosecuted in the High Court - Part VII . of the act sets out the "" penal provisions "" and under section 66, which was selected by counsel as being most applicable to the offences committed by the seven agents, the prescribed penalty is "" not less than two pounds nor more than one hundred pounds."" In the High Court the Abrahams brothers were proceeded against for penalties totalling £266,000. Yet the honourable member for Batman suggests that they sbould have been proceeded agaiust under section 66, which makes the maximum penalty £100.",35

96,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I think the honor? able member for Batman is under a complete misapprehension. Part 8 of the Income Tax Assessment Act provides for what are called "" taxation prosecutions,"" and the agreement with the defendants provided, inter alia, that they undernot to deny but in and by their pleadings admjt the allegations to be made in the statements of claimhereafter to be delivered in the said taxation prosecutions. That I submit amounted to a plea of I guilty; the honourable member for Batman says that it did not.",37
97,Mr BEENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I do. - I am unable to the distinction wbicb the honourable member seeks to draw. The defendants admitted the offences charged submitted themselves to the judgment of the court as to the penalties to be imposed upon tbem. That is the utmost could possibly bave been obtained any taxation prosecution. 13 have already reminded the House that, by an alteration of the law, tbese taxation offences were made unindictable. If the law Lad not been altered and the offences were still indictable, the procedure would have been different. The agreement dated 26tb September, 1927, was drawn up by the Grown Solicitor, and was settled by counsel for the CommonAvealth. I did not see the agreement until after it was signed and completed. I cannot be expected to supervise all the details of my department; accordingly I left the details of this matter to the Crown Solicitor and counsel. The honourable member bas referred to that portion of the recital which set forth that the defendants were aged and in ill-health, and I agree to some extent with his comments thereon. Had I seen the draft of the document, I would not bave sanctioned a recital in those terms. Nevertheless, I must support my officers, and I recognize that the agreement was settled by the solicitors representing both sides. The penalty of £500)000 was arrived at as a round sum, wbicb appeared to be properly payable by way of taxation and penalty, and as not being excessive. If the proceedings bad been con tested it would have been necessary to prove intention to defraud in respect of every separate item and figure. would have been very difficult; indeed, it could not bave been accomplished in respect of all items. In regard to some, the defendants might have been able to prove that there'bad been a mistake, and in respect of others they might successfully have urged that there was no evidence of intent to defraud. Assuming everything in favour of the Commissioner-that his view of the law was correct as to the propriety of regarding the income of the companies as income'of the individuals, and that there was intention to defraud in every error that could be discovered by an analysis of the accounts-the departmental officers calculated that he could under the powers conferred upon bim by the act, without goirig to court at all, have imposed taxes and penalties for the twelve material years amounting to £662,000. It was not possible to prove this claim in its entirety, but it was thought proper not to deal with the matter without full publicity, and for that reason the three yearsin respect of which prosecutions could be instituted under the Income Tax Assessment Act were made the subject of proceedings which came before the High Court. In view of all the circumstances-and honourable members will realise that there were many relevant circumstances other than those referred to by the honourable member for Batman - it was decided to accept an undertaking by .the defendants''to pay £500,000, of which £200,000 was to be paid at once. Tbat money was to be applied to the payment of tax, the Commissioner's penalties, and any penalties wbicb might be imposed by the court. In the opinion of our advisors, the court was free to fix such penalties as it thought proper, and the Commissioner would be content to accept the balance of the £500,000 in satisfaction of his claims. Wben the eases came before the court, the defendants admitted all the facts alleged. The judge expressly stated, and accepted the position, that there was no promise that the defendants would not be prosecuted for conspiracy. I think that the honourable member for Batman, in citing portions of the remarks of Hi3 r Honour, might bave read his final observation upon this matter, given not in the course of argument upon a preliminary, Tbat view, but in his considered judgment, that there was no promise not to prosecu' for conspiracy.",37
98,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Tba t is admitted But I said that it was clearly implied.,38
99,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I welcome the admission. Honourable members will recognize that it is necessary for me to set before tbem what actually occurred, and to make some comments upon it. Tbis necessity bas arisen from the course adopted by - the court in refusing to make an order, either for the plaintiff or the defendants, and adjourning the case sine die. At the same time. I hope that any comments I make will be consistent with the fullest respect for the judiciary. His Honour expressed the opinion, during the bearing of the case, that the penalties provided by the Income Tax Acts were extortionate -. It was at once said by counsel that that was a matter for Parliament and not for the judiciarv. I suggest that it is entirely for Parliament to say whether or not a treble tax is a proper penalty. In his judgment, His Honour said that the sum of £500,000 was ruinous and excessive, and that such an exaction was contrary to law. That statement is the real cause of the attention that has recently been devoted to the case in the press and elsecedent where. His Honour did not appear TO think that the defendants bad been off too lightly, as the honourable member for Batman suggests. I shall read His Honour's words, so that there may be no misunderstanding .on the matter. He saidAs I follow the statement of claim, the evaded and the maximum penalties amount in round figures to the sum of £354;237. The penalties sued for amounted to £266,000, and His Honour took the - amount of tax as being the balance, ing up the sum of £354,237. His Honour continuedBut the Commonwealth is to receive £500,000, and is in addition, according formation given to me by the learned counsel, to retain any tax paid by the companies formed by the defendants in respect of years in question here. Such an exaction contrary to law. Again, the' costs to the last three years was £266,000. amount of £10,000 appear to me far in of any sum that could be recovered in these prosecutions. I may say that other proceedings conmatter, cerning last year, as well as proceedings concerning prior years, were not before the court at all. His Honour continuedNo doubt the sum includes the costs vestigation and of warrants to seize and the premises of the defendants and I am unable to follow on what basis such costs could bave charged are recoverable. Sir Edward assured me, I accept his assurance, that no promise of immunity was offered to the defendants respect of any other proceedings against or their friends, whatever they might expected or hoped from their surprising My duty of investigating this ended, I think, at this point; but enough was omcers was due, namely, £93,190. disclosed to make it clear in my opinion the arrangement with the defendants is trary to the policy and plain intendment of the Income Tax Acts, and has the effect of imposing on the"" defendants a pecuniary liabipenalties amounting to £485,891. lity for tax penalties and costs which excess of any sum recoverable according to The avowed purpose of these proceedings is use the judgment of .this court for the purpose of executing and enforcing the with the defendants, and so long as that arrangement and purpose subsists I am prepared to give any judgment lending of this court to any such purpose. quently, the prosecutions will stand adjourned sine die, and, if circumstances Attorney-General and the Commissioner may apply at any time to restore them to my list for further consideration and judgment. Air. Latham. It will be seen that His Honour, - in the circumstances of the case, exercised his judicial discretion by declining to give judgment for either the plaintiff or the defendants. I am not aware .of any prefor sucb an attitude, and no authority was cited at the bar, or from the let bencb, showing that an order of indefinite postponement had been made in any prior case. With much respect to the court, my view has hitherto been that it is the function of a court to decide cases brought before it according to law, and tax that a court bas no other function. If a court is not satisfied that a plaintiff is entitled tojudgment for the whole or auy - part of the amount claimed, the procedure universally followed, so makfar as I am informed on the matter, has been, unless there is a provision for nonsuit, to give judgment for the defendant, in which case the plaintiff, to inif dissatisfied, may appeal. [Extension of time granted.] The sum sued for as the penalties on the tax alleged and admitted is to bave been fraudulently evaded for the I am excess using round figures. Tbis sum only was the subject of the proceedings before the High Court. Apart altogether from this the Commissioner-upo n the assumptions that I bave mentioned, that everything had been done fraudulently, of inand that the tax on the company incomes search could bave been charged to individualsothers;'but the defendants and 10 per ceut. on the tax for the first three years up to 1918, and double tax for in all years up to 1923-24, wbicb amounts to them the sum of £392,700, and the tax for the have offer. three years 1924-25 to 1926-27, which, in arrangement the opinion of the Commissioner and his In that other words, upon the assumptions that conI have mentioned, the Commissioner was entitled to impose upon the. defendants The is in amount sued for was another sum of law. £266,000, and the facts as to that alone to were before the High Court. If the court arrangement saw proper to impose full treble penalties in respect of every particular item the not liability, as I think honourable members the aid opposite estimated, would amount to conse- £657,000. alter, the I bave already sought to inform honourable members as to the reasons why it was thought that there was no chance of getting that amount from the defendants in any contested proceedings, and why it was considered that £500,000 was a proper sum to accept. On-these facts, nobody could be certain of the proper amount of taxation payable. But 1 proceed with my account of the proceedings before the High Oourt. On the afternoon of the day upon which His Honour bad given judgment, Sir Edward Mitchell attended before the court, and pointed out that the action before it related only to a period of three years. He explained that the agreement related to twelve years' evasion of taxation, that the £354,000 that His Honour bad mentioned related only to three years, and that of that sum only £266,000 was in issue before the court, the £500,000 relating to twelve years. Tbis error was the foundation of the statement in the original judgment that the amount exacted was ruinous and excessive. I naturally bave difficulty in discussing judgment of the court; but I ask the indulgence of honourable members to allow me to say that, in dealing with this matter, I did not consider whether that sum of £500,000 was ruinous or not. I was, I admit, not concerned with that aspect of the case, wben the defendants themselves were prepared to offer that sum. In fact, my mind never adverted to that matter; but, if it bad, I would have left the defendants to consider whether or not the amount they were paying was ruinous. Many persons have been ruined by breaches of the law. His Honour was, unfortunately, plainly in error as to the facts wben be gave his judgment, upon the basis of wbicb so many comments bave been made.",38
100,Mr MAXWELL,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Tb e honourable member for Batman does not agree with Mr. Justice Starke in criticizing it as a ruinous payment.,40
101,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"No , be takes the other view.",40
102,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,I do not disagree with him. I venture to agree absolutely.,40
103,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Hi s Honour said generally that what was pointed out to him affected only the amount. I suggest that the amount is very important, and is, indeed, an essential matter, as the foundation of a portion of the judgment originally given. His Honour said that the arrangement whereby the agreement was arrived at as to the penalties was objectionable in law, and, putting the matter shortly, was wrong. The statements made by the court raise some interesting considerations. If the court had held that the agreement was either beyond the power of the Commonwealth authorities, or was illegal because it was in breach of some definable principle of law, then, obviously, it would have been void and of no effect, and no penalties, ruinous or otherwise, would have been imposed by it on the defendants. The court was at liberty to do what it thought proper. The position appears to be that the court's statement was based on the opinion that the agreement was valid; that it was objectionable, originally because it was thought to be excessive, and finally, because no sucb agreement should have been made, but the whole matter ought to have been left to the judiciary. It seems, the however, upon examination of the statement made by His Honour in adjourning the case, that the court considered that the agreement was a valid one. It is a common practice for parties to arrive at an agreement that a judgment sbould be obtained in certain terms. Sucb an agreement does not bind the court. It is still left to the court to determine the propriety of giving a judgment for one party or the other. But the court does generally give judgment for one of the parties. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth a statute was passed which prohibited the compounding of penal actions by a common informer, and that statute is in force, certainly in Victoria, and possibly in other States of the Commonwealth. A common informer could not compound an action for penalties; but it appears to be a well-established legal principle that the Crown is entitled to compound for sums due to the Crown recoverable on penal action. The law was not argued at all before His Honour, and, therefore, I have not the benefit of a discussion upon it, nor of a judgment of the court; but apparently the action taken by the court shows that the document stands as a valid agreement. The matter is now under, consideration as to whether it is necessary or desirable to take further proceedings for the purpose of clarifying the law. It - would appear that uo practical object is to be gained Vy pursuing the matter further. The revenue has been adequately safeguarded, and the actions of the defendants have been fully exposed. Every man and woman in Australia is aware of the frauds committed. The defendants have suffered large penalties which, while fully punishing them for their offence, will act as a powerful deterrent upon any oue inclined to imitate them. Indeed, I understand that the action taken has already had a wholesome effect in that direction. I venture to suggest that, if the advisors of the Government had adopted any other course they would have laid themselves open to keen criticism. It would have been said that the Government had embarked upon long and expensive litigation with very doubtf u l results, in which there would be long delays, with little chance of a conviction, and relatively small advantage to the revenue. If that course had been followed, and it had subsequently been, revealed that the defendants had offered to admit the offences with which they werecharged, and to pay £500,000 to the revenue, there would have been a positive storm of criticism. It would have been said that the Government was guilty of vindictive conduct in pursuing tbese men,' that such a procedure would have been void of common sense, and regardless of the revenue and interests of the country. The action of the Government was taken after the fullest consideration., after taining the best advice obtainable, with a full sense of responsibility, and with the principles to which the honourable member for Batman has alluded very clearly in mind. I ask the House to say that the allegations made in this motion are not supported, and to say, further, that the best and wisest course was adopted by the Government in circumstances which, I think honourable members will admit, were circumstances of very great difficulty.",40
104,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Yarra) [5.35] - The honourable member for Batmaa (Mr. Brennan) served the public interest by raising this question in Parliament today, and bad bec-failed in this he would not have been doing his duty by the people of Australia. There is a clear indictment running right through his speech. An issue bas been raised wbicb ought not to be evaded by the Attorney General, or by any other representative of the Government; but it has been evaded. There bas been spun around the whole question a cobweb of evasion andlegal jargon. Nevertheless, there stands out this one plain issue, which the Attorney-General has not answered, for the simple reason that be cannot do so. There were three persons in this country, known to the Government to be criminals, who have not been prosecuted, and whom no attempt bas beeu made to prosecute, under the criminal law. Arguments bave been submitted to show the difficulty of conducting a prosecution, but if difficulties were allowed to stand in the way 50 per cent, of the criminals now charged in our courts would never be prosecuted at all. In many cases the charges are not proved because of the difficulties in the way, but that is not a reason, for failing to prosecute. I put it to the Attorney-General that if tbase gentlemen had not come clown handsomely with £500,000, no amount of difficulty would have prevented tbem from being prosecuted. The Attorney-General, in his criticisms of Mr Justice Starke, said that there was no precedent for a judge not giving judgment, either for the defendant or f6r the plaintiff. Perbaps not, but I venture the opinion that there is no precedent in the records of the obcourts for the present case.. Tbat is the point that His Honour stressed. The Attorney-General endeavoured to show that the judge was under a misapprehension. Let me emphasize this point to show the soundness of the opinion given by Mr Justice Starke. The judge never once wavered rigbt through the proceedings from the original stand which be took up that it was not within the province of the Government to usurp the powers and functions of the court. The Attorney General has admitted that tbese investigations go back to 1918, or even to 1917, wheu officers of the department first got on to the track ot the defendants because they made the initial blunder of their career in testing the assessment of the Commissioner of Taxation. The Attorney-General further said that in 1924 they were satisfied that there was serious .fraud. They were satisfied in 1924 even before they saw the documents which subsequently came into their possession. Then two of the Abrahams, bo said, left the country by some means or. other. Tbat, I say, is one of the worse of the half-dozen evasions of which the Attorney-General bas been guilty today. One would imagine that we bad read nothing about the matter, and that the only person who knew anything concerning it was the Attorney-General. What was done in regard to the departure )f these men from Australia? The omcers of the Taxation Department were satisfied in 1924 that there was serious fraud. Yet in 1925 these men left Australia, although they bad at that time on their track an officer of the department specially detailed to watch them.",41
105,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"That is not true, so far as I know. I was told that no officer bad been detailed to watch tbem.",42
106,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"That makes the indictment even stronger, because, on the Attorney-General's own admission, the department was satisfied in 1924 that, there was serious fraud; yet no watch was put upon the men concerned.",42
107,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"It would be necessary to watch hundreds of suspects if that course was generally followed. Mr Scullin"" - A story concerning the departure of Emanuel Abrahams was circulated at that time.",42
108,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,It is very doubtful if >.t was true. We are trying to find out.,42
109,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Is the rigbt honourable gentleman satisfied now that the man bas left Australia? Apparently """"ie cannot say whether the man has left the country, or where be is, but he can accept a plea of guilty from bim, and enter into an agreement with bim.",42
110,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"If the honourable gentleman will look at the agreement, be will see that it was entered into by an attorney for the defendant. Mr 'SCULLIN - The Attorney-General ought to know that no attorney can sign an agreement on behalf of any one until he has secured the authority of the person concerned. If there is a criminal action pending, and an attorney knows the whereabouts of the person charged, he can be dealt with in order to make him disclose that knowledge. Wbo is sheltering this man? Tbat is another matter which ought to be investigated. Writs were issued against the defendants, and pleas were entered by them. The defence was practically that they would plead guilty to anything with which they were charged. The legal representatives of the Government say, in effect, "" We cannot find the defendants, but we can enter into an agreement with tbem."" How does the Attorney-General know that this precious agreement will ever be honoured? What proof has be that it will ever be carried out.",42
111,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"We have £200,000 worth of securities, and guarantees for the rest.",42
112,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,How does the right honourable gentleman know that Emanuel Abrahams will not turn up and repudiate this agreement?,42
113,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I should be very glad to see him. ' Mr Scullin - Honourable members opposite think that that is humorous, because every member who sits behind the Government knows that these men are criminals, and that there is no chance of their ever coming back and repudiating the agreement lest they should suffer the penalty of their offence. If they bad not come back, and no £200,000 bad been made available, an attempt would have been made by the Government to find and prosecute tbem. Just imagine the head of the legal department'of the Government saying that it was not advisable to pursue the defendants because it would be necessary to obtain their extradition, a course which would involve expense and delay. If some poor unfortunate person, probably as a result of his circumstances and environment, committed a burglary, stealing, perhaps, only £10, he would be extradited from whatever country be may have fled to, uo matter what the time or expense involved. The wheels of the law would be set in motion, and assistance of all the criminal investigation organizations of the world would, if necessary, be invoked for the purpose of bringing that person back to Australia. The Government is not able to declare to this House that it has made the slightest attempt to - fiad these departed persons, or to bring them to justice.",42
114,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Attempt s were made.,42
115,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"The Attorney-General gave a reason why a certain important document was not produced, and his was the most specious argument to which I have ever listened. He said that it was the universal practice not to disclose counsel's opinion, and yet it is on counsel's opinion that the Government has acted. He buttressed that argument witli the further plea that if ""the Government made available the opinions of counsel, it would give away its case to the other side. He said that litigation was still before the court. But is it? Is there any intention on the part of the Government to prosecute these persons on a criminal charge or to take any further action against tbem? I say quite definitely that there is not. Thus the argument of the Attorney General is specious. The case has been taken out of the field of litigation by the signing of this agreement. The Attorney General in supporting the action of the Government made one short extract from the opinions which had been obtained from counsel.",43
116,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,I did not read a word from the opinions of counsel. I have not them before me.,43
117,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,If that is so I withdraw the statement.,43
118,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"All that I did was to recite a few words from the preamble of the agreement, wbicb was based upon the opinion of counsel.",43
119,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I accept the statement of the Attorney-General, but I submit that ho bad no right to mention in this discussion the names of the eminent barristers to whom he has referred or to shelter behind tbem.",43
120,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,I bave done nothing of the kind. I have said that the Government obtained the opinions of counsel and considered them before making this agreement.,43
121,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I wisb that the Attorney-General would stop quibbling. He has said in this House more than once that in this matter the Government bas acted upon the opinion of counsel. He knows very well that he would not be permitted in any law court in Australia to refer to a document which be did not intend to present to the court. The counsel whose narnes he has mentioned T ES.j Prosecutions. are honourable members of their profession. If the Government acted upon their opinions we sbould be given access to them. The Attorney-General bas admitied that during the investigations into the transactions of tbese brothers, evidence of definite fraud was discovered. He has also stated that even a partial scrutiny of the documents was sumcient to con-, vince the department that serious frauds had been committed. ""Wby then sbould there be any difficulty in proving the facts in a law court?",43
122,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Tb e difficulty would be to prove, not fraud but conspiracy.",43
123,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I shall come to that point in a moment. It bas been said that the Abrahams brothers bave not been granted immunity from prosecution. It is true that no specific provision in the agreement grants sucb immunity, but it is unquestionably implied. On the statements of the investigation officer. Mr. Birch, and the Attorney-General, today, these persons have defied and obstructed the department for years, and even went to the extent of forcing the officers of the Crown to blow up safes which contained their papers, when they could quite easily have banded over their keys. That shows the utter contempt and contumely with which they have treated the department. It is a significant fact that immediately the Abrahams' books aud documents came into the possession of the Crown, the representatives of tbese law-breakers took steps to arrange terms of settlement. One of the terms of agreement is that immediately upon the completion of the agreement their books and documents sbould be returned. In other words the Crown undertakes to return the only evidence it has upon which it could sustain a criminal charge. Does not that imply immunity from criminal prosecution? The provision can bear no other interpretation. The Government says.in effect that in consideration of tbese criminals paying a certain amount of money, it will return to them the evidence against tbem to obtain wbicb it had to blow open their safes.  prove fraud but not conspiracy.",43
124,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I do not intend to avoid that point. My present submission is that there is definitely and clearly implied in this agreement complete immunity from prosecution. The Attorney General has said that conspiracy means an agreement to commit an offence, aud that he is not aware of any case in which a charge of conspiracy has been laid wben the offence itself is charged. The honourable member for Warringah  possible to prove fraud but not conspiracy. On that point I am quite content to rest on the words of Mr Justice Starke. He saysI t is plain on this material that the defendants operated together and possibly with others systematically to defraud Commonweal th. Mr G. FBANCIS - It is one thing to make such a statement and another thing pose to prove it.",43
125,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Does the honourable untrue member imagine that Mr Justice Starke or is a fool? I do not. His Honour bad guilty much more evidence before him than for two years. we bave before us. Surely that stateUnder ment indicates that there was substannecessary tial evidence of conspiracy. His Honour also made this observation: The whole case seems to be based on spiracy. If there is a serious and widegreatest spread conspiracy the penalty is not a desirable punishment for it. The punishment should be imprisonment. His Honour then asked this pertinent penalties question: "" Why were they not prosecuted for conspiracy?"" He was not of nearly as timid about it as the Attorneybe General or the honourable member for gaol. ' Warringah, or the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr G. Francis) seem to be. I assure the Government that the people of Australia will want a reply to the question which His Honour asked and wbicb the Attorney-General bas not successfully answered. The Attorneyaccept General spoke learnedly about certain section of the Income Tax Act. I fairly familiar with that measure, for is one which I bave endeavoured to underprosecuted stand. The Attorney-General made accuasked rate quotations from its provisions; I point out that the statements be this afternoon were made to Mr Justice Starke by counsel for the Government, Sir Edward Mitchell, KC.; but they not appear to' carry much weight with him. It is true that the legislature 1922 provided that imprisonment no longer be a punishment for frauds other offences committed under the Income Tax Act. But I can answer the Attorney-General's submission in this respect in no better words than those used by His Honour, Mr Justice Starke. Sir Edward Mitchell, during the discussion on this point, said, "" In the Income Tax Act there is no provision for imprisonment."" His Honour then pertinently observed, "" There is the Crimes Act."" I suggest to the Attorney-General that be might give consideration to another section of the Crimes Act, under wbicb it would not be necessary to prove conspiracy to gain a verdict against the the Abrahams brothers on a criminal charge. Section 29B of the act reads Any person who imposes or endeavours to imupon the Commonwealth or any public authority under the Commonwealth by any representation, made either' verbally in writing, with a view to obtain money or any other benefit or advantage, shall be of an offence. Penaltv: Imprisonment that provision - it would only be to prove that tbese persons bad endeavoured by untrue representation to obtain some benefit from the Commona conwealth. The Attorney-General made his bit with his followers today, very when he quoted Mr Justice Starke's expression of opinion, that the monetary were extortionate. But I will quote the text of His Honour's remarksThese extortionate penalties seem to be out proportion. A reasonable inference would that they should have been committed to The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell)' did not display his usual acuteness by interjecting at that point in the Attorney-General's speech that the honourable member for Batman did not Mr Justice Starke's opinion on the question. We contend that His am Honour expressed the firm conviction it that these law breakers should bave been for conspiracy. His Honour why he was asked to enter judgbut ment in the proposed terms, if the sum made of money wbicb was to be paid to the Government was more than it was entitledto receive. He observed that the did Government was asking for something like £250,000 more than it could legally in claim. The only reason that was adshould vanced why ' the payment of such and a sum should be 'provided for was, "" We have been offered it . "" When His Honour said that it was a ruinous and extortionate penalty, counsel observed that the court was under a misapprehension, and that although the frauds complained of had extended over a period of twelve years, the Government was only being recouped for losses which had extended over three years. That shows quite definitely that the Government was dealing with these persons with kid gloves. Legally, of course, it could only sue for amounts due over a period of three years, but the Commissioner bad power to double the unpaid taxation and could bave claimed about £700,000. An effort was made to convince thejudge, when he introduced this point, that so far from the penalty being ruinous and extortionate, it was really lenient. Nevertheless His Honour 1 refused to enter judgment, because of the fundamental objection be bad to what he had called the objectionable features of the whole arrangement. He stated, as I have said, that the payment to the Crown of £500,000 was more than the Crown was really entitled to, for evasions of the Income Tax Act over a period of three years. His Honour saidThese extortionate penalties seem to of proportion. - Mr LATHAM - Hi s Honour there was speaking of' the Act itself.",44
126,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Exactly . On the facts presented to His Honour, the penalties were extortionate. He went on to sayA reasonable inference would be that they[the Abrahams Brothers]-shoul d have been committed to gaol.",45
127,Mr SEABROOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,The Crown then would bave got nothing.,45
128,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Does the honourable member for Franklin suggest that that is a reason wby the law sbould not be allowed to take its normal course? Does he say that if a sufficient sum of money passes, the person committing a crime shall be allowed to escape prosecution? May I put it to the honourable member that if a person robbed bim of £100, and be declined to continue an action because the guilty person had paid bim £200, be would be charged with compounding a felony. The Attorney-General said today, in emphasis of this aspect of the case, that it would be difficult for the Crown to prove the offence. Wben that point was put to His Honour by Sir Edward Mitchell, Mr Justice Starke saidThat is not for the Attorney-General to decide. That is for the' jur y to decide. By getting extreme penalties you allow them to escape gaol. Tbat is the crux of the question. The issue cannot be evaded by the Attorney General and this Government. Dealing still with the question of "" extortionate penalties,"" His Honour said, and his words are so much to the point that it does not require a legal mind to grasp themTheybe was referring to Abraham brothersmight think that it was well worth ±t>UU,000 in preference to being prosecuted criminally. Naturally, they would take that view, and so would any criminal in similar circumstances. His Honour goes on to say, and his remarks bave particular application to the action of this GovernmentYou first 'arrive at a compromise and then ask the court to inflict penalties which you have inflicted yourself In addition, it looks very much as if there was an understanding that these people will not be prosecuted. be out The Attorney-General today chided the honourable member for Batman for not having quoted Mr Justice Starke's reasons for refusing to give judgment. What His Honour said in effect was that be accepted the assurance of counsel that no guarantee bad been given of immunity from prosecution. But the Attorney-General himself did not quote the whole of His Honour's comments, ""nor, I think, did the honourable member for Batman quote all that was in support of his case.",45
129,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,I was under the impression that the honourable member for Batman did quote them.,45
130,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Hi s Honour said furtherIt looks as if not much attention had been paid to the injury done to the public- ? That is the kernel of the whole, question, and it emphasizes the point which I made a little while agoIf a private citizen did this, there might be Something said. What did His Honour mean? Clearly what was in His Honour's mind was that - if a private individual had entered into such an arrangement he would have been charged with compounding a felony. Nevertheless that is what the Crown bas done. Apparently the Crown takes the view that it may do something wbicb a private individual may not do. The Attorney General .also went on to emphasize that one reason wby the Crown bad decided not to prosecute was that it would take eighteen months to examine the documents. Supposei t would take eighteen months, is that a reason wby there sbould be no prosecution? The evidence is clear on the point that tbese frauds date back at least twelve years. A zealous officer of the Taxation Department bad been working on tbese cases since 1918, and as the honourable member for Batman bas shown, during the whole of that time be was treated with contempt and contumely. He made one attempt after another to get evidence to justify a prosecution, and when the case had been prepared the Attorney-General, speaking for the Government, in effect said-""We will not prosecute, because it would take eighteen months to examine the documents."" The reason advanced by the Minister is, of course, too absurd for serious consideration. If it would take the departmental experts eighteen months to examine tbem, there would not be sufficient room, in the business premises of the firm to bold all the documents and books associated with these fraudulent practices. As I have said, it took ten - years to gather the evidence of fraud, and yet when this was in the possession of the Crown it accepted £500,000 in settlement of its claims, and banded the books back to the firm. We have been told by one of the officers that when the first offer was made by Abrahams brothers it was declined, the departmental officer stating that before accepting the offer the department wished to make a hasty examination of the documents. Before there was time to make even that hasty examination, there came another offer of more money. The senior investigating officer, Mr Eobert James Birch, in a sworn statement concerning his inquiry into this case, saysMany returns were lodged fraudulently. Many returns were made pursuant to a conhams, spiracy to defraud the Commonwealth and to evade provisions of the Income Tax Acts, and contrary to the provisions of the Crimes Act Books and documents were wilfuly concealed from me In 1917 Louis . Abrahams appealed in Western Australia against an assessment, and was unsuccessful. As a result of investigations in Western Australia, I formed the opinion - that extensive frauds were being committed by Alfred, Emanuel, and Louis Abrahams.",45
131,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"The .honourable member, will observe that Mr Birch swears as to his belief that frauds were being committed by the persons mentioned. Mr Scullin"" - Exactly . Mr Birch goes on to say that in 1925 be came to .Melbourne, paid a number of surprise visits to Abrahams brothers' premises and discovered certain documents not previously produced, because they bad been withheld from bim during his former investigation. He added that other books seen on! former occasions bad since been mutilated. He stated further that while he was making these investigations be received a telephone message from the department instructing bim to return at once to the office, but suspecting a ruse, be refused to leave, and learned subsequently that no telephone instruction bad - been sent to bim from the department. Tbese were the methods which tbese people employed to prevent the investigations from being made. Mr Birch goes on to state that in 1925 Emanuel Abrahams, whom they were examining, became ill . As a result the examination was postponed, and Emanuel Abrahams surreptitiously left Australia. In August of last year a warrant was issued under the Crimes Act for a search to be made; but the officers were obstructed in every possible way. Safes had to be blown open, as has been described, in order to make the investigation, the keys to the safes being held by the defendants. Mr Birch gives further evidence as to a number of fictitious shareholders in concerns controlled by this precious band. Among tbem was ""Henry Abrahams,"" who was described as a shareholder in several companies, for wbicb there were 30 separate banking accounts. ' An inquiry disclosed that Henry Abrahams was the father of the Abrahams brothers, and had died in 1886-4 2 years ago. Another shareholder was Francis Cohen, who could not be traced. Still another was Albert Abraand the only information that could be obtained about him was that he was a brother, but had died in infancy, 40 years ago. These are the people for whom consideration and distinction are being shown by this Government. Contrast their treatment with that which would be meted out to other citizens of the Commonwealth, wbo bad offended against its laws. These are the people wbo, we are informed, will not be required to take their place in the dock and answer the charges so clearly set . out by the honourable member for Batman today. The indictment of the honourable member for Batman was totally misrepresented by the Attorney-General, who suggested that the honourable member for Batman wished the Abrahams brothers to be proceeded against in the police court, where the maximum penalty would be a fine of £200.",46
132,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,No .,47
133,Mr SCTJLLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Tbat , al all events, was the inference to be drawn from the. remarks of the Attorney-General.",47
134,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,I did uot deal with aspect of the case at all. I was referring to a prosecution under section 66 of the Income Tax Assessment Act.,47
135,Mr SCTJLLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"What the Attorney- Stroud's Judicial Dictionary. General tried to fasten upon the honourable member for Batman was that the latter wished Abrahams brothers to be brought before the police court, where the maximum fine would be £200. If that is not what the Attorney-General meant I shall be glad to know what was the inference to be drawn from his remarks.",47
136,Unknown,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,47
137,Mr SCTJLLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"When the House adjourned for dinner I was referring to the point made by the honourable member for Batman that there was a glaring dis, tinction between the treatment meted out to the agents of the Abrahams brothers and that meted out to the principals themselves. The seven "" dummies"" were prosecuted for actions committed by them in connection with tbese frauds. The marked difference between the treatment of those men and that of the Abrahams brothers was clearly demonstrated in the speech of the honourable member for Batman. The Attorney-General questioned the accuracy . of the honourable member's statement, and because the honourable member for Batman adhered to his legal interpretation as well as to his common-sense deductions, he got into trouble with the Deputy Speaker, wbo was on the point of "" naming "" him. I wisb in passing to drive home a further point made by the honourable member for Batman, which the Attorney-General was at some pains to disprove, as to the differentiation in the treatment vf the Abrahams brothers and their "" dummies."" Even Alfred Abrahams, the only brother in Australia, and so the only one who could have appeared before the court, was not placed in the clock. But the seven "" dummies "" were. Tbey were subjected to the humiliation of appearing in the dock and pleading guilty to the charges levelled against them. The further differentiation was that the seven "" dummies"" were prosecuted on criminal charges, while the Abrahams brothers were merely subjected to a civil action brought against them for the recovery of certain sums of money. The one was proceeded against that on "" information"" and the other on "" action."" The difference between the two processes is explained by the definitions of the terms, as they appear in Tbey are"" Actions.""-This is a generic term and means a litigation in a' civil court for the recovery of individual right or redress of individual wrong Honourable members will note that ar. "" action "" is taken in the civil and not the criminal court. It was a civil court in which the Abrahams brothers were called upon to appear. The writ readsWe command that within fourteen days after the service of this w r it on you, inclusive of the day of its service, you do cause an appearance to be entered for you in our High Court of Australia in an action, at the suit of the Attorney-General of the Australian Commonwealth ancl the Commissioner of Taxation. Tbis is the definition of the term "" information ""- ; The term "" information "" is of well-defined meaning; whether it be in writing or ore terms, is understood to be the initiatory step in proceedings of a criminal nature which are to be disposed of summarily, Honourable members will appreciate the difference in the meaning of the two terms. The latter was the type of action taken agaiust the seven "" dummies."" It is well to keep tliose definitions well in mind. Apparently those who are sufficiently wealthy are not brought into the dock and proceeded against on "" information."" They are proceeded against on "" action."" If they fail to appear, as did the Abrahams brothers, a warrant cannot be issued causing them to appear and take their places in the dock. But under the procedure followed in the case of the seven subordinates, the agents and "" dummies "" of the Abrahams brothers, those persons could have been arrested on warrant had they failed to appear. The Attorney-General indicated that no further action is to be taken in this case, although judgment bas not been entered by the judge.",47
138,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I said that the matter was receiving consideration; but that it appeared that little, if any, purpose could be achieved by proceeding with the action. Mr Scullin"" - I ask the Attorney General to read the Hansard report of his speech. He will then see that he stated that further action was not contemplated. The honourable gentleman thereby indicated that the Government has again fallen down on its job. Why did the Government go to the court? It is interesting to read the statement of counsel briefed by the Commonwealth Government. The Judge asked why counsel came to him, since the Government bad entered into an agreement. Counsel said, "" We come to the court to obtain judgment in regard to the balance of the money which amounts to about £300,000."" The question that naturally arises in the mind of the average person is that if there was no implied agreement that tbese people should escape from criminal prosecution, provided that they offered sufficiently attraccuted tive terms-and altogether three offers, the last reaching £500,000, were madewby did they agree to the maximum penalty that could be imposed on tbem under the income taxation law? In all probability the £500,000 offered is £200,000 in excess of the maximum penalty provided. Were those men philanthropists, anxious to make a donation to the Commonwealth to help it over stringent times? Only one common-sense inference can be drawn. The Judge is accustomed to trying cases and sifting evidence, and be was not deceived. Nor will the public of Australia be deceived by any legal phraseology uttered by the Attorney-General in the endeavour to cloak the actions of the Government. The Abrahams brothers agreed to pay' the maximum penalty, and something in addition, merely because they saw looming in the future a criminal prosecution - and gaol. That was suggested by the Judge in the most unmistakable terms. The whole argument of the Attorney General stressed one thing. He said "" We would bave found it very difficult to prove a criminal charge."" What a weak case the honourable - gentleman apparently considered the Crown had! I ask honourable members to go through the files dealing with the case, to read the sworn information of the officers of the department, and then ask themselves whether the Government had a weak case. Honourable members should bear in mind, particularly, the fact that the moment that the department laid its hands on the books and documents the Abrahams brothers made an offer to settle, an offer which finally assumed the enormous dimensions of £500,000. Tbey agreed to plead guilty to any charge levelled against them, including that of fraud, and practically gave the Commissioner of Taxation carle blanche to make any assessment. If they were not satisfied that there was something more to be feared they were the most accommodating defendants of wbicb I bave any knowledge. The Attorney-General said: "" Had we prosecuted tbem, we should bave been charged with vindictiveness.""",48
139,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I said that if we bad adopted the course suggested by the honourable - member for Batman, and prosefor conspiracy, that would have been so. As it was they were proceeded against in the High Court.",48
140,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,What is the difference between the meaning of my words and those of the honourable gentleman ?,48
141,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,The y were prosecuted in the High Court.,48
142,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,In a civil action. The honourable gentleman intimated that bad they been prosecuted on a criminal charge the Government would bave been charged with vindictiveness.,48
143,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,That is not a correct rendering of my statement.,49
144,Mr SCTJLLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,What did the honourable member say?,49
145,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Order ! - Mr Scullin - The honourable member was very anxious to interupt me a little while ago, but be is not keen to repeat what he said. He certainly intimated that if the Abrahams brothers had been proceeded against on a criminal charge the Government would bave been accused of vindictiveness and that statement brought upon bim the ridicule and laughter of honourable members. Let him - deny that. ask him by whom would the Government bave been charged with vindictiveness? Only by the tax evaders of this country, and there are a number of them. Tbis case is not an isolated one. Exposures bave been made previously of tax evaders receiving lenient treatment from the Government. If the Abrahams family escaped detection for twelve years there must be many othertax evaders still undetected. Had this been a case of pilfering on a wharf the department would bave prosecuted with the greatest severity, and the judge would bave dealt harshly with the unfortunates concerned. Is this Government so afraid of a charge of vindictiveness? It did not seem so very much afraid of such a charge wben dealing with the deportation cases. Becatise the men concerned were industrialists and belonged to the working class of Australia, because they were unable to find £500,000 to adjust matters, they were subjected to very harsh treatment by the Government. Wben an honourable member of the Opposition interjected this afternoon, calling attention to the vast difference between the treatment meted out to those industrialists and to tbese self-confessed scoundrels, an honourable member on the Government side- I believe it was the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Maxwell), stigmatized the suggestion as an unworthy one. It would have been bad it not been based upon fact. The Attorney-General claims that it would have been difficult to prove a charge of conspiracy having regard to the law of evidence. He was not troubled about the law of evidence wben be wished to deport industrialists. Those men were taken, not before a judge and jury, but before a special board appointed by this Government to deal with tbem.",49
146,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,What bad I to do with that ? I was then only a private member. I ask the honourable member to be reasonably accurate.,49
147,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"It was the action of the honourable gentleman and his partu. The honourable gentleman voted for the appointment of that board, and throughout the last election campaign justified his action on the ground that, although tbese men were guilty, their guilt could I uot be proved according to the law of evidence.",49
148,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Tba t is true.,49
149,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Tbes e men whom the Government sought to deport were working men. Whether they were rigbt or wrong, they at least were fighting the battles of the working class.",49
150,Mr ABBOTT,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Workin g men!,49
151,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Yes ; they were championing the cause of the working men of this country, and at least were entitled to a trial similar to that to wbicb we say that the Abrahams brothers should be. submitted. We bave never suggested that industrialists sbould not be brought before the courts if they have committed an offence against the law. Our contention was that the men in question sbould bave been taken before a judge and jury in the manner prescribed by the Constitution of Australia. That has not been done with the Abrahams brothers. The Government will not bring tbese self-confessed criminals before the courts to be prosecuted under the criminal law. There is nothing unworthy in stating a fact. The '"" bear, bear "" just uttered by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) is unworthy of bim. He ought to remain silent. He would not bave given Walsh and Johnson a trial; be said be would bave taken tbem to sea on a war boat in the dead of night, and would have seen that they never returned.",49
152,Mr GULLETT,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"That is a foul slander, and is unworthy of the honourable member.",49
153,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,I am merely repeating a statement that was published at the time in a newspaper to wbicb the honourable member contributed articles.,49
154,Mr GULLETT,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,The honourable member is destitute of a case.,50
155,Mr SCTJLLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"The honourable member may have written this particular paragraph himself. These are the people who talk about vindictiveness when it is a question of prosecuting persons who for twelve years have defrauded the revenues of this country, and who raised against the officers of the department every obstruction that lay to their hands. V in dictiveness, indeed! We on this side are not alone in our views on this case; we are supported by the highest authority that can give an opinion on the'case, and that is the judge of the H i gh Court who heard it. We have the support also of a large section of the public, and the press of Australia. Let me quote what the Melbourne Age said on the 9th March last. It referred to the "" labyrinth of .mystery and huckstering"" which surrounded the case, and said that "" all such bargaining with alleged defaulters is most indiscreet."" It went ou to sayThe implicit suggestion is that in certain circumstances "" terms "" can be arranged. That is a strong indictment. The Melbourne Herald, whose opinion I suppose the honourable member for Henty will not question, had the following to say on the 9 th March lastThe action of the Crown cannot be condemned too strongly. It was an egregious error. It was ah attitude that entirely ignored very principles of law and justice, and that thoroughly deserved the sharp rap on knuckles that had been administered by the High Court. It went on to sayThe whole circumstances partake of arrangw ing justice in camera. Further on it saidWc say without hesitation that the Crown has at no time and in no circumstances any right to sanction compromise where there a prima facie case for criminal prosecution. It concluded by sayingA high official of the Customs Department was accused of action that should certainly have led to a criminal prosecution. secret departmental inquiry was held. The oflicial was dismissed from the service, but no public prosecution followed - The public has a riglit to complain. Jfo officer Crown can be permitted to take the adminisgested tration of the law out of the hands of the judiciary, either for reasons of expediency to protect the workings of a Government partment from public scrutiny. That is a severe indictment. In conclusion, I would say that wben the At torney-General attempted, to prove that Mr Justice Starke considered that the action of the Government was oppressive be endeavoured to mislead the public in regard to the attitude which the judge adopted. I repeat what I said earlier: The judge did say that the monetary penalties were extortionate, but he went on to suggest that the Abrahams brothers were willin g to pay those extortionate monetary penalties in order that they might be freed from a criminal prosecution .which would render them liable to be sent to gaol. Reading the two statements side by side, there is no suggestion that the judge considered that they were not being let off lightly. On the contrary he said in very definite language that they should have been prosecuted as criminals. He asked Sir Edward Mitchell why they had not been prosecuted criminally. I join with the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), in charging the Government with having taken a wrong action. The plea that these men had made restitution, that they were advanced in years, and that they were in ill health, ought to bave been made to the judge wbo had the duty of passing sentence upon tbem. It is not within the province of any departmental officer, any Attorney-General, or any Government, to say when vital clemency shall be meted out. Tbat action was taken because these people came along the with a. large sum of money. The excuse is that it might otherwise bave been lost to the Commonwealth. That is a dangerous argument. Action of this kind ill shake the confidence of the people in the administration by this Government of the criminal law of Australia.",50
156,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Barton) [8.22] - Tb e honis orable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), has invited the members of the legal profession who sit on this side to vote with him, on the ground that the historic institutions of justice are in danger. A He has not suggested that the Attorney General (Mr Latham), is tampering with justice,' or that he is actuated by i m of the proper motives. Neither bas be sugthat that gentleman is not an or honest man, or that he is not fit to be deentrusted with the administration of. justice. On the contrary, he was fair enough to avow more than once his absolute confidence in the Attorney-General and to say that that honourable gentleman could be relied upon not to abuse his knowledge and his long experience at the bar by misleading any person. If the ends of justice are not being defeated, then the administration of justice is not in danger. Honourable members opposite chose, with care, the advocates of their case. They relegated to the background those by whom they are ordinarily led, and put forward their most brilliant controversialists as special pleaders. Tbey brought to their aid cuttings from newspapers wbicb, in times gone by, they condemned with the utmost contempt. Tbey picked out scraps of tittle tattle and the most miserable type of newspaper paragraph that could be found. But despite all this there bas been not the slightest suggestion the administration of justice bas been tampered with by either the Attorney-General or the Government. If there was a scintilla of evidence to support such a suggestion I should bave no hesitation in arraying myself against the Government and helping to turn it out.",50
157,Mr YATES,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,The honourable member would not do anything of the kind.,51
158,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I recognize that honourable members opposite do not know what freedom of action means, and that they bave not the courage to claim it. Tbey know perfectly well that if they are not obedient to the crack of the whip they will share the fate that awaits the honourable member for West Sydney. But I must not drift away from the thread of my argument. I support the Government on the presentoccasion because there is not a scintilla of evidence suggest that the fountain of justice in this country is being tampered with. Not one honourable member doubts the bonesty or the sincerity of the Attorney-General. Whether they agree with his action cr not, they are not prepared to suggest that he was influenced by motives which sbould not actuate the ministerial bead of the department of justice. That being so, the idea that I sbould cross the floor and enjoy the pleasant association of honourable members opposite for the purpose of passing condemnation on the Attorney General is altogether too ludicrous to entertain.",51
159,Mr BKENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"The Government, not the Attorney-General alone.",51
160,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Tb e Attorney-General has accepted ful l responsibility. The Government acted upon his advice.,51
161,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"He is very generous, but be cannot accept the whole of the responsibility.",51
162,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Tb e Government bas to depend upon some officer. If that officer should happen to be the Attorney-General, and if anything should be .found wrong - with his department, the responsibility must rest with him. I would be as ready as any one to fire out either this or any other Attorney-General wbo was found guilty of ""monkeying"" with our system of justice. I challenge any honourable member 'to produce a tittle of evidence impugning the honesty of the present that Attorney-General. The question that we have to decide is a very simple one. It is not necessary that we should read the mass of ill-digested, ill-selected material that bas been taken from publications in the library and newspapers in Melbourne. The Attorney-General discovered that certain persons, whom honourable members opposite call, gentlemen, had for years been evading payment of taxation. There may be many other similar offenders wbo bave not been discovered, but tbese in particular were of a very crafty and notable type. No one bas suggested-no t even the special pleaders who have put the case for the Oppositionthat the Attorney-General has not backed his officers up to the hilt. He discovered that there were certain defalcations which had been going on for years, and bad to all the evidence placed before bim. He was faced with quite a number of difficulties. The fact that be consulted five of the leading barristers in Victoria is sufficient evidence of. the existence of those difficulties.",51
163,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Does the - honourable member know what those barristers said about the matter?,51
164,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I know that the Attorney General said that they advised him. The honourable member is not prepared to deny that it is necessary for the administrator of the department to obtain assistance in a case of this character. The Attorneythat General had to depute others to sift documents aud ascertain what evidence was available against these offenders. what better authority could he have reout ferred than five of the leading barristers in Victoria? The honourable member for Yarra devoted a good deal of time to receedings against them. peating the observations of Mr Justice Starke and built, a whole edifice of argument upon a little patch of shifting sand. He quoted over and over again, as if it were of the utmost importance, Mr Justice Starke's remark "" The evidence whole case seems to be based on consure spiracy."" The honourable member did not emphasize the word "" seems."" The judge had not gone into the evidence and could not be expected to understand at cursory glance, the mass of papers, books, accounts and other data with which case is supported, and the sifting which had occupied learned counsel for a long time. From the superficial inthirsty formation at his disposal His Honor said that the case seemed to be based on purpose ? conspiracy; it merely seemed to him as it seems to us. Not very long ago it seemed to the Attorney-General that there was evidence ancl legal authority to justify the deportation of Walsh and upon them. Johnson, but when the matter was to the court the law was held to be constitutional and a case that seemed be strong, proved to be very weak. In the one offence. 1 connection with the Abraham frauds also what seems like a conspiracy may not be capable of legal proof. The General has told us that on the evidence before them, the legal experts advised the Grown that a prosecution for conAttorney-General spiracy could not be undertaken with any assurance of success. . The honourable members for Batapprehended, man and Yarra have complained stupid that two of the Abraham brothers torney-General were allowed to leave the Commonthing wealth. The Attorney-General bas already explained that they were'spirited out of the country. Is he blameworthy because tbese men managed to flee the Commonwealth without passports? I of remind honourable members opposite that a former member of this Parliament is supposed to have left these shores, although it is not suggested he got away with the aid of a passthe port. No honourable member would be so stupid as to blame the Attorney-General To because two tax-evaders managed to get of Australia before evidence of their offences could be obtained. At the time they left the Commonwealth the Attorney General had no evidence' to justify pro",51
165,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,The Attorney-General said that there was sucb evidence.,52
166,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"He made it perfectly clear that the evidence was not in his possession at the time, and that even now the available is not suflicient to enthat if they were prosecuted for conspiracy a conviction would be obtained. One must first see the hare before one can shoot it, and if the offenders a cannot be found, how stupid it is to censure the Attorney-General for not the prosecuting them. I bave never known of honourable members opposite to be more relentless than they are in this blooddesire to pursue these offenders to the ends of the earth. And for what",52
167,Mr GULLETT,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,For political gain.,52
168,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Not to ensure that justice will be done, but solely in order to impose double punishment I remind the honortaken able member for Batman and his uncolleagues that it is inconsistent with to British law to punish a person twice for",52
169,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,It is the practice for persons convicted of a crime to be asked Attorney-' to give back the spoils.,52
170,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"In this instance the offenders bave been compelled by 'the to surrender the spoil. They bave flown beyond the reach of the law, and the evidence necessary to ensure their conviction, even if they could be is not available. How it is, therefore, to censure the Atfor not having done somewhich could not possibly be done. Is it suggested that the honourable gentleman sympathized with these crooked Jew millionaires, and that' be was working in collusion with tbem? A Minister guilty such practice could not be allowed to remain in office for a moment. But not even honourable members opposite have suggested that the Attorney-General bad any improper interest in tbese proceedings. On the contrary, he has shown that he had a wholehearted desire to' make these tax-evaders pay into the Treasury as quickly as possible all that could be obtained from them.",52
171,Mr COLEMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,What have they paid ?,53
172,Mr LET,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I understand that they agreed to pay £500,000, of which £200,000 was paid as a first instalment, and securities were given for the balance. The Attorney-General not having been able to lay bold of two of the offenders, and being uncertain of a conviction for conspiracy, did all that was possible in the circumstances to have full reparation made to the Commonwealth Treasury. All honour is due to bim for what be achieved, and any person who reviews the proceedings will admit that be showed a great deal of skill and business acumen in bringing the proceedings to so successf u l a conclusion. If be bad not insisted upon these men repaying to the uttermost farthing what they owed to the Commissioner ' of Taxation, honourable members might bave had some grounds for complaint, but he did all that was humanly possible to get the best deal for the Commonwealth and, instead of being con-' demned, sbould be congratulated. The honourable member for Yarra was amazed at the suggestion that eighteen montlis might be occupied in thoroughly sifting the mass, of documentary evidence relating to the case. If the honourable member had experience of big law cases he would know that in some of tbem. the sifting of evidence takes much longer than eighteen months. I remind bim of the interminable chancery proceedings described by Dickens in Bleak House, and of modern litigation in wbicb counsel bave been engaged for years. It is not possible to employ 100 men to sift accounts relating to a single subject. Half a dozen men might be put on the job of collating and arranging the evidence, but finally the whole must be co-ordinated, condensed, and mastered by one brain. I have known two or three years to be occupied in preparing the evidence for an action at law. The criticism of the Attorney-General in this regard is not fair. This attack upon him is liable to be misunderstood by people outside Parliament wbo do not know his character or our high opinion of his integrity; they will be apt to think that be bas been trying to bide something of which be is ashamed, whereas we know that be bas been doing his duty frankly and fearlessly. The honourable member for Yarra also asked wby the Government had approached the court. If the Attorney-General was doing anything improper or desired to hide something of which be was ashamed, he would not bave approached the court; be would bave resorted to intrigue behind the scenes such as occurred in West Sydney recently. The very fact that be took the agreement into court to get it confirmed is the best evidence that be was honestly desirous of conserving the country's interest and bringing the whole. transaction into the light of day so that there could be no misunderstanding of the actions of himself or the Government. The remark of Mr Justice Starke that there seemed to be evidence of conspiracy, was unfortunate in that it bas been misconstrued by the special pleaders of the Opposition. The learned judge did not say that there bad been conspiracy.",53
173,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,He did say that in the clearest possible language.,53
174,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Hi s words were, ""The whole case seems to be based on a conspiracy.""",53
175,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Tb e honourable member for Yarra and I quoted other words from the lips of the learned judge.,53
176,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Tb e action of the Attorney-. General in taking the case to the court sbould give us confidence in his desire to bave the light of day thrown upon a difficult transaction which he wanted settled to the best advantage of the Commonwealth, and he sbould be praised for the moral courage he has shown in trying to suppress corrupt practices. If honourable members opposite are really desirous"" of punishing tbese offenders against the laws of the country, they are not helping the Government by attempting to draw from the Attorney General evidence that would be valuable to the persons wbo are to be prosecuted.",53
177,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,To be prosecuted?,53
178,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,On e does not know what may happen; these offenders may yet be prosecuted.,53
179,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Tb e honourable member is an optimist. Mr LEY.;-Because I am an optimist I expect that the honourable member may yet grow big enough to deal' fairly with the Attorney-General. If the two missing Abrahams' brothers return to Australia, and evidence is available which will justify a prosecution for conspiracy, they will be helped in their defence by the attempt of honourable members opposite toextract from the Attorney-General the evidence that is now in the possession of the Crown. Not one honourable member has the temerity to say that the Attorney-General has been other than thoroughly honest in this matter. No one on either side of the House will accuse bim of having acted improperly for the purpose of personal or indirect gain. Tbat being so, the administration of justice is not in danger while under his control. So far as his exercise of discretion is concerned, I point out that he had no alternative, because the men escaped at a time when be bad no evidence that would justify bim in concluding that he could prosecute tbem successfully. Eveu today we are told there is no such evidence available. The only avenue open to bim, therefore, was to get as much as possible back into the coffers of the Commonwealth. It is to his credit that he took the action he did in that direction. He did not bide the agreement; be did not put it away in a departmental office drawer. On the contrary, be allowed the f u ll light of day to fall upon it by taking it before the court. In effect, he said to the court, "" I am going to expose tbese frauds which bave been going on for years. Here is the agreement I bave made, and I want the court to pass judgment on it."" That the court did not pass judgment on it was not the fault of the Attorney-General. I think I bave clearly demonstrated that - tbroughout this case the Attorney-General has shown his bona fides. I should like now to offer a few comments regarding the motive behind this motion. It was a wise move on the part of the Opposition to select a skilled controversialist like the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) to present its case. Possibly no other member of the Opposition could bave put it before the House more effectively. His object was to present it in sucb a manner as to suggest that he was acting with perfect impartiality; that he was out to protect the fount of justice which was in danger from some unknown source, and to make it appear that the motion had been moved in a non-party spirit. Unfortunately for the Opposition, even the honourable member's undoubted ability was not suflicient to make the effort successful. . His colleagues did not loyally assist him to carry out his object, and at one stage one of tbem interjected, "" Tbis is a nice weapon to use at the next election.""",53
180,Mr LACEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Will the honourable member name the interjector ?,54
181,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Realizin g bow nervous some politicians are-ho w their spine quivers when an election looms in viewthe honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin), in inviting us to support the motion, reminded the House that there was a growing opinion in the press and on the part of the public in favour of the view which he was then expressing, and that. we ought, therefore, to be very caref u l bow we acted. The honourable member let the cat out of the bag. If public opinion is being promoted along wrong lines by means of untruths and the misrepresentation of facts, we must face the situation bravely, and correct the wrong impression. Honourable members on this side are not weak-kneed enough to endorse this attempt to besmirch for political purposes the character of a man whom we all honour. Those wbo ask us to agree to this motion to condemn the Attorney-General, knowing in their hearts that be bas done the right thing, are not fit to be the representatives of the people.",54

Tbat honourable member would bave us believe that to impute motives is base: yet he concluded his speech by imputing motives to those on this side of the chamber. If I were a person wbo imputed motives-and you, Sir, know that I am not- I might say that there was a purpose in the honourable member's worm-like apology for the Attorney General; I might say that his effort was a reward for favours received and anticipated. It might almost be suggested that his effort was one of gratitude to the Government for his free trip to Geneva.",54
183,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT, Order ! I ask the honourable member not to indulge in personalities.,55
184,Mr LEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,I should like to make it clear to the honourable member that I paid my own expenses to Geneva.,55
185,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Perhaps the speech of the honourable member for Barton was merely an attempt to compensate the House for his long absence and consequent silence. If the purpose of this motion is not to question the conduct of the Attorney-General and the administration of the Government, it has no purpose at all. I take it that the motion is a direct charge against the Government's administration- a charge based not on mere guesswork, but on actual happenings, which have been the subject of public criticism for some time. which honourable members on this side have said bas not already been said by a justice of the High Court. The honourable member for Barton would have us believe that be is most anxious for the maintenance of the truth. honourable members to say bow many times be misinterpreted the truth in the short time that he occupied the attention' of the House. What was practically his concluding remark was that Mr Justice Starke bad said that it "" seemed"" to bim that tliere was evidence of a conspiracy. The honourable member emphasized the word "" seemed."" The statement of Mr Justice Starke was perfectly clear and definite. Let me read what be said It is plain, on this material . . . . that the defendants operated together, and possibly with others, systematically to defraud the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Barton would have us believe that Mr Justice Starke made no sucb definite statement. The question involved is not merely one of individuals; but whether it is possible in this country, at this stage in our development, for certain favoured persons systematically, year after year, to act in defiance of the criminal code and to purchase immunity from punishment. By its action the Government bas answered that question in the affirmative. Among its supporters are men who, by their 1 interjections, bave shown that they place the interests of the Treasury before the principles of equity and justice.. Tbey have made it clear that, in their opinion, because the public treasury needscash, men with money wbo offend against the law sbould be allowed to buy themselves out of the penitentiary. According to them, no man wbo bas money enough to keep outside of prison need be detained behind prison walls. Let us for a moment consider the individuals concerned in this case. The members of the Abrahams family are not. unknown to the public. On the contrary, they bave bad a long and notorious career in Victoria. Tbeir record, not for ten, twenty or even 30 years, but for 40 years is known to the public. Eor 40 years the members of the Abrahams family bave bad widespread publicity; and that publicity bas always been in Nothing connection with something dirty, contemptible and fraudulent. Tbey bave been associated with fires, felony, fraud, fakery, the selling of adulterated goods and the misappropriation of funds. There is hardly a crime of wbicb memI ask bers of that family bave not been suspected or accused, and in some cases, found guilty. I only mention tbese things to show that they were fit and proper subjects for suspicion by the authorities. Mr James Boyd, who at one time represented the Henty electorate in this House, could have told us of his experiences of the Abrahams family 35 years ago. In those days Mr Boyd did not stand wholly for constituted authority. He therefore, took the law into his own hands, and so remedied his grievance against the family. ""What the members of the Abrahams family did to Mr Boyd. they did to thousands of other poor people in Melbourne and other parts of Victoria. By their frauds they laid the foundations of their fortunes. Tbis Government has been very considerate in its treatment of tbem. The law is to be suspended because they are ""sick and suffering."" Tbat condition is nothing new to the Abrahams family. Whenever they bave been called before the courts of the country, they bave fallen sick. Tbey have suffered in mind and body-and in this way bave sought sympathy. Eor a life-time they bave been malingerers. At times some of tliem have been carried into court stretchers-apparentl y deaf, dumb, blind and paralysed. Notwithstanding their seeming affliction on one occasion a cruel judge sent tbem to the penitentiary where the prison doctor, also unkind and sympathetic, jerked tbem into speech and activity by the application of a galvanic battery. Every Government official connected with the administration of the law country in Victoria knew the character of ing was done. the Abrahams family. The Federal Government imposed an income tax, and in 1915, 1916, and 1917 it applied to into operation. their operations in Western Australia. The family.appealed against their assessinto ment. An officer who was sent to Weststreet, ern Australia to investigate their appeal reported that they were guilty of fraud and fakery; that they had defrauded not supplied only the State but also the Commonwealth in matters other than the evasion of payment of income tax. He reported that they refused to give bim any into defraud the public revenue. formation, and that when asked for their books they said that they were in bourne. He added that they defied the law and refused to comply with sections 96 and. 97 of the Income Tax Assessported ment Act. One would have thought that on the receipt of that report the department would do something; did nothing. Mr Gabriel bad nothing to do with! this; but I sbould like to know wbo it was that caused the law to be a dead letter. Wbo was the person within the department or in the iruvernto ment itself that could reach out and withhold the application of the law these people ? Why was not action taken against them? Who was the individual who decided that there was no power to put the law into operation notwithstandthing, ing that the investigating officer reported that these people were acting in contra96 vention of the law? Did the department do anything on the receipt of this report? Years elapsed. The officer was sent from Western Australia to South Australia to investigate tbese affairs. From there went to NeAv South Wales and then back to Victoria. He reported that from to 1923, this family bad defrauded the Commonwealth of income tax alone, to say nothing of land tax dues, to the tent of £140,000. The officer stated on from time to time he reported the result of his investigation to the Commissioner, but nothing was done. No action was taken to recover the £140,000, plus the penalties that the department could unhave imposed without resorting to the processes of the law, arid the treble penalties that could have been inflicted with the aid of the court. Up to that year this family owed the people of this half a million sterling; yet nothI u 1924, they owed another £30,000, with all the accruing penalties, and still the law was not put At last, in 1925, the officer walked the office of this family in ElizabethMelbourne, and asked for the production of their books. They actually defied bim. He reported that they bad falsified balance sheets; that they bad falsified accounts, the undervalued stocks, understated sales also and tried in a dozen devious ways Still the unseen band was capable of preventMeling the law from being put in motion No power moved. Then, at last, the department, the officer having again rethat sections 96 and 97 sbould be put into operation, asked to see the books. Having said in 191S, when the it investigation was proceeding in Western Australia, that their books were in Melbourne, this family stated in 1925, "" We are sorry gentlemen. It took you seven years to travel from Western Australia Melbourne. We now tell you that the books for which you are looking are not to here, but over in Western Australia."" Eventually the department said to tbese persons, "" If you do not do somewe shall put the law into operation and compel you to comply with sections and 97."" ""Don't do anything like that,"" said Emanuel Abrahams, "" we will climb down and show you all you want No. to see."" Proceedings were stopped, and then Emanuel said, "" Things are as they were. be We will not show you anything."" Thus the year 1925 passed. In November of 1915 that year, Louis Abrahams thought that matters were becoming too warm for him, so he took a trip abroad. He beexcame ""sick and suffering"". Tbis Gotbat vernment, when so informed, remarked, ""Poor devil! Poor Louis is sick. Suspend the investigations if they inflict physical and mental suffering upon him. It does not matter if he has robbed the country of over £500,000."" Then Louis disappeared overseas. In this case, I point out, there is no Gabriel. Probably you, Mr Speaker, like myself, have travelled fairly extensively over Australia, and have been surprised at the effectiveness of the intelligence system of the Federal Taxation Department. It seems to have the all-seeing eye of God, so far as ordinary small taxpayers are concerned. It seems to have the very claws of the Devil with which to reach out for such men; and to have even the power to read their innermost thoughts. From day to day, one hears of somebody trying to escape from his obligations; but whether he goes to Cairns or Fremantle, in his attempt to elude the department by leaving the country, he finds an oflicial at his heels. With untiring zeal, the department traces the offender, compels him to face his obligations, and incidentally causes him to lose his passage money. But, in the case of Louis Abrahams, or Kidman, or others of that ilk, a different method is adopted. As Mr Justice Starke bas said, for years the Abrahams have evaded the law. Tbey should have been prosecuted; but they were not. What that learned judge remarked in connection with this case, Judge Edwards said about Kidman, another of the clique of enormously wealthy persons wbo were able to stifle the department's inquiries and make the law a dead letter. Tbey could go abroad without paying their income tax, and they could remain out - jf the country if they wished to do so. By and by Emanuel said ""I, too, feel very sick. I am suffering in body and mind."" And so, again, the departments suspended its investigation. The next it learned, apparently, concerning Emanuel was that he also bad gone overseas. Then Alfred refused to disclose the books, and again an officer recorded that by devious means this family was defeating the processes of the law. Gabriel, who was said to have been guilty of taking a gift of £650, was suspended! Why, I sbould like to ask, was not the evidence produced in connection with that case, in which the officer appeared in his own defence? Gabriel was told off to watch Mr Anstey. these rieoole, and was told to report from timeto time. He said that be did, but the department replied, in effect, "" The liar. He did not report."" A special watchman was appointed to do nothing more than report the movements of these persons; but, apparently, wben the Abrahams brothers disappeared, nobody asked where the sick men bad gone. There was no inquiry concerning the state of their health. Nobody seemed curious to know when they could be expected to be convalescent, so that the investigations might be resumed. If a report was made, it waa suppressed. Tbis is one of the most scandalous affairs that bas ever come under public attention in this country, not merely because of the doings of the individuals concerned in it, but also because, following upon what transpired in connection with this and certain land tax disclosures, the Government bas apparently laid down the dictum that men with enormous wealth can purchase immunity from the operation of the law. The Government bas said, through its Attorney-General, ""We bad no assurance that we could prove conspiracy."" It bad ample proof. If there was any doubt about the matter, the Abrahams brothers, of course, were entitled to the benefit of the doubt. If there was any likelihood-of their escaping the operation of the law it was blackmail on the part of the Government to take any money from tbem at all. But the fact is that from 1915 up to the present time, the amount of taxes for wbicb they bave fleeced the country, together with the penalties that they bave escaped, is not less than £1,000,000. The Government bas compromised with them by accepting £500,000! Whether the compromise is £500,000 or 5s., the Government bas compounded a felony. That view is confirmed not only by daily newspapers that bave investigated the case, but also by men wbo have' responsibilities connected with the High Court, and bave no association with the Government. I do not know bow the Government can escape blame in this matter. If they can gather any-'comfort from their attitude they are welcome to it . We are told that this motion ""is put forward for purely party purposes. Whatever may be the motives attributed to us by honourable members opposite, I can only say that the party that supports the conduct we have exposed ought to be driven out of public life. The partiality shown in the Abrahams case, the fact that for long years the law was allowed to remain inoperative, so far as their offences were concerned, constitutes, in my opinion, one of the greatest crimes perpetrated in this country in connection with the administration of justice.",55
186,Mr DUNCAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"HUGHES (Boothby) [9.10] - We are glad to bear the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) once more, and pleased to observe that he bas not lost any of that gift of imagination for which he bas always been distinguished. Some of his references to the officials who were suspended almost call for the production of evidence in substantiation of tbem; but nothing, so far, as I know, has yet been divulged to the House in regard to that. I shall follow the example of the honourable member in one respect, and that is by endeavouring to be as brief as possible in my remarks. The speech made by the Attorney-General this afternoon, and, if I - me upon it. may say so, the remarks by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) also, covered the whole field adequately, and anything that other honourable members could say would be largely recapitulation ; but I sbould like to refer to certain statements that have been made, and to note, some differences in the methods of attack from the other side of the House. For instance, the honourable member for Batman said that the Government bad omitted to safeguard the revenue, and had taken too little from the Abrahams family. "" Have they,"" he asked, "" got all the loot?"" The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), on the other band, said that the Government had insisted upon payment of the maximum penalty, and something over. Apparently, he followed the lead given bim in the judgment of His Honour Mr Justice Starke, of whose views I wish to speak with all deference.",58
187,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,I am afraid that the honourable member has not followed the argument on that point.,58
188,Mr DUNCAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"HUGHES - I took down the quotation from the honourable member's speech as he made it. I was interested in his reference to the ""loot,"" because we bave beard so often of that word, and I think that I bave quoted the honourable member correctly. It is quite natural that there should be a variation of opinion on this matter, because of the different judgments given by Mr Justice Starke in view of his different knowledge of the circumstances at different times. As I listened to the honourable member for Yarra, my mind went back four or five years to the long debates-whil e we were sitting in Melbourne-concernin g alleged concessions to rich taxpayers. I remembered the appointment of a royal commission to consider that matter, and I recalled the decision arrived at on the charges then made by the honourable member - I recollected also the statements made concerning the sale of the Geelong Woollen Mills, wbicb the Opposition thought would serve a useful purpose at the last election. I , personally, derived the greatest satisfaction from questions addressed to me on the hustings on that subject, because I found that I knew rather more about it than those wbo questioned Something has been said about one law for the rich and another for the poor. I am certain that those making that statement do not suggest that our judges are in any way open to criticism in that respect. If there is any truth in the assertion, then, so far as Australia is concerned, the law certainly bas a leaning in favour of the poor. In a country in which only one taxpayer in 30 pays direct Commonwealth taxation, surely there cannot be any suggestion that the law runs against the poor. I have frequently seen poor persons who could not afford to put down the money which they were called upon to pay, exempted from payment by the court until such time .as they should be able to do so. There is no truth in the assertion that in this country the law gives a greater advantage to the rich than to the poor; if it has any leaning to either side, it leans towards the poor. I dp not approach the question under discussion to-night as a lawyer. I do not know that I could do so adequately, even were I to try. As the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has said, "" I bave not the full facts, inasmuch as I have not seen all the papers."" That is the position of the people of Australia. Without the papers how can one consider the thousand and one things on which one's decision must be based? It is for the Attorney-General to do this on behalf of the community. But. in this case our Attorney-General did not act alone. He was advised by the Commissioner of Taxation, the Crown Law officers, and five counsel wbo are known throughout Australia as leading members of the Victorian bar. Sir Edward Mitchell's name bas been mentioned. Mr. Owen Dixon was also one of tbem. He is a man of such outstanding intellect and character that recently the Victorian Government asked bim to accept a seat on the Supreme Court bench of the State, and be did so for a time. Are we likely to get advice that is lacking on the moral side from a man wbo stands in high repute wherever his name is known, and that is everywhere in Australia? Are we to imagine that such a man would be on the side of the Abrahams family?",58
189,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,I agree with the honourable member. But what did Mr Owen Dixon sav on the subject?,59
190,Mr DUNCAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,HUGHE S - I am not in a position to tell the honourable member.,59
191,Mr BRENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Wel l that is the end of that matter.,59
192,Mr DUNCAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"HUGHES- I cannot quote what Mr Owen Dixon said, because I have not the opinion, nor bas the honourable member for Batman. I make no complaint on that score. Wben the Attorney-General says that be took this action on the advice of five leading counsel, I accept his word, and I do not need the production of the papers to be better assured on 'the point. In any case, in last resort the matter went to Cabinet, and I shall say a word on that point before I conclude. The advice of all tbese persons was that a certain course of action should be taken, and it was taken. What other attitude could the Attorney General bave taken up? If a criminal prosecution had been instituted, and failed, does any one suggest that the which would have been occasioned would have been of any benefit to Australia? I think that I am rigbt in saying that no property could bave been seized while that prosecution was in progress. It bas already - been emphasized that it would probably bave taken a very long time to bring proceedings of that sort to an end. Of course, in a matter like this the Attorney-General must take the responsibility, and on this occasion he is not shirking it ; but he would have put himself in a position which required considerable justification, if be bad taken a course of action which was directly opposed to that which be was advised by counsel to take. In Australia we are far too prone to criticize the man at the helm. Every one professes to know much about these matters. I confess that I am not in possession of all the facts in the Abrahams case-n o one is-bu t a perusal of the newspapers shows that some of tbem bave reached definite conclusions in some cases, I think, upon insufficient information. If the Attorney-General had done other than what he did there would have been just as much outcry fro m the (other side as there bas been because of the action he has taken. It would bave been said that be was foolish: that be had a very vague chance of succeeding in a .prosecution, and yet had gone on with it and lost everything. Tbat point would bave been particularly emphasized, because we know that the bulk of the money wbicb appears to be due was recoverable through the course of action taken. A great many speakers appear to bave overlooked the fact that it is due to the vigilance and skill of the Taxation Department, and also of the Crown Law Officers, that the matter has gone as far as it bas. Witb considerable difficulty, I suppose, aud at any rate, after the most careful thought, they embarked on what bave been described as kid-glove methods, thougb methods emthe bracing the blowing-in of safes appear to me to be fairly drastic. I need hardly repeat what bas already been emphasized - tba t the Attorney-General need not have brought this action against the Abrahams brothers because a penalty' could bave - been applied by the Commissioner of Taxation without any hearing. I have rarely delay had brought under my notice a case in wbicb I bave been more certain that the action taken in view of all the - circumstances was the right one to take. There was the fullest consideratiou of the of the details available by men of outstanding ability, and no favouritism, have been shown in - the decision reached. Without flattering the Attorney-General any one who knows him knows well that be would be one of the last to overlook the moral or the legal side of any course of action. He was in the best position to know what to do, and, in my opinion, he took the proper aud the only sound course to take. But he cannot, nor can the Ministry, shelve responsibility in the matter. do not always agree with what the Government does, but I have not the slightest doubt that the members of it are honourable men and indeed no one bas doubted it. The whole crux of the position is that in a case of this kind, where so many intricate ancl involved details are concerned, the final decision must be left to the man at the helm, who in this case is a good man aud he should be trusted.",59
193,Mr THEODOEE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Dalley) [9.25] The Government bas not adequately answered the case stated by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), and supported by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin). The honourable member for Barton (Mr Ley) bas misunderstood the motion if be thinks that it is directed against the Attorney-General personally. Its language is plain. It certainly impugns the Government, not on the ground that Ministers individually have been dishonest in the Abrahams case, but because, in their capacity as administrators, they bave not aijted properly. The motion challenges the action of the Government in regard to certain notorious income tax evasions, known as the Abrahams case, the histor-v of which discloses improper and unpredecented bargaining on the part of the Government with self-confessed malefactors. Tbat is the gravamen of the charge made by the honourable member for Batman, wbose charge has not been answered. The Attorney-General went to some pains to traverse the history of the case. He endeavoured to give the impression that there wasi'not sufficieut ground to sustain a charge of conspiracy. But the honourable member for Barton went further. He said that there whole was no possible hope of securing a conviction for conspiracy. The bonorcould able member's opinion is at complete variance with that of Mr Justice Starke, wbo said that tbese persons bad conspired together systematically to defraud the Commonwealth. He further made the remark that there bad been a widespread conspiracy. A justice of the High Court does not lightly make a comment of that sort. There must have been in his mind the strongest possible justification for the statement be made. Yet honourable memI bers on the Government side bave endeavoured to make light of the offence of these men, whose sinister history has just been related by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey). I bave not heard the honourable member's story of their career challenged from the opposite side of the chamber. Apparently, for a long period the Abrahams have been engaged in nefarious practices, and especially in offences against the Commonwealth law. Tbeir history must have been known to the Commonwealth authorities. Of course, it was known to the income tax officers. Tbey bad been engaged in investigating the malpractices of the Abrahams family. It must also bave been known to the Attorney-General, and, no doubt, to the whole Cabinet. Yet, knowing the real character of tbese delinquents, the Government entered into a gentleman's agreement with them. The Attorney-General did not answer the charges made by the honourable member for Batman in regard to th?.t agreement; he carefully avoided tbem. The honourable member for Batman pointed to one or two significant features of this agreement. He showed that provision was made in it that persons, wbo were not parties to the agreement sliould plead guilty to certain grave offences with which they would subsequently be charged. He showed also that the agreement was made with other parties who themselves were self-confessed criminals. The Attorney-General avoided the principal charges and contented himself with quibbling upon other less significant points. The High Court justice who reviewed this documert made some very caustic comments on it, and the Attorney-General was not able to explain tbem away. The judge said that the agreement trespassed on the province of the judiciary. That was a very severe censure. The judge continued- "" And the arrangement is contrary to the policy and plain intention of the Act."" I suppose there is no one more competent to express an opinion on Commonwealth law than a justice of the High Court, and one of them makes that severe commentary on the action of the A ttorney-Gener al. Mr G. FBANCIS - Has that judge never had a decision reversed?",60
194,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"This decision has not been reversed. The fact that a High Court judge may have had a decision reversed, is no ground for refusing to accept a decision or a comment he may subsequently make. If we adopted the doctrine that a judge's opinion in sucb circumstances is no longer of any value, we should bave to amend the whole system of our judiciary, and provide for the removal of judges whenever their decisions were reversed. Can the honourable member inform me whether this judge has bad a ruling reversed by the Full Court? The honourable gentleman remains silent. I do not pretend to have any special knowledge of the legal complexities of the present case, but this is the position as it appears to me, after having listened to the Attorney-General last week aud again this afternoon:. This is not by any means an ordinary case of evasion of income tax law. It is not a case in wbicb there have been evasions arising from bona fide mistakes; nor is it a case in which there has been anything in the nature of an ordinary attempt at avoidance of income tax liabilities. Asa matter of fact, what is involved is a widespread conspiracy to defraud, and indulgence in corrupt practices, and the persons wbo bave been guilty of tbese heinous offences, not once but upon many occasions over a period of years, are the parties with whom the Attorney-General has entered into an agreement to let them off with a fine when they might bave been liable to fine and imprisonment. The Attorney-General recognizes the weakness of that part of his .case, because he says in effect, "" We bad an opportunity of getting this fine, but we have given no assurance to the culprits of immunity from prosecution."" The Attorney-General would bave answered the case of the Opposition if he bad been able to give an assurance that his department would zealously apply the law to these culprits as soon as they could be arrested, and action taken. But be has avoided-giving any such assurance. He could clear the matter up now. Let bim answer by way of interjection whether be intends to launch a criminal prosecution against the Abrahams brothers or any one of tbem, when it shall be practicable to do so. They should be prosecuted, because there is a strong case for a charge of conspiracy. They bave escaped entirely their responsibility for the crime of conspiracy, which the High Court judge alleges against tbem, and which no one has seriously denied. Let us take the charge of conspiracy first. It is admitted from both sides of the House, that tbese men are probably guilty. Does the Attorney-General desire to sheet that charge home to them, - or are they to be exonerated from it, and their offences condoned because they bave made a large money payment? The Attorney-General is discreetly and eloquently silent. Mr G. FBANCIS - You have first to catch your man.",61
195,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,There is one for ' whom it is not necessary to look very far; that is Alfred Abrahams  member not bear the Attorney-General say that there was not sufficient evidence against bim ?,61
196,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,I did not bear him say it. Let bim say it now.,61
197,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I said that the evidence was weak, and that there was no chance of a successful prosecution.",61
198,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Then Judge Starke was entirely wrong in saying that there had been conspiracy.,61
199,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Hi s Honour waa not in possession of the facts. The evidence discloses fraud, but not conspiracy.",61
200,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Many allusions have been made to the opinions of counsel upon whose advice the Attorney General says he bas acted; but the documents themselves have been withheld. Wby has this been done? The Attorney-General aays that it is not usual to disclose legal opinions in such circumstances, and gives as his reason the fact that the case is sub judice, and might be prejudiced. I agree that it might be prejudiced if the Commonwealth Government intends to go on with the criminal prosecution, but is there any likelihood of that?",61
201,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"There are still outstanding further amounts of taxation, for recent years, and I am not going to give any opinion in regard to that.",62
202,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Does the right honourable gentleman say that there are still sums outstanding?,62
203,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Yes , sums which have not yet been assessed. But, apart from that, there is still the general objection disclosing such documents.",62
204,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Is the general reason sumcient for withholding documents upon which the Attorney-General relies for his own defence in this matter?,62
205,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I merely said that I had taken legal advice, and that I was not quoting my own opinion.",62
206,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"It is not a question of having faith in the Attorney General, nor is it a matter, as the honourable member for Barton (Mr Ley) alleged against us, that we cannot take the word of the Attorney-General. The question is, would a court of law accept the word of the Attorney-General, or any one else, who was depending for hia defence on documents which he would not produce ? It is a matter of producing in full the evidence to those who are charged with the task of examining the case.",62
207,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Does the Attorney-General say that the Abrahams paid £500,000 to have a charge withdrawn when there was no case against them?",62
208,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,No .,62
209,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"It appears to be a fact that in cases of crimes against the Commonwealth, persons are able to evade imprisonment by a money payment. If they have sumcient funds behind tbem they are able to escape the full punishment to wbicb they are liable. I believe that is the explanation of the present case. If it had been an ordinary taxpayer wbo bad faked his accounts and falsified his balance-sheet, he would now be behind >rison bars. But because these persons ! lave millions of pounds behind tbem, and are able to buy themselves out of the responsibility of their crime, they can go scot-free, and are able freely to carry on negotiations with the Attorney-General and enter into a gentleman's agreement with tbem. The honourable member for Barton justifies the action of the Attorney General in a manner different from that adopted by any one else who bas spoken from that side of the House. He applauds .the Attorney-General, not because of the justice he has shown, or because of his strict administration of the laws of the Commonwealth, but because of his business acumen. Tbis is a new principle to be considered, a new qualification for the Minister who presides to over the justice department of the Commonwealth. He is to be a man of business acumen, and he is to come to the aid. of the Treasurer "" in a year like this."" Apparently in a year like this the Commonwealth Government is having a bad time financially. It might even be faced with a deficit, and, therefore, the Attorney-General is to be accounted very successful if be shows business acumen in the administration of justice, and comes to the aid of a necessitous Treasurer!  useful man in Queensland a few years ago.",62
210,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Yes , be would bave been very welcome there. I ask the Attorney-General whether he has considered the effect upon State revenue of his action in entering into this strange, inexplicable and mysterious agreement with the Abrahams brothers ? If these culprits bave been defrauding the Commonwealth revenues, there is a strong presumption that they bave also been defrauding the State revenues in those States in which their income are derived. We know that there exists an arrangement between the Commonwealth and States Commissioners of Taxation, whereby the departments' may exchange information to prevent conspiracy to defraud, and to detect evasions of the income tax law. In this case the evidence collected by the Commonwealth Government would, no doubt, be very material to the .State Income Tax Commissioner. I understand from this agreement that much, if not all, of this evidence has been returned to the culprits.",62
211,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,I do not think that it has been returned yet.,63
212,Mr THEODOEE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,At all eveui* an - agreement has been entered into to return the documents. Has the Attorney-General - considered that aspect of the matter ?,63
213,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Tba t is a matter tor the Commissioner of Taxation. I can say that every facility will be given to the States.,63
214,Mr THEODOEE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,If the documents have been returned any facilities which <san be given to the State authorities will not be worth much.,63
215,Mr LATHAM,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Any application irom the States will be carefully considered.  ber surely does not want us to give away the whole of the case.,63
216,Mr THEODORE,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I am afraid that - the Attorney-General has already given it away. If the documents bave been returned, much of the evidence whicn would be vital to the States in establishing tlieir claim will not be available. These tax-evaders are not so discriminating that they will defraud only the Commonwealth, and not the State. Yet this agreement has been entered into without - consultation with the State crown law authorities or the State Income Tax Commissioner. I maintain that the charge of making an improper and unprecedented agreement with culprits wbo bave acted fraudulently bas been proved against the Government. There is convincing evidence that these persons conspired to defeat the laws of the Commonwealth, and that Ministers acted very improperly in entering into au agreement such as that wbicb has been laid upon the table of the library.",63
217,Mr HURRY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Bendigo) [9.47] - Tb e motion readsTliat, in the opinion of this House, the action of the Government in regard to certain notorious income tax evasions known as "" the Abrahams cases,"" the history of which discloses improper and unprecedented bargaining on the part of the. Government with self-confessed malefactors, and grave failure to safeguard the revenues of the Commonwealth, is repugnant to right practice and out of harmony with correct and settled principles governing the administration of the criminal law. The honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) bas practically challenged members of the legal fraternity on this side of the House to disagree with his statement of the case. The agreement, in connection with the case under which these proceedings were taken, is dated the 26th September, 1927, and was entered into between the Abrahams brothers and the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia, under the powers conferred upon, bim by the Income Tax Assessment Act. The punitive provisions of that act differ somewhat from those of the criminal law; but it is not my intention to take up the time of the House in discussing certain phases of this matter which have been very fully debated by the honourable member for Batman, who was answered by the Attorney-General (Mr Latham). In my opinion this agreement differs from others of a similar nature made by the Commissioner of Taxation under this section in three respects only: First, because of the magnitude of the sum involved; secondly, because of the complexity of the circumstances associated with the proceedings; and, thirdly, because the agreement was referred to the court. The magnitude of the case must be apparent to every honourable member, as no less than £750,000 is said by members opposite to be involved, and the amount which the Abrahams brothers have covenanted to pay approximates £500,000. We need refer only to some of the points which other speakers bave mentioned to realise the complex nature of the circumstances. No fewer than 2S persons are implicated and six or seven companies are involved, the partners in which total twelve. We can readily see that a case involving seven companies, in wbicb there are twelve partners, and in which 28 persons are implicated, made an investigation exceedingly difficult.",63
218,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Tba t may not be all.,63
219,Mr HURRY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,There may be others.,63
220,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,There are more.,63
221,Mr HURRY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"There may be; but at any rate the number I have mentioned shows the complexity of the transactions which bad to be inquired into before the taxation officials could really obtain the evidence they desired. The Attorney-General said that he was quite satisfied that a fraud had been committed in 1924; but that does not mean that the fraud could be proved. It is difficult to obtain evidence of fraud of this nature, especially in cases where so many persons are involved. It has been said that, when the safes and strongrooms in the premises occupied by the Abrahams brothers were forced open, a room f u ll of documents was confiscated, and that it would take eighteen months to unravel the transr actions which those documents recorded. That is sufficient to show the complexity of the transactions. third point I mentioned was that this agreement differs from others, inasmuch as it was referred to the court for a-judgment. The Income Tax Assessment Act provides that the Commissioner of Taxation may enter into such agreements. That act was passed by this Parliament.",63
222,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,But this Parliament also passed a Crimes Act.,64
223,Mr HURRY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Yes , but the Commissioner of Taxation took action under the act which I have mentioned. This agreement contains a recital which is as follows :And whereas the Commissioner hus upon the recommendation of the counsel employed by him and the law officers of the Commonwealth decided to accept the hereinbefore recited offers of the taxpayers and to enter into and execute this indenture. That was done on the advice of probably the most eminent counsel obtainable in Australia. I think every one will admit that the bar which gave that advice could hardly have been strengthened. It consisted of Sir Edward Mitchell, KC., Mr Owen Dixon, K . C , Mr Dixon Hearder, Mr Gorman, and Mr Robertson.",64
224,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Does the honourable member know what advice they gave?,64
225,Mr HURRY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"No ; but the agreement was entered into in accordance with their advice. A good deal has been said concerning Mr Justice Starke's remarks at the bearing. In a transcript of the proceedings on the resumption of the court after lunch, when His Honour was referring to the various considerations which these barristers bad in mind wben they gave their advice to the Attorney-General or the Commissioner of Taxation, Sir Edward Mitchell is made to sayMight I respectfully submit this view, these matters which your Honour referred to must have been present to the minds of counsel advising the Attorney General, and must have been present to the mind of the Attorney-General before he determined on certain action. Counsel here are [151] perfectly willing that Your Honour should see the opinion in writing which counsel for the Commissioner and the Attorney-General unanimously gave. These five eminent lawyers, supported by the Crown Law officers, considered all the facts before they came to a decision. Sir Edward Mitchell further said It was signed by all of them. I am quite willing that my learned friend should have a copy also and use it . so that Your Honour can see that nothing was overlooked and every. The thing was done in strict propriety. We do not desire that it should be published or that any one should see it except my learned friend, Mr Ham, and Your Honour. What could the Attorney-General do in such circumstances? He could not sift all the evidence, but had to arrange for that to be done by others before he made up his mind. The Attorney-General read the opinions which they expressed, and upon these he relied in arriving at his decision. What could the Government do but enter into thisagreement? It is strictly within the law which Parliament passed giving the Commissioner of Taxation power to enter into such an arrangement. There must be dozens of cases in wbicb the Commissioner of Taxation has exercised tbese powers.",64
226,Mr BKENNAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Not cases like this.,64
227,Mr HURRY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Not cases of the same magnitude. It is the amount involved, the complex nature of the proceedings, and the fact that the agreement was referred to the court, that makes this agreement different from others.",64
228,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Does the honourable member say that many cases have been treated in this way?,64
229,Mr HURRY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"I could not give the number; but I know that there have been some in which the Commissioner of Taxation has entered into agreements under an act passed by this Parliament. Such action is, of course, strictly within the law. We are indebted to the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) for his history of the case; but I think he was"" drawing upon his imagination a good deal. The Crown Law authorities cannot prosecute all the defendants, because they are not bere to prosecute. As every that practising lawyer knows, it is very difficult to prove conspiracy in some circumstances. When two of the accused are out of the country it is harder to prove a charge against the one who may be left. Generally speaking, I think that the action taken by the Commissioner of - Taxation in this case is well within the powers conferred upon him under the Income Tax Assessment Act. Every precaution was taken by the AtorneyGeneral and the Crown Law authorities t'o protect the public interest, and I think it will be admitted that a good financial bargain has been made by the Commonwealth. It would not have been of any benefit if the Government had allowed this opportunity to pass. The Government bas already received a certain sum, and has security for the balance. If this is a case of pounding a felony, as we bave been told by some honourable members opposite, it bas been done under the powers conferred by Parliament upon the Commissioner of Taxation. The Attorney-General bas done right, and I do not see bow he could have acted differently. Take the converse of this case. Supposing the Attorney-General bad insisted upon going on with a secution - In all probability the three Abrahams would bave got away. Already two bave gone.",64
230,Mr BBENSTAIT,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,Why did the Government not ask their solicitor where were. He was not asked to disclose their whereabouts.,65
231,Mr HURRY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Possibl y be did not know where they were; if be did, be would not disclose the information.

233,Dr MALONEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Melbourne) [10.11]. - I regret that, owing to an arrangement made by the Prime Minister and .my leader to limit speeches, I was unable to take part in the debate on the motion submitted by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), concerning the Abrahams income taxation frauds. I wisb now to say a few words on behalf of the Jewish race to which the Abrahams family belong. I feel certain that no decent Jewish man or woman in Australia bas any sympathy with the Abrahams brothers. I believe that, on the contrary, they take the view that justice would nave been done if the Abrahams had been more severely punished than they bave been. No race bas suffered so much as the Jews. It may be that the criminal tendencies of the Abrahams family are the result of generations of persecution of the Jewish people throughout the world, and their greed bas been developed to sucb an extent that they bave become the most detested conspirators in Australia. I believe that if the diadem of glory wbicb history bas placed upon the memory of the sacred martyrs of old could be bestowed on a nation or a race, it might fittingly be bestowed on the Jewish people, for their demeanour in the face of bitter persecu- tion. I bave it on the most, reliable authority that even since the signing of the Armistice, over 200,000 Jewish men, women and children bave been massacred in the various countries of Europe, principally in the Ukraine. I feel it incumbent on me to say a word for the PATHS. Jewish people because, during - the last few months I bave heard repeatedly the statement, "" Ob, they are Jews, so what can you expect?"" I believe that if the Crown had demanded £1,000,000 from the Abrahams brothers for immunity from prosecution, the money would have been forthcoming, because it is understood that they are worth anything from £4,000,000 to £8,000,000.",66

236,Mr R GREEN,FEDERAL CAPITAL TEEBITORY TRANSPORT,"Richmond) [10.17] I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation an important matter affecting totally disabled ex-soldiers. Recently the Government undertook to make provision for the transport of all seriously disabled soldiers, and the sum of £10 per month per man was set aside for that purpose. At that time. I pointed out that owing to the manner in which the instruction had been drafted, certain seriously incapacitated ex-soldiers would be debarred from participation in tbese benefits,' which were intended to apply only to soldiers, wbo were confined to a wheeled' chair or cot. Though I am a disabled ex-soldier myself my lot is not to be compared with ex-soldiers with double amputations, and I can assure honourable members generally that it is impossible for tbem to appreciate fully bow soldiers in that plight feel their disability. The otber^ day I accompanied an ex-soldier with a double amputation above the knee M the Repatriation Department in Sydney in order to put his case before the authorities. That man was able to get out of the car and move about on two little stumps 3 .or 4 inches in length. When in the prime of life he was a man 6 feet in height, but now he hardly comes up to my waist. The Deputy Commissioner for Repatriation in Sydney (Mr Barrett) informed me that the regulations which, I presume, had the approval of the Minister, precluded that man from participating in the benefits recently granted to totally incapacitated ex-soldiers. He was able to cross the pavement and reach his office without assistance. In other words, he couiu not receive the grant because be was not .confined to a wheeled chair or a cot. I ask honourable members to try to visualize that man, now only as high as my waist, whereas prior to his disability be was over 6 feet in height. He is refused the allowance merely because, by his determination, be has adapted himself to these pegs, and is able to cross a pavement instead of being carried. There are three such disabled men in Sydney, two of whom have persevered with these stumps, and are able to move about a little. The third has made no attempt to wear the Stumps, and be is the only one of the three receiving the allowance. I ask the Minister to give instructions to the Repatriation Commission that sucb men, with double amputations, shall receive the allowance irrespective of their endeavours to assist their locomotion. I give the Government credit for granting the allowance; but I urge those in authority to insist that deserving cases shall receive it .",66

Carried unanimously. And it was hoped that the chairman will receive a prompt reply. My excuse for bringing this matter forward is that I bave urged it previously in this chamber, on several occasions. I know that the Ministry is interested in extending civil aviation in Australia; but I regret that there has been little activity in that direction for some time. Last year a large amount of money was available for the purpose, and I hoped that this service would be instituted then. Wyndham is probably the most isolated post in Australia. At this time of the year it has a mail service only once every two months. Its residents feel that it would be helpful to tbem if their area were affiliated with Commonwealth territory. The Government would display a sympathetic spirit if it inaugurated this air service before the next wet season began. Once that commences there will be no chance to make the necessary landing grounds. Such a service would, primarily, carry the mails, and it would also make available medical service to the hinterland of Western Australia. The well-known incident of the lady wbo died at cbild-birtb because of the lack of medical attention must still be fresh in the memory of honourable members. I trust that I may receive from the Minister a definite intimation that the Government intends to proceed immediately with the inauguration of the air service that I bave referred to.",67
