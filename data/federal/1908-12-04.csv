45,Mr WEBSTER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Gwydir) [10.51] The only ground upon which the Minister last night upheld the adoption of this item by the Government was the action already taken by this Committee in raising the salaries of two other departmental heads. The Minister, of course, wants to see the head of his Department treated as well as are other heads. I am not sure whether this gentleman ever asked to have his salary increased. The' labourer knows the value of his hire, and, if no appeal has been made for an increase, I fail to see why the Committee should endorse the Ministerial proposal. The work of this Department is capable of material improvement. I know of no other Department that appears so effectually to prevent rather than assist effective administration. It seems to be the brake upon the wheel of the State coach. There should be ESTIMATES. some means of evolving a better administration of the Department. It is all very well for the Minister to lav the blame elsewhere. He first says that the States Public Works Departments are responsible AFFAIRS. for the delays, and then he says that it would not be economical or advisable to Staff), alter that state of things. We are informed that the States Public Works Departments are a stumbling-block in the way of effective administration. be re",14
46,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,We say that nothing better than the present arrangement has yet been devised.,14
47,Mr WEBSTER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I admit that the Minister has not had time to evolve ai better policy, nor am I making this criticism in any factious spirit. deal of the trouble, however, can be at the door of the Home Affairs Departwithout ment itself and its circumlocutory They are capable of vast improvement, spite of what its officers say. Even when know that matters have been delayed from other causes, they have not shown any sire to be more expeditious themselves. a Department knows that delays have been caused by authorities outside its own trol, but fails to exhibit any particular anxiety to push on matters affecting terests of the people of the Commonwealth, when it does come within its power to so, it cannot expect to escape the responsicase bility. I shall vote against the proposed increase. The officer evidently thought was well enough paid. We are not ranted in giving additions in salary at stage to the heads of Departments, the overtime due to many of the employds justlv treated. of the Commonwealth remains The men who worked weeks and months during many weary nights and days to keep their Department going when it was extremis should have consideration before we increase the salaries of those who are already amply paid. Until justice been done in that regard I cannot conscienpartment tiously support a proposition of this kind, especially when every day country members are receiving letters, which they are sending the Commonwealth Public Service. on to their constituents, regarding imporHome tant matters affecting their daily lives, though, so far as expenditure is concerned, the amounts involved are small - letters couched in these terms: ""This work cana not be done, as funds are not available,"" ""This work cannot be done until funds are available,"" "" This matter will be conpartment. sidered when funds are "" The matter is under consideration, and you will be communicated later; but we have to inform that at present no funds are available."" be increased proportionately. While we are forwarding such letters to our constituents every day, they read in the morning papers, that we are' increasing the salaries of the chief officers of the Departthe ments. Until we have the means to perform services which are of vast importance to people of the country, we are not justified in fairness or equitv'in granting those vances. It is beside, the question whether this gentleman is or is not entitled to the proposed increase: There is a time when employer can be liberal towards his manab°3\ ger, but that is when he has treated the A good rank and file of his employees equitably. laid While the men who can least afford to do that tb which they are entitled, methods. who are most affected by the withholding in of any sum due to them, have to stand out they of their money, and are not paid in pjr> portion to their services, it is not just for dea body of intelligent men to vote additional If salaries to officers who would not feel the loss of the proposed increases. These matconters have been brought before Parliament previously, and therefore I am not divulgthe ining any information that may be regarded as the property of any particular body. I do am dealing simply with an aspect of the which is a slur upon the administration of the Department concerned. The members he of this House will be blameworthy if they warpursue the course of giving advances to this well-paid officers, while neglecting to do while justice to those who have too long been ununpaid. Mr HENRY WILLIS (Robertson) [10.59] - The honourable member for Gwydir is quite right in his desire to imin prove the condition of all officers who are worthy of the positions they occupy, but I disagree with his assertion that the has Permanent Head of the Home Affairs Deshould not receive £ 9 0 0 a year. The office should carry a salary of £ 1 , 0 0 0 a year. It is one of the most important in The Affairs Department is a most imporaltant one. The riiillions of pounds which pass through it constitute a responsibility which should carry with it the payment, of £ r , o o o year to the officer in charge. The whole of the expenditure upon the establishment of the Federal Capital will pass through the DeI notice that the Accountant reavailable."" ceives the paltry sum of £ 5 5 2 a year. That officer should not be asked to accept with les? than £ 6 0 0 per annum, and the salary you of the Secretary of the Department should It is imperative that the officers of such a Department as this should not loolt for allowances from any outside quarter, and I trust that Minister will not yield to anvprotest against the proposed increase. The Secrethe tary of the Department is a most efficient officer, who has in his time refused an. offer adof an engagement at £ 2 . 0 0 0 a vear.",14
48,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"We are dealing not. an with the officer, but with the office.",15
49,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Quite so. When we have high-class men filling importanr offices we should be prepared to pay them well. In view of the large expenditure controlled by the Department, I hope that the Minister will not agree'to a reduction of the item.",15
50,Dr LIDDELL,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Hunter) [11.3] - It is difficult to understand the plea advanced by the honourable member for Gwydir, that the Secretary of this Department should not be granted an increase of salary on the ground that he has not asked for it. If we are to lay down the rule that no officer shall receive an increase unless he applies for it we shall give rise to a most undesirable state of affairs. I agree with the honourable member that the Post and Telegraph Department is starved, but that cannot be attributed to the fact that increases of a few pounds per annum are being granted to a few officers. Apparently the Labour Party desire to pack away a large sum of money for some other purpose. It would be far better to expend it in an effort to develop the commerce of the country.",16
51,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Fa r better to do that than to pay old-age pensions, I suppose?",16
52,Dr LIDDELL,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"On e may be strongly in favour of old-age pensions and yet disapprove of the method by which it is proposed to finance them.

53,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,That officer acted as Secretary whilst Colonel Miller was away valuing the transferred properties.,16

57,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Calare) [ n . 7 ] . - The honourable member for Hunter suggests that the Labour Party desire to utilize certain moneys of the Commonwealth for a hidden purpose. There are some honourable members who are prepared to vote increased salaries to highly paid officers whilst they withhold the same consideration from those ; r. the lower grades of the service. Those who criticise this proposed increase of salary recognise the ability of the officer concerned, and are anxious that a fair salary should be paid to him, but they object to undesirable distinctions being drawn between heads of Departments and those on the lower rungs of the ladder. Dr LIDDELL . - I suppose that the honourable member would pay all alike?",16
58,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"No , but there are men who, after spending practicallv a life-time in the lower grades of the service, are receiving only small salaries, whereas those who get to the top of the ladder and are able to reach the ear of a Minister secure an increase year after year. I freely admit that Colonel Miller is an able officer.",16
59,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,Hi s ability has saved the Commonwealth thousands of pounds during the last two or three years.,16
60,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"And he has been assisted by officers of ability, whose services are not recognised on these Estimates. The Secretary is deserving of praise fdr the way in which he discharges his duties, but I am not prepared in recognising his abilities to create anomalies. There sliould be some well defined policy in regard to the granting of increases of salary. It is proposed to increase the salary of the Secretary of the Department from £ 8 0 0 to £ 9 0 0 per annum. The next increase is in the salary of the Meteorologist, an officer of recent appointnient, who cannot be said to be entitled, by long service, to additional remuneration.",16
61,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,A condition of his appointment was that he should get periodical increases of salary.,16
62,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Ha d that all been made clear at the time of the appointment, my objection would be answered. I was not aware of the existence of such a when I first voted for the salary. It is proposed to give lum an increase of £50. The accountant of the Administrative Staff, however, is to get only £ 2 0 , a paltry increase considering the importance of his position. The chief clerk, a very able officer, whose duties are onerous, is left out in the cold. There is no recognition of his ability and long service, although a special grant of £ 1 5 9 is proposed as compensation for Secretarial work recently performed by him. That, no doubt, is extra work. He is to get no permanent increase of salary. Last year, in the Public Service' Commissioner's office, there was a Secretary to the Commissioner, at a salary of £ 6 0 0 , and an Examiner, at £ 4 0 0 . Now there is only a Secretary and Examiner at a salary of £ 5 2 0 , so that one man appears to be doing the work of two for £ 4 8 0 less than they were paid. There is no proposal to increase the salary of the Director-General of Public Works'",16
63,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,The salary creased last year.,17
64,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"That disposes of my objection, though I would point out that no increase is proposed to either of his subordinates-the Director of Public Works, located in Sydney, who gets £ 6 0 0 a year; and the Victorian Director, who gets £ 5 2 0 . I should like to see a more systematic arrangement of salaries. In my opinion, the fixing of all salaries should* be placed in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. I do not see why distinction should be drawn between the' position of the rank and file in this matter and those at the top of the tree. If the Commissioner can arrange a scale of increments for the small men, why cannot he do so for the big men?",17
65,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,He has power to do,17
66,Mr THOMASBROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I do not think that he has. I should like to know whether the increases which are being discussed have his approval. There must be dissatisfaction uncler the present system. The heads of Departments come into direct contact with Ministers, from whom they can get sympathetic responses to their requests for increases; but the rank ancl file are bound by hard-and-fast rules. This must breed discontent, and although I ' regret that I have to oppose the proposal of the Ministry which I am supporting, f feel it my duty to protest against what is being done. We Labour men, who wish to secure a reform in this matter, have been accused of being actuated by ulterior motives, and members of the Opposition are always ready to assist the Ministry in greasing the f at sow; but we cannot shirk our responsibility. We are prepared to submit our case to the electors. Criticism has been levelled against the Department of Home Affairs because of the slowness with which public works are carried out. I am disposed to think that the Department is made the scapegoat of other Departments. cannot properly be held responsible, so long as it is dependent upon the officials of the States for the preparation of plans and specifications, and the supervision of pub[103]- 2 lie works. The officials of the States have plenty of work to do in carrying out the instructions of their own Governments. They naturally do first the work of those who pay them, the Commonwealth needs being a secondary consideration, and looked upon as providing extra tasks, for which no remuneration is given. Until we have was in- a supervising public works staff, it will be unfair to blame the Department for delays in the carrying-out of public works.",17
67,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Dalley) [11.23] - I have listened with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Calare, who put his case very well. No member should apologise for criticising the Estimates. It is caddish to attack a man because he is not always ready to vote for large salaries. I am not a skinflint, and have no objection to large salaries; but I find fault with the present system. Those who are under the limelight get all the good things. The heads of Departments, coming, as they do, into direct contact with Ministers, obtain favours, and thus we have got what is cal led '' souperism.'' The Minister of Home Affairs, being an Irishman, will know what so. that is, and how objectionable is the practice which the term covers. I refer to the system of the Permanent Head of a Department receiving favours which are not enjoyed by those lower in the ranks. Why should the Permanent Head be selected for advancement, ancl be freed from the review of the Public Service Commissioner, who has been appointed, at a high salary, in the interests of the country ? I am against any one, whether he be messenger or Permanent Head, being underpaid; and if it is true that £ 9 0 0 is a proper salary for this office, then it is clear that for the last four or five years the officer has been sweated, and is practically a creditor of the Commonwealth. It will be remembered, however, that the work of this officer is no more now than it was in the early days of the Commonwealth; in fact, his staff was not then in proper working order, or trained or equipped, and, therefore, there should really be now less responsibility. I notice that when an honourable member attacks a salary, he is supposed to almost apologize, and say something nice. about the ability of the It officer; but I do not see why we should not confine ourselves to the office and leave the individual officer out of the question. If a man, in a position of this kind, does not save the country thousands of pounds, he has no right to be there; and if he does most other men. save money, that is what he is engaged and paid for. It is manifestly unfair that Permanent Heads should be recommended for increments, while nothing is done the officers in the lower positions. I agree with the honourable member for Robertson that officers who realise their should be well paid; but I know that in another Department I have discovered member for Kalgoorlie and I many officers with high salaries, who shirk their responsibility, and allow junior cials to do the work. I do not understand why, when an honourable member desires oppose an increase of salary, he should be compelled to remove his boots, as though about to enter the holy of holies, and ask to be excused for the step taking. The salaries of two other permanent Heads have been brought up to £ 9 0 0 ; and I do not see why the officer under discussion should be made a scapeister goat. What I am attacking is the ciple of these recommendations being quite apart from the Public Service Commissioner; and the sooner we make up mrhds that the Minister should 'not have this power, the better it will be.

81,Mr COON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I do not know; but the Victorian Government, and also the Harbor Trust, do much that they should not in connection with public supplies. It is very strange that Australian manufacturers - should not be permitted to tender; ancl it would appear that if the present specifications stand, there will be created a monopoly such as I understand the Labour - Party, to be pledged against. The tenderer is allowed to charge any price he likes, being told that a certain kind of - fan must be used, and must come from the Old Country. At the proper time. I shall move that the item referring to this matter shall be struck out. Sir WILLIAM LYNE) [11.37]. - The honourable member for Dalley is quite mistaken when he says that the work performed by the Permanent Head of this Department is not quite as arduous and responsible as it was some time ago; as a. matter of fact, the actual work and the responsibility have been increasing year by year. This officer is not one who quietly sits down and allows things to go along as they may, but he takes a great interest in his work. For some considerable time past he has been actively engaged in connection with the transferred properties; .and I am happy to know, though I am not at liberty to divulge the amount, that he has reduced the possible expenditure of - the Commonwealth by a considerable sum. It has further been said that, while increases are given to some of the heads of Departments, no consideration has been .given to men of the lower grades. That .also is an absolute mistake, because, from figures which I had supplied to me, when I anticipated having to defend these Estimates myself, I learned that the total increments in the year 1906 amounted to £ 5 > 5 3 - The Public Service Commis2 I sioner shows in the following memorandum the exact position :As increments to officers of the clerical division, class 5, and all officers of general division are provided on the draft Estimates by ""the Departments concerned, the Commissioner is unable to say what provision in this regard has been inserted in the iqoS-9 Estimates. It - is difficult to give the actual increases in any - given financial year for the reason that under the Public Service Act the year closes with the 31st December, and the Commissioner's returns are made up on that date, whereas the Treasury financial year closes on 31st July. Details of the expenditure on increments actually paid for the calender years 1906 and 1907, have, however, been compiled, and from these may be gathered a fairly approximate idea of the probable expenditure that will be incurred for 1908-9 on increments. The total increments for the two years was as underAmount Expended. Annual Rate. 1906. l 9°7Minimum salary ... 14,442 ... 11,692 General Division ... 19,133 --- 17,397 Clerical DivisionClass S ... ... 9,192 ... 7,356 Class 4 and higher ... 8,701 ... 8,734 Professional DivisionClass F ... ... 160 ... 105 Class E and higher ... .525 ... 470 Total - £5 >'53 - £45>754 2 From these figures it is fair to assume that the ordinary expenditure on increments for 190S-9 will be approximately about the same as that for 1907, but in addition extra increments are provided for this year for raising the maximum of the 5th class clerical officers, also for increasing the grading of the General Division. These two extra sums are as underLong service increments to £180 in clerical division, class 5 ... £11,250 Cost of new General Division grading for first year ... ... 5,000 Total £16,250 The above being added to the anticipated increases for 1908-9 will make the approximate amount for increases for the present year £62,004. It must not be assumed that the cost of the service will be increased by this amount. As against the increase must be allowed the savings that are made throughout the year by retirements, deaths, and the filling of vacancies at the minimum salaries of the classes. The savings under these headings amounted to £55,176 last year. The amounts provided in the Estimates of expenditure for the current financial year, at the instance of the Commissioner, for promotions and increments in the Public Service, are as follow:Class Promotions ... ... 2,228 Subdivisional Promotions ... 7,974 General Division Grading ... 5,000 Long Service Increments Class 5 11,261 Regrading Victorian Post Offices 500 Total ... £26,963 It must be admitted that the officer whose salary is now uncler discussion is very earnest and energetic in his work. The way in which he carried out the gigantic work in connection with the visit of the American Fleet was really marvellous.",19
82,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Leavin g the name out, any officer occupying that position ought to be equally energetic.",20
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"The honourable member is quite right; but we do not always get them, l t was I who originated the Home Affairs Department, and I waited for three or four months before appointing a Permanent Head, knowing that Colonel Miller was then in South Africa, in order to secure his services, as I knew him in New South Wales, to have been an energetic, earnest, and able officer. That is how he came to be appointed to that position. He has been dealing with the question of transferred properties, and, when that matter comes before the House, honourable members will see the immense amount of work that he has done in connection with it, and the savings, if I may call them so, that he has effected on behalf of the Commonwealth. AU these matters should be considered. ""When you have a man at the head of a Department about whom you need - not worry, but who is always on the qui vive to do what ought to be done without being told to do it, he ought to be regarded as a man to be kept. Our officers in these Departments get less than do officers in corresponding positions in the services of two or three of the States.  States services, then?",20
84,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,Some of them regretted it. ,20
85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"There is a great deal of sentiment affecting the minds of some; but I do not mean that these particular officers received higher salaries when they were in the State services. My point is that corresponding positions-at any rate, in Victoria and New South Wales--comman d higher salaries. have, in selecting our officers from the State services, sometimes taken them from lower positions and given them an opportunity to step up. Colonel Miller did not receive so large a salary when in the New South Wales service; but he has proved himself an earnest and good man, and the office which he holds is not paid as well as are corresponding positions in two or three of the States. The Under Secretary for Works in New South Wales used to get, I think, somewhere between £ 1 , 2 0 0 and £ 1 , 5 0 0 a year, and this position is in much the same category. I hope the Committee will not refuse to pass the small in creases that are proposed, especially as a large sum of money has been given-and properly so-to the lower grades of the service, showing that whilst we have considered the higher officers we have considered the lower ones also.  one honourable member who has spoken against the proposed increase has said a word against Colonel Miller's ability as an officer. It is simply a question of principle with me. No doubt he is worth the money ; but, in view of the state of the finances, I do not think the time is opportune Lo give the increase. As to State officersbeing better off than those in the Commonwealth service, when I have been in Brisbane dozens of officers have come to me to ask me to do my best to get them positions in the Commonwealth service. State officers say that Commonwealth officers are better off and have greater privileges, particularly with regard to the income tax. The cry throughout Queensland was that the State officers had to pay that tax while Federal officers escaped it. I asked the Public Service Commissioner on one occasion if he had many applications from Stateofficers. He told me that he has more applications from them for Federal billetsthan he has from Federal officers. Consequently our service cannot be too bad. I remember one particular instance of a Hansard reporter from Queensland. He camehere, and the work apparently did not suit him during the first few weeks of the session, so he went back again to the State service. In moving to reduce this item, I hacl no animosity whatever against Colonel Miller, nor have I against any other officer in the service. We have a fine lot of fellows, and a worthy lot of officers. I believe in a highly paid service, because it means a highly contented service, but I We have in my mind's eye a case where one particular head of-a Department in the Commonwealth service has been able to get two increases, while an officer under him has not secured any. His application had to go through the man who had alreadv obtained those two increases. That shows that the man who can get the ear of the Minister is in the best position.",20
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Are we going to doany business today ?  anxious to do' business, I am prepared tosit down.",20
87,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"North Sydney [f 1.50] - Objectio n can be taken to the way in which some of the salaries of the Secretaries of Departments are dealt with. For instance, four Departments are always - kept at the same level of pay, although there is a difference in the responsibility and in the amount of work. There should be a - corresponding difference in the salary. There - ought to be a grading as regards those four Departments that would give salaries corresponding to the importance and amount of the work. In my opinion this question should have been dealt with by the Public Service Commissioner, but, of course, he - claims that he has not the power, and Ministers have taken upon themselves the responsibility. With regard to the matter .now before the Committee, we have already passed two of the proposed increases, and .as a division has been taken on them and the fight has been concluded, it is absurd to propose to deal differently with the two - cases remaining. As honourable members have expressed their views, they might well - let the other items go.",21
88,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Swan) [11.52]. - I am not in accord with the view that the Secretaries of Departments should be subordinated to the Public Service Gommissioner in regard to their salaries. In the interests of the Public Service itself the Minister should have some one near him who is independent of the Commissioner. The Secretaries of Departments have statutory powers under the Public Service Act. To make them dependent upon the - Commissioner for increases of salary would not be likely to encourage that independence which they now have-responsible, as they are, only to the Minister - and to Parliament. By the Public Service Act a great many duties are cast upon the Secretary of a Department, and he has the responsibility of efficiently manning his Department by making recommendations to the Commissioner. He has statutory powers independent of Ministers. To subordinate him to the Commissioner would be to strike a blow at the theory of the Public Service Act. He is at present - on an equality with the Commissioner in tlvj service.  - do many unfair things.",21
89,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I did not mean to imply anything of the sort. I have the 'highest respect for the present Commissioner. But the principle of the Public Service Act requires that the principal officer of a Department shall be independent of the Commissioner, and to that end he has statutory powers as well as great departmental responsibility to the Minister, and is of the same status as the Commissioner. ",21
90,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"The Commissioner's powers - are well defined. The powers of the two are not likely to clash. If they did, this House would have to settle the question. The present arrangement '.s wise, and my experience is that .it works well. Unless it is found to work badly, we should not disturb it. There are only four or five officers in this position in the whole of the service. I quite agreethat those closest to one comemore directly under one's notice, but that cannot be avoided. We cannot avoid heads of Departments being brought more directly in touch with Ministers than are officers in remote parts of the Commonwealth; but the position would be the same, even if they were under the Public Service Cimmissioner.",21
91,Mr BAMFORD,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,Every officer in 'the Public Service Commissioner's office obtained a rise last year.,21
92,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"It would appear, then, that the increases in those cases were granted indiscriminately. I have not heard of any undue clashing of authority, so far as the Public Service Commissioner and the heads of Departments are concerned. Probably those who framed the Public Service Bill did not fully realise what would be the true legal position under it ; but on the whole it has worked well, and. in this respect, I hope that it will not be disturbed.",21
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Parramatta) [11.57'J - I should not have spoken but for the renin:-ks just uttered by the right honourable member for Swan. I find myself utterly unable to endorse his view. The Public Service Act, to my mind, breaks down at the very beginning, if it does not control the high officials of the Service. I come from a State where the Under Secretaries of Departments are under the control of the Public Service Board, and I have never known the slightest difficulty to arise from that fact. On the other hand, I have known difficulties to arise in the Federal Service where such officers are not under the Commissioner.",21
94,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,I have not heard of any difficulties.,22
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I do not wish to rake up the past, but I am afraid that the divorcement of high officers from the control of the Public Service Commissioner of the Commonwealth has resulted in some of the ablest men in the Service going out of it .",22

102,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,The head of Department has no power to increase salaries.,22

One of the reasons for this that the Secretary has the ear of the Minisshould ter while the Public Service Commissioner has not. The Service would be improved if every member of it , from the highest to the lowest, were placed under the Comhave missioner. In order that that may be done, the status of the Commissioner himshow self might with advantage be raised. I is too near the status and position of some officers who are without his control, and who are immediately under the eyes of Ministers. The moment we begin to set up men with equal authority and responthat sibility, human nature begins to work and there is trouble. That has been our exto perience in connection with the CommonI wealth Service. In New South Wales, where the Public Service Board controls every appointment from the top to the botshould tom of the service, there has never been the slightest trouble.",22
104,Dr MALONEY,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Melbourne) [12.0] can endorse all that has been said by the honourable member for Parramatta. wish it to be clearly understood that shall vote for this amendment, not because 1 desire to attack any officer, but because 1I have to carry out a pledge that I have given to my constituents. Every member of the Service, from the humblest individual who sweeps out an office to the highest salaried officer, should be under the same rule, and have equal chances of advancement. We find, however, that the Public Service Commissioner has no control over certain officers. My contention is that if he is fit to control men who will ultimately become of Departments, he is fit to control! Comthose who already occupy such positions. I can speak of the great .capacity and mental equipment not only of Colonel M i l and Mr Garran, but of other officers. Mr Knibbs, for instance, is now producing one of the finest statistical works published outside the United States of America. As honourable members are aware, the Government of the United States probably spends £ 1 0 to every -£i expended by other countries on the collection of staa tistical information; but Mr Knibbs is producing for the Commonwealth a. work that will rival even some of the finest staproductions of America. I should a like to ask honourable members' whether nine they are aware of the abominable system beobserved in every Department in regard tc* This Parliament for the first time in history deteris mined that men and women in the service receive equal pay for equal work, and that a minimum wage of £ 1 0 4 per annum should be fixed. That provision, however, is being evaded in many ways. I only one instance of the kind that I can absolutely prove, and I can certainly that the Public Service Commissioner t has taken one man out of his turn. I can> forgive him for that, because the case was an exceptional one, and no doubt if I occupied his position there would be more. I have received many reports to the effect this course is repeatedly followed by him j but such inquiries as I have been able make have not borne out that complaint. repeat, however, that there is an abominable and iniquitous system followed in regard to the women cleaners,- and that it be abolished. I have found Colonel"" Miller an able man with a judicial mind, and ready comprehension. There is one I officer in his Department who, as the result of action recently taken by him, will I save not only the Commonwealth, but every I State a very considerable expenditure. I allude to Mr Oldham, the officer in chargeof the electoral branch, whose action in abolishing the present absurd system of collecting the rolls will save Victoria more, perhaps, than any other State, a very considerable expenditure. I repeat that those - who tliink that I shall vote against these increases because of personal considerations will do me an injustice. I am pledged to try to bring every officer of the service under the same rule and charter. No one - can deny that heads of Departments have many opportunities to meet Ministers, and that the personal equation is one that we - cannot get away from. We should endeavour, however, as far as possible, to minimize its effects. I should have been ,glad had our party been able to take up .the reins of administration with a majority of one behind it. We should then have .been able to get away from precedent, andi in regard to any proposed expenditure that we believe to be unwise, to have voted as our consciences dictated. In this case we are making no attack upon an individual, 'but are simply endeavouring) to remed'y what we believe to be wrong.",22

143,Mr WEBSTER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"If the present system is not the best, let us criticise and alter it ; but we should not discuss every small matter in regard to this or that officer, and indicate practically how the Public Service Commissioner should carry out his duties.",26
144,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,The honourable member cannot have listened to what I said.,26
145,Mr WEBSTER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"The honourable member for Brisbane must have an object in making his remarks; but, if we are to criticise the administration of the Public Service Commissioner, let us do it in the proper way, and at the proper time. The honourable member said that he had not approached the Public Service Commissioner, as the Commissioner resents that sort of thing. It is a good thing for Parliament and the public that he does resent it. I shall be sorry to see the day when some obstacle of that kind does not stand in the way of those who, according to the history of politics, as we read it, have ever and anon been trying to push forward the interests of those with whom their sympathies lie. That sort of influence has been abolished by the existing system, and I hope it will not be resurrected in the way proposed. With regard to the present procedure, how seldom do we find honourable members selecting the cases of humbler 1 members of the service for advocacy in this Chamber ! We do not find any honourable members informing the Public Service Commissioner through the debates in thisChamber that individuals in the lower ranks of the service have not received justice. When certain honourable members, rise to speak of individual cases, they always indicate some one in a high grade of the service. Therein lies the reason why these matters should not be brought forward in the House in this way. It is a good thing that such action has no effect on the Public Service Commissioner.  I who asked the honourable member for Brisbane to name an instance of a publicservant who regretted his transfer from the State to the Commonwealth service. It ispeculiar that the honourable member has-, named an officer about whose position I probably know more than any other honourable member does. Mr Lawson wasanxious to get into the Federal service, because he could see there was very littlechance of promotion in the State service.",26
146,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I think he was quite wrong, and I was in a position to know.  that he was anxious to get into the Federal service and take his chance, as hethought the prizes were more numerous, and the opportunities of promotion greater. From what I have heard, that has beenpractically the case with every other officerwho came from the State services. They were rightly anxious to get into the Federal' service, which I think is much better than the State services are. The honourable member for Brisbane is quite right on the question of influencing the Public ServiceCommissioner. The only chance an honourable member has of letting the Commissioner hear him at all is either through the Minister or on the floor of the House. I have hacl to bring cases forward where public servants have been harshly and cruelly treated by the Public Service Inspector in Queensland, ancl therefore, through him, by the Public Service Commissioner. When I brought the cases forward in the House, the Minister brought the Commissioner and myself together in the Minister's room, we discussed the pros and cons of the matter, and settled it to the satisfaction of both the Commissioner and the public servant. No one denies that Mr Lawson is an able officer. He was the commissioner who divided Queensland into electorates, and did it in a manner that was so satisfactory that there was not a single complaint even from honourable members themselves. This House accorded him a vote of thanks for the admirable manner in which he did the work. I have no doubt that when higher positions become vacant Mr Lawson's past career in the State service will be taken into account. We know how it was that salaries in the Queensland State service were reduced. Retrenchment was called f b r in that State, and the first to suffer were the public servants. Many were retrenched out of the service altogether. As soon as the State began to prosper, Mr. Lawson was one of the first officers to be taken on again. That speaks volumes for him. No one knows Mr Lawson's capabilities better than does the Public Service Inspector in Queensland, and I am sure that Mr Lawson will get a square deal from him if any position for which he is eligible becomes vacant.",26
147,Mr STORRER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Bass) [12.48] - When the salary of the Secretary to the Department was under discussion a number of honourable members expressed regret that that officer was not under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner, in order that his position should be free from , Parliamentary or political influence. But, as soon as we have disposed of that question, the case of a gentleman, who is under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner, is brought forward. If we are going to discuss the positions of the various officers under the Commissioner, what becomes of the question of political control or influence? This particular gentleman seems to have been under the direction of the honourable member for Brisbane in Queensland. If influence is brought to bear in cases of this kind, the result is likely to be just as bad as in the case of the Secretary to a Department, who is directly under the control of the Minister. If we are to have these divided opinions, and to discuss the cases of individual members of the service, the consideration of the Estimates will occupy a good many more days.",27
148,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,I mentioned the matter only because I was challenged to name a case.,27
149,Mr STORRER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"It is not advisable to bring cases of individual public servants before the Committee. We all know officers in our respective States whom we consider to be very good and clever j but if we intend to deal with individual cases here, we might as well abolish the Tublic Ser-' vice Commissioner and all his paraphernalia. I shall not occupy time by bringing forward the cases of all the able men that we have in Tasmania. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 23 (Public Service Commissioner), £ 1 1 , 0 5 8 , agreed to.

150,Mr COON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Batman) [12.52] - In order to test the feeling of the Committee on the question of whether Australian tenderers should be given an opportunity of tendering for the supply of the ventilating fans that I have mentioned, I move That the item, "" Director-General, £900,"" be reduced by £1. An honourable member who asks a. question of the Minister in charge of a Department is entitled to a reply; but the Minister of Home Affairs did not think my request was of sufficient importance to offer any reply. He gave as an excuse for the present advertisement the fact that the Government were following the example of the late Government. He implied that they intended to proceed on different lines; but I have yet to learn in what particular they are going in a different direction from the late Government. Up to the present we are told that they are proceeding on the same lines. It is difficult to discuss this question in view of the Prime Minister's statement that he was not prepared, on the most important question of the day, to say whether his Ministry was a free-trade or a protectionist Ministry.",27
151,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,I said nothing of the kind.,27
152,Mr COON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"The honourable member and said that this was not the time to do i but it is the time so far as I am concerned. The fans were installed in this buildtemperature ing under the guidance, we were told, of protectionist Ministry, and the honourable member who was responsible for that was - was the late Minister of Home Affairs. Since that time, however, we have imposed a duty. There is now being manufactured in Victoria what is known as the Burkett of Mr. fan, and it has successfully passed the the most severe tests. A trial took place Bendigo a few weeks ago, and among the those present was a member of the State Labour Party, who said that he was so expressed satisfied with the test that he would be prepared to recommend the use of the fellow fan.",28
153,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,What objection has the honourable member to the fan used with such excellent results in the ventilation of this chamber?,28
154,Mr COON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I have no objection to it. My centention, however, is that while the Ministry professes to be opposed to monopolies, it would seem to be prepared to build a fence round a firm manufacturing these fans abroad, and to prevent any one else from competing with them in the Australian market. They say that the Department requires a fan that is made in the Old Country, and they will not allow a local firm to tender.",28
155,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,Why not?,28
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Because they in favour bf monopoly, I suppose?",28
157,Mr COON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,That is the only reason I can think of.,28
158,Mr HALL,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,-Because they are following their predecessors.,28
159,Mr COON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Then they have no right to occupy the Treasury bench. The f o l lowing report appeared in the Argus of srst October last, regarding the trial of the Burkett fan at BendigoRENnico, Friday - The Mines Department are allowing inventors of fans trials at the Gjeat Extended Hustler's Mine. This evening a public trial was given of the Burkett suction fan. Th s fan, which is styled a 6-ft. : Burkett fan, has been working over the "" P up s"" shaft, since October 9, with isfactory results. The trial was conducted in (he presence of Mr A. H . Merrin, Chief Inspector of Mines, Messrs. Livingston and Cotter, M.L.A.'sMr Cotter was recently returned to the State Parliament as a member of the Lahour PartyE l i Trewern and Wilfre d Rickards, of the t ; Mining Managers' Association. The air was drawn through the main shaft and workings, and up the "" Pups"" shaft. Before the test the below was S35 deg., but aftera wards it was reduced to 76 deg. At the first test the fan was drawing 18,400 cubic feet of air per minute, and at the second the exhaust increased to 20,340 cubic feet per minute. Between the tests it was found that the natural current coming up the upcast shaft was only 8,500 cubic feet per minute. Livingston, as Chairman of the Board Directors of the Burkett Company, said inventor was a Victorian, and the fans were at of Victorian manufacture. Mr Merrin said mine had been one of the most difficult to ventilate, and the trial had resulted satisfactorily. Messrs. Trewern and Rickards also their appreciation. Mr Cotter said he was prepared to recommend the fan to his Labour members for the amelioration of the conditions of the miners. Silting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.",28
160,Mr COON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I should like to inform the Committee that the Mr Rickards, who, according to the report I have read, expressed approval of this fan, is the manager of the deepest gold mine in the world. I am at a loss to account for the attitude taken up by the Minister of Home Affairs. In the early hours of this morning I twice questioned him with regard to tins matter, but could obtain no reply, and when I questioned him a third time. I was informed that the Government were simply following the course adopted by their predecessors in office. Assuming that the Labour Party are, as they claim to be, the party of progress, surely if the late Minare istry did something wrong-and I do not admit that they did-the present Government are not prepared to slavishly follow in their footsteps. We were told yesterday, during the course of a debate on the question of immigration, that there were in Australia a number of men out of work, and I think that I may well inquire, in view of the attitude of the Minister, in regard to this matter, whether he and his colleagues are prepared to throw more men out of employment. Is that their policy? Surely the Government should be prepared to use the locally-made fans, and so to find employment for more of our own woiksrs. The Minister of very satTrade and Customs knows the manufacturer of these fans, who is one of his constituents.",28
161,Dr MALONEY,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,What is his name?,28
162,Mr COON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"He is a Mr Marshall. I have no personal interest in the matter, but stand here as a representative of the working classes. If the Labour Party are not prepared to advocate the claims of the men whom they say they represent, I am. Never in the history of this Parliament has there been witnessed such a spectacle asthat now presented by the Minister of Home Affairs. Is he prepared, with his colleagues, to go to the country and declare that he does not believe in the use in the Departments of the Commonwealth of an article of Australian manufacture? he prepared to say that he and his party prefer an imported article? The honourable member's silence is practically an admission that he is not prepared to give the local manufacturers of these fans an opportunity to tender for those required by the Department. He was not dumb when he was sitting in the Ministerial corner. The Minister who then failed to give what he regarded as a satisfactory answer to a question put by him had a lively time. change has come over him. To-day the honourable gentleman appears to be able to adapt himself very readily to his altered circumstances. What will the working classes say when they learn that the Labour Ministry is not prepared to stand by an Australian manufacture? Surely the honourable gentleman does not wish to shelter himself behind the plea that he is following the course laid down by his predecessor?",28
163,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"How is it that honourable member had nothing to say when a member of the late Government, he was a supporter, took up the same attitude ?",29
164,Mr COON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I had something to say about the matter. I am not tied to skirts of any Ministry. I am prepared support the Government while I believe them to be doing right, but if their present attitude on this question is continued they will not be able to count very long on support. I am not going to stand long lwhind a Ministry that is not prepared to assist local industry. The Minister of Home Affairs has ignored my request for information, and T. wish to tell him once that he will have to look elsewhere his support if he is going this way- I was returned as a protectionist in opposition to the Labour Party, and the Labour leagues in my own election torate today are selecting a candidate oppose me at the next general election. do not complain of that, but I do complain of the stand taken by the Minister on this here. question. Had he said that he would consider my representations, or that not think the locally-made fans were suitable for the purpose for which the Department requires them, the position would be different. But he was prepared to allow my amendment to go to a division without giving a single reason why the specifications of the contract in question should not be ' amended. 1 could quote testimonials to show that the Australian fan oosts £ 5 0 less than the imported fan, ancl needs Is only half as much motive power to work it.",29
165,Dr MALONEY,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,Then why does not the Australian manufacturer tender?,29

167,Dr MALONEY,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Is it a patented fan? . Mr COON --Yes ; made in the Old Country. Seeing that the Australian fan is so much better, why does not the specification require that it . and not an imBut a ported fan, shall be submitted? Ministers show no desire to expedite the passage of the Estimates, and I trust that the Committee will reduce the item to let the people know those who support the policy of giving work to our manufacturers, and recognise the value of Australian-made goods. Had the late Ministry been in power, the importance of this matter would have been recognised.

172,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,I had not seen that vertisement before last night.,30
173,Dr MALONEY,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"The seventh paragross graphof the specification mentions a Sirocco fan, which, I understand, cannot be made hete, and therefore I ask Minister to authorize an alteration which will allow Australian manufacturers to compete. Fans are made in an estab-' lishment located in the electorate of Minister of Trade and Customs, and other parts of the Commonwealth, and - both protectionists and free-traders are agreed that fair play should be given Australian manufacturers by putting them on the same footing, in the matter of ders, with manufacturers abroad. I do not know anything about the merits of the Australian fan, but the statement the honourable member for Batman, that *s £ 5 0 cheaper, and requires less power, should be carefully examined. am glad that the late Postmaster-General whether it can do the work required. did so much for the comfort of the attenam dants in the telephone exchange. medical members of the Committee will from the Minister. endorse my statement that no occupation puts a more severe strain on mental energy than does that of attending to telephones. When a member of State House, I frequently drew attention to this matter, and the result has been considerable shortening of hours.

I have seen him in this mood before, and I - have a shrewd suspicion that he has been quietly preparing a reply which will completely answer the statements of the honoradable member for Batman. That is my interpretation of his sphinx-like attitude. A injustice has been done to local manufacturers if the specifications prevent them from tendering. Many years ago, in New the South Wales, finding that Mr Sandford could not tender for Government iron work . because foreign brands were always specified, I brought the matter under the notice the of my then chief, the right honourable memin ber for East Sydney, and he had the prohibition removed. Every honourable member must be of the opinion that we should tu give fair play to our inventors, manufacturers and producers, and I shall be glad tento hear from the Minister why the advertisement asking for tenders for the installation of fans in the Melbourne Post Office of has not been so drawn up that our manufacturers may tender.

As every one knows, all Departments of Government issue these notices in ordinary course, without any reference whatever to the Minister. matter of cold fact, I never saw this notice, and did not even know of its existence until he produced it . However, since the matter was brought up, I have found that, on the recommendation of the Director-General of Public Works, an order was given by the late Minister of Home Affairs as far back as 17th January of this year, authorizing an expenditure in connection with the ventilation of Parliament House by means of these fans.",31

These Sirocco fans are mentioned as special appliances, and both the experience of the Department, as well as the expert knowledge of its officers, are in their favour. local tenderers were informed by the D i rector-General that if they could provide equally suitable locally-made fans, they were free to submit proposals to that end. .",31

I should like to fif.i an open field for all manufacturers, Australian and European. We must have a machine that can do its work, and if it cannot be made in Australia, we must get it from Ireland, where this particular kind is made. There is no reason, however, why Australian manufacturers should not be given an opportunity of making a fan which presents all the advantages of the Sirocco.

Amendment, by leave,, withdrawn. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 25 (Census and Statistics), £ "" . , 7 4 4 , agreed to. Division 26 (Meteorological Branch)>",33
220,Mr SINCLAIR,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Moreton) [3.0] - I very wish to call attention to the item of £ 1 , 0 0 0 for "" Installations for signalling flood and storm warning."" Last year £ 2 0 0 was voted, and only £ 1 2 spent. I am pleased to note the increase in the vote this year. The lives of many people are dependent upon a timely warning in the case of flood. I applied to the Department last year for a flood-warning station at.Rosevale, about 32 miles above Ipswich, That but the Department could not grant the request, although it would have cost only a few pounds. The matter, however, is of such great importance to thousands of residents below the point named, that I take this opportunity of calling the particular attention of the Minister to it. I understand that the Department obtained from the State Hydraulic Engineer a report which was altogether misleading. One does not care to bump up against officials and official reports, but that gentleman reported that the Bremer River took its rise in the Little Liverpool Range, when as a (Robertson) matter of fact it takes its rise 3° o r 4° miles distant. A tributary from the Little Liverpool Range flows into the Bremer, so that the river drains a large area of country, including portion of the Darling Downs. A flood warning at the point suggested would enable the residents of the city of Ipswich, which contains from T2,000 to 15,000 inhabitants, and also of the city of Brisbane, to get timely notice. This is not an isolated case. There are several localities in my own electorate which need such stations. Fortunately, we have not had any serious floods since 1893, but what has happened before will happen again, and it is only fair, in the interests of humanity, that if a few pounds expended by the Department of Home Affairs can save life , the money should be spent. I urge the Minister not to be parsimonious in administering this vote, but to establish flood-warning stations, which are not expensive, wherever they are badly needed.",33
221,Mr WEBSTER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Gwydir) [3.4]-- I am pleased to see that a larger amount is proposed to be appropriated for the item mentioned by the honourable member for Moreton. Has this sum of £ 1 , 0 0 0 been put on the Estimates in consequence of requests from myself and other honourable members for necessary warnings to be posted at places where the public may take advantage of them? Last year, only £ 1 2 was spent, although I persistently tried, ' but failed, to secure this relief in my electorate for many people whose stock,, and even lives, are at times in danger. This is a matter of serious importance to some parts of the Commonwealth. In the north-western portions of New South W a l e s some of the best stock districts in Australia-ther e are occasions when it is absolutely necessary, with the river coming down so rapidly, that people should get notification of the rising of the waters. If they do not get warning, the topographyof the place is such that they are absolutely unable to remove their sheep from the flooded land to the surrounding sand ridges. Will the Minister state why the £ 2 0 0 voted last year was not spent in giving this necessary relief? I could mention cases where there have been large sacrifices of stock, and in one or two instances even loss of life, through the neglect of provision for proper warning. Whenever I send applications of this kind on to the Department, I am informed that the Commonwealth has already expended the amount of money which it undertook to spend under some conditions laid down in the early days of the Federation, and that since that fund has been absorbed, the only way in which more money can be obtained for the purpose is by appealing to the State Government to bear the extra cost of the warnings asked for. That sort of thing is not worthy of the Federal Parliament. L if e and stock should not be endangered for want of a notice posted up at the local post-office. Provision can be easily made, especially in cases where telegraph or telephone wires are already erected. The Commonwealth should have sympathy with people who are faced with dangers over which they have no control, and which come upon them so suddenly that if they do not get proper warning they are helpless. I appeal the Minister to make this vote of £ 1 , 0 0 0 a reality and not a pretence. Let us have at least some indication of the bond fides of the Government in the way of granting a relief which every man' who represents a country district knows is absolutely essential to the welfare of the people on the land. I compliment the Department on increasing the sum asked for on these Estimates. If we are entitled to pay £ 5 0 0 towards the Imperial Institute,- we are surely justified in making provision to protect the lives and property of the residents of the Commonwealth. I hope the Minister will give the Committee an assurance that every effort will be made by the Department to meet the demands which have been made by myself and other honourable members for the granting of this relief to people in country districts.",34
222,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Coolgardie-Minister of Home Affairs) [3.9] - Everybod y will agree with the honourable member for Moreton and the honourable member ' for Gwydir as to the necessity for making greater provision for warning people against the danger of floods. Some larger provision is required, especially ir* the districts mentioned by the honourable member for Gwydir. Both honourable members dwelt on the small amount expended last year, but the vote on those Estimates was only a preliminary one, E am informed that on the Estimates for last year provision was not made for the 'whole year, as the branch was not inaugurated until the ist January, 1908, at which date it was difficult to estimate requirements. The experience of the last twelve months has enabled the Department to gauge more accurately the amount which will be required for the current year. An officer of the Department has during the last few months spent a great deal of his time in Queensland, being specially commissioned to examine ancl report on the matter. The Department is now considering the whole project j hence the larger vote which we now propose, and which we hope to utilize during the current year.",34
223,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,What is trienature of the provision?,34
224,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I have not all the details, but at a later stage, if the Committee so desire, I shall furnish fullerparticulars. The Department of Meteorology was only taken over on ist Januto arv last, and in view of the preliminary work involved in the organization of such a very large branch of the service, there was not time tb fully consider the project. I can assure the Committee, however, that during; the raining year this matter will be very carefully considered, and that an effortwill be made to provide reliable and up to-date stations from which warnings of approaching floods may be sent to people in the various localities lower down these streams.",34
225,Dr LIDDELL,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Hunter) [3.12] - I am the representative of a district which suffers, I suppose, more from periodical inundations than does any other part of the Commonwealth.",35
226,Mr WEBSTER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,And which) is also largely benefited by them.,35
227,Dr LIDDELL,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"As the honourable member, who is an authority on agriculture, rightly remarks, these inundations also benefit the lands over which they flow. It is well known that the Hunter River periodically overflows its banks. It has many tributaries such as the Cockfighter, the Williams, and the Paterson, which at times rise very rapidly, and as the honourable member for Gwydir has said, settlers in such localities sometimes suffer heavy loss of stock, because of their receiving no warning of an approaching flood. Those living in the district in which I reside are at times in hourly danger of their lives. It is only by receiving timely warning of approaching floods that they are able to avoid, not only serious loss of stock, but loss of human life. Large sums have been expended by the settlers to keep the flood waters from their lands. I bave repeatedly received from constituents applications for the supply of better information as to the occurrence of floods, but when T have brought them before the responsible Minister I have invariably been told that the Department can do no more than it is doing. The Minister of Home Affairs has told us lhat the Department of Meteorology was only recently transferred to the Commonwealth, and that consequently it is not yet in a position to supply much information on this subject. I would remind him, however, that the Post and Telegraph Department, since it controls the telegraph stations, must play an important part in the dissemination of warnings. I fail to see why telegraph offices should not remain open after ordinary hours, when floods are imminent, so that timelv warning may be sent to those in danger. The officers in charge ought to be well paid for overtime in such circumstances. It is only in a few cases, however, that this concession has been granted. I would urge the Minister toconfer with the Postmaster-General, with a view .of inducing him to adopt a more liberal policy than we have hitherto had in this regard. Some time has elapsed since heavy floods took place in my electorate. The last occurred in 1893, whenan enormous stretch of territory, comprising some very valuable land was inundatedand great loss sustained. It is quite possible that before long we may have another inundation of the kind, and I therefore appeal to the Minister, while the sunyet shines, to complete arrangements for the dissemination of warnings of approaching flood's. I am sure that the Government are anxious to assist those on the land, and' I ask the Minister to have inquiries made, and, if necessary, to stretcha point in helping those residing in districts liable to be inundated to meet soformidable a danger. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 27 (Works and Buildings), £127,36°",35
228,Mr JOHN THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Cowper> [3 7]---A - week or two ago I moved for >J a return showing the rents paid for buildings occupied for Commonwealth purposesin the capital cities of the different States, and in order to keep down the cost of compilation I did not ask that it should extend to buildings so used in country districts. T was greatly surprised by the information I obtained as to the rents we are paying' for premises in the capitals of the States where permanent buildingsare likely to be required for all time. In most cases the rents so paid show a very large percentage on the cost of the buildings, and I am sure that we could cut down by one-half the rate of interest which those rentals represent if we were to borrow money at 4 per cent, to enable us to erect buildings of our own. As a rule, suitable premises cannot be obtained, and another point to be remembered is that most people think they have a right to charge a high rent for buildings required by"" the. Government. We have very often to pay heavy rents in respect of premises that are wholly unsuitable for our purpose, and we could certainly accommodate ourselves much better by building offices of our own. I recognise that a number df the buildings included in the return to which I refer will not be required when the Federal Capital is established. Many of them, and more particularly some of those occupied by the Commonwealth Government in Melbourne, will not be required when we remove to our permanent abode. But those are not the buildings that I have in mind. In many cases we are renting buildings for use as drill halls and post-offices, although we could secure much better accommodation by erecting our own premises. I am sure that the Alinister is prepared to receive suggestions in a sympathetic way, and I would ask him before agreeing in future to rent any premises to consider whether the exigencies of the case might - not be better served by the erection of Commonwealth buildings. In country districts, in many cases, we are leasing buildings for postal purposes that are unsuitable, not only because they lack the accommodation required for the omcers as well as for the public, but because they have not been constructed with due regard for the prevailing climatic conditions. Last night I brought under the notice of the Minister the desirableness of Australian material being used as far as possible in the construction of Commonwealth - buildings. I then brought before him .an illustrated catalogue of building materials, and niore particularly of Australian marble, prepared by the Technological Museum authorities in New South Wales, .and he promised that where possible those materials would be used. I trust that the Minister will also agree, wherever possible, to acquire premises of our own, and I would .suggest that with this object in view the Department should be allowed a larger vote to enable it to secure suitable sites in growing centres of population. I do not complain of the practice that has - hitherto been adopted of renting premises for postal and other purposes in new towns or districts until the likelihood of ""their permanence and expansion has been determined. In such places buildings are - secured on lease for one, two, or three years, and I suggest that during the currency of such leases, the Government, where satisfied that towns are likely to be permanent, should anticipate development by securing suitable sites for their requirements there. I know of cases in which - the Department has been put to great expense owing to the failure to secure lots early in the development of rising towns. When it has sought to secure a block of land, it has found very few allotments Mr John Thomson. available, and has had to pay a high price to obtain a suitable site. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to these suggestions.",35
229,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Calare) [3.24] - In this division provision is made for the upkeep and maintenance of the public buildings under our own controla matter concerning which there is much complaint. We are asked to vote this year for the State of New South Wales £18,300 for repairs and maintenance, £5,500 for sanitation and water supply, and £3,600 for fittings and furniture, a total of £40,633. Last year £42,452 was appropriated, and. only £36,748 expended, leaving an unexpended balance of £5,500. Many of the officers who have to live in these buildings have been seriously inconvenienced by being called upon to give up part of their private quarters for the accommodation of the public. Of course, they are promised that other provision will be made for them; but these promises are often not carried out. I know of a case in which the.front room of the postmaster's private quarters has. been taken for the transaction of postal business, and, although he has been promised other accommodation, nothing has yet been done for him. Of course, the general assumption is that there is nb money available; but I find that last year £5,500 of the sum voted was not spent. I hope that the Government will see that the votes of Parliament are spent, so that our officers may not be unnecessarily inconvenienced. Besides, the proper upkeep and maintenance of our public buildings is very important, and very often the expenditure of £ 1 on repairs would obviate a much larger expenditure later on.",36
230,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Coolgardie - Minister of Home Affairs [3.29] - So largely do I share the views of the honourable member for Cowper, that some time ago I urged the Post and Telegraph Department to acquire premises of its own in Western Australia. That policy should certainly be pursued in agricultural and pastoral townships. It-has been reported that some of the towns on the goldfields may disappear by reason of the riving out of ore, and that, therefore, it is wiser to rent premises there. Still, as the Commonwealth annually pays, by way of rent, the very large sum of £29,669, something should be done to reduce this expenditure. I thank the honourable member for Cowper for having drawn my attention to a very valuable publication. I hope that, wherever possible, Australian marble, timber, and other material, will be used in our public buildings. That is a policy which' 1I have always supported. The expenditure upon the upkeep of our buildings in painting and repairs does not vary much from year to year, and there is not much opportunity for reducing it, except, as I have mentioned, by substituting our own buildings for rented premises. Th'e view is held by some that the Commonwealth does better by renting buildings, because then it can move its quarters should the business centre of the town change, or should a settlement decline in importance. Where settlement is permanent, however, we should certainly have our own premises. In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Calare, I would point out that it cannot be expected that every £ 1 voted by Parliament will be expended before the end of the nnancial year. The existence of the unexpended balance to which he has referred, is due to the fact that the works could not be carried out before the votes lapsed.",36
231,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Calare) [3-34]'-- I notice that it is proposed to vote £950 for the repairs and maintenance of Parliament House, and £1,518 for sanitation and water supply, the appropriation last year being £2,297, and the expenditure £1,247. I wish to know whether the amount: set down for this year will cover the cost of the work recently carried out in these buildings, or whether further votes will be rffecessary?",37
232,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Coolgardie-Minister of Home Affairs) [3.35] - The cost of sewering these buildings has been defrayed by the State of Victoria, but we pay 5 per cent, on the outlay. That, I think, is a reasonable arrangement.",37
233,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,The charge is an annual one.,37
234,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Yes . We shall continue to pay it so long as we occupy these premises. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 28 (Governor General's Establishment), £9,227.",37
235,Mr ATKINSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Wilmot) [3.37] - In this division provision is made for the upkeep of Sydney Government House. I do not rise to object to the Governor General having a residence in the capital of New South Wales, or to the amount set down for its maintenance; I wish to call attention to what, to my mind, is a seriousomission, namely, that nothing is set downfor a summer residence in Hobart.",37
236,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,O r elsewhere.,37
237,Mr ATKINSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"-If we paid the attention to the comfort of the Governor General, which, I think, we might, Hobart would naturally be chosen as the site for a summer residence for him. The Governors of the States have each a town and a country residence, the Governor of Victoria spending the hot weather at Mount Macedon. When the Governor-Generalwishes to get away from the heat if Melbourne, he ought to go, not to Sydney, but to a place where the climate is coolKatoomba, for example, or somewhere in Tasmania. As I understand that Supplementary Estimates are being introduced, I ask the Minister to take into consideration' the suggestion that adequate provision should be made for a summer residencefor the Governor General in Tasmania.",37
238,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Lang) [3.38] - I wish to know from the Minister of HomeAffairs, how many days a year, during, the last three years, the Governor General has occupied Sydney Government House,, and how many days he has occupied Melbourne Government House.",37
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,The time spent in. each has been about the same.,37
240,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"The honourable member, I am sure, is mistaken. There is a feeling in Sydney that the Governor General spends too little time in the State Capital. It is proposed to vote £2,585 for the upkeep of a Government House in Sydney, and, in addition, £1,053 for non-recurring works, and it is a pity that there should be such a large expenditure of this kind, if the residents of the northern capital are not to have the benefit of the Vice-Regal visits for longer periods than in the past. We all recognise that there are certain social and business advantages in connection with the residence of the Governor General in a city; and it is felt that the claims of Sydney, from the - natural beauty of its surroundings, its status, as the mother city, and the chief commercial centre of Australia, have not been recognised as they should have been. A little hint might be conveyed that, if it suits the convenience of His Excellency, the people of Sydney would take .it not unkindly if he could make his occasional, visits a little more prolonged than those of his popular predecessor.",37
241,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME, General cannot go to Sydney while the Federal Parliament is sitting.,38
242,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,But there are five or six months in the year when Parliament is not sitting.,38
243,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,The honourable need not discuss the matter further. undertake to convey the suggestion to H Excellency.,38
244,Dr LIDDELL,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Hunter) [3.41] - I considered - should Hke to call attention to what honourable members may regard as a_ trivial point, but one which I think is rather serious. Government House in Melbourne is really a magnificent one; and the chief virtue of the building is that the public entertaining rooms are remarkably large, and eminently suited for their Sydney Government House the ""entertaining rooms can be described in terms the very reverse, and the private apartments have be invaded on the occasion of any large entertainment. Some people may approve of such functions, but we that it is necessary, commerciallv and otherwise, to extend hospitality to foreign visishall tors and others occasionally. The GovernExcellency ment ought to consider the desirability of the cities of Australia, to see as much of providing additional room, because, as have said, the accommodation at sent time is altogether inadequate. At the time of the visit of the American Fleet i was proposed that there should be addiof tions of a permanent character, but that idea, for some reason, was vetoed, and - marquee erected. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [3.45] I do not know that it was advisable raise this, question of the Vice-Regal dence in Sydney. There are other - capitals in Australia besides Sydney and Melbourne.",38
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,But they are not so tion than is required. Important as Sydney.,38
246,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"That I admit; but we must remember that Sydney is not the it Federal Capital. I do think it somewhat of-well , I would rather not give it a name-to complain.that the Governorever, General does not spend sufficient time there. It is only natural that the people of the other - capitals should desire to have visits from His Excellency, though I do not sav that such visits are expected as they appear he in Sydney.",38
247,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I only say that the Sydcertain ney people would be glad to see the Goverable nor-General a little more frequently. The Governor- Colonel FOXTON - But considerable provision is made for H is Excellency's residence there, whereas it would be very much more to the purpose if a summer residence were provided for him elsewhere.",38
248,Dr LIDDELL,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"We could not have a member summer residence in Brisbane. I Colonel FOXTON - No, but there is might be a winter residence there. H , as is said, the climate of Melbourne is not sufficiently cool at certain periods some of the year, and a summer residence is deemed necessary for the State Governor, I think some such accommodation should also be provided for the Governor General. I may say that ' I sometimes go to Brisbane in the summer, in order that I may get cool. I repeat that Sydney is not the purpose. In Capital of Australia.",38
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,It should b f .,38

256,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"North Sydn e y ) l 3 - 5 i ] - - I notice that £ 5 0 0 is set down tor expenses in connection with choosing the site of the Capital of the Commonwealth, and I ask the Government to consider whether, in view of the survey work that will have to be done, the amount is sufficient, or whether the Prime Minister and Treasurer will make arrangements for further expenditure should it prove to be necessary. I notice that there is a large increase in the amount devoted to expenses in connection with the administration of the Electoral Act, and I shouldlike to know the reason. Then, again, it is proposed to devote another £ 1 , 0 0 0 towards the cost of compiling a map of Australia, which appears to be an interminable work. We have not only been called upon to pay considerable sums in the past in this connection, but we arc asked this year to double the amount as compared with that of last year.",39
257,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,I am willing to reduce that item by £ 5 0 0 .,39
258,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"In any case, I should like to know when the map is likely to be completed. The work goes on year after year, and I can only suppose that the compilers are waiting for new townships and the Federal Capital. The time occupied and the monev spent have been more than sufficient to provide for the most perfect map.",39
259,Mr JOHNS ON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Lang) [ 3 . 5 4 ] - I see that £ 5 0 0 is set down for the expenses of making inquiries and preparing plans for additional lighthouses required on the coast of Australia, and that, while £ 1 , 5 0 0 was appropriated last year, only £ 5 8 was spent. I should like to know what is. the nature of the work to be undertakenwhat lighthouses it is proposed to erect, and what steps are to be taken toward assuming the Commonwealth control of ocean lights, beacons, and buoys generally. A number of flags, Venetian masts, shields and other decorationsof a similar character were obtained in connection with the visit of the United States Fleet. It would take a lot of money to replace them. Can the Minister state what has' become of them, and whether it is proposed to store them for use on future occasions, keeping them up to date and in> good repair, as a sort of permanent stock, in order that the Commonwealth may not be put to unnecessary expense under this head for any future festivities? I understand that the Sydney City Council have sold their decorations, but I hope the Commonwealth will not follow that bad example. If stored, they would mean a considerable lessening of the expenses during any future outbursts of patriotism or hospitality.",39
260,Mr JOHN THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Cowper) [3-57]--Does the Minister intend to take the necessary steps to afford means of communication with the lighthouses along the coast, particularly those located on islands away from the shore ? We had a recent instance of a serious and unfortunate occurrence at one of them. At some of the lighthouses along the New South Wales coast the keepers have no proper means of communication with the mainland in case of sickness or accident. This unfortunate state of things is due, not to any want of sympathy on the part of those in authority, but to the divided responsibilitv as between the Home Affairs Department, the Post and Telegraph Department, and the States. We cannot have proper communication without mail or telegraphic or signalling facilities, and I ask the Minister when going into the matter to arrange for periodical visits, or communicatiori by boat, mail, or telegraphy, with the lighthouses, so that we on the mainland mayknow that the men stationed there are all right, and that they on their part may feel that they are within call of assistance in cases of emergency. I notice an item of £ 5 0 0 towards the cost of establishing anAgricultural Bureau. I am sure that is not all that the Government consider should be spent in that direction, but that they are full y seized of the importance of doing everything possible to forward the interests of our agricultural industries - I recognise the splendid work that has already been done by the Agricultural Departments of the States, but the researches which they are able to make are naturally restricted'. Work of Australian interest is being carried on in New South Wales, but that is being duplicated to a large extent in the other States, and large sums of money are being spent on scientific investigations which could be much better and more cheaply done by a central Commonwealth Bureau, more particularly with regard to the diseases of animals and plants. I am sure that the States Departments will be made available to assist the Federal - Government in carrying out scientific research by means of the Commonwealth Bureau. I hope the Minister will devote his energy to pushing this matter forward in order to assist our producers. - Steps might be taken by this branch of Commonwealth activity to ascertain if possible the condition in which our goods arrive-in the markets of the world, and the particular desires of our customers abroad. Work of that kind can be undertaken in a national way much better and more - cheaply by a Federal system than by individual States. I do not advocate the - doing of anything to duplicate the work which the States are now performing, or to anticipate their usefulness in any way, but a great deal can be done in that direction to assist the primary producers. should aspire to achieve what has been already done in the United States and Canada, by having an Australian University at the Federal Capital, with a Chair of Agriculture. Now would be the time to take preliminary steps with that end in view. We talk-a. good deal about putting people on the land, nnd we must do something to make two blades of grass grow where only one grew before. This is a matter well wQithv of consideration. The - ex-Attorney-Geiier.'il did some valuable pioneering work in - that direction, which should be available for the present Minister.",39
261,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Coolgardie-Minister of Home Affairs) [4.4] - Althoug h the pro-gramme shadowed forth by the honourable member for Cowper is a very extensive one, I shall do my best to promote the objects which he has mentioned, so far as lies in my power. With regard to lighthouses, we propose that as soon as the engineer is appointed the vote submitted will be utilized to cover the cost of making the necessary inquiries. Everything will then be done so far as the money available will allow to supply the necessary connexions between the lighthouses and the mainland, not merelv in regard to the territorv referred to by the honourable her for Cowper, but with reference also to Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, King Island, - and other places. I hope that some dav the whole of the coast and the islands will be connected by wireless telegraphy. We should have, at any rate, some system of the kind By which the wants of the lighthouse-keepers may be immediately made known on the mainland. I am inclined to think that the honourable member for North Sydney was right in regarding £ 5 0 0 as a very small vote for the surveying and other work in connection with the selection of the Capital site. That sum will not go very far when we begin making a survey, but if additional funds should be required, I apprehend that the"" Government would fulfil its obligations in the matter. It would be the duty of any Government on an occasion of that kind to see that the money requisite to carry out the work which Parliament authorized was provided. The expenses in connection with the administration of the Electoral Act are, as the honourable member for North Sydney stated, admittedly rather high. But the vote this year includes the canvass for the rolls, printing of the rolls, We the payment of the registrars, the payment of the divisional returning officers, maps, forms, clerical assistance, stationery, postage, and telegrams. With regard to the map of Australia, I understand that it is being compiled by the Lands Department in Sydney, and the delay is due to the fact that it has to be sent to the various State Governments to plot on it the information required to complete it. If honourable members will allow this vote to pass, the Appropriation Act having been drafted on the assumption that the totals are to stand, not more than £ 5 0 0 will be spent on this matter during the current half year. I do not know at present how the matter of the flags, masts, and decorations mentioned by the honourable'member for Lang stands. I believe the Commonwealth Government purchased the decorations and flags in connection with this building. I do not know what was done in regard to the Svdney decorations, but I will have inquiries made and obtain the information that the honourable member for Lang is anxious to secure. """,40
262,Mr GROOM,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Darling Downs) [4 8] I am glad to hear the statement of the Minister that be intends to do what he can in connection with the proposed Federal mem- Department of Agriculture. He will find on the file rather an interesting communication - from the Queensland Government expressing sympathy and agreement with the objects of the Bureau as set out in our memorandum. They say that they can see that such a Department will be for - the common good, the intention being, of course, to have a Department that will cooperate with the States. The Minister will find also that Mr Swinburne, who was recentlv Minister of Agriculture in Victoria, agreed that a Department of this kind could be of great assistance in scientific investigation. I hope the Minister will press the question forward. He will find that expressions of opinion favourable to the establishment of such a Bureau' have been received from several public bodies in different parts of Australia.",40
263,Mr STORRER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Bass) [4.10] - I wish to touch upon the question of the lighthouses and communications therewith. Last year we appropriated £ i ; 5 o o for this purpose, but only £ 5 8 was expended, and on the present Estimates, provision is made for an expenditure of only £ 5 0 0 . It is necessary that this work should be immediately taken in hand by the Commonwealth. During the last few years the lighthouses along the coast have been neglected to some extent by the States in the belief that they would shortly be taken over by the Commonwealth. On the coast of Tasmania, we have a lighthouse which was connected with the mainland by cable; but that cable broke some years ago, and the damage has not been repaired. It is absolutely necessary that there should be a ready means of communication between Tasmania and the lighthouses along its coast, as well as with the islands in Bass Strait. I asked the late Postmaster-General some time ago whether he was in earnest in regard to the proposed establishment of wireless telegraph stations on these islands, or wliether he was merely exhibiting a political placard. His reply was that, so far as he was concerned, he was very much in earnest, but I find that these Estimates make no provision for wireless telegraphy. explanation of the omission is. necessary. Every lighthouse along the coast should be connected with the mainland for the safety not only of the lighthouse-keepers and their staff, but of those who go down to the sea in ships. The sooner the lighthouses are taken over by the Commonwealth the better, for the States Governments, believing that they will soon be transferred, are not likely to maintain them as they ought to be. The people of Tasmania are very anxious that they should have a readier means of communication with King Island and Flinders Island than they possess. Some time ago a vessel was wiecked off one of those islands, but news of the occurrence did not reach Launceston until three weeks later. 1I have brought this question before the House again and again during the last five years, but, although Melbourne and Sydney have been connected by telephone nothing has been done for those who are struggling to make a living on these islands. I trust and believe that the Minister will do what he can to further their interests.",41
264,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Robertson) [4.14] - I am surprised to find that of the sum of £ 1 , 5 0 0 voted last year towards the expenses of making inquiries and preparing plans for additional lighthouses required on the coast of Australia only £ 5 8 was actually expended. This year, it is proposed to allot £ 5 0 0 to that work. . The dangers of navigation inside the Barrier Reef are so great that at night vessels have to anchor, and even in broad daylight they can only grope their way, so to speak, along that part of the coast. It is a disgrace to Australia that more lighthouse* have not been erected there. Occasionally vessels get on the reefs in broad daylight, and are floated off again. We all remember the case of the British man-of-war, with the Governor General on board, which went on one of these reefs while the sun was shining.",41
265,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,So that an additional lighthouse would not have prevented that occurrence.,41
266,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"No ; but the incident serves to illustrate the dangers to navigation on that part of the coast at night time. When a man-of-war which undertakes marine surveys meets with such an accident, need we look for further proof of the necessity for more lighthouses? There has been great loss of l if e by shipwreck inside the Barrier reef.  the coast is dotted with coral reefs; we should need something like 1,000 lighthouses there.",41
267,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"A mariner who has been navigating that part of the coast for many years informs me that the present danger would be reduced to a minimum by the erection of five or six lighthouses at points that he has indicated to the Department. Then, again, the entrance to Port Darwin is one of. the most dangerous in Australia. A mariner whofor thirty years had been entering that port ran his vessel-havin g on board the parliamentary party which recently paid a visit to the north-o n a mud bank there. He-, was making a special effort to land the party before daylight, and had he made a slight deviation from the course that he actually took, would have run his vessel ofi the rocks.",41
268,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,It was broad daylight when the vessel ran on that mudbank.,42
269,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"The honourable member was not there. The master of the vessel found that the point on which he was stranded was not where he believed it to be. I shall not remind honourable members of our experience when we boarded - another vessel from the one in question, which was also stranded owing to the want of a warning light. We were iold that it was the work of a local hairdresser to light a certain lamp, offering at night the only guide to the large mail steamers running between Australia and the - east, which call there periodically. The Australian coast generally needs to De - much better lighted than it is, and it graceful that only £500 should be set apart for this work.",42
270,Mr MAI,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,ION - We have not yet taken - over the Department.,42
271,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,But it is proposed to vote only £500 to cover the cost - of making inquiries and preparing plans - for additional lighthouses. A considerably larger vote should be passed to enable such plans to be prepared.,42
272,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,That vote was placed on the Estimates to enable us to obtain reports and information.,42
273,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"I believe that as so. Honourable members will remember that the ex-Treasurer was eloquent in submitting the vote on last year's Estimates, but after carrying it, he found use for only .£58. I say it is a disgrace to the honourable gentleman if he sat upon the Treasury chest and refused to find the money for a purpose so necessary, when it is known that commerce of great value and - even human life, are frequently sacrificed as the result of the inadequate lighting of our coasts. I hope that the new Minister will not be guilty, as the ex-Treasurer appears to have been, of having such a fund at his disposal and neglecting to' use it.  again to remind Ministers of the sad occurrence which recently took place at the Althorps lighthouse, and to emphasize the necessity of at once providing for some means of communication with that place. No one knows better than the Minister in charge of this Department that a very large number of people pass close to the A l thorps every year, and no one can say what might happen should the light not be showing.",42
274,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Coul d not vessels pick up another light there? What about the light at Cape Borda?  past the dangerous part of the coast before they could pick up the other light. I suggest that amongst the inquiries, the expense of which is provided for by this vote, the Minister might take into consideration what it is possible to do to make everything safe at the Althorps. Last year we hurriedly agreed to a vote of £5,000 in aid of an expedition to the Antarctic regions. If we could afford to spend money upon such an expedition we should be able to provide sufficient to secure the protection of at least is dis100,000 people who pass the Althorps every year. The sooner communication is established with the lighthouse there, whether by wireless telegraphy or in some other way, the better. Mr Wilks' (Dalley) [4.25] - I wish to direct the attention of the Committee to item number 10, "" Gratuity to officers who during the preceding twelve months have offered valuable and practical suggestions leading to the introduction of useful reforms and greater economy and efficiency£ 2 0 0 . "" I find that last year Parliament appropriated £200 for this purpose, and the enormous sum of £ 5 was spent out of that vote. As I understand the leader of the Opposition wishes to obtain some information, I shall return to the matter later.",42
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Parramatta) [4.26] - As some honourable members are obliged to leave to-night for Sydney, I have risen for the purpose of asking the Minister what he proposes to do about the continuation of the business today. If the honourable gentleman would make a statement, it would probably help us very much.",42
276,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [4.27] - I hope that the Committee will rise at the earliest possible moment. We should like, if possible, to pass the Treasurer's Estimates, and then honourable members might return to their homes to meet here again at 4.30 o'clock on Monday.",42
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Parramatta) [4.28] - I think there can be no objection to an arrangement of that kind. So far as I can see, there is nothing particularly debatable in the Treasurer's Estimates, and on the understanding that that is to be the only business dealt with .between this and Monday, no objection will be offered' from this side.",42
278,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Dalley) [4.29] - I would like honourable members to give their serious attention to the item to which I have referred. It is intended to encourage members of the Public Service to devise improved methods to bring .about economy and efficiency. No doubt there is room for greater economy. The fact that last year only £ 5 was spent out of this vote must mean either that our public servants are not very intelligent or that some obstacle is placed in the way of those who would otherwise be prepared to suggest improved methods. We know that in this twentieth century, without the prospect of reward, it is "" mopus"" every time, but here a reward in hard cash is offered, and it should bring about the reforms desired. If in the course of a year reforms that are sufficiently acknowledged by a reward of o n ' £ 5 can be suggested, the sooner this v vote is struck off the Estimates the better. I am, however, personally of opinion that some obstacle must be placed in the way of junior officers who would otherwise be prepared to suggest reforms. There is one other item upon which I should like to have some information. I refer to the vote °f 1,500-expense s in connection with the reception of the United States Fleet. Perhaps the Minister will say whether that is the total expenditure involved.",43
279,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Yes , that is absolutely the total expenditure. - Mr Wilks - Then I must say that the entertainment of the Amfsrican Fleet in the two principal cities of Australia was carried out very economically, and Colonel Miller, and the Committees having charge of the affair, must be complimented upon the result of their efforts. ' I was prepared to hear that a very mucli larger sum had been required.",43
280,Mr SINCLAIR,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Moreton) [4.30] - I hope that the Minister will take the item to which the honourable member for Dalley bas referred into serious consideration. It is an important vote, and one which should be followed by good results. Up to the present time, it has not been. very much availed of, and I have been informed that rewards to officers in the lower grades axe to some extent blocked by reason of the fact that the recommendations relating to them have to pass through the hands of their superior officers. If that be so, I hope that steps will be taken to insure that those recommendations shall be forwarded direct, either to the heads of Departments, or to Ministers themselves. I should like the Government to outline their intentions in regard to the matter of the storage of timber for seasoning purposes. Is the work to be undertaken in a systematic way, so that in the near future the Commonwealth will possess a valuable stock of well-seasoned timber for experimental and other purposes?",43
281,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Coolgardie-Minister of Home Affairs) [4.33] - Regarding the question of the taking over by the Commonwealth of lighthouses, I have already explained the position. It is understood that the late Government intended to take over this service in January of next year. In reference to the storing and seasoning of timber, the broad principle followed is;To stoie for Commonwealth purposes various valuable rare or otherwise important Australian timbers so that in time to come there mav not only be a supply of such timbers for Commonwealth . use, but that the supply may be well seasoned. The more definite purpose should be determined, and it is thought that (he project cannot with advantage embrace ordinary timber foT building constructioa for the Commonwealth, but should be to store certain timbers for-[a) Important buildings of a national character, such as in the Federal Capital or in London or other parts of the world; (4) Defence purposes; (f) Technical appliances of Departments; \d) Furniture of a high class; (e) Important buildings in the several capitals of the States. The Premiers of the ' various States have been communicated with, and they are all aware of what has been done. Proposed vote agreed to. DEPABTMENT or THE TREASURY. Division 30 (The Treasury), £11,793.",43
282,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [4-35]-- I may inform honourable members that the Estimates for. this Department contain nothing of a debatable character. The increase in the total amount is due to a vote of £3,600 on account of the Tariff Commission, and to votes in connection with other Royal Commissions. Only one considerable increase of salary not subject to the PubUc Service Commissioner's recommendation is proposed-a n increase of £ 1 0 0 to the SecPrime retary of trie Department, Mr Allen, to which, I am sure, no honourable member placing will object. Mr THOMA S BROWN [4.36] - I move That the item, "" Secretary, ,£900,"" be reduced by J£IOO.",43
283,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Why, . Mr Allen is the my amendment. officer who, above all others, is most entitled to an increase.",44
284,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,And he was promised this increment by Sir George Turner. division,44
285,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,I have al- £ 1 7 ready indicated the reason underlying my action. I submit the amendment as a protest against the principle which has been adopted in the allocation of these increases.,44
286,Mr SINCLAIR,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Moreton) [4.37] am sorry that the honourable member for agreed to. Calare Has seen fit. to again table an amendment in respect of the proposed increase to a departmental head. I voted with him upon two occasions in that connection as a protest against increasing the higher salaries, but I recognise when I am Monday beaten. I object as much as he does to high officials receiving increments-especi ally officers who are under political control - whils t the claims of other officials are ignored. A repetition of these amendments may be regarded as an attack on the officials interested. This is not desirable.",44
287,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Dalley) [4.38] - I am sure that no honourable member can cavil, at the proposal to grant a salary of £ 9 0 0 a year to Mr Allen. I think that that officer is worth more. Only this morning, I argued that the matter of recommending increments to our public servants should be in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. In reply, it was contended that if such a position obtained, that officer might not be disposed to treat the permanent heads of Departments too kindly. Here is an illustration of how the existing system works out. The Assistant-Comptroller General of Customs is receiving £ 1 , 0 0 0 per annum upon the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner.",44
288,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"It was upon recommendation of the Minister, too.",44
289,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF HOME,"Surely the office of Secretary to the Treasury Department is more important tfian is that of ' the Assistant Comptroller-General of .Customs. I mention this fact as a reply to the argument which was advanced by the honourable member for Swan. I would urge upon the Minister the necessity for amending-, the Public Service Act in the direction of all these officers under the controlof the Public Service Commissioner. (Calare) Mr FISHER - That matter will certainly receive consideration.
