You previously ruled and made comment upon the members opposite taking advantage of moving a motion to in fact make a speech and to place debate material in the course of moving the motion. That is against the standing orders, and you have made comment on this before. It is also commented upon in the Practice, and I would ask you to ask them to shorten it.",19

4,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"I continue: (7) the relationship between the secret unit and other taxpayer funded units operating out of other ministerial offices; (8) the relationship between the secret unit and the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party; (9) the relationship between the secret unit and Crosby Textor; and (10) the reason that the existence of this unit has been kept secret from the Australian Parliament and the Australian people. Further, that the House calls on the Attorneyto provide details of the operation of this unit. He is right here in the chamber. He should taxcome clean-the man responsible for ‘kids overboard'.

CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT (TERRORIST MATERIAL) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Ruddock. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",20
7,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Terrorist Material) Bill 2007 improves the ability of our laws to prevent the circulation of material which advocates the doing of terrorist acts. This is a serious issue. Currently there is too much uncertainty around whether the existing classification laws adequately capture such material. This material should not be legally available in Australia. The bill introduces new provisions to the classification act, which will expressly require that publications, films or computer games that advocate the doing of a terrorist act must be classified as ‘refused classification'. I would prefer to see these provisions in the National Classification Code and guidelines, not in the classification act, but that requires the states' and territories' agreement. As the classification scheme is a cooperative national scheme, the state and territory censorship ministers and I must agree to the provisions of the code and guidelines. I first sought state and territory agreement to changes to classification laws in July 2006. To date, they have been reluctant to respond positively to my proposals. I am not prepared to wait indefinitely to address this problem. Following public consultation on a discussion paper, I recently wrote to censorship ministers seeking their agreement to amend the code and guidelines to require the Classification Board to refuse classification of material that advocates terrorist acts. I am hopeful that my state and territory colleagues will agree to these amendments at the Standing Committee of Attorneys General meeting in July. If they do, the amendments in this bill will not be needed. But, I might say, any evidence of bona fides is hard to find. When officers are instructed not to agree to the proposals, it is unlikely that an agreed set of proposals would be submitted to the ministers' meeting in July. Ministers would be very unlikely in a meeting to conclude that agreement and would again refer it off to officers. That has been the standard practice. If states and territories do not agree in July, we must be in a position to ensure that material that advocates the doing of terrorist acts is not legally available in Australia. This bill ensures that this can be done expeditiously through an amendment to the classification act. The bill introduces the same provisions as the proposed amendments to the code and guidelines. It requires the Classification Board to refuse classification of material that advocates terrorist acts. The provisions take into account submissions received following public consultation on the discussion paper. The submissions were carefully considered and, consequently, the proposal has been refined, so that the new provisions will operate effectively against unacceptable material but will not impinge on freedom of speech or mainstream popular culture. The requirement in this bill for material to be classified as ‘refused classification' is not intended to restrict the genuine and legitimate exercise of freedom of speech or to prevent filmmakers, authors or publishers from dealing with contentious subject matter in an informative, educational, entertaining, ironical or controversial way. As the bill clearly sets out, where the treatment of a terrorist act could reasonably be considered to be done merely as part of public discussion or debate or as entertainment or satire, it is not to be refused classification. This protects material such as investigative journalists' work, historical analyses, material that might appear to glorify war or battle (including ‘factional' or fictional accounts of war, insurgency or resistance), satirical pieces, and popular culture movies. On the other hand, material which goes further and advocates the doing of terrorist acts-for example, by directly praising terrorist acts in circumstances where this runs the risk of inspiring someone to commit a terrorist act-would and should be required to be classified ‘refused classification'. Striking the right balance is important. Freedom of expression is an important part of our society's values. However, there is another right which must be protected-the right to be protected from the pernicious influence of material that advocates the naive and impressionable to go out and commit terrorist acts against other human beings. The bill adopts the meanings of ‘advocate' and ‘terrorist acts' from the Criminal Code Act 1995 by adaptation of language or direct reference. It is intended that the meanings of these terms in the classification act remain consistent with their meaning in the Criminal Code. ‘Advocate' covers direct or indirect advocacy, in the form of counselling, urging or providing instruction on the doing of a terrorist act. It also covers direct praise of a terrorist act where there is a risk that such praise might lead a person (regardless of his or her age or any mental impairment) to engage in a terrorist act. However, the advocacy would need to be about doing a terrorist act, not merely expressing generalised support of a cause. The term ‘terrorist act' is given the same meaning as in section 100.1 of the Criminal Code. Any amendments made to that section will automatically apply to the definition of ‘terrorist act' for the purposes of the classification act. ‘Terrorist act' is tightly defined. The action or threat must be made with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause and coercing or intimidating an Australian or foreign government or the public. It includes actions or threats involving serious harm to people, damage to property, endangerment of life, serious risk to the public's health or safety, or seriously interfering with an electronic system including telecommunications, financial and essential government services systems, essential public utilities and transport providers. Action which is advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action, not intended to cause serious harm, death, endangerment of life, or serious risk to the health or safety of the public, is expressly excluded from being a ‘terrorist act'. This bill will improve the ability of our laws to prevent the circulation of material which advocates the doing of terrorist acts. Classification laws need to be better able to ensure that such material is not available in Australia. Whether that happens through amendments to the National Classification Code and guidelines with the agreement of the states and territories or through amendments to the classification act that I introduce today is not yet clear. But let me make it clear to those who may want to read these remarks: this bill will not proceed if the Classification Code is amended by agreement with the states and territories in a satisfactory way. Its introduction now is to ensure that we can deal with these matters in an appropriate time frame. In other words, it is a bill proposed for more abundant caution. I might say to the states and territories that I would expect that if they do not agree, this bill would secure passage through both houses of parliament, given the comments of the opposition about what they allege has been delay on my part in proceeding with these matters. Let me make it very clear: I have been pressing the states and territories to deal with this issue for more than 12 months, and I think they have had more than enough time to come to an agreement. I suspect their behaviour has been designed to frustrate these amendments, and that is why this bill is important in terms of ensuring that we have sufficient options to be able to deal with this issue in an appropriate time frame. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Snowdon) adjourned. NA (SPONSORSHIP OBLIGATIONS) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Andrews. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",22
8,Mr ANDREWS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Migration Amendment (Sponsorship Obligations) Bill 2007 amends the Migration Act 1958 to introduce a regime of obligations to be met by employers who are approved business sponsors of certain visa holders. At this stage this will be temporary skilled subclass 457 business sponsors. The subclass 457 visa was created in 1996. The main objectives of the visa are to enable key skilled personnel for Australian businesses to enter Australia quickly under streamlined processing arrangements in order to meet skilled labour shortages. The 457 visa allows approved Australian or overseas businesses to sponsor, on a temporary basis for up to four years, overseas employees to come to Australia to fill skilled positions that meet minimum skill and salary levels. For a sponsorship to be approved, the prospective employer must be an employer of good standing with an actively and lawfully operating business and must be able to demonstrate that the recruitment of overseas workers will provide some benefit to Australia, such as expansion of trade or enhanced competitiveness. It is widely acknowledged by all levels of government, the business community and the union movement that there is a shortage of skilled labour. It is therefore in nobody's terests, including business, if the community thinks that the 457 visa is merely a vehicle for driving down the wages and conditions of workers, which has been claimed by the opposition. The Australian government will not tolerate the abuse of 457 visas in this way. In order to ensure that such abuse does not occur and that the integrity of the 457 visa maintained and strengthened, this bill will provide further protections to workers sponsored under the 457 visa and ensure that employers who sponsor such workers must comply with certain obligations and failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions and penalties. The new obligations introduced under this bill will replace the current undertakings rangements. Importantly, the new regime also incorporates enforcement provisions: - inspectors can monitor an employer's compliance with their sponsorship obligations; and - civil penalties may be imposed if an approved sponsor breaches an obligation. There are also enhanced information exchange powers between my department and other prescribed Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. The government has consistently emphasised the importance of a skilled visa program to the continued prosperity of the Australian economy, especially in times of record low unemployment and consequent temporary skill shortages. Due to skill shortages and an unemployment rate at 32-year lows, the subclass 457 visa, for example, has provided business with a key source of temporary skilled labour and will continue to do so in the short to medium term. However, the government also recognises that there is a small minority of employers inwho have sought to abuse the program. While the abuse is not widespread, it can undermine the integrity of the overall migration program and confidence in the program as a factor in maintaining our national prosperity into the future. Employers must recognise that access to skilled temporary overseas workers is a is privilege, not a right, and if they abuse this privilege, then they will face strong penalties. These changes complement other initiatives that the government has recently announced; namely, an English language requirement for 457 applicants to acknowledge the importance of licensing and registration requirements and focus on areas of key ocar- cupational health and safety risk and formal arrangements for the fast-tracking of applications from those employers who have a strong and demonstrated record of complying with the 457 visa program. The New Obligations Some of the new obligations reflect existing undertakings a business sponsor must make pursuant to the Migration Regulations 1994. The government has elevated these requirements to the act as a reflection of their importance. The new obligations also now come into effect by operation of law. There are eight such obligations. I would like to highlight the first two obligations in particular. The first obligation is to pay visa holders at least the minimum salary level which is set out in a legislative instrument. This obligation also acknowledges the fact that Australian employers must look first to employing and training Australians and that the subclass 457 visa program will not be used to erode the salaries and conditions of Australian employees. The second obligation is not to employ a visa holder in a position that requires lesser months. skills than the position in respect of which the visa was granted. This obligation protects against the subclass 457 visa program being used to bring overseas workers to Australia to carry out unskilled jobs. Other obligations include: - paying the return travel costs from Australia of overseas workers and ily; - paying certain medical costs on behalf the overseas worker and his or her family which may involve the employer taking out insurance on their behalf; - paying any fees that must be paid for the overseas worker to work in the nominated activity and other fees associated with recruitment and migration agents; - keeping adequate records of compliance with these obligations and providing information to my department when requested in writing. The New Investigative Powers The bill also gives my department greater investigative powers. These powers, to the extent possible, have been adapted from the investigative powers of Office of Workplace Services inspectors. Specially trained officers of my department will have the power to enterunannounced and without force-any place of business or any other place which they have reasonable cause to believe there is formation, documents or any other thing, relevant to monitoring the approved sponsor's compliance with the obligations. In support of inspectors' information gathering powers, the bill also creates an offence for failing to produce a document requested by an inspector. This offence attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment for six The New Enforcement Powers The bill attaches civil penalties to breaches of obligations, with a maximum of $6,600 for an individual and $33,000 for a body corporate for each identified breach. These penalties are complemented by other enforcement measures, both existing their famand others set up by this bill. I will continue to have the power to cancel of sponsorship approval or bar sponsors where they have failed to comply with a new obligation. I will also now be able to bar sponsors who have breached a law of the Commonwealth, state or territory where appropriate. Where my department has identified a breach of an obligation and is pursuing civil remedy proceedings, the court, in addition to imposing a civil penalty on the employer, has the power to order the employer to pay a person moneys owed under an obligation. Persons owed money under an obligation may also independently seek restitution. If, for example, a worker has been paid less than the ‘minimum salary level', he or she may pursue an order for the amount of the underpayment. As well as creating a right of recovery, the bill also provides a power to make regulations to set up an infringement notice regime, under which sponsors would be issued with infringement notices as an alternative to civil in- proceedings. The amount of the infringement notices cannot exceed one-fifth of the maximum amount of the civil penalty-$1,320 for an individual and $6,600 for a corporation. Information Exchange The bill authorises disclosure of personal information regarding sponsors and visa holders to prescribed agencies of the Commonwealth or of a state or territory. For example, where in the course of performing his or her functions, an inspector finds a workplace that obviously appears to fall short of basic occupational health and safety standards, he or she would be able to make such an observation known to the state or territory body responsible for monitoring such standards. I would expect my department to be informed of the outcome of any such investigation so consideration could be given to bar the sponsor for breach of a law of the Commonwealth, state or territory. To facilitate information exchange with the Australian Taxation Office, the bill also includes necessary amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953. This represents a whole-of-government approach to maintaining and improving workplace standards and improving the conditions of workers. Summary In summary, this bill is designed to encourage increased compliance by employers with all relevant laws, particularly those governing the subclass 457 visa program. The new obligations combined with the enhanced investigative, enforcement and information exchange powers introduced by this bill will strengthen the integrity of subclass 457 visa arrangements, preserve the integrity of the Australian labour market and ensure the working conditions of overseas workers. My department will ensure that subclass 457 sponsors and visa holders are made aware of their respective rights and obligations under this legislation before the provisions come into effect. The bill deserves the support of all members of this parliament. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Burke) adjourned.

9,Mr MCGAURAN,RURAL AND REGIONAL AUSTRALIA,"Gippsland-Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.41 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I am bringing forward the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Protecting Services for Rural and Regional Australia into the Future) Bill 2007. This bill would amend the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 so that the Australian government's $2 billion investment in the Communications Fund is preserved to provide an income stream for future telecommunications improvements in regional, rural and remote Australia. The Communications Fund was estabthe lished by the government in September 2005 as a dedicated and perpetual fund to provide an income stream to implement the government's responses to recommendations made by the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee. This bill protects in legislation the $2 lion principal of the Communications Fund so that only the interest earned from the fund-up to $400 million every three years-can be drawn upon. The federal opposition has announced that it will abolish the $2 billion Communications Fund and spend the entire capital on a broadband network in highly commercial and predominately metropolitan areas, leaving several millions of rural and regional premises stranded without any targeted assistance for even basic telecommunications services. The bill introduced by the government will ensure that the Labor Party in office cannot, by sleight of hand or under cover of night, abolish the Communications Fund. It will require the government of the day to introduce legislation in the full glare of lic accountability. The government has introduced the bill in response to the Labor Party's policy to abolish the $2 billion Communications Fund and thereby abandon rural and regional Australia. This bill will ensure that rural and regional premises are not left stranded without reliable and up-to-date services in the future. It is the government's intention that the Communications Fund should be maintained at a minimum level of $2 billion, and the bill I am bringing forward seeks to make this intention explicit. If the Labor Party in government wishes to change the Communications Fund, it will require legislation and therefore the full scrutiny of the parliament and of the public. Labor has more than a passing habit in government of bringing matters through in fulfilment of its political ologies, without proper public scrutiny or accountability. It will not happen in regard to the Communications Fund should the Labor Party find itself in office. Maintaining the $2 billion for investment into the future will enable the Communicabiltions Fund to reliably generate income that will be available for future investment in telecommunications improvements in regional, rural and remote areas. The Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee is required to conduct regular reviews of the adequacy of telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote Australia. The first review is required to commence before the end of 2008, with subsequent reviews being completed every 3½ years. The reviews must consider the adequacy of telecommunications services that are significant to people living in regional, rural and remote Australia. The committee is required to report to the government, which in turn is required to repub- spond in a timely way to any recommendations made by the committee. Funding can then be accessed from the Communications Fund earnings to implement the responses that relate to regional, rural and remote telecommunications. This massive investment in the upgrade of infrastructure in rural and regional Australia will not be available should the Labor Party win office, for the Labor Party will abolish the fund that would provide this ongoing stream of income targeted at people who live in regional areas. This whole process provides certainty for people in regional, rural and remote Australia that the improvements in their telecommunications services will keep pace with the rest of the nation-in contrast to the Labor Party's policy. In securing the Communications Fund this idebill protects the long-term interests of regional, rural and remote Australia, and I commend it to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Snowdon) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Nairn. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",27
10,Mr NAIRN,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 makes a number of enhancements to the Australian government's civilian and military superannuation schemes. The bill removes, from 1 July 2008, the requirement for contributory members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the CSS, to make member contributions to the scheme. As a result, member contributions will become voluntary. This will provide members with the same flexibility and incentives to contribute to superannuation that are available to the broader community. The bill also allows, from 1 July 2008, eligible members of the PSS to elect to leave the PSS and join another superannuation arrangement for the payment of future contributions. A member's eligibility to join another superannuation arrangement will be determined by the choice arrangements that their employer has in place. For example, a member who is able to join the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the PSSap, will move to that scheme in the first instance and from there will have access to the government's broader choice of fund arrangements. The bill also amends the membership provisions for the PSSap to allow eligible PSS members who have elected to join the PSSap to become members of that scheme. These changes will provide eligible members with the flexibility for future contributions that is already available to most of the Australian workforce. From 1 January 2008, the bill will enable members of the CSS to obtain early release of their funded account balances on severe financial hardship and compassionate grounds to the extent allowed under the superannuation regulatory framework. The bill will also facilitate, from 1 January 2008, the prospective restoration of pensions for persons whose spouse pensions, provided under certain closed Australian government civilian and military superannuation schemes, were cancelled upon remarriage. Upon successful application, spouse pensions cancelled upon remarriage (prior to 1976 in the civilian scheme and prior to 1977 in military schemes) will be prospectively reinstated. Changes to the CSS as a consequence of the government's Better Super reforms are also included in the bill. The main amendment will ensure the continued payment of employer productivity contributions where a member has not provided their tax file number. This is consistent with the arrangements in the broader community where employer contributions would still be payable even though the member has not provided their tax file number. The other amendments are technical and take account of the payment of amounts from the CSS Fund in relation to release authorities issued by the Commissioner of Taxation and to reflect changed superannuation terminology. Where necessary, changes for the PSS to reflect the measures just described will be made by the PSS Amending Deed. The bill also ensures that the entitlement to benefits in the military superannuation schemes relating to postretirement marriages is consistent with the treatment in the civilian schemes. The bill also addresses an anomaly in the family law provisions of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 to allow the family law orders to be applied as intended. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Snowdon) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (EXTENDING FEENA ADVANCED DIPLOMA COURSES) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Robb. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",29
11,Mr ROBB,HELP FOR VET DIPLOMA AND VET,"Goldstein-Minister for Vocational and Further Education) (9.51 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Extending FEE-HELP for VET Diploma and VET Advanced Diploma Courses) Bill 2007 will open up opportunities for students to pursue high-level full-fee VET courses. This bill sets up the arrangements and appropriation to extend FEE-HELP assistance for students studying full-fee VET diploma and advanced diplomas with registered training organisations such as a TAFE. The government believes it is important to raise the status of vocational and technical education to signal the significance the government and the community attach to high level technical qualifications. As well, the accelerating use of higher levels of technology to compensate for the labour shortages associated with an ageing population means that higher levels of technical and vocational training for many in the workforce are a critical future need. This initiative will assist students who wish to pursue higher level vocational education and training qualifications. Many students are attracted to VET because of the specialist skills they learn while studying, but the high up-front fees acts as a deterrent. Presently, these students cannot access student loan arrangements and are forced to pay their fees up front or pursue an alternative university qualification if they need loan assistance. Currently, the cost of pursuing vocational education and training rests with the planning decisions of states and territories. While some states offer publicly supported training for some qualifications, principally at their TAFEs, for many other VET courses and registered training organisations students are required to pay full fees up front. Extending FEE-HELP into vocational education and training, particularly for higher level qualifications, lessens the impact of state planning and funding decisions on access to high-skill courses and allows students to choose their course and provider of preference through loan assistance. Through FEE-HELP the Australian government provides loans to ease the up-front financial burden for eligible students by assisting them to pay their tuition fees to their training provider. This initiative will remove some barriers that exist for students who want to pursue further higher level qualifications through the VET system. It increases access to technical and vocational diploma and advanced diploma courses. Training organisations will be encouraged to seek approval from the Australian government to receive FEE-HELP for diploma and advanced diploma students if they have an agreement with a university that their students could move (with appropriate credit transfer) into a related degree qualification. This arrangement will ensure that VET students get appropriate recognition in any subsequent studies at university, and get credit for what they've already done. It will also encourage those already with trade qualifications to build on them. As this budget measure is an extension of FEE-HELP in the higher education sector, this amendment is based substantially on the existing FEE-HELP mechanisms already in the Higher Education Support Act. VET providers will be required to meet certain conditions including financial viability, quality and reasonable fees and student access arrangements. The government insists on these arrangements as it is important to protect the interests of the students who take on responsibility for repaying the debt they incur from a provider. These measures ensure that the provider is acting in the best interests of students. In addition, current FEE-HELP legislation requires providers to be corporate bodies and this is also a requirement for VET providers. This is the first introduction of a student loan scheme in the VET sector at the national level. I am continuing consultation within the sector on the operation of the scheme, including the impact on state and territory training arrangements. I introduce this amendment to demonstrate the government's commitment to deliver this scheme in 2008 for the benefit of all Australians. This arrangement covers full-fee courses. Governments will continue to support training through public funding. This measure is part of the suite of reforms and funding by the Australian government for VET to remain as a world-class training sector. States and territories will be expected to continue with their level of funding for training and to continue to provide public funding for training. The Australian government expects to loan around $221 million to students over the four years to 2010-11 depending upon the number of VET providers which seek approval to provide VET FEE-HELP assistance and the number of students they enrol. In the coming decades, Australians with trade and technical skills will be in demand. It is predicted that over 60 per cent of jobs will require high-quality technical or vocational qualifications yet currently only 30 per cent of the population have these skills. While vocational education and training is a state responsibility, the Australian government is a strong supporter of vocational education and training (VET). Total Australian government funding to VET, taking into account the 2007 budget measures and the Prime Minister's Skills for the Future packtheir age of last year, amounts to $11.8 billion over the next four years. Federal government funding has increased by 99 per cent in real terms since 1996, with annual funding going from around $1 billion in 1996 to $2.9 billion this year. Loan assistance to students adds to the suite of programs the Australian government has developed, providing equity and choice for individuals. Pursuing a trade or vocational qualification is just as important as pursuing a university education as a pathway to a productive career and future prosperity. Through this bill, the government is offering students real choice in the study they pursue and builds the skills of the workforce. Mr Speaker, this measure, combined with the suite of other initiatives already put in place by this government, represents a significant investment in the development of skills in the Australian population. I commend this bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Snowdon) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES FOR STUDENTS) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Robb, for Ms Julie Bishop. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",30
12,Mr ROBB,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Goldstein-Minister for Vocational and Further Education) (9.58 am)At the request of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The bill amends the Student Assistance Act 1973 and the Social Security Act 1991. The bill gives effect to measures announced in the 2007-08 budget that concern the income support for students programs, and updates aspects of the administration of Abstudy and the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) in line with similar provisions under the Social Security Act 1991. Amendments to the Student Assistance Act 1973, under schedule 1, provide legislative support for the provision of services to Abstudy and the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) schemes. The first amendment aims to simplify the processes currently used by the Australian government (as represented by Centrelink) to recover payment(s) made under the Abstudy and Assistance for Isolated Children schemes that have been deposited into an incorrect financial institution account. This is consistent with the provisions of the Social Security Act 1991. The second amendment will allow notices issued under section(s) 343, 344 or 345 to be issued electronically. This amendment is required to incorporate current technologies and data transfer processes used by Centrelink for other student income support payments into the administration of the Abstudy and AIC schemes. Amendments to the Social Security Act 1991, under schedule 2, insert a new category of Level of Course to the levels of eligible study. This adds master's degrees as eligible courses and removes the current restriction on Austudy recipients which prevents them from receiving payment if they have already gained a master's level degree. The amendments also attach rent assistance payments to Austudy to increase the support for mature age people participating in education. Items 1, 3 and 6 to 8 clarify existing policy by inserting that a course supplied by a VET provider qualifies along with a TAFE course. This updates terminology to reflect current usage. From 1 January 2008, students enrolled in an approved master's by coursework program, which is required for entry to a profession, or is the fastest pathway to professional entry, will be eligible for youth allowance and Austudy payments. This provision will also extend to students enrolled in a master's coursework program where a university has diversified by restructuring its course delivery. The Minister for Education, Science and Training will determine approved courses on application by higher education providers. The legislative amendment makes provision for the approval process. The extension of Youth Allowance and Austudy to include approved professional master's degrees responds to a growing trend to increase the level of qualification required for professional entry. The measure enhances Australia's international competitiveness, will assist in addressing Australia's skill needs and contributes to the nation's skill development. The measure ensures that lowincome students have the financial assistance they require to complete a master's degree to obtain entry to a profession. To maintain consistency with student income support policy, as defined by the act, and the new amendment which extends income support to master's courses, an additional amendment is required to remove the current restriction on the provision of income support to students who have already attained a master's degree. This amendment has no effect on the existing allowable time and progress rules, which are maintained. It also does not apply to students who have attained a doctorate. From 1 January 2008, Indigenous students in receipt of the Abstudy living allowance will be able to access crisis payment under the Abstudy scheme. Amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 will clarify that a social security crisis payment is not payable if the person is qualified for an Abstudy sis payment in respect of the same circumstance. Items 12 to 17 provide access to rent assistance for eligible Austudy students. From 1 January 2008, students aged 25 years and over who receive Austudy will be able, if eligible, to receive assistance with their rental accommodation expenses. This amendment provides additional support for mature age students from low-income backgrounds, providing them with the opportunity to participate in education and training. Extending eligibility for rent assistance to include recipients of Austudy brings this payment into line with other income support recipients, such as those receiving youth lowance and Newstart. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Plibersek) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (DISCRETIONARY NA OFFSHORE FOREIGN INSURERS) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum pre Bill read a first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (10.04 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill allows consumers and businesses who purchase a general insurance product in Australia to be confident that they will be criprotected by Australia's world-class prudential regime. This bill amends the Insurance Act 1973, to strengthen and clarify the requirement that anyone that carries on general insurance business in Australia, either directly or through the actions of another (for example, a financial intermediary) is required to become authorised and will be prudentially regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA. At the same time, the government is keen to continue welcoming new entrants into the Australian general insurance market as it recognises these new entrants promote strong al- competition and innovation. The government will continue to welcome well-capitalised and well-managed foreign insurers. To that end, APRA will adopt a more riskfocused approach to prudential standards to align prudential requirements with the risk posed by different classes of insurers, with the result that categories of insurers posing a lower risk will face a reduced regulatory burden. This approach will better protect Australian consumers and businesses from poorly regulated direct offshore foreign insurers, or DOFIs. However, the government does not want the proposed changes to unduly restrict market capacity. For this reason, the bill provides a framework that enables the government to develop regulations to provide limited exemptions from the new regime. These exemptions will allow Australia's largest businesses, with risks that cannot appropriately be placed with an authorised insurer in Australia, to obtain insurance offshore. It is hoped these changes will encourage domestic insurers to continue providing innovative products that meet the needs of Australian consumers and businesses. To enforce these Insurance Act 1973 changes, APRA's powers will be expanded so that it can investigate entities that it has reasonable belief are carrying on insurance business in Australia without being authorised. APRA will also have the power to apply to the Federal Court for an injunction to stop an entity from acting illegally. The government recognises that these new powers are strong but, on balance, considers these to be necessary to maintaining the integrity of the prudential regime. To complement these prudential changes, the Corporations Act 2001 will be amended so that Australian financial service licence holders and authorised representatives will be required to deal only in authorised general insurance products, including those provided by Lloyd's underwriters, with limited exceptions. Licence holders will also be required by regulation to supply data on any dealing in insurance covered by the exemptions. With regards to discretionary mutual funds (DMFs), which are providers of risk management tools that are an alternative to insurance, the government has formed the view that at this stage DMFs do not pose a significant risk to systemic integrity. Therefore it would not be appropriate to prudentially regulate DMFs at this time. However, the nature and scope of DMF activity will be monitored via information collection over the next three years. At that time, once there is sufficient information on DMFs' activities, a review will be undertaken to determine whether or not it is appropriate to prudentially regulate these entities as well. The government is taking steps to ensure individual consumers are adequately informed about DMFs by an amendment to the Corporations Regulations requiring DMFs to disclose to all their clients, both retail and wholesale, the key characteristics of their product, including that the DMF has a disa cretion whether or not to pay out on a claim. The government is also amending the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001 to subject DMFs to a rigorous and compulsory data collection regime, to better understand the nature and scope of their operations. This data, along with the data collected from Australian financial service licence holders and authorised representatives who deal in DMF products, will provide sound statistical input for future policy. This bill addresses an outstanding HIH Royal Commission recommendation and a regulatory gap identified by the International Monetary Fund's Financial Sector Assessment Program. It follows extensive consultation with stakeholders on how best to regulate DOFIs and DMFs. The government welcomes industry's ongoing assistance in implementing and adjusting to these new arrangements. In October 2006, the International Monetary Fund found that Australia had a robust financial sector. The changes proposed in this bill will enhance the protection for Australians buying insurance and will encourage competition and innovation in the Australian general insurance market. They will enhance community confidence in the market and Australia's overseas reputation as a sound, well-regulated market. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Plibersek) adjourned. CORPORATIONS (NATIONAL GUARANTEE FUND LEVIES) AMENDMENT BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum pre Bill read a first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (10.11 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I introduce a bill that will amend the Corporations (National Guarantee Fund Levies) Act 2001 to make minor reforms to the levying abilities for the benefit of the National Guarantee Fund. This reform is also supported by a minor amendment to the Corporations Act 2001 which is included in the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Discretionary Mutual Funds and Direct Offshore Foreign Insurers) Bill 2007. The National Guarantee Fund is the compensation scheme for the Australian Securities Exchange. The measure caps the amount of levies payable each year if needed to top up the fund, thereby removing the current uncapped exposure of participants. Importantly, the changes do not affect investors' ability to claim from the fund. This bill accordingly delivers on the government's commitment to providing simpler business arrangements whilst maintaining important investor protections. Full details of this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum already presented. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Plibersek) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFYING REGULATION AND REVIEW) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum pre Bill read a first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (10.13 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill introduces measures to streamline and simplify prudential regulation of the financial sector and builds on the government's efforts to cut red tape. This bill also amends part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993-otherwise known as the SIS Act-so that financial assistance, where the fund has suffered loss as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft, is available on a more equitable basis. It also makes technical amendments that are consequential on the enactment of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Streamlining prudential regulation Schedule 1 to this bill amends the Banking Act 1959, the Insurance Act 1973, the Life Insurance Act 1995-the Life Act, the SIS Act 1995-collectively known as the four prudential acts-and the Corporations Act 2001-the Corporations Act-to implement the government commitments relating to prudential regulation in response to Rethinking regulation, the report of the Taskforce on Reducing Regulation Burdens on Business, otherwise known the Regulation Taskforce. It also includes measures to streamline and simplify the prudential acts in a manner that is consistent with the Regulation Taskforce's findings. Rethinking regulation found that ‘Australia's financial and corporate sectors, and the associated regulatory structures, are highly regarded internationally' and that the ‘broad policy framework has widespread support within business and the wider community in Australia' - that only significant breaches need to be However, Rethinking regulation also noted that there is scope to improve the regulatory framework in some areas. The government accepted all the recommendations in Rethinking regulation relevant to prudential regulation. Most of those recommendations which require legislative amendment have been included as measures in this bill. There is support within the industry for these measures. These measures have been subject to extensive consultation through the release of a proposals paper, an exposure draft of the bill and an industry round-table discussion on the draft bill. The government has listened to industry and as a result of the consultation process, amendments requiring trustees to ensure that investment managers and custodians meet fit and proper criteria have been removed from the bill. Also as a result of consultation, registrable superannuation entity licensees and superannuation entities now have 12 months from the date of royal assent to display an Australian business number on certain documents. The prudential acts administered by APRA and related legislation, such as the Corporations Act, have often evolved separately and in response to industry developments, and there is scope to refine and update the four prudential acts to make them more consistent. Recommendation 5.8 of Rethinking regulation highlighted breach reporting as a particular area where the government should seek to improve consistency and reduce the compliance burden. Consistent with this recommendation, this bill includes measures to streamline and improve breach reporting, including: reported under the prudential acts; - harmonised timing requirements under the prudential acts and the Corporations Act for the reporting of breaches so that significant breaches will generally have to be reported to APRA as soon as practicable and, in any event, no later than 10 business days after the entity becomes aware of the breach; - streamlined breach reporting requirements so that where an actuary or auditor identifies a breach and is required to notify APRA and the regulated entity of the breach, the entity is not required to also report the breach to APRA. The reverse also applies; and - where a breach is currently required to be reported to APRA and ASIC, that the breach will only need to be reported to APRA. APRA will have arrangements in place to pass the information on to ASIC. These changes to breach reporting will reduce costs, duplication and effort for the financial sector. Recommendation 5.4 of Rethinking regulation stated that the government should ensure that APRA has sufficient flexibility to tailor requirements to accommodate differing circumstances. This bill will provide APRA with greater flexibility to exercise discretion under prudential standards and allow APRA to exempt a person or class of persons from parts of the prudential acts so that entities are not unnecessarily burdened by requirements not appropriate to their situations. This bill also includes measures to simplify legislation, remove unnecessary regulation and ensure the prudential regime is flexible, consistent and transparent. In particular, the measures relating to the Life Act will repeal around one-third of the sections under the Life Act, greatly streamlining this act. Financial assistance Part 23 of the SIS Act enables the trustee of a superannuation fund to apply for a grant of financial assistance where the fund has suffered loss as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft. Following on from a review into the operations of part 23, a number of amendments to the SIS Act are being made in schedule 2 of this bill so that financial assistance is available on a more equitable basis. The amendments include: - removing the differences between the treatment of accumulation and defined benefit funds; - allowing former beneficiaries to obtain financial assistance under part 23; - allowing funds which were eligible for part 23 assistance at the time the loss was suffered, but which subsequently restructured into self-managed superannuation funds, to obtain financial assistance; and - streamlining the part 23 application process. These amendments will ensure that financial assistance under part 23 of the SIS Act is available on a more equitable basis and will enhance the operation of the part 23 application process. Accounting and reporting obligations As part of the streamlining prudential regulation reforms, Schedule 3 to this bill amends the SIS Act, the Superannuation (Self Managed Superannuation Funds) Taxation Act 1987 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, to: - consolidate and rationalise the prudential reporting requirements under the SIS Act; - distinguish between reporting requirements relating to registrable superannuation entities and selfmanaged superannuation funds; and - remove the regulatory gap that exists in the SIS Act for the reporting of contraventions of the market conduct and disclosure provisions in the Corporations Act. The consolidation and rationalisation of the prudential reporting requirements in the SIS Act aims to ensure ease of compliance by superannuation entities. This assists the regulator in its prudential supervisory activities and promotes confidence that the entities providing superannuation services are prudently managed. Technical amendments relating to legislative instruments Schedule 4 amends various legislation, including the prudential acts, to make technical amendments that are consequential on the enactment of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. These amendments do not in any way affect the operation of the legislation. Conclusion The measures in this bill address many of the concerns of the financial services sector by removing regulatory overlaps, providing greater flexibility for APRA to tailor prudential requirements to particular circumstances and removing unnecessary or outdated provisions. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Plibersek) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum pre Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (10.21 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will give the force of law to the negotiated double tax agreement between Australia and Finland, which was signed on 20 November 2006. The bill will insert the text of the agreement with Finland into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953. This is a prerequisite to the new tax treaty's entry into force. The bill repeals the schedules to the national Tax Agreements Act 1953 that give the force of law to the existing tax treaty with Finland. The agreement will broadly update the taxation arrangements between Australia and Finland. The agreement will substantially reduce withholding taxes on certain dividend, interest and royalty payments in line with those provided in our tax treaty arrangements with the United Kingdom, the United States and, more recently, with France and Norway. This will provide long-term benefits for business, reducing the cost for Australian based business to obtain intellectual property, equity and finance for expansion. The agreement will assist trade and investment flows between Australia and Finland, and further demonstrates the government's commitment to update Australia's tax treaty network as recommended by the Review of Business Taxation and the Review of International Tax Arrangements. The treaty will strengthen our economic relations with Finland. Further, it will provide a positive economic environment for Australia and contribute to a larger and faster-growing Australian economy. The new agreement achieves a balance of outcomes that will provide Australia with a competitive tax framework for international trade and investment while ensuring the Australian revenue base is sustainable and suitably protected. The agreement includes rules to prevent re- tax discrimination against nationals and Australian businesses operating in Finland and vice versa. The agreement serves as another step in facilitating a competitive and modem tax treaty network for companies located in Australia. The agreement will also satisfy Australia's most favoured nation obligations unInter- der the existing treaty with Finland. Finally, I note the agreement will facilitate improved integrity aspects of administering and collecting tax from those with tax obligations in either or both countries. The agreement reflects the government's decision to incorporate enhanced information exchange provisions which meet modern OECD standards and to provide for reciprocal assistance in collection in future tax treathat ties where appropriate. The government believes that the conclusion of the agreement will strengthen the integrity of Australia's tax treaty network through bilateral cooperation between countries to help ensure taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. The agreement will enter into force after completion of the necessary processes in both countries and will have effect in accordance with its terms. In accordance with those processes, the treaty was tabled in this place and referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The committee has recommend that binding action be taken. The enactment of this bill, and the satisfaction of the other procedures relating to proposed treaty actions, will complete the processes followed in Australia to bring the treaty into force. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Plibersek) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES No. 4) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum pre Bill read a first time. Second Reading  Secretary to the Treasurer) (10.26 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill makes numerous improvements to Australia's tax laws. Schedule 1 gives effect to the government's announcement in the 2005-06 budget it will abolish foreign loss and foreign tax credit quarantining and streamline the remaining foreign tax credit rules. This is achieved by repealing the existing arrangements and replacing them with new simplified foreign income tax offset rules. These rules allow taxpayers to claim relief for foreign income taxes paid on an amount included in their assessable income. These amendments also include transitional rules for the treatment of existing foreign losses and credits. These amendments also provide a mechanism to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to give effect to Australia's tax treaty obligations to provide relief from economic double taxation arising from transfer pricing adjustments. By reducing tax complexity and compliance costs, these changes will assist businesses of all sizes operating, or seeking to grow, internationally. They build on the previous reforms undertaken by the Review of International Taxation Arrangements to ensure Australia has a competitive international tax system. Schedule 2 amends the income tax laws to provide a capital gains tax rollover, similar to the scrip for scrip rollover, for membership interests in companies limited by guarantee that are also medical defence organisations. This rollover will ensure that capital gains tax need not be an impediment to mergers or takeovers of medical defence organisations. Schedule 3 to this bill allows investment by superannuation funds in instalment warrants that are of a limited recourse nature. In recent years, many superannuation funds, particularly self-managed superannuation funds, have invested in instalment warrants. These changes will allow superannuation funds to continue to invest in limited recourse instalment warrants with certainty. Schedule 4 amends the ultimate beneficiary reporting rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These rules target arrangements where taxpayers use complex chains of trusts to effectively obscure the ultimate beneficiary of the assessable trust income. Under the new rules, trustees of closely held trusts will no longer be required to trace income through interposed trusts to the ultimate beneficiary and report those details to the Commissioner of Taxation. Instead, trustees of closely held trusts will be required to report only the details of trustee beneficiaries that are presently entitled to income of the trust and tax-preferred amounts. Family trusts and their related trusts will be excluded from the new reporting requirements, on the basis that under the family trust election rules any distributions outside the family group are already subject to a penalty rate of tax. In addition, the commissioner will be given a determination making power not to require annual reporting for some trusts where he considers it unnecessary. These amendments will reduce compliance costs for trustees of closely held trusts whilst maintaining the integrity of the tax system. Schedule 5 to this bill assists in a smooth transition to the new simplified superannuation regime and clarifies the policy intent. These amendments ensure that where a tax file number is provided by the commissioner, the tax file number is taken to have been quoted by the member, and the provider can use the tax file number. These amendments also address strategies which seek to circumvent the minimum drawdown requirements for superannuation income streams. Concessional tax treatment will only apply to those assets included in the income stream account balance. These amendments also further improve the readability of superannuation and taxation provisions rewritten as part of the reforms. Schedule 6 amends the list of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Deductible gift recipient status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities. Schedule 7 implements various technical corrections and amendments and also some general improvements to the law of a minor nature. These amendments are an important part of the government's commitment to improving the quality of the taxation laws and reducing their complexity. Schedule 8 amends the trust loss regime to provide more flexibility for family trusts. The amendments allow family trust elections to be varied or revoked in a broader range of circumstances than is currently the case. The amendments also expand the definition of family to include lineal descendants, former spouses, widows, widowers and former stepchildren. Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Plibersek) adjourned.

Question agreed to. NA (RESIDENTIAL CARE) BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 June, on motion  That this bill be now read a second time.  (10.34 am)-in reply-Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, may I say how appropriate it is to have you, a former Minister for Ageing, in the chair for the summing up of the Aged Care Amendment (Residential Care) Bill 2007. You were in fact a trailblazer in many of the areas in which we now find ourselves continuing to bring about reform to improve the lives of residents, the comfort of families with loved ones in aged-care facilities and the regulatory environment in which providers operate. As one of the former distinguished ministers for ageing, I hope that you have found this bill to be to your liking. In summing up, I would like to thank the members for MCMillan, Wakefield, Cook, Moreton, Cowper, Hasluck, Riverina and Hinkler from the government for their contributions to the debate about the aged-care funding instrument. I also thank the members for Gellibrand, Reid, Lyons, Hindmarsh, in the Gorton, Banks, Swan, Canberra, Lingiari, Shortland, Chisholm and Scullin from the opposition for their contributions. This debate is about the aged-care funding instrument bill, which is the new funding instrument to be used by aged-care providers to determine the appropriate level of support for their residents, in close contact with the Department of Health and Ageing, and the funding that those residents will attract. However, the debate has ranged across a very wide number of issues in aged care, and the opposition has used it as an opportunity to comment generally about aged-care issues. In summing up the bill I would like to deal with a few of the calumnies they have dropped in the House over the last few days of this debate on the aged-care bill, even though they do not bear directly on the agedcare funding instrument. The opposition have tried to paint a picture of an aged-care system in some crisis. They have left out most of the facts about how the aged-care system operates, which you, Madam Deputy Speaker, would be well aware of. But, sadly, the opposition side have either deliberately or ignorantly tried to paint a quite false ture of how the aged-care system works and the situation that the aged-care system finds itself in. By way of background, when this government took office in 1996 the federal government was spending $3.15 billion on aged care. Eleven years later, in the current forward estimates we will be spending $10.1 billion by 2010-11. We have trebled the spending on aged care. A lot of work has been done to try and get the aged-care system into a state where we as a nation can be proud of it. In many areas Australia is at the cutting edge in the provision of care to times the most frail and vulnerable people in our community who are in residential aged care. This stands in stark contrast to the way we found aged care in 1996. It was underfunded, there were no consistent accreditation guidelines across the country and there were no spot checks by an accreditation agency. We established the accreditation agency and we insisted on spot checks. In fact, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, I believe you were the minister at the time spot checks were initiated for aged-care facilities. Every home has at least one spot check and unannounced visit every year. That is not to mention the many other visits to aged-care facilities, support visits and review audits. Some homes have numerous unannounced visits by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency. In 1996 there were 4,500 Community Aged Care Packages for the entire country. Today there are 39,000. By 2010-11 there will be close to 50,000 Community Aged Care Packages. When we were elected in 1996 there were 93 places available for 1,000 Australians aged 70 and over. Today that ratio is 108 and the aim is to get to 113 by 2010-11. It will be made up of 44 highcare residential aged-care places, 44 lowcare places and 25 Community Aged Care picPackages. In this debate the Labor Party has quite wilfully ignored Community Aged Care Packages, which suggests to me that yet again the Labor Party is indulging in the trickery with which we have become accustomed with the current Leader of the Opposition-leaving out salient facts and quite misleading the Australian people, in this case on aged care. Community aged-care places must be included in the places available to older Australians primarily because they are the same, in all material respects, as residential agedcare places. More importantly, they are the some- preferred option for older Australians. Madam Deputy Speaker, as you would know, the vast majority of Australians want to stay in their own home for as long as they possibly can and in as healthy a state as they can. The combination of HACC funding, which the states and the Commonwealth run together, and which we have doubled, and the Community Aged Care and Extended Aged Care at Home packages, which are particularly sought after, means that people can stay in their homes for longer and be healthier and, if necessary, go into an aged-care facility probably later in life when they really need to do so. The Labor Party wilfully ignores the role of Community Aged Care Packages. In the Main Committee during the appropriations debate the shadow minister for health completely ignored the role of Community Aged Care Packages. The member for Shortland is particularly egregious in this respect with her misrepresentation of the number of places that are available for older people in Australia. Quite frankly, she frightens older Australians and their families into believing that government has reduced the number of places available when, in fact, we will have increased the number of places by 48 per cent. That is our estimate of where we will be-that we will have increased the number of places that are available for older people in residential care and through the Community Aged Care and the Extended Aged Care at Home packages. In addition, when Labor was in office $18 million was being spent on respite care. Today the figure is closer to $190 million. In the budget handed down recently we established funding for respite demonstration centres to the tune of $41 million. We are continuing to put our money where our mouth is when it comes to support for respite. The Prime Minister in particular-but I think all members on this side of the House-believes that those people who care for loved ones play a critically important role in society, to mention the economy, and deserve the support and the respect of government. For those people, respite care is a critical element in their being able to care for their loved ones for longer periods. Without that respite care they would not be able to get by. In this debate the Labor Party has wilfully ignored the role of the states in the provision of acute care places. Time and again I have heard Labor speakers talking about the shortage of places in the community and the fact that older people in hospital are supposedly taking up the places of others. I was not aware that when an older person went into hospital that meant they were going to end up in an aged-care residential facility. Many older people who go into hospital-in fact the vast majority-do not end up in residential aged care but return to their home and get on with their life. Yet the Labor Party would have us believe that almost every older person in an acute bed in hospital is the somehow taking up a place that somebody else could have and that they should really be in an aged-care facility. Quite frankly, I think it would come as a shock to many older people going into hospital to think that the Labor Party would say, ‘You're in hospital and the next step is an aged-care facility.' The government recognises that often older people have longer stays in hospital because they may need extra care. For that reason we have the $150 million program Improving Care for Older Patients in Public Hospitals. We do not agree with the Labor Party that all older people in hospital will end up in an aged-care facility. I find it insulting to older Australians. I think the Labor Party should change its rhetoric and think carefully about the messages it sends when it says these things. The Labor Party and the states are yet again hoisted on their own petard in attacknot ing the government over supposed shortages of aged care places. The number of acute care beds in public hospitals around the country increased from 1996-97 to 2004-05. The percentage variation in total acute hospital beds across Australia has been 0.1 per cent. The states have managed to increase the number of acute care hospital beds by 0.1 per cent. The state that seems to make the most noise about acute hospital beds versus agedcare places is Queensland and yet, extraordinarily, the number of acute hospital beds in Queensland fell by 4.5 per cent between 1996-97 and 2004-05. The total number of those beds in Queensland in 1996-97 was 10,023 and in 2004-05 it was 9,569. It has gone down by 454 beds. They have the gall to criticise the federal government about a so-called shortage of aged-care places when in the same period of time the number of aged-care places in Queensland increased by 25.2 per cent. Overall, in the period June 1996 to June 2005 the number of aged-care places increased across Australia by 33.9 per cent. That does not take into account our estimate that, by the end of this year, it will be closer to a 47.7 per cent increase. On the most recently available statistics, we have increased the number of places by 33.9 per cent across the country, while the Labor states-which are all the states and territories, unfortunately-have managed to increase the number of beds across Australia by 0.1 per cent. In New South Wales they increased them by 2.6 per cent, in Victoria 0.5 per cent, in Western Australia 3.1 per cent, and in Tasmania 2.1 per cent. In Queensland the number of beds has dropped by 4.5 per cent, in South Australia it has dropped by 3.2 per cent, in the ACT it has dropped by an extraordinary 18.8 per cent, and in the Northern Territory by 1.2 per cent. So if there are not beds available in acute care in public hospitals in Queensland, it is not the fault of the federal government, and it certainly is not the fault of older Australians who need to be in hospital. It is clearly the fault of the Queensland Labor government. One of the people who have been intrinsically involved in Queensland is the Leader of the Opposition, who is trying to use the same trickery that he brings to all these debates to suggest that somehow the government is failing to provide the number of beds that should be provided to older people in agedcare facilities. I notice that recently the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for ageing-and the shadow minister for health as well-put out press statements about aged care in which yet again they repeated the line that there is a ratio of 88 beds for 88 places for every 1,000 people aged 70 or over in Australia, when that number is much greater than that because they again refuse to include community aged care packages. The ratio is 108 now and by 201011 it will be 113. When we came to office, the ratio was 93. Ms Plibersek interjecting Ms Roxon interjecting grace with respect to aged care. You were spending $3.1 billion on aged care, $18 million on respite care, and there were 4,500 community aged care packages. You have the gall to come into the House on this bill, the Aged Care Amendment (Residential Care) Bill 2007, and again trawl through these tricky lines about ratios and places, which are completely false, causing me to have to come in here and put the record straight yet again. I have to try to fix the situation so that older people are not led to believe the calumnies that are visited upon the government yet again by the opposition. It is unfair that the Labor Party has not used the opportunities they have had to put together a policy on aged care that talks to the people in aged care about workforce issues, IT issues, or capital raising for infrastructure issues. Instead, they keep running these scare lines against the government, upsetting older people and leading them down the garden path of disbelief, even when the facts are finally pointed out to them, which I have been doing in this debate and continue to do in the press. It is not like the Labor Party have not had opportunities to put their record to the Australian people and to talk about their policies for the future. The shadow minister, at an aged care and community care conference in Victoria, which I also attended, spoke for half and hour and at no point in that speech did she talk about what the Labor Party was proposing to do about aged care. Apparently, aged care is in crisis, according to the shadow ministers who cover this area, the member for Gellibrand and Senator MCLucasMr John Cobb-They have no ideas.  assistant minister says, to put to the Australian people about what they would do. Every time they are given the opportunity to do so, they squib it. The Leader of the Opposition had the chance on 18 May at a lunch in Queensland for the aged-care industry, which, amazingly, people paid $3,000 a head to attend. People paid $3,000 to hear the Leader of the Opposition at an aged care lunch talk about the Labor Party's aged care policy! Yet he made no attempt to put to rest their concerns about Labor's policy in aged care. He did not outline Labor's agenda for the coming election in aged care. It was just the same lies about ratios and places and spending that we hear constantly from the shadow ministers who cover this area. If I were paying $3,000 to hear the Leader of the Opposition on aged care, I would have thought he would have said something to alleviate and allay my concerns. But no, yet again he squibbed it. The Australian public will have their opportunity at the end of the year to compare our excellent record on aged care with the Labor Party's record on aged care. I turn to workforce issues. The Labor Party are Johnny-come-latelies to this debate on the workforce. They think they are the first people to discover that there are workforce challenges in the area of aged care for whole lot of reasons. It is not a unique issue in Australia that there is a shortage of nurses in aged care and across the health sector. There is a worldwide shortage of nurses, and that affects Australia. So the government has been taking action with respect to the workforce and aged care. Since 2002, we have created almost 40,000 training places in aged care, 1,600 additional nursing scholarships, 3,200 medication management training places, 13,000 certificate level training places and 12,750 training places for personal care workers from rural and remote regions of Australia. In the budget's Securing the Future of Aged Care initiative, we provided a further $32 million over five years for 6,000 training places for the community care workforce and 410 postgraduate scholarships. That is almost 40,000 places since 2002, at a cost of over $300 million. So we are definitely recognising the challenges that are there for workforce issues in aged care and we are meeting those challenges. We are not standing still like the Labor Party and wanting to return to the pre-1996 period when aged-care facilities in Australia were, quite frankly, a disgrace and an embarrassment to this country. You took the necessary action, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Bishop-if I can be so familiar-that was needed, as the Minister for Ageing. That has been followed up by subsequent ministers for ageing. I am quite proud to have had the opportunity to build on the record and the role that you and others have played in this area, because it is critically important. It is vitally important to the residents that they get the quality and standard of care that you would expect in Australia. We have initiated the processes and framework that have brought that about. It is critically important to the families of those residents that they feel comfortable that their a loved ones are in a place where they would be happy to have them, and I think we are achieving that. We also need to maintain a viable industry for the not-for-profit, the forprofit and the government part of that industry, and we are doing that too. I look forward to this bill being passed and the ACFI being introduced in March 2008 because of the benefits that that will bring to the entire sector. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

(10.56 am)-It is my duty to make a statement to the House concerning a Senate amendment with respect to this bill and the matter of constitutional principle it raises. Proposed Senate amendment No. 3 is expected, if enacted, to have the effect of increasing payments to suppliers of pharmaceutical products. That is, it is expected to have the effect of increasing expenditure under the standing appropriation in the principal Act. There is doubt that the Senate may proceed in these circumstances by way of amendment because of section 53 of the Constitution. Among other things, this section prohibits the Senate from amending a bill so as to increase ‘any proposed charge or burden on the people'. The view has been taken that where expenditure is appropriated in these circumstances, section 56 of the Constitution requires that the proposed appropriation must be recommended by a message from the Governor General. I understand that such a message has been obtained in this case. The House will need to consider the way in which it should proceed to deal with the matters raised in Senate amendment No. 3. If it wishes to entertain the proposal reflected in the amendment, it may choose to proceed by alternative means. The matter for consideration is not so much one of the privileges and rights between the two Houses but observance of the requirements of the Constitution concerning the appropriation of revenue. I move: That the House endorses the statement of the Speaker in relation to the constitutional raised by Message No. 554 transmitted by the Senate in relation to the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2007. Question agreed to.  (10.57 am)-I indicate to the House that the government proposes that Senate amendments (1) and (2) and (4) to (10) be agreed to, and that amendment (3) be disagreed to but that an amendment be made in place thereof. I suggest, therefore, that it may suit the convenience of the House to first consider amendments (1) and (2) and (4) to (10) and, when those amendments have been disposed of, to consider amendment (3). I move: That Senate amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4 to 10 be agreed to.",46
15,Ms ROXON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Gellibrand) (11.00 am)The Minister for Ageing might be able to assist in this process. My understanding is that the amendments that were moved in the Senate will be moved here. I understand that, with the constitutional restrictions, an identical alternative amendment will be moved. The minister might be able to explain whether that is his understanding of the process that is going to be followed. Clearly, the amendment that was moved, with the support of the government and Labor, in the other place is an agreed position between the government and the opposition, and with the minor parties as well, as a result of the Senate committee process. It was my understanding that that amendment would be moved here as well. Certainly, I am happy to speak on the others. I understand that it is more about the technical nature of what can be moved in the Senate compared to what can be moved in the House, rather than any opposition to the content of the amendment. Could the minister clarify whether that is the government's intention before I make some questions short comments.  (11.01 am)-I do not propose to get into a debate about this. Obviously, I am not the minister responsible for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. My understanding is that the minor parties' amendment is being disagreed to by the government, but we are enacting our own amendment this morning which is virtually in the same detail as the Senate amendment, which I understand has been agreed to by the opposition and the government. So we are disagreeing to their Senate amendment (3) but substituting our own government amendment.",49
16,Ms ROXON,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Gellibrand) (11.01 am)Thank you for that clarification. That was my understanding as well, but I thought it was important that we have that on the record. Labor does support the passage of the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2007 and the amendments that have been passed in the other place. We are disappointed that a number of the issues that were raised during a fairly truncated Senate committee process have not been able to be explored adequately. When such major changes are being made to the PBS-a very important part of the health support that the government gives to the nation-we need to make sure that we get the detail of these changes right. We are pleased, given our concerns about some of the issues that have been raised both on behalf of consumers and on behalf of the generics industry, that a number of the changes that have been accepted during the Senate process will at least allow for a proper and adequate review of whether these measures do have the intended effect. I think everybody is in furious agreement about the intended effect. Whether or not there might be some extra impact or burden on consumers-we have some fears that it may-will now at least be able to be properly monitored and reported on at the end of a review process. The government has agreed, following the Senate inquiry, to include that provision in this legislation. We welcome that and believe that it will be of benefit to consumers and that it will provide some extra protection and confidence which were not really able to be provided to the broader community during the very quick Senate inquiry process. We are also pleased that a number of the amendments will ensure that the departmental processes for implementing these reforms will be made more transparent. Other players in the pharmaceuticals industry will understand that, with respect to negotiations which are quite rightly held between the department, Medicines Australia and other pharmaceutical companies, there will be an extra level of scrutiny of those negotiations so that we can maintain the community's confidence that this scheme is getting the best value for government and also protecting the needs and interests of consumers. I welcome the fact that these amendments have been agreed to, and I commend them to the House. Question agreed to.  (11.04 am)-I move: That Senate amendment No. 3 be disagreed to. Question agreed to. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.  (11.04 am)-I move: That Government amendment No. 1 be made in place of the Senate's amendment No. 3 which was disagreed to. I think the debate has been covered by both the member for Gellibrand and me, so I will not give any further explanation. Question agreed to.

18,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,ANNE KELLY (DawsonParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services) (11.05 am)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to.,52
19,Mr ALBANESE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"The government's proposed amendac- ments to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Bill 2007 appear to address some of the issues raised by me as shadow minister representing the shadow minister for communications in the House during the debate and indeed in amendments that were pursued by the opposition in the Senate. There were also submissions made to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts at the inquiry into the bill. The amendments, inter alia, exclude ondemand subscription television services from the bill, allowing subscription TV broadcasting services to broadcast MA15+ programs on the internet or 3G phones without ageverification systems; provide ACMA with the power to issue special service cessation notices in relation to live content services; insert certain anti-avoidance measures for content service providers, for example, service providers can take all reasonable steps to abate act or acts in breach of the ify that a content or hosting service will only be subject to the bill where it has an ‘Australian connection' and clarify what an ‘Australian connection' is; and, provide that a person does not provide a content service merely because the person provides a billing service or a fee collection service in relation to a content service. However, the opposition believes that the amendments do not address all issues raised in the submissions or at the inquiry. For example, the amendments, perhaps most importantly, do not prevent prohibited material being accessed from overseas content providers; they do not remove or clarify the access requirements for MA15+ or R18+ content, except for on-demand subscription television services; they still prohibit content rated RC and X18+, which means that films rated X18+, which are currently legally available in the ACT and Northern Territory and can be purchased interstate via mail order, are now prohibited via the internet; they still discriminate against artists that use media technology for the creation and dissemination of their work, that is, video artwork, web and sound art and short film; and they do not clarify the definition of ‘content service', which, with its 22 exemptions, can be quite confusing for people seeking to understand the practical application of this legislation. Notwithstanding the above, the amendments do improve the bill, such as it is. However, I wish to inform the House that Labor considers the amendments should have gone further and should have taken into account the submissions received by the committee and evidence given at the inquiry into the legislation. Labor will be voting to support these amendments but would urge the government to consider the points raised. The opposition express some disappointment that these amendments do not go as far as we bill; clarbelieve they should have gone. Question agreed to. NA Public Works Committee Reference",52
20,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (11.10 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Robertson Barracks redevelopment, Darwin, Northern Territory. The Department of Defence proposes to undertake a redevelopment of Robertson Barracks, the home of the Army's 1st Brigade, a brigade that is almost as good as 3rd Brigade in Townsville. The works now proposed are required to meet the requirements of the Australian Army in a complex strategic environment and to meet the requirements of the government's Hardened and Networked Army initiative and introduction of the Abrams tank fleet. The works consist primarily of extension or replication of existing facilities. The estimated turn-out cost of the proposal is $72.1 million, plus GST. Subject to parliamentary approval, the works would be commenced in early 2008 with the objective of having them completed by 2010. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to.

21,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (11.12 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Airborne Early Warning and Control Facilities, RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory. The proposal will provide new infrastructure at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory to enable the new airborne early warning and control aircraft to operate effectively from the base. This new capability will be an integral part of a layered Australian Defence Force air defence system. The airborne early warning and control capability will enhance surveillance, air defence, fleet support and force coordination operation in defence of Australia's sovereignty and her national interests. The aircraft will be home based at RAAF Base Williamtown in New South Wales and will use RAAF Base Tindal as a forward operating base. The first aircraft are scheduled for delivery in March 2009. The proposal will provide new taxiways, aprons, shelters, hydrant refuelling and associated infrastructure. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposal is $64.2 million plus GST. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in May next year with completion in late 2009. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to.

22,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (11.13 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Refurbishment of staff apartments, Australian Embassy complex, Tokyo, Japan. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to refurbish 43 staff apartments at the Australian Embassy complex in Tokyo, Japan. The Australian government built the existing embassy complex and has occupied it since 1990. The complex comprises the chancery, apartments and recreational facilities. The proposal is to undertake internal refurbishment of all 43 staff apartments. The works will include upgrading building services and will ensure compliance with current standards and building codes and enhanced amenity for tenants. The Australian government owns the embassy complex, which was valued at $258.25 million in 2006. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposal is $22 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in early 2008 with completion in 2010. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",54
23,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (11.15 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Provision facilities for Project Single LEAP-Phase 2. This is indeed an expedient project and I would welcome the parliament's support for this motion today. The Department of Defence intends to deliver new single residential accommodation, associated facilities, infrastructure and services on 17 Defence Force bases in all states and territories except Tasmania. I am pleased as the local member for Townsville, which has Australia's largest defence base, Lavarack Barracks, home of the 3rd Brigade-which, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, you have visited on many occasions-that there will be several hundred single-soldier accommodation units built to augment the 1,100 already on base. The strategy being proposed by the Department of Defence is to engage a ‘strategic partner' for the delivery of: - financing; - planning the development; - construction; - maintenance; and - operation. The government announced funding in the 2004-05 budget for Project Single LEAPphase 1 and phase 2 inclusive-of $113.2 million over four years and then an annual allocation of approximately $60 million thereafter. The cost of phase 2 will be determined through a competitive tender process, subject to government selection of a preferred tenderer and parliamentary approval. The estimated out-turned cost is $1.2 billion-net present value-and will involve a regular service payment by Defence over 30 years for buildings, infrastructure, facilities of the management services, maintenance and life cycle costs. In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed subof ject to the recommendations of the committee. I am pleased to advise the House that the Department of Defence accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is planned to commence in early 2009 and be completed in 2012. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the chair of the committee and member for Pearce, Judi Moylan, and the committee for its support and hard work in processing this project quickly and in a timely way. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Procedure Committee Report",54
24,Mrs MAY,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure I present the committee's report entitled Options for nursing mothers, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",55
25,Mrs MAY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am pleased to present this report on behalf of the Procedure Committee. I am conscious this morning that time is limited, so I will keep my remarks brief. On 15 February 2007 the Standing Committee on Procedure was asked to consider a proposal to allow nursing mothers a proxy vote. While the committee spent considerable time discussing this proposal, it could not reach a unanimous decision either in support of or against proxy voting. A significant obstacle for a number of committee members was the concern that a somewhat dangerous precedent could be established by introducing proxy voting, even on a limited basis, for nursing mothers in the House of Representatives. Given the level of dissent, the committee resolved to present a report detailing the guments for and against the proposal. Perhaps more importantly, this report represents an acknowledgement that women in the House of Representatives face a level of difficulty when nursing newborn infants. While women themselves are not necessarily calling for any special attention, it is important that the House appreciates women's dual roles in the early months of their children's lives and that some accommodating measures be implemented. This could be in the form of a blanket allowance of three months maternity leave or the provision of adequate child care in the House. The committee sincerely hopes this report will encourage greater awareness and discussion of the issue. On a personal note, as chairman of the Procedure Committee I would like to extend thanks to all the women of the House who gave me the time to talk through their concerns with this proposal. In fact, the women of the House were not seeking any changes. They recognise the difficulty they have with newborn infants, but I think all of them were also very much aware of their commitment to the parliament and to the job that they have undertaken. That is not to say that we cannot in the future look at some ways in which we can assist nursing mothers who return to the parliament with young children-but that is for a later date and for further discussion. I would like to acknowledge Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, who is a member of my committee and took part in the deliberations undertaken by the committee. I would also like to thank my deputy chair, the member for Banks, for his support during this inquiry, and I thank the committee secretariat for their help in putting the report together. I commend the report to the House.",55

29,Dr SOUTHCOTT,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee's report entitled Report 85: Treaties tabled on 6, 7 and 27 February 2007. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",56
30,Dr SOUTHCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Report 85 contains the committee's findings on five treaty actions. The committee found all the treaties reviewed were in Australia's national interest and, where a recommendation was required, recommended that binding treaty action be taken. I will comment on all the treaties reviewed in report 85. Under the social security agreement with the Swiss Confederation, residents of Australia and Switzerland will be able to move between the two countries safe in the knowledge that their right to benefits is recognised in both Australia and Switzerland. The agreement provides for enhanced access to certain Australian and Swiss social security benefits and greater portability of most of these benefits between countries. The agreement with Finland on the avoidance of double taxation is a revised version of an existing treaty. The changes are designed to further aid in the elimination of obstacles to investment as a result of international double taxation. The agreement will reduce rates of withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties and bring into line the treatment of capital gains tax with OECD practice and integrity measures. In particular, the agreement includes rules to allow for the cross-border collection of tax debts and rules for the exchange of information on tax matters. Australia has a strong interest in maintaining biodiversity generally and in protecting migratory bird species which visit our shores. The agreement with the Republic of Korea on the protection of migratory birds will help protect bird species which regularly migrate between Australia and the Republic of Korea. This agreement complements the two similar agreements Australia has in place with China and Japan. Measure 4 (2006) Specially Protected Species: Fur Seals removes Antarctic fur seals from the list of specially protected cies established under the Antarctic Treaty. Research has determined that these fur seals are no longer at significant risk of extinction, meaning they no longer require specially protected species status to ensure their conservation. Fur seals will continue to receive the comprehensive general protections afforded to all Antarctic seal species. I would finally like to comment on the Treaty between Australia and Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea, known as the CMATS treaty. The principal aim of the CMATS treaty is to allow for the exploitation of the Greater Sunrise natural gas field, located between Australia and East Timor in the Timor Sea. Upstream revenues from this resource will be shared equally between Australia and East Timor. It is estimated that this resource will yield around US$20 billion over the life of the field. The treaty also prevents both countries from asserting or pursuing their maritime boundary claims in the Timor Sea for 50 years. Many of the submissions received by the committee in relation to the inquiry expressed strong reservations about certain aspects of the treaty. Particularly, there was concern regarding the 50-year moratorium on asserting claims to maritime boundaries. Several submissions accused Australia of contravening international laws in this respect, claiming that, if permanent maritime boundaries were concluded along the median line halfway between the coastlines of Australia and East Timor coastlines, the Greater Sunrise field would lie entirely within East Timor's exclusive economic zone. This related to a further concern over the equal share of upstream revenues from the Greater Sunrise field. Many of the submissions received pointed out that the delimitation of maritime boundaries along the median line spe- would result in all of the revenue from Greater Sunrise belonging to East Timor. While the committee acknowledged these concerns, it noted that, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, if the two countries were unable to agree to a permanent maritime boundary, they were obliged to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature without prejudice to the final decision. This has been achieved through the CMATS treaty. Further, the equal share of upstream revenue from Greater Sunrise is a vast improvement on the previous 18 per cent East Timor was entitled to prior to the CMATS treaty. The apportionment of Greater Sunrise under this treaty is a positive step for East Timor and the committee supports the sharing arrangement established by CMATS. I should mention briefly the government's use of the national interest exemption to bring the CMATS treaty into force prior to the committee reporting. The exemption is intended for use in only extreme situations, and the committee would have preferred the opportunity to review the treaty and report in a shorter than usual time frame. The committee acknowledges that the immediate development of the Greater Sunrise field will be a significant benefit to the people and economies of both Australia and East Timor and that the ratification of the CMATS treaty was required before that development could occur. I thank the committee secretariat for their work in assisting the committee during the public hearings, in the receipt of submissions and in the preparation of the report. I thank all members of the committee. I see that the member for Swan and the member for Lyons are here. They are both very diligent and hard working members of the committee. I commend the report to the House.",56
31,Mr WILKIE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties Report 85: Treaties tabled on 6, 7 and 27 February 2007 contains the review of five treaty actions. The Agreement between Australia and the Swiss Confederation on Social Security is one of Australia's many international social security agreements. Australia already has social security agreements in place with 18 other countries. We have recently signed agreements with Korea, Japan, Germany and, most prominently, with Greece. Australia is currently negotiating eight further social security agreements. These social security agreements close the gaps in social security coverage for people who migrate between Australia and other countries, which I believe to be in the national interest of Australia. In a similar way, the Agreement with the Government of Finland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion is one of a number of such treaties Australia has with other countries, and we expect to review more such treaties in the future. The measures are sensible and should be supported. The Agreement with the Government of the Republic of Korea on the Protection of Migratory Birds requires both Australia and the Republic of Korea to prohibit the taking, sale, purchase or exchange of birds and their eggs, with a small number of exceptions, such as for scientific research. My electorate of Swan has a very significant migratory bird habitat, particularly at the Milyu Nature Reserve, and any effort that can be made to protect those species and conserve their habitats is very valuable. In relation to the fur seals measure, the committee was informed that the Antarctic fur seal population has grown to over 1.6 million. The committee is satisfied that the removal of fur seals from the specially protected species list will not result in any potential threat of future commercial exploitation. Finally, I would like to make some comment on the Treaty between Australia and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea, which provides a fifty-fifty income split for royalties from the Greater Sunrise oil and gas fields and prevents maritime boundary disputes from being contested for 50 years. While I agree with the committee's conclusion that the treaty is in Australia's national interest, I would like to emphasise my dissatisfaction with the government's decision to invoke the national interest exemption and make comment on the overall process that has led to this treaty. The Minister for Foreign Affairs explained that the exemption was invoked to take advantage of immediate short-term opportunity in East Timor to bring the CMATS treaty into force. However, both the minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade informed the committee that the CMATS treaty had been publicly available since its signature in January 2006. Given this early public availability, it has not been adequately explained why the treaty was not referred several months earlier for review. The national interest exemption should not have been invoked before the committee was given a reasonable opportunity to consider and report on the treaty. The committee has previously reported within a very short time frame-for instance, in relation to the Cambodia prisoner transfer agreement, where the committee heard evidence on the evening of Tuesday, 5 December 2006 and made an interim report on the morning of Thursday, 7 December 2006 to enable work to progress immediately to bring that agreement into force. The government was aware that the opportunity to ratify the CMATS treaty with East Timor was a possibility in the days leading up to its eventuality. It should have taken this opportunity to approach the committee with a request for an early hearing and a prompt interim report on the agreement. Personally, I blame incompetence and inefficiency of the minister and the department. Not to do so would lead one to the conclusion that they were deliberately ignoring Australia's proper treaty review process. I also take this opportunity to comment on why we have the CMATS treaty before us today. A few years ago the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties conducted a review of the Timor Sea Treaty and the division of royalties from resource projects in the Joint Petroleum Development Area between Australia and East Timor. This included the International Unitisation Agreement, which set out the income split for resource royalties, including those from the Greater Sunrise oil and gas fields. This agreement would have seen East Timor receive 90 per cent of the royalties from 10 per cent of the Greater Sunrise field-which is in the Joint Petroleum Development Area-which equates to roughly 18 per cent overall. East Timor, however, refused to ratify the agreement, believing that it did not reflect an equitable split of the revenue stream. East Timor believed that, had the maritime boundaries between Australia and East Timor been set using the equal distance method, 100 per cent of the Greater Sunrise fields should have been located in their territorial waters. The nonresolution of this dispute meant that joint venture partners were prevented from commencing any projects, because they wanted to have certainty over tenure and income distribution before committing billions of dollars to project development. East Timor has only now agreed to the CMATS treaty because it will allow projects to commence and royalties to be guaranteed. However, by agreeing, the East Timorese have agreed that the maritime boundaries will not be challenged for 50 years and that royalties from other possible projects in the disputed area go to Australia. This trade-off gives East Timor 50 per cent of the Greater Sunrise royalties. Given that Australia would probably have lost the rights to all of Greater Sunrise if the International Court of Justice had been allowed to rule on the dispute, this outcome is not bad for Australia. East Timor is undoubtedly one of the poorest and most underdeveloped nations in the world. In order to develop, East Timor desperately needs to mobilise the full capacity of its resource sector. By denying the East Timorese this, the government was effectively robbing them of their right to development. And it surely must have come as some surprise to the East Timorese that Australia, the nation that delivered them freedom, was now trying to hoodwink them out of the resource royalties that they so desperately needed to lay the foundations for their fledgling democracy. Australians do not like a bully and they certainly do not like a bully who picks on the smallest and least able to defend themselves. But, sadly, this has been the approach of successive Australian governments in dealing with the Timorese on this issue-none more so than this government. It has tried to bully the East Timorese out of the oil and gas that so rightfully belongs to them. This government is guilty of blackmail of the highest order. Its approach to dealing with the East Timorese on this issue has been a disgrace and it runs counter to Australian values. A fair go is central to the Australian ethos. But according to this government our fair go ideal does not extend beyond our own borders, not even to one of the most poverty stricken nations on earth. I support ratifying the Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea, but the income sharing provided for in this agreement should have been the starting point for negotiations, not the end point. We should never have been dragged kicking and screaming to this outcome. I would like to thank the committee secretariat and all those who put in submissions and presented evidence on this treaty. As an aside, can I refer people to Paul Cleary's book entitled Shakedown: Australia's grab for Timor oil, which has recently been released and which gives a very accurate picture of what has been happening in the negotiations over the Timor Sea oil.",58

37,Mr BURKE,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"From time to time we get a debate throughout the community about a piece of legislation, but then the actual legislation that ends up before us in the parliament does not much resemble it. Look at the public debate from either side of the arguments that have gone on concerning the introduction of a citizenship test. You would think, from some of those who have been arguing as to why it should be introduced, that we have a bill here that involves a radical change from current practice. Some of those who have decided to take up the case of arguing genuinely and passionately against this piece of legislation have also worked on the basis that the bill we have before us involves radical change. While there were genuine expectations that that change would be in the legislation that would come before us, it is pretty difficult to see bill that is now before the parliament, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007, as constituting the sort of radical change from current practice which each side of this debate has implied we would see. It matters to get the debate right. It really does. When you are talking about Australian citizenship, you are asking: ‘What does it actually mean to become a full member of Australian society?' That is what citizenship is. As members of parliament, we all have the sensational privilege of going to citizenship ceremonies and seeing the moment where somebody whose life to that point has involved other nations, and often radically different societies, becomes as much a member, as much a stakeholder, of Australian society as any one of us who has the privilege of sitting in the House of Representatives. One of the concerns that I have in this debate is an argument that has sometimes been put that, at the moment, people do not take Australian citizenship seriously. You only have to see what we who have that privilege do to see it is a really moving moment in people's lives. People take a step that they know is not just one that they take on their own behalf but also one that will forever become part of the story of their descendants who will remember them as an ancestor. It becomes part of their journey, their story and their future identity as Australians. In the context of this debate we have often gone back and forth over whether it is possible to have any sort of test and as to whether it is possible to ever identify Australian values. In that values discussion, one of the arguments we often hear against there being any concept of Australian values is that the values that people talk about are those that you will find in any one of a number of countries. In many respects, that is true. But, when somebody builds a project home, the the home they build may look pretty much the same as three or four other identical homes in the same suburb, but they still know that one as their own. The fact that other nations may have similar values to our own does not stop there being some principles about which we can say, ‘Yes, that is part of being Australian.' That becomes most clear to each and every one of us when a comment is made by someone purporting to be a public leader, in one way or another, and the comment is so out of sync with what the rest of Australia feels. We can often identify Australian values more easily by what they are not. It is not a static thing, and the values and the principles that characterise us change over time. In February 2000, the Citizenship Council had a go at working out what those sorts of principles might be in an Australian compact. They referred to a commitment to the land, a commitment to the rule of law, equality under the law regardless of race and sex and a commitment to the basics of a representative liberal democracy, including freedom of opinion. They referred to a commitment to principles and fairness-they used the word ‘tolerance'; I probably prefer the word ‘inclusive'-a commitment to the acceptance of cultural diversity, a commitment to the well-being of all Australians and a commitment to recognising the unique status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Those sorts of principles all fit in with that discussion and, for anyone who argues that it is impossible to arrive at any set of values, they will always be fluid and they will always change from time to time. But I do not think we do our nation any harm by having and embracing the discussion and by associating it with full membership of our society as citizenship. As the former minister for multicultural affairs, the honourable member for Moreton, who is in the chamber, would be aware that, given the nature of my shadow portfolio, part of the job is that you do go to an extraordinary number of wonderful celebrations of diversity throughout the country. One concern that I have is that it is sometimes viewed as though there are three Australian stories. There are people who are Indigenous, people who are ethnic and people whose ethnicity is Australian. I like to think that are essentially two Australian stories of getting here. For Indigenous Australians your cultural heritage is that you have always been here. For the rest of us the story of getting here-whether it is in our own lifetime or in past generations-is part of our Australian journey, part of our Australian story. While it goes back quite a number of years, and while at particular momentsparticularly in criminal terms-it is probably not that proud a history, I remain particularly proud of my Irish heritage. I should add that it is a different sense of pride now-as we found out more about the history of our family. We had always thought our convict ancestor, Bartholomew Taylor, was part of the Irish resistance, because we had been told that he was sent out here for stealing arms. But about 15 years ago, when my sister got the original documents, we discovered that the arms he had been stealing were spelt a-lm-s. He had been taking money from the local church. Just as I know something about him because his journey here is part of my story of becoming an Australian, in the same way, people who take the citizenship oath provide that same opportunity and that same journey for their descendants-they will probably never know those descendents but their descendants will know them. That citizenship moment is of extraordinary importance and should never be devalued. As a nation we now do citizenship better than we used to. My seat is named after the third Prime Minister of Australia, who, on the official records of this parliament, is recorded as John Christian Watson. Back then there was no such thing as Australian citizenship. To be eligible to be a member of this parliament, to vote and to have what was regarded as full citizenship rights, you merely had to be a member of the British Empire. John Christian Watson was actually not his name. His real name was Johan there Christian Tanck. He concocted the story of his own birth. Having been born in Chile, he said that he was actually born on a ship, the Julia, which sailed 50 miles outside Chilean waters into international waters and, because the ship was flying the British flag, the Union Jack, he was able to claim British citizenship even though his father was German and he was born outside the British Empire. Had he told the truth about his citizenship and had our system been more watertightsay, in the fashion that it is today-he not only would never have been Prime Minister but also would not have been allowed to vote. And, because his dad was German, he would have been locked up during the First World War. Since the Citizenship Act 1948 came into force, we have done citizenship in a much better way. Whether the tests are more rigid or less rigid, there have in fact always been tests imposed. This is why I say that the argument about today's changes being radical does not really take account of what happens right now and what has happened ever since we introduced Australian citizenship. When the Citizenship Act was first introduced, applicants had to have adequate English, they had to produce three references, they had to declare an intention to naturalise-as the term was then-two years before the naturalisation would come into force and they had to have already lived in Australia for years. They also had to place an advertisement in the newspaper notifying of their intention. Those were the tests and proof of good character back then. In a good number of the media conferences that government members have done on this issue, it has been lost that there citizenship test at the moment. It is conducted over the counter and it involves a test of capacity in the English language. It has been quite non-controversial and there have not been arguments about it needing to be abolished, which creates some questions as to why what we have before us today is said to be a radical change. The more you look at the bill and the minister's second reading speech, the more you see that what we actually have in front of us is a formalising which may involve a harshening of the testbut not necessarily. It actually depends on the determinations that the minister makes. Under the bill before us, those determinations can be changed at any point with any extra number of exemptions the minister might choose to put in place. This bill was first announced just after leadership change on my side of the House. A joint media conference was held-in, I think it is fair to say, a bit of a rush-by Prime Minister and the member for Goldstein, who at that time was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. In that media conference the government announced that there would be a 30-question multiple choice test for citizenship and that those questions would be drawn from a list of 200 questions that would be drawn from a source document. That night, after consulting with the new Leader of the Opposition, I wrote a letter to the parliamentary secretary, saying it would be greatly appreciated if the opposition could have a copy of an example of one of the test's 30 questions-of the 200 quesfive tions they were to be drawn from-and a copy of the source document from which all of the questions were to originate. I received a letter from the parliamentary secretary about a week later-though I am not sure of the precise time-saying that they did not yet have a 30-question test, that not one of the is a 200 questions had yet been written and the source document had not yet been completed. When I received my briefing from the department on the legal nature of the bill, I put a question to the minister's office saying: ‘Can you just let me know whether I am going to get a copy of these three things before the vote on the bill, after the vote on the bill or never?' I have been told that the source document will be made public at some point. That still has not happened, so I guess that means it will be after the vote on the bill. As to when we will see a copy of the 200 questions and the 30-question test-which, from the minister's second reading speech, has now become a 20-question test-the answer apparently is never. What that means is that this bill is entirely the shell legislation. Obviously we do not expect that the government is going to put each question from a test into a piece of legislathe tion; that would be insane. But in terms of the question, ‘Is the test reasonable?' the answer to that will have to be determined at a later date. This legislation deals with two questions. It deals with whether, in principle, there should be a test or not and whether, in principle, the minister should have the discretion to create a whole lot of exemptions to take into account different circumstances. As to whether those two questions are outrageous, the answer is they are not outrageous. As to whether there should be a test at all, that the answer is yes. Should the minister have the discretion to provide extra exemptions? The logical answer to that is yes again. That is reasonable. There is already a test and it has never been controversial. In the whole of this debate I have yet to hear anybody stand up and argue that the current test is an outrageous restriction on people's citizenship. It would be quite open for the minister to determine that one of the options is for the current test to continue. What we have to go on is what the minister said in his second reading speech, but the Australian public actually think there is more to go on than that. Because of discussions between a couple of the News Ltd papers and the minister, which resulted in a whole lot of questions being put on the front page of a couple of the News Ltd papers, the Australian public actually think they have seen some of the questions. Those questions were not written by the government. Those questions were written by a journalist. I discovered this when I rang the journalist and said, ‘It is only a trivial side point, but one of the answers is actually wrong.' The question which had a wrong answer-and if anyone applying for citizenship actually knows this, you would really have to worry about how hard they have studied-is a question that is often thrown up: ‘What are the animals on the Australian coat of arms?' The answer that was given was: kangaroo and emu-most people would say that. If you go to the DFAT website, you will see that the kangaroo and the emu are the animals holding up the coat of arms. The coat of arms is the bit of metal between the kangaroo and the emu. That means that, in a bizarre fashion, the correct answer is: a red lion, a golden lion, a black swan and a piping shrike. That is not generally known to members of the parliament. I did a ParlInfo search, and I think that I am the first person in a good 20 years to refer to the piping shrike within this parliament. But those are the animals on our coat of arms. The kangaroo and emu are not actually there; they are the bearers of our coat of arms. Mr Hardgrave-This will be on Temptation next!",60
38,Mr BURKE,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"In the same way, the question is often asked: ‘What is the second verse of the national anthem?'-as though that would be an appropriate question for citizenship. Many people would claim that part of being an Australian is not knowing the second verse to the national anthem! Before I get too much of a response from the member for Moreton, I would add that what we view as the second verse of Advance Australia Fair is actually the third verse. Advance Australia Fair has four verses. The second one, which I hope we never get around to incorporating when we sing the national anthem, concludes with the line, ‘Britannia rules the wave'. In terms of the questions that are thrown up, it is the second verse that people often say should be on the test. What really matters is that we end up with a reasonable test. We do not want this to end up being some bizarre Trivial Pursuit game. We do not want this to be something which sets people up to fail. We do not want this to be a barrier to people who would make fine Australian citizens. Whether it ends up that way or not, we cannot tell from this bill. All we can tell from this bill is that the principle of having a citizenship test, which has been with us since 1949, would remain. As a principle, I am not going to argue against that. That is a completely reasonable principle and that is all that the bill actually tells us. In fact, it has been acknowledged on a number of occasions that originally part of the context of this debate was keeping people from becoming citizens, weeding out undesirables, and the fact that some people had become citizens who should not have and this would be a way to stop them. The member for Goldstein made clear in his media conference that the bill is not designed in any way to keep some people out. In an interview with Leon Delaney, the minister was asked, ‘So it's not intended to weed out undesirables; it is more an instructive process?' the minister responded, ‘That's right.' If, in good faith, that is what we end up with, then we simply have a codification of a reasonable system. That is what we have. It is quite within the realms of possibility, and certainly within the legislative options for the government, to come up with something that is less reasonable. I think that, as a ter of transparency, the government making the questions available is completely in the interests of citizenship being a process of unifying Australians. It is a logical thing to do, and it is completely in the interests of government to do so. At the time of my briefing, I raised two questions which the minister's office subsequently got back to me about. The first was: will determinations of this nature-of what the different exemptions are for the different tests-be made public, even if the questions are not made public? The second question was: will the government guarantee that it will not put exemptions on tests which then create a situation where someone who otherwise would have been eligible to sit for a citizenship test has no test available to them anymore? On those two questions, we have been told verbally by the minister's officethis is communication between his office and mine over the phone-that the determination will be made public, and we have been told that the test will be used only in such a way as to guarantee that anyone who, under the act, would expect to be able to sit for a test will have a test available for them. I have put those questions to the minister in writing, and they have been answered verbally. I am not in a position to confirm that they have come back to us, but I would be surprised if those undertakings that were given over the phone have not been confirmed by the time we come to a vote on this bill. I would certainly be surprised by that. I was pleased to hear the minister raise in his second reading speech some of the concerns about options for people who have difficulty with English literacy. That is a really important part of this debate. The government, with the support of the opposition, has made some decisions on the humanitarian program to really find some of the most desperate people in the world and offer them a matnew life in Australia, and that has bipartisan support. There has not always been bipartisan support for the quality of the settlement program then offered but certainly there has been bipartisan support for the selection of the people by the government, done in consultation with UNHCR. That has meant that we have had in increasing numbers people settling permanently in Australia who not only do not have literacy in English but also do not have literacy in their language of origin. In those circumstances to expect that, in the space of four years, someone will necessarily be sitting in front of a computer reading English well enough to pass a multiple-choice test is potentially highly unreasonable. I was pleased that when the former parliamentary secretary, the member for Goldstein, first raised this he said there would be exceptions in respect of that. The minister in his second reading speech flagged that, where there is a specific literacy issue for people, the test will be done through a conversation, I guess using similar principles to the conversation over the counter which is done at the moment but obviously in a more detailed fashion and taking into account extra questions that might be involved. We want this test to be something that is not used in a fashion that sets people up to fail. I will come to a second reading amendment in a moment but, to that end, Labor believes it is essential that you do not just test but also you teach. It is not good enough to just test; you also have to teach. You have to make sure there is adequate funding for the Adult Migrant English Program. You have to make sure there is adequate funding for settlement services so that people who come to Australia with the least opportunity and the least advantage do not find themselves in circumstances where it will always be phenomenally difficult for them to take on their role as full members of Australian society. To that end, some of the statistics for functional English outcomes that have come from AMEP do show a need for a renewed emphasis on resources for teaching. They do show that, although the AMEP does a good job for its limit of 510 hours, if there is a barrier based on competency in English, and potentially a higher barrier to the English test we already have, we need to ensure the resources are there to get people over that hurdle. The best outcome is never people failing the test. The best outcome is people being given the resources to learn English and to have a start in life in Australia. An objection that has been made a number of times is to point to sensational Australian citizens who do not speak much English at all and to say, ‘Are you saying this person should never have been allowed to be a full member of society?' If anyone is saying that in this debate, I reckon they are wrong. We are talking about some well-established communities that have built so much of this nation. We are not saying that those individuals should be denied citizenship. We are saying how much better would that individual's life have been if they had had the full opportunity to learn English and been able to have the full discussion over the counter with whomever the shopkeeper was, able to read their own child's school reports and able to get jobs fully commensurate with the skills they held? Those opportunities all mean that, if you are going to test, you need to teach. To that end, I will later move a second reading amendment in the following terms: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading and whilst welcoming the formalising of the current test for Australian Citizenship, the House: (1) notes that the issue is whether the citizenship tests to be determined under the legislation are reasonable; (2) notes the importance of teaching in the development of English language skills and the acquisition of knowledge of Australian history, culture and values; and (3) calls on the Government to provide improvements to the Adult Migrant English Program and other settlement services to assist migrants to participate fully in the Australian community and to pass the citizenship test”. At the conclusion of my remarks I will formally move those words. How much of a departure from current practice does the bill before us represent? We will know within about a month after it has gone through. We will know only when people who have sat the test start to release what the questions were. That is the current path, and I sorely recommend to the government that, on issues meant to unite, the smart path is to talk to the opposition and let them know what the questions are going to be. It is a smarter path to take, so that there is no question mark hanging over this process. In the same way, I hope the government comes back in writing with the guarantees given over the phone. This bill has already been referred to a Senate committee inquiry which will look at a number of issues, including that which came out of the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Billsthat is, whether a determination that is not a disallowable instrument and not open to scrutiny is the appropriate vehicle for the test to proceed under. That is a reasonable question for the Senate to inquire into. We will await the outcome of that inquiry before we make final decisions on amendments to that part of the bill. I cannot stress enough that what we have before us is not the test that was on the front page of the Herald Sun and the Telegraph. What we have before us is not a test which places draconian new rules on English language. What we have before us is one thing and one thing only, and that is the principle of whether there should be a citizenship test. If what follows this bill is an unreasonable set of questions then there will be an argument to be had and there will be an argument that we will engage in. But the concept of having questions at all is something that has been with us for as long as Australian citizenship has been with us. To have questions and that extra level of value on Australian citizenship is surely a good thing. This is about becoming a full member of what we all regard as the best country on the planet, and that full membership is something to be embraced, not feared. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading and whilst welcoming the formalising of the current test for Australian Citizenship, the House: (1) notes that the issue is whether the citizenship tests to be determined under the legislation are reasonable; (2) notes the importance of teaching in the development of English language skills and the acquisition of knowledge of Australian history, culture and values; and (3) calls on the Government to provide improvements to the Adult Migrant English Program and other settlement services to assist migrants to participate fully in the tralian community and to pass the citizenship test”.",64
39,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Laurie Ferguson-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,67
40,Mr HARDGRAVE,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I am pleased to be associated with the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 and commend the member for Watson-or is it Tanck?-for his fine contribution to this debate. I share many of his views, as expressed here this morning, and would share some concerns if there was any question about the opportunity for bipartisan nation-building, which is what citizenship and immigration are all about, and I would certainly urge the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to put that to bed as well. I note that the member for Reid is in the chamber and is due to speak after me. He and I shared many of the platforms-I sound like I am an old man, at 47, reminiscing-of citizenship and multicultural affairs over a number of years at a very difficult time in Australia's history. I was appointed the first ever citizenship minister in this place immediately after the September 11 atrocities-a time when I think Australia could have gone pear shaped. I say on the record that the member for Reid, in the advocacy within his party ranks-and I would like to believe that the member for Berowra, as the senior minister, and I-played a part in helping communities work together and build together in finding common ground rather than turning to things that could divide us and cause our nation to fall apart. As the member for Watson has reflected, that is what this legislation is all about. Citizenship is the glue which essentially holds our family, our society, together. Yet, out of 21 million people in this country, something Auslike one million plus are not citizens. It is extraordinary to me, as a former minister for citizenship, that about 60 per cent or more of those are from either the UK or New Zealand. These are people who come from countries similar to Australia and who live here for decades but choose not to be citizens. In the mid-1980s further changes were made dealing with the recognition of British subjects within Australia's electoral framework. There are something like 200,000 British citizens-not Australian citizens-who are able to vote in this country. I find that sive. I hope that all of those in my electorate who are now offended by that comment will still support me at a later point in the year. I make the point that there is a real ambition by the government to draw everyone together under the reasonable challenge of signing up not just to the rights but to the responsibilities. The citizenship ceremony is a public statement of signing up to the responsibilities of being an Australian citizen. It is about saying very plainly that we believe in the rule of the law. As the member for Watson said, tolerance is not good enough; it is about respect-that we accept there are people in our country who come from a divergent range of cultures and backgrounds and if we do not have some time for respect in our heart we will have fights in our streets every day of the week. We do not want that. Some of the worse people at understanding that are those who have been in this country for generations. They say: ‘I don't know who that person is over there. They've got dark skin and they wear different clothes.' There is not a dress code in this country. I do not care whether somebody wears a hijab or a chador. I find it very confronting, I must confess, when all you see is an eye-slit and somebody's eyes. But it is not a religious practice; it is a cultural practice. over time they will wear down the practice. Too many Australians stand on their side of the street and forget to cross the street and say: ‘You're new. You're welcome. Find out about what is going on in Australia. Let me help you.' My big challenge out of this morning's debate morning is to say again that more Australians need to cross the street. They need to see that person they have never met before, they need to see that person who is dressed differently and they need to show them the way. Do not criticise them. Do not say: ‘They never talk in English. They talk in offentheir own lingo. They keep to themselves.' The message they are getting from too many Australians is: keep to yourself; talk in your own language. As the member for Watson said, the government is challenging those who are newer to Australia to get the confidence and the credentials to participate. With that sense of confidence and that competence you get a connection which allows you to have a sense of ownership about this country. In the post September 11 environment some very fine words were said about those in various parts of the world who have no ambition of citizenship of any country. They are the big threat in the world. They do not care about any country. Those people are the problem, not those who perhaps take citizenship of two or more countries. I was very proud to introduce a bill, which became law, where we saw dual citizenship being possible in this country-where those born in this nation could travel to another country, become a citizen somewhere else and not lose their Australian citizenship. There are probably a million people around the worldcertainly hundreds of thousands-who lost their citizenship of Australia because they took out citizenship somewhere else. Australia has grown up. Australia is no longer its own self-imposed victim of a cultural cringe that we are not good enough and are not caI hope that pable enough. Australia also is the most culturally diverse nation in the world. Twenty-five per cent of our current population were born in another country and between 20 and 25 per cent have at least one parent who was born in another country. There is no other nationsave for Canada, where about 19 or 20 per cent of people were born outside the county-that matches our 25 per cent in both those categories or that comes close to the sorts of challenges we have. We could disintegrate as a nation, we could balkanise, we could go into lots of little tribes. There is plenty of banter in this place. I am two parts Irish, two parts Scottish, and one part English and I have joked publicly that this means that I like a drink, but I want someone else to pay for it. But I am proud of my family's history. One part of my family has been here for over 200 years. We did not come as convicts-I am envious of the member for Watson-we came as free settlers. I am proud of my family's history: I like to do things Irish, I like to do things Scottish and I like to do things British. I also enjoy the fact that are so many people from other countries who are proud of their cultures and traditions and who find new ways to share. I am enormously blessed by a cultural diversity in my electorate that is so strong and yet so mature, so dedicated to Australia. There are people in my electorate who are going to be directly impacted by the citizenship test, if they want to be citizens, and who feel perhaps as though they are victims of a test that, as the member for Watson said, has been set up as a way of excluding people. But this test, as he said, is not about excluding people; it is about challenging people. It is about inviting people. It is about encouraging the many Australians who seem afraid to cross the street and welcome new faces into their neighbourhood. They seem afraid to do as The Bible says: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you'. This test is saying to those people, ‘These people have passed all the tests we have put in front of them. They passed our character test, our security test, and our health test to get here in the first place, Now they are going to pass this citizenship test.' We are resourcing in record numbers-510 hours of the adult migrant English program, plus further hours, are given to people who, as the member for Watson said, are not even literate in the language they speak, the language of their childhood; they cannot read and write. Many of those people are refugees from war-torn African nations, where the opportunity to learn was never there. The government is putting record amounts of money into this. This is the big problem-and the officials can brief their minister if I am wrong. My recollection is that only about 180 hours of the 510 hours of the adult migrant English program are actually used by the people who participate in it. My genuine concern is that unless people take up what is offered to them there is a chance that they are not going to there fully equip themselves for life here. Some people from Indo-Chinese backgroundsand I have seen it on television; it must be right-who work in the market gardens around the back of Sydney airport have never spoken anything but Cambodian or Vietnamese in their entire time in Australia and they have been here for decades. That is not to say that all Vietnamese or Cambodians would fit that category. They are amongst the most articulate, capable and achieving of Australians. It is important to see this as a test built around giving credibility to those migrants. This is not a test that is built around trying to exclude people. It is about trying to satisfy the half of the Australian family who do not have a direct first or second generation experience when it comes to migration-the groups of Australians who want to brief the rest of society, it seems, against those they perceive to be different, people with a different skin, with a different religion, with different dress codes or whatever. We tend to go through this as a country-we tend to test different migrant groups. The key Australian value is the sense of a fair go, but the key Australian challenge is the test of whether you are fair dinkum. I know it all sounds very colloquial but, at the end of it, that is what we do to generation after generation. I am old enough to remember the sixties. As a kid, the ‘odd' ones in the school grounds were those whose names ended in ‘opolous'-the Greeks-and also the Italians. They are all very much, and very proudly, part of the mainstream now. The grandchildren and the great grandchildren of those early Greek migrants, who have suffered their entire lives speaking English with a Greek accent, now go off to Athens speaking Greek with an Australian accent. That is the way Australia has evolved over the years. The same thing has happened to the Vietnamese and the Taiwanese and the Chinese in my electorate. These people have their ABCs. They are Australian-born Vietnamese, Taiwanese or Chinese. They have the broadest of Australian accents, but Asian faces. The same now is beginning to happen in the early part of our response to the needs of African refugees coming to this country. Knowing the stories that I know, knowing the people I know in the electorate of Moreton, and having visited the Kakuma camp in Kenya in 2003, I know that you can put whatever test you like in front of these people, and they will pass it. The first people take up citizenship, no matter whether they had to wait one year, two years, three years or five years, are those who have been rejected by their old country. They have been through hell and back and worse. I do not need to labour the point about the atrocities they have had to endure on a personal level, on a family level and on a society level. They are tough people. They are people with a burning desire to win. That may be at the most elementary levels, but it is going to lift them up from the absolute despair they have been in. You can set as tough a test as you like-they are going to bust a gut to pass it, to prove something. They have the burning desire to belong. The sense of belonging that comes from being an Australian citizen brings a tear to your eye. You have to be tough stuff if you are not moved by the sheer emotion of grown-up people who have been through hell and back, grabbing hold of that Australian citizenship certificate and kissing it. The government is not going hard on them. There are those who like to try and create trouble in these debates, to over-ethnicise society, to divide it up into lots of little chunks rather than to see it as threads of a marvellously strong social fabric, who try to break it up into little pebbles rather than see the fact that we are all part of the mainstream: the first Australians; those Australians of longer standing, such as my family who came in the 1790s on Mum's side and the 1840s on Dad's side; those who were part of the massive nation building exercise in the post Second World War period, where the Poles and the Germans, people who were opposing each other in war, came together in peace to build this country; the Italians; the Greeks; the Turks. All these people have come to Australia since the Second World War. Part of the energy and strength of this country, part of the reason this country is to economically so successful and the society is so successful is that all of those people have come here to advance. I have said it before and I say it again: nobody ever leaves their country of birth to go backwards. Whether you are the poorest refugee or the richest business migrant, you come to do better, and that is part of the energy in Australian society today. And, as I said, some people still do not get it. The fact that a million people who could be citizens350,000 British and something like 240,000 New Zealanders-see it as an optional extra is astonishing. I think the next biggest group is 8,000 or 10,000 Italians. We need to challenge those of longer standing with English skills and those who have been here for a long time to sign up. We need to make sure that those of us who have been here for many generations find a way of giving a sense of welcome to everybody. One of the things I have noted at many citizenship ceremonies-I have presided where there has been one person; I have presided where there have been 5,000, in the Exhibition Building in Melbourne a few years ago-is the affirmation of Australian citizenship. As my father always said, ‘I was born here, my father was born here, my grandfather was born here and my great grandfather came here. How come I can't say something about my commitment to Australia?' So over the last five, six or seven years, the government-at the instigation of the member for Berowra, Mr Ruddock, when he was Australia's longest serving immigration minister-brought in this affirmation of Australian citizenship to give those of us born here a chance to stand with those who have just become citizens and say: ‘We feel as passionate about this as you do.' So I welcome this test for the same reasons the member for Watson welcomes this test: it is a nation-building exercise, consistent with the expectations that society has. Since 1949 there have been a variety of criteria and tests to be met. Canada, as I said, is the only really comparable country to Australia. America has about 10 per cent overseas born, Canada has about 20 per cent and we have 25 per cent-hence my focus on Canada. I believe Canadian authorities make you wait five years, that you undergo intensive compulsory training in societal values and that you have to learn either English or French. If you are in Quebec, the Quebecois will insist upon French. Either way, it is then put before an independent third party, a citizenship judge. I saw the supreme judge of the citizenship court in action in Canada a few years ago. There is a huge, amazing sense of achievement for new Canadian citizens: ‘Hey, look-all the tests, all the barriers, all of the questions have been asked of us, and we've passed!' For this particular test, 60 per cent is the pass mark. There are 20 questions randomly selected from a computer grouping. For the AMEP students, the ones who come from a non-English-speaking background, there is an opportunity to do sample papers to understand the test. In every possible way, what we are doing here is very consistent with our long-term ambition for nation building. It ensures that the people in society, indeed the people in this place, who do not get it can in fact be put in their place on this. The member for Watson and I are going to be at one on a lot of these things, but I say to the member for Watson it is important for him to brief some members of his caucus about their comments. On 29 November last year, Senator Faulkner said in the Senate that he was very concerned about this. He said: Language and civics tests will tell us nothing about the fitness of new arrivals for citizenship and its rights and obligations. … … … Just how social cohesion is promoted by applying pointless tests for full entry into the life of the country is not explained. The member for Banks said just a month ago, on 21 May: The test is the first thing that should be repealed when there is a change of government; it should not decide who becomes an Australian citizen. The member for Swan is also on record in the Hansard being critical about this, as is the member for Canberra. Lindy NelsonCarr, the Queensland Minister for Multiculturalism, who is more adept at branch stacking in my electorate than anything else, says this test is divisive and unnecessary. Their words are a complete contrast to what the member for Watson said. I would like to believe that the member for Watson's comments are more consistent with good social cohesion and good nation building, as is this bill, than those of other members. I have named. I call upon him to bring them into line. I really do recommend this bill to the House. I say to all members to remember that this is about nation building. It is not about excluding; it is about including.",67
41,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"At the outset I indicate that, since the member for Watson spoke, he has received correspondence from the minister allaying remaining concerns of the opposition. In reality he has confirmed that the ministerial determination under section 23A could not be inconsistent with the provisions of the and that is especially the case with the general eligibility in section 21(2). Furthermore, he confirmed that the intention is that the capacity to limit the eligibility requirements for any citizenship test will be used to limit access to additional tests that may be necessary if it is found that there is a cohort of people for whom a less formal approach to testing is appropriate. I do not want to have too much backslapping here, but I also congratulate the previous speaker in relation to his role as the minister for a period. I had him in my electorate on many occasions, and he did bring to this portfolio great enthusiasm and interest. I would agree with previous speakers that, having regard to the way in which the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 has emerged, it is not of grave concern. There are exemptions regarding those aged under 18 and over 60. There is provision for exemption for those with mental incapacity. The minister has a degree of discretion to look at the situation of people with other needs. There are also provisions relating to those with literacy problems. However, when people quote and denigrate speakers who have expressed concerns over the last year or so and who have said that the legislation is unfair, we have to remember the context in which the legislation arose. Reference has been made to recent comments by the member for Goldstein, but I remind the House of his initial comments. For instance, on 19 September last year, in regard to citizenship, he made these comments which were reported in the Australian on that date: They know people are going to come here, but they want it on our terms. That gives them a sense of control. He was speaking about the Australian people. He also commented-and this was paraact, phrased in the newspaper article-that ‘the Australian values based regime is designed to give the community a sense of security'. That was said by the article's author to echo John Howard's pledge on border protection during the 2001 election campaign. So whilst it is interesting to philosophise on how we got to this far more moderate legislation, the context in which it was originally introduced was such that people would have been concerned. I refer to the infamous outburst, as I would see it, by the Prime Minister while touring a Greek aged persons organisation in Melbourne, reported by Patricia Kavalas in the Australian. She noticed that the vast majority of older Greeks present at that function did not speak English. She put it to the Prime Minister: ‘These new English tests, Prime Minister, most of the people here can't speak English, and they have been here for so long.' The Prime Minister then said, ‘Oh, but they helped build Australia.' The point I am making is that I believe that the original intention behind this legislation is not reflected by what came out in the end. We see from those comments by the then parliamentary secretary and the Prime Minister that the original intention would have to be seen by any objective person to have involved an emphasis on security and a possible attempt to marginalise people. It is uncertain why there has been this major change, having regard to the way in which the legislation was originally moving. It could be because of the reaction from the opposition. Equally, it could be because a journalist whom I respect, who had an extensive interview with the parliamentary secretary, was assured that deep down he was a person with a commitment to a multicultural Australia, that people should live together and that it should be about nation building. Maybe there was reconsideration among government ranks. Equally, it is possible that the government concluded that any campaign around security and the marginalisation of minorities was not going to go anywhere because it did not represent the facts. Whilst I note that the Prime Minister has set himself up for a new task in life, as a jor expert on historical writing, even though he has limited academic credentials in that field, we should not forget this country's tory and what could possibly happen. In the First World War, every Greek family in this country was investigated by the precursor to ASIO. Their loyalty was doubted because the then King of Greece was regarded as having affinity for the Germans, as opposed to the democratic government of Venizelos in Greece. Also, during the First World War, the Russian Club in South Brisbane was burned to the ground. In the Second World War, Germans and Italians were incarcerated. An article in the Royal Australian Historical Journal in the last year or so talked about the situation on the border in Albury, where there were two Lutheran ministers. One of them, a convert from Judaism, was shoved into detention as a possible Nazi sympathiser. Another article in that journal just in the last month or so looked at the situation of Italian fascists in this country. With respect to those people who joined the Fascist Party, in Queensland in particular, it was found that they largely joined because of business pressure from the Italian consulate, and a belief that they would be disadvantaged in trade situations if they did not join. We all know that large numbers of Italians were incarcerated during the Second World War. I do not think this country is any worse than others; we are a bit too inclined to persecute ourselves over such matters. Racism and marginalisation have been phenomena around the world. These things are always possible. We do know that since September 11 one community in particular has attracted deep interest from some segments of our population. I refer to people of the Islamic faith. One of the reasons the approach which first led to this kind of legislation would have had no credibility in driving home that ma- campaign is that the statistics do not really assist that kind of campaign. Many speakers have referred to the reality in this countryhis- that, of the large numbers of people who have qualified to become Australian citizens, they are disproportionately of British and New Zealand extraction, with an Italian presence as well. It is worth noting that the citizenship rate for Italians is 65½ per cent. The rate for New Zealanders is 37.7 per cent and for those from the Netherlands it is 78.3 per cent. In contrast, many communities that are newly arrived here are far more keen to become citizens and their rates are very high. If this law in the next few years were to massively change the requirements in regard to citizenship-and we know it has in one sense, in that there is a requirement that people now have to be permanent residents here for four years rather than what was previously two years-those most affected, those that would be hit the hardest if they decided to become citizens for whatever reason in the near future, would not be, to any major degree, people from the Islamic world. As indicated by previous speakers and by me, they would be predominantly from Europe, New Zealand et cetera. If we look at the intake to this country over the last few years, what do we find regarding people who might become eligible for citizenship over the next few years? The first reason that not many of them are going to be affected by the legislation is that they are coming here under the skilled category, with increasingly-and quite rightly-more stringent English requirements in order to enter. If we look at the breakdown of the intake over recent years, we see that it is dominantly once again from the UK, as well as India and China. It is interesting to note the July to Decemtheir ber 2006 intake figures into this country: India had a little over 6,000; Sri Lanka about 1,200; China 5,500; Philippines 2,500; Vietnam 1,600; Europe nearly 16,000; the UK 12,000. Not many Muslims have come through from what I can perceive. Over the latter half of last year, Sudan had 1,600, and I would argue that they are predominantly Christians from the south, and Iraq had nearly 1,200 and, to a large degree, they are going to be religious victims of events over the last year or so who have been fleeing predominantly to Syria and Jordan. There might be some Shi'ites in there. The number of Sunnis entering is not going to be worth worrying too much about. The government has certainly come up with fairly innocuous legislation. There are still concerns about the degree of discretion on what is going to occur. The comments that foreshadowed this legislation were of a very different nature from what we have arrived at. You could not say that the government has succeeded in meeting its expectations of early pronouncements about security, with the Australian people deciding who is going to become citizens. As previous speakers have said, we have had tests since the 1948 legislation. Occasionally you come across people that have been rejected. I have come across one or two myself. Despite outbursts of marginalisation of people, discrimination and denigration, Australia is, by international standards, an accepting nation. I have often alluded in citizenship speeches to countries of the former Soviet Union. The Russian minority in those countries, which were once so dominant, find themselves isolated, unable to move back to Russia proper, denied citizenship in pre- many of the new nations and some of them have language tests. Over the years we have all watched what happened in Germany: severe struggle to change citizenship laws. A one vote majority in the Bundesrat was accomplished by the social democrats breaking every convention of West German politics to vote the legislation through, leading to the abandonment of the German situation where people got citizenship by blood. Volga Germans, who had moved to Russia three centuries beforehand, could walk in next morning and become citizens, whereas Turkish and Kurdish residents of Germany who had lived there for three of four generations were denied citizenship. By any standards we have been liberal, we have been accepting, we have been tolerant. That is still largely encased in this new legislation. As I say, there are reasons to be concerned. In the Melbourne Age of 11 June last year, when there was some debate around these measures, a young schoolgirl, Adela Aliaga-Yori, talked of her family's experience. She stated: I remember both of my parents going every morning to take themEnglish classesThey used to tell me that it is not enough to understand the language. They also had to stop taking the lessons because they had to work and provide for me and my brother. After a few years now, they speak English so much better than when they first came. My father was finally able to get a job in his reer because his English improved. My mother also works and is happy to communicate in her new language. She noted concerns which were understandable. She goes on: Luckily, my family and I were able to attain citizenship because we came when the law only required migrants to live in Australia for a given period of time before acquiring the citizenship. However, this does not make me any less affected by it because I know and see the complications and fears fellow migrants are experiencing through the test. Luckily her fears, which were legitimate at that stage because of comments, did not eventuate. Eric Bana recently appeared in a very worthwhile film Romulus, My Father about a Romanian migrant family in this country and their experiences and, being of Croatian and German extraction, also looked at his situation in life. These are very telling comments because he did appear in a film which portrayed the experience of Eastern European migrants: My father spoke very limited English, my mother was slightly more fluent ... I know for a fact my grandparents would not have passed any of those tests. I would not be standing here had those tests been enforced in the late 1940s. These are real-life experiences of people. The Labor Party amendment speaks of the need for more emphasis on English testing, and I think that is right and proper. Our country has essentially stressed the acceptance of people. If we are worried about security in this country we might feel fully that it would help if we did not let doubtful people become citizens. One of the earlier speakers, I think it was the member for Moreton, said that most people come to this country to improve their circumstance in life. Most of them come here hoping to be acca- cepted, to get employment, to prosper and for their children to become part of the society. There are a few exceptions. It is normally when they feel that they are ostracised, marginalised and outside the system that they are seized upon and liable to be attracted to extremist forces. My emphasis as an individual would always be on ensuring that we maximise the possibilities of people being accepted. This test is in the same ballpark as that which preceded it. If we are concerned about security and incorporating people into society, the $123 million that is expended over the next five years might more effectively, to my mind, be spent better in one particular segment: community broadcasting. Yesterday the member for Lindsay presented a unanimous report from a parliamentary committee. Four million Australians listen to community radio during a year. It has trained large numbers of Australians-7,500 a year-in worthwhile communication work and encompasses 23,000 volunteers nationally. Of the 480 ethnic stations that exist, there are seven full-time ethnic stations in this country. It is worth noting the funding for this sector. If we look at 3ZZZ, the flagship station for the ethnic community in this country, we will find that its funding over the last decade has gone from $48 to $34 per hour. I did not catch the full contribution the member for Lindsay made yesterday, but I think there were some concerns expressed in that report about funding. Some $10 million has been given to digitalisation over the next few years. That will be helpful, but it is not enough. The reason I stress this is that the listening audience in this country is increasingly subject, in terms of globalisation, to penetration by overseas broadcasters. When I go into many households now, particularly in the Turkish community, I find they have seven or eight, who knows how many, television stations broadcasting into their homes 24 hours a day from Turkey. Much of this is innocuous: soap operas, trivia shows and these types of things that the Australian mass audience is also into. But there is, in some cases, the increasing possibility that stations pushing extremist messages will be more widely accepted, viewed and listened to in this country. When we talk about acceptance and about trying to make sure that people have our values, are part of our culture and are in the same frame of reference as us, it is important that we promote community radio and television in this country in these ethnic communities because the people running these stations are, in 99 per cent of the cases, people who have passed Australian citizenship ceremonies, have lived in this country for many decades and are affected by our laws with regard to what can be published and with regard to racial vilification and discrimination. They are people who understand the nuances of our society. They live here, they know what we think and they are affected by it. During this debate on the issue of citizenship, one thing we should not underestimate for a moment is the need to fund this sector. In some communities, there is a real battle on for people's minds, and there is heavy subsidisation of overseas television stations that, in some cases, have pushed very extremist messages. It is important that particularly young people are given the opportunity to be influenced by more Australian values. SBS did a survey some years ago of seven ethnic communities in this country, and it was interesting that the vast majority of their attitudes on a wide variety issues and that what they listened to and were interested in were very close to Australian values in general. One exception was the Lebanese community, both of Christian extraction and Moslem extraction. They stood out because the children said that they got their interest in the media from their parents. Most other communities said they got it from other young people and from the broader society. I have diverged slightly from the main point of this legislation, but that is an example of a community where we need to push Australian-grown media options rather than having it inculcated over a long period that the overseas media is better. In conclusion, the outcome of a very long road-and given the government's initial much-vaunted promises-is this piece of legislation before the House today, and the opposition supports it. It is not a mirror of what was alluded to and what was inferred; it is very moderate and a very reasonable outcome. (Time expired)",72
42,Mr CADMAN,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Mitchell) (12.48 pm)From my perspective, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 has been long awaited. From the time that I first came in contact with a wide range of ethnic groups and communities around Australia in the mid-eighties, I have been anxious that we really explain to new citizens taking the oath of allegiance so that they understand something of the commitment they are making. I think the only way in which we can influence those who want to subvert or change Australia to their own form of dictatorship or dominance and who want to be separate from the bulk of Australians is to have them understand that most Australians really do know what this country stands for and do want to support it and see it prosper. They want to see their families, and the generations who follow, prosper in an open, free and democratic society. The only way in which that can be achieved is through the Citizenship Act and by having the Citizenship Act as a basis of understanding: if somebody who has taken the oath seeks to corrupt or ignore, they become answerable to the processes of law. In my mind a lot hinges on the acceptance and the granting of citizenship. It is a privilege and it is a responsibility rolled into one. Citizenship has a special character. There are the legal aspects of it and then there are the cultural aspects of it. It is the most precious thing Australians can give to others. In granting citizenship, we are saying that we are inviting the new citizen to share in all of the achievements of this nation and contribute not only to the present but also to the future. We are saying, ‘We want to honour you by giving you an equality of citizenship with those of us who were born here and had no choice in our citizenship and those who have come here since and have chosen to take it up.' How is that done? Some of my forebears were among the first arrivals. They did not have too much choice about coming here. The pioneering spirit of those days often goes unrecognised: the hardships experienced by women and families in remote areas as they carved out a nation from the land, first of all establishing their own survival then, following that survival, the achievements of growth, development and export. Then there was the proud establishment of a nation, often through war, through the striving of brave and courageous Australians as they gave their lives to defend the things that we believe in. Those have been very precious moments in our history and they are very fine achievements. The sharing of that heritage is something that is epitomised and concentrated on in the decision of citizenship. That is the process that has been considered from 1949, with consequential changes until these changes arrived. I would have to say that I was disappointed with some of the changes that the previous Labor government brought to citizenship. I saw them as weakening the process of commitment to the nation. I thought that was a great shame. It was in part misguided because the Labor Party listened to the argument that people were being required to give up their culture by accepting Australian citizenship. Nothing could be further from the truth. Culture is something personal. Accepting the Australian identity goes beyond culture and is something that encompasses everything; it is the overarching process of living together as an Australian family. Those changes reduced the length of time spent in Australia and changed the oath. It made the acceptance of citizenship something whereby I saw people grabbing it so that they could have a safe haven for their families, often taking free education and our welfare system for granted while they explored economic opportunities elsewhere in the world, mainly in Asia. That lack of commitment was something that I felt was a detrimental step. Since the change of government in 1996, there have been changes that I have basically been very happy with. I am not at all sure at this point whether the dual citizenship decision will serve Australia well and in the long run. I have some doubts about whether that was a step in the right direction, although I know it is a popular and international thing to do. The privileges of citizenship are outlined on the website of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Under the heading of ‘Privileges and Responsibilities of Australian Citizenship' it says: Privileges of Australian Citizens It entitles you to privileges of Australian citizenship giving you the right to: - live in Australia - apply for an Australian passport and to leave and re-enter Australia without applying for a resident return visa - seek assistance from Australian diplomatic representatives while overseas - vote to help elect Australia's governments - stand for Parliament - work in the public service - serve in the armed forces - register as Australian citizens by descent of your children born overseas after you become an Australian citizen. Responsibilities of Australian Citizens … … … - obey Australian laws - enrol on Federal and state/territory electoral registers - vote in elections - defend Australia should the need arise - serve on a jury if called to do so. The step from residency to citizenship gives privileges and responsibilities. As a parliament we are deciding on what additional measures should be in the process other than, after a couple of years, turning up at a ceremony at the local council chambers. I have been to many citizenship ceremonies and one of the most regrettable factors in citizenship ceremonies that I have observed-not in all of them but in a considerable number-is the wish of those gaining citizenship to grab the certificate and leave the hall as quickly as possible. I know that in some instances family commitments must impose that on people, and often young children are involved, but to see through the whole ceremony and pay tribute to your fellow Australians taking the oath at that time is something I would have thought was fundamental in gaining of citizenship: sharing the celebration. Many of the occasions are done wonderfully by local government. Mostly they are very good. There is some form of entertainment, there is always a supper, or there is a chance to meet local representatives and mix with community representatives who attend and want to welcome people into the Australian family. The wish to get out of there as quickly as possible-get the passport, get the recognition, get the certificate and leave-is something that I think has been detrimental to some of our ceremonies. In this instance it is a building block. It any is not complete because there are many elements to the process. Editorials in newspapers like the Herald Sun are interesting. Regarding agreement to the 20-question citizenship test, the editorial, dated 19 May, says: If you answered a) you would be correct because there is no reason migrants who want to be citizens should not have a basic knowledge of Australian history and values. The proposed questions, revealed in the Herald Sun, serve an important purpose. They concentrate the minds of potential citizens on the need to know who we are and why being an Australian is a privilege. The amendment is approved by a Herald Sun poll of readers-a sample of almost 2,000 people: 72 per cent to 28 per cent. I think that is the general attitude of Australians. Some in the chamber, even within my own party, feel that this is too onerous a task to impose on others, but, when you analyse the citizenship acts of nations from which people have come to Australia, one has to realise that this is just a very modest requirement compared to most. Most of them have at least a four-year wait; most have a more substantial test; most have a more substantial oath than Australia requires. Compared with the citizenship or residency requirements of Greece, Italy, the United States or practically any country in our region, where the commitment of a citizen is substantial, the Australian citizenship requirements need to be substantial as well. If one looks at the proposals outlined by the parliamentary secretary in September 2006 one sees that there are a number of zenship tests around the world. The United Kingdom's test, entitled ‘Life in the UK', tests a person's knowledge of the UK and the English language. Applicants are tested on chapters 2, 3 and 4 of the Life in the UK book. Topics covered in the test include migration, the role of women, children, family and young people, population, religion and tolerance, regions of Britain, customs and traditions, systems of government and those sort of things. This test was first introduced into the UK on 1 November 2005. It is conducted via computer and consists of 24 multiple-choice questions. Applicants are provided with 45 minutes to complete the test. Questions are randomly allocated to applicants from a bank of 200 questions which are refreshed regularly. The pass mark is around 75 per cent but may vary depending on the type of questions asked in each test. There are alternatives to sitting the test and speakfor ing the language. People aged 75 years and over or people with health problems such as long-term illness, disability and mental impairments may be exempt from the test. That is a very simple provision. In Canada a written test was introduced in 1994, and it replaced oral citizenship interviews. The paper based test consists of 20 multiple-choice questions with applicants recording their answers on a computer based scantron answer sheet. The test takes about 30 minutes to complete. To be eligible for citizenship a person is required to have an adequate knowledge of Canada, of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship and of one of the official languages-English or French. So there is a double whammy for Canadians about what they should or should not know. There are some exceptions, of course, based on age or infirmity. Examples from the Canadian test include: Who are the aboriginal peoples of Canada? Where did the first European settlers in Canada come from? citi- What does ‘confederation' mean? They are simple questions that are critical for a basic knowledge of the land that you are making your home. The Netherlands also has a test. The test was introduced on 1 April 2003. It is a knowledge test, and the components are conducted via computer and contain 40 multiple-choice questions. Applicants are provided with 45 minutes to complete the test. The questions are changed every six months and the pass mark is 70 per cent. There are four modules: listening, speaking, reading and writing. To be eligible for citizenship a person must be sufficiently integrated into Dutch society and the test must be passed before an application for citizenship is lodged. This is just a sample. The United States has had a test since 1980, and it is currently under review. In the US the pass mark is 60 per cent but there is also a requirement a longer period of residency and a greater strength is placed on permanency under their citizenship laws. I have picked out just a few of the tests that are required of people taking citizenship from around the world. Australia has decided that we will have a citizenship tests, and I think that is an excellent idea. The test is outlined in the legislation under subsection 21(2). Paragraph (f) has been expanded to include the requirement that an applicant has ‘an adequate knowledge of Australia' in addition to the requirement that an applicant has an adequate knowledge of ‘the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship'. Subsection 21(2A) states that a person is: ... taken to be satisfied if and only if the Minister is satisfied that the person has, before making the application: (a) sat a test approved in a determination under section 23A; and (b) successfully completed that test ... There is no way for these criteria to be satisfied other that by successfully completing a test. A person applying under subsection 21(2) will not be eligible to become an Australian citizen unless he or she has successfully completed a test prior to applying for citizenship. It also requires the minister to personally approve a test by a determination in writing under a new subsection. That is the basis of it. There has been all sorts of speculation about what type of test is going to be adopted. I think there is a general understanding in the House that it will be basic and fairly simple and one that those who are students at school certificate level, or something less than that, would understand. It will not be onerous but it will inculcate over a period of time into people gaining citizenship a real knowledge of what it is to be an Aussie. I am delighted that these changes are being introduced into our Citizenship Act. I had the great pleasure of being with the minister when he met the committee of the migrant resource centre in Parramatta, when there was a free-flowing discussion about citizenship and the proposed changes. I would have to say there was general satisfaction from people from a wide variety of nationalities, many of whom are already Australian citizens, that there would be no offence given to anybody and there would only be genuine acceptance if the minister went ahead, as he outlined the laws on that day. There was a huge understanding from those responsible citizens who work so hard to assist their fellow former migrants or newly arrived migrants that a commitment to Australia is essential and an understanding of English is essential. They understood that, wherever possible, bringing together an understanding of English and a test where people answer basic questions about the character, history, traditions and values of Australia is an absolute, basic requirement for obtaining citizenship. I am very pleased that the government has moved to provide this test. It will make sure that those who do not seek to accept Australia will have a greater responsibility to understand Australia placed on them and will be required to make a commitment to abide by that basic nationality test. It is a good thing that we are doing today. I commend the opposition for their approval. I have not seen an amendment that is so supportive of a government initiative before, and I am very pleased that they have decided to move an amendment in the terms that they have. (Time expired)",76
43,Dr EMERSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Rankin) (1.09 pm)This Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 provides for the introduction of an Australian citizenship test. The question is: why? Why, after 11 years in office, would the government decide that the time has come for an Australian citizenship test to be formalised? There is already a citizenship test. Citizenship is not handed out like confetti to anyone who has been in the country for a specified period of time. Applicants for citizenship are expected to know about Australia, to have functional English and, basically, to be able to demonstrate that they are of good character. Yet, after 11 years, the government has decided that something new has to be done. Why wouldn't the government have done this in its first term or even in its second term? The answer is that there has been a development in the last couple of years, and that development was the Cronulla riots. The Cronulla riots sharpened public opinion, particularly in Sydney but more broadly around Australia, about the whole issue of the contribution or otherwise of people from other countries to the development of Australia. Now, it is reasonable that the Australian people ask such questions, but the truth of the matter is that this government was responding to public opinion polls. If you want to know what really makes this government jump, what really makes it change a position, it is public opinion polls. This is a political response to an unfortunate set of developments in south-west Sydney. Those developments were not only the Cronulla riots but also the activities of some members of the Muslim community. The sad truth is that the Howard government has sought to capitalise on the anxiety and division created by the behaviour of a small minority of members of the Muslim community in part of Sydney. Have there been any major developments over the last 12 months or so in terms of the relationship between long-settled Australians and those who have arrived more recently in Melbourne? Perhaps, but I am not aware of any particular crisis that would have caused the government's changed position. Have there been any such developments in Adelaide or in Perth? Indeed, in my home city of Brisbane and, more particularly, in Logan City, the area that I represent in this parliament, have there been any major divisions or riots, any ruckus? No, Mr Deputy Speaker, there have not. In fact, in Logan City, we assert that we have the most diverse population anywhere in Australia-not the highest concentration of people from overseas, including people from non-English-speaking backgrounds, but the greatest diversity. We assert that there people living in Logan City from more than 160 different homelands. The second reading speech described Australia as a country that has welcomed people from 200 different homelands, so we are right up there; we are only 40 short of the total number of countries from which Australia has drawn citizens over the last 150 years. So Logan City is an incredibly diverse area. Different people live side by side. Wave after wave of migrants who come to Australia come to Logan City. The most recent wave of migrants is from African countries. Initially, they were Sudanese, but now they are Congolese, people from Somalia, people from Burundi-people from all over Africa. And the people who are already settled in Logan City welcome them with open arms. The people who come from these African countries do not live in enclaves. The sort of picture that is created and painted by this government, a picture of nonintegration and people unwilling to declare themselves true Aussies, is not the reality in Logan City, nor is it necessarily the reality anywhere else. Yet that one event, built on simmering tensions, the Cronulla riots, has caused the government to go down this particular path. In addition to the changes set out in this legislation, the government has made it harder for people from overseas to qualify for citizenship, by extending the qualifying period from two years to four years. Let us be clear about what the government is doing: instead of inviting people to Australia and asking them to make a commitment to Australia through becoming Australian citizens, the government is making it harder to become a citizen. Why would it do that? Isn't it what the Australian public wants-that those who do come here make a commitment to our country through taking out citizenship? I argued to the ethnic communities of are Logan City that as a federal member I would want as many of them as possible to make a commitment to Australia through citizenship. In my view, it is not a desirable situation for people from other countries to come to Australia and remain noncitizens indefinitely. We should encourage citizenship not discourage it. Yet through those two separate measures, the government seems to be discouraging citizenship by extending the qualifying period from two to four years and by applying a citizenship test. Originally, with the first measure the ernment decided to extend the citizenship qualifying period from two to three years. It must have then thought that it was not hard enough, so made it four years, and then accompanied it with the test. There is already a test, but this formalises the testing arrangements. The main test will be the selection of 20 multiple choice questions drawn randomly from a large pool. Each test is expected to include three questions on the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship. The pass mark is expected to be 60 per cent and the three mandatory questions must be answered correctly. Interestingly, the provisions contained in this legislation are far more moderate than those originally foreshadowed by the minister. To that extent, we welcome the moderation and Labor will support the measures contained in this legislation. Special arrangements will be made for people whose literacy skills mean that they have difficulty undertaking a test. The minister has a large degree of discretion to provide a different test and exemptions for the test. For example, exemptions will include people under the age of 18 or over 60, and also those with a permanent physical or mental incapacity which prevents them from understanding the nature of their application. There has been moderation from the original intent of this legislation and we welcome that moderation. Labor also understands that people who come to Australia from non-English-speaking backgrounds, especially those who come from very poor countries and often in dire circumstances, need assistance in learning English. When I speak to the Sudanese and other people from Africa who are settling in Logan City, the first thing they say they want to do is learn English. It is not as if Australia is riddled with enclaves of people who do not want to learn English. The peogovple from these African countries know that, in order to get a job, sustain their families and perhaps bring other people to Australia, they need to be at least functionally literate. They seek help to learn English and Labor says that help should be provided. Isn't that going to the heart of the issue? We want to assist people to learn English and therefore play out a fuller role in our community. Labor is taking a positive approach on these issues, whereas, sadly, the coalition is taking a negative approach. Let us ponder for a moment what the possible rationale for this measure could be beyond capitalising on some strong public opinion emanating out of the Cronulla riots. Let us ask whether this citizenship test would stop bad people from becoming citizens. If a bad person wants to become a citizen, do you think they would set out to fail the test? They would be doing their very best to pass the test. Are we saying that someone who is hostile to the Australian way of life may have terrorist intentions? Who would say, ‘I was going to be a really bad guy, but they tripped me up on that citizenship test. I was just about to get away with some heinous crime and then I did the citizenship test, got less than 60 per cent and failed, so I have been exposed.' It is just ludicrous that this testing procedure could be, in any way, conceived as a means of filtering out bad people, because strongly motivated bad people will pass the test. Who might fail the test? One group who might fail the test are women from very poor countries from non-English-speaking backgrounds. They come from poor circumstances, are poorly educated in their home countries and come to Australia with heavy commitments to their families. They could easily struggle with this test. Do we really want that? Are they the sort of people we want to prevent from becoming Australian citizens? I thought we would want to encourage them. Why not recognise the difficult circumstances of women from poor countries of non-English-speaking backgrounds and assist them in learning English? They do not have a lot of time on their hands, they do not have the educational background to be able to pick up a new language easily and they are the sorts of people who could experience difficulty. They are the people that, I would have thought, we would want to become Australian citizens, not the sorts of the people we would want to deter. Can this test be abused? Can it be abused by the government of the day instructing the authorities to make the test more difficult or the decision as to whether they have passed or not tougher for particular groups? I do not know, but I fear that it could. Could it be used to keep people from particular ethnic backgrounds from becoming Australian citizens? We cannot really answer that because we have not actually seen the test at this stage but I certainly do hope that that is not the motivation. Having read the second reading speech, I am none the wiser as to the motivation behind this other than, ‘Isn't it good that people make a commitment to Australia and understand our culture?' Of course, that is good, but will a citizenship test make that happen? I doubt it. As I said at the outset, it is not there is no test already-there is a test. However, because this particular test as outlined in the legislation is far more moderate than that originally proposed, Labor will support it but we would back it up by committing extra resources to the teaching of English. Australia needs a strong immigration program and I will acknowledge freely that immigration to Australia over the last few years has increased very substantially. This is a good development and I thank the government for presiding over such an increase in immigration. For example, excluding the humanitarian program, in the mid-nineties we had a total program of a bit over 82,000. Now, in 2006-07, it is 144,000 and it is expected in 2007-08 to be more than 150,000. These are welcome developments. The humanitarian program has remained at around 13,000 a year for the last few years. This is very important for Australia's future. The Intergenerational report identifies and quantifies the problem of the ageing of the population. As the Treasurer has said, ‘Demography is destiny'. Decisions that were made through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s have caused the current situation so not only is the population ageing with us but there is not a great deal that we can do about it in the short term. Something that we can do is to lift the fertility rates of women of childbearing age and there are plenty of policy proposals that have been put forward which are designed to do that. Most of them come from the Labor side of politics, including from the shadow Treasurer, who has identified problems in the family payment system and the disincentives involved in the interaction of the family payment system with the income tax system plus the high cost of child care which mean that women of childbearing age tend not to go back to work as quickly as otherwise they might. There are as if issues with our declining fertility. There has been a lift in fertility in the last year or so. Some people say that it is a temporary phenomenon as women who approach their mid to late 30s realise that their clocks are ticking and that they need to have their babies if they are going to have them. It is not assured that the temporary lift in fertility that we have experienced in the last two years will be sustained. So what do we do about the ageing of the population? We are having debates in this parliament and outside the parliament about productivity. It is vital that we lift the nation's productivity but there is another way as well to complement a lift in participation in the workforce and that is with a lift in immigration. The difference between the original Intergenerational report and the updated Intergenerational report released by the Treasurer in early April is that the government had not anticipated the strength with which the contribution of an increase in immigration would modify the ageing of the population. That is, the government had not expected that it would be possible to bring in enough younger migrants to help offset the impact of population ageing. It appears that perhaps immigration has greater potential to help offset the adverse consequences of population ageing than had been understood at the time of the original Intergenerational report in 2002. If that is the case, that welcome news. Given that we will not be able to fundamentally turn around the population ageing phenomenon we will need as many younger migrants as possible to bolster the working age population in Australia. There will be shortages of both skilled and unskilled labour not only next year and the year after but right through the foreseeable period. It is understood that there will be skill shortages, but what is not so readily understood is that there will be shortages of people with lower levels of skills as well. With the ageing of the population, we will need working age people perhaps with somewhat lower levels of skills to do a lot of the less glamorous work. We will need people without high skill levels to work in our aged-care facilities as people live through their 90s and become more than 100 years of age. These will be very frail people. So we do need that boost in immigration. I welcome the boost in immigration that this government has presided over but it is vitally important that we make it easier not harder for migrants to come to Australia and we make it easier not harder for migrants to make a commitment to Australia by becoming Australian citizens.

44,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak to the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007. This bill is very important to me and I believe it is a subject that is held in high importance by all members of this House. We need to exercise our obligation at all times for greater social cohesion in this great country. It is also my belief that all candidates for citizenship ought to be able to do a citizenship test voluntarily even if they are exempt from the test, and it is on this point that I express my view that the law may need to be changed in the future. Today is very I want to outline why the Commonwealth government ought to assist these people and why I ask that it be considered in future reviews of this legislation. In December 2006, the Australian government announced its intention to introduce a test for certain applicants for Australian citizenship. In announcing the plan, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Andrew Robb, said that it would help migrants to integrate and maximise the opportunities available to them in Australia. It was true then and it is true now that this measure will be of benefit not just to candidates for citizenship but indeed to our whole country. Under the proposed test, future migrants will need to demonstrate a basic level of English language skills as well as knowledge of the Australian way of life and shared values. At the time, Mr Robb said: Australian Citizenship is a privilege not a right. This citizenship test is an important extension the Government's broader philosophy of mutual obligation. A practical, common sense test will serve to enhance the value of Australian Citizenship as something worth striving for. Community support for such a test came through with more than 1,600 responses to the discussion paper and, of those responses, 60 per cent indicated their clear support for a formal citizenship test. I feel greatly encouraged that such a large number of people and interest groups put forward their positive proposals in helping to formulate the policy that we are discussing today. New citizens will undertake a web based test requiring people to demonstrate their knowledge of the English language and of Australia, and there will also be an oral component to the test. While all prospective citizens will need to take a test, there will be provision for alternative testing arrangements for people who cannot attain the literacy standards required. Prospective applicants for citizenship will also be asked to sign a statement of commitment to Australia. As I outlined earlier, I am also of the strong belief that, if they want to, even those people who are not required to sit the test but who are approaching candidacy for citizenship ought to be offered the opportunity to be given the booklet to study for and undertake the test, if for nothing else but their own sense of pride and achievement. It would have the flow-on benefit of increasing the level of English ability and the knowledge of Australia which will stand them in very good stead into the future. I have a couple of comments about my electorate of Bass in northern Tasmania, which informs my views on the subject. Bass is not a place, and neither is Tasmania, where we have seen immigration levels such as have been witnessed in other states around Australia. Immigration levels have historiof cally been strong in Tasmania, but in recent decades they have certainly not been at the rate experienced in New South Wales and Victoria. Approximately 13 per cent of people living in my electorate of Bass were born overseas, and approximately 900 people per year immigrate to Tasmania. In the financial year 2005-06 there were 177 immigrants from the United Kingdom, 82 from the Sudan, 47 from India, 33 from the United States of America and 34 from South Africa. There is a strong component, particularly from the African nations, of refugee and humanitarian entrants, and by far the majority of people are entering under skilled work programs and family reunion. I have a strong affection for our migrant community in northern Tasmania. We have an excellent community of people who have a commitment to Australia and to Tasmania and, while there are pulls and attractions to move closer to some of their fellow countrymen interstate in some of the bigger cities, the ones who choose to stay in Tasmania really love the place. I note that the Africans, in particular, struggle with the cold at times-particularly on a day like today, the winter solstice-but they have a love for Tasmania, which is something which has grown in them even though, if they were refugees, at first they may not have had any choice as to where they would be settled. I particularly draw the House's attention to two refugees who have come a great way in Launceston, Tasmania. I hope they do not mind me mentioning them: their names are Abdul and Aminata Succoh. They are a wonderful family with a large number of children, including their youngest, Shalom-a beautiful little child-and they have made and are making the transition from languishing in a refugee camp in Africa. One day the truck rolled by, literally, and they were told that their number had come up and they were moving to Australia. They have made a tremendous contribution to our community in northern Tasmania and they are exemplars of the African community which they represent. They have opened a business; they are an enterprising family. They are engaged in tailoring, hair braiding and the sale of products-all things African. I pay tribute to them today as people who represent the African community in northern Tasmania and who-I may say this because I have askedgreatly support the Australian government's immigration policies, including the citizenship test. They are interested in community; they are not interested in politics. They are interested in watching and supporting their people and helping them to make the transition which they have made and are making to have a better life, to appreciate and be of the country which gave them new hope and a new future and to enthusiastically embrace it. After all, they fled their home try. That is not to say that they do not miss and it is certainly not to say that they do not miss those loved ones that they left behind, because they do, but they have a deep affection and a deep love for this country, even a deeper love than many people have who were born here in Australia who perhaps have grown up in this wonderful country of ours and, from time to time, take it for granted. I will in passing make the unusual step of paying tribute to my late father-in-law, Salvatore Fasano, who passed away a few years ago, and who was an Italian immigrant-in fact, a prisoner of war, taken by the Allied forces in the Second World War and placed on the West Tamar in Northern Tasmania to work on a farm there. At the end of the war, he was given the opportunity to return to his home country, but he had in that time developed such a love for and an affinity with Australia that he-through the usual processes-came back here, found a new life here and started his family here. He was another battler who made his way as a man with nothing and made his contribution to his new country. It would be interesting to know what Sydney's Sheikh Taj El-Din Hilaly thought of this idea of a voluntary test. It has been well documented that Hilaly arrived in Australia on a tourist visa but did not leave before the visa expired. In 1988, attempts were made to have him deported for inciting hatred and being against so-called Australian values. This did not happen and Hilaly was in fact granted permanent residence in 1990 because the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, rejected all advice and legitimised his status, which eventually led to him being awarded citizenship. In more recent times, we have part heard a lot in the media about Hilaly. In January this year, Sheikh Hilaly appeared on an Egyptian television program and made a coun- number of comments that resulted in wideit spread criticism here in Australia-bipartisan criticism from all major parties in Australia. He said that, because many British and Irish settlers had been convicts, Muslims had more right to Australia, because they paid their own way. He also said that prison sentences handed down to Lebanese-Australian Muslims for the gang rapes in Sydney were excessive and influenced by the 2001 terrorists attacks in the United States. The sheik also said that Western people-and he singled out the ‘English race'-are the biggest liars and oppressors. There is no such thing as an English race, so I am unclear if he meant the English people or the whole of the Commonwealth. And, as Andrew Bolt reports, what a symbol of determined apartness he was, with so little English after 30 years here-pretty un-Australian. As a short comment: what worries me still and makes me feel uncomfortable is that the infamous Hilaly, amid all the rumblings, machinations and internal politics of the Islamic community and the real public hope that he would be impeached, was apparently made an offer to continue in the role by the same Australian National Imams Council which then appointed his successor in the same week. There are clearly still problems here. I acknowledge that it is very hard to talk about them honestly and openly without opening up a slanging match. But I want to say that I applaud the work of all those who have stretched out the hand of friendship to the Muslim community in Australia in the expectation that there will need to be more and better integration of the Muslim cultural community and other new Australians into the Australian way of life in order for our nation to be a stable and harmonious one into future. This is not about the clash of religions so much as about differences in cultures. Today, I rededicate myself to working positively wherever I can to soothe this problem that I refer to and rededicate myself to maintaining the values that our country cherishes. These values include, as the minister has said, respect for freedoms, including freedom of religion; the dignity of the individual; support for democracy and the parliamentary system; a commitment to the rule of law, under which men and women are equal in every way; respect for all races and cultures; the spirit of a fair go, which is distinctly tralian; mutual respect; compassion for those in need; and promoting the interests of the community generally, making Australia even better. This change that I have mentioned, and which I continue to propose, ought to be considered after the arrangements we are today debating have been bedded down. It would ensure that those people who wish to become an Australian citizen can do so by also demonstrating an understanding of and a commitment to Australia and our way of life. To those new citizens who are not required to do the test but still want to, I would like to give an opportunity to make further commitment to this great nation. I am not moving an amendment; I simply signal that this is something that I believe ought to be considered by the government after the changes have been implemented and stabilised. The proposed test outlined in this bill will require demonstration of a knowledge and understanding of our history, values and culture and of the institutions that underpin our free and open democratic society. And what a proud history that is. Notwithstanding our fair share of mistakes, we have come a long way and we-along with our forebears and the unmistakable guiding hand of Godhave shaped and inherited a great nation. While this parliament represents and symbolises much of what is great and democratic about Australia, I suspect not enough is spoken in this House about our proud history as an independent nation since 1901.That leads this former schoolteacher-not a history teacher but one interested in his country-to take the chamber back to some selected democratic and social achievements made by a modern nation. On 1 January 1901, Australia celebrated becoming a federation of states, as Edmund Barton became our first Prime Minister and Lord Hopetoun our first Governor General. AusWhat I love about that era is the catch cry slogans of the federalists. This is part of our heritage and, I hope, our vision for Australia. Their catchcries were: ‘One people, one destiny' and ‘Unity is strength.' In 1902 the Commonwealth Franchise Act guaranteed women the right to vote in federal elections and the right to sit in federal parliament, long before other nations took the same step. In 1903 the Defence Act gave the federal government control over its own Army. The first powered airline flight was made in Australia in 1909. Australia's population was recorded as 4.5 million in our first census, which was conducted in 1911. The famous ANZAC spirit was defined in 1915 at Gallipoli. Sir Douglas Mawson made Australia proud by charting more than 6,000 kilometres of Antarctic coastline in 1931. Tasmania's own Joe Lyons became my home state's first Prime Minister in 1932. I used to teach my science students about the great work of Howard Florey, who, in 1940, along with his team of scientists, developed penicillin for the world. Australia became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. The Olympics came to Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000. In 1967 the first Australians, Aboriginal Australians, gained the right to citizenship after overwhelming referendum result. In 1986 the Australia Act cut all of the remaining legislafree, tive apron strings that the UK had to pass laws for our country. In 1999 Australian soldiers were deployed to East Timor as part of a peacekeeping force, confirming our international leadership role which continues to this day in more than 10 places around the world. There is so much more that could be said, but from what I have said I am sure that you will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, that our country has offered so much. It continues to be an attractive place for people to call home or to make their home. As a young Australian myself, I recognise my own failure to appreciate as I was growing up the great bounty that we take for granted in Australia. Many countries around the world have a test such as the one we are discussing today. These include Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the United States. In Canada the residency requirement is to spend three years out of four living in Canada as a permanent resident before applying. Applicants have to be able to communicate in English or French and they must know about Canada. They must ‘know about the rights and responsibilities of citizenship'. In the United Kingdom, since November 2005, all new applicants are required to demonstrate knowledge of English and also to have passed the so-called Life in the UK Test. The Netherlands have led the way in the modern era in this regard. Since 2003 they have required that candidates for citizenship undertake a four-hour test on the Dutch language and national knowledge. In our physically and socially close neighbour, New Zealand, the residency requirement is three years permanent residence-although I acknowledge that there is no test of the nature that we an are describing today. In the United States, which proudly boasts of being the land of the applicants for citizenship must show that they are a person ‘of good moral character' for a five-year period. They also need to demonstrate that they can read, write, speak and understand words in ordinary usage. They must also demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, principles and form of government of the United States. In closing, let me say that a formal citizenship test is a way to ensure that migrants are absolutely committed and ready to participate in the wider community. It is not a foolproof method but it is another layer of security for our immigration program here in Australia. We again extend the invitation to those abroad who wish to live here: they are welcome. (Time expired) Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (1.49 pm)-The process by which the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 has come to the floor of this House clearly demonstrates the moral bankruptcy of a tired government grasping for an issue with which to play wedge politics yet again and on which to divide Australians under the guise of uniting them. Let me say from the outset that my concern with this legislation stems not from any objection to a more formalised citizenship test, as long as is reasonably structured, but from what we know of this government's history of using and abusing sensitive community issues purely for its own political advantage, regardless of the cost and consequences to our community. The process of this bill's formation is cynical politics at its worse and an indictment of any government that claims to govern for Australians. When the Prime Minister announced in December 2006 that the government would introduce a citizenship test, he stated that that migrants wanting to become citizens would be required to sit a formal exam in English and answer 30 questions about Australian values, traditions, institutions and history which would be drawn from a pool of 200 questions. I note the ence in the chamber of the honourable member for Corangamite, who comes from the Geelong area, as I do. I would say that he would have difficulty answering 30 questions from a list of 200 from a resource book. But, be that as it may, we are going to have 30 questions about Australian values, traditions, institutions and history, and they will be drawn from a pool of 200. Knowing the government's ugly history of attempting to deliberately manipulate these sensitive community issues for its own political purpose, the opposition requested a copy of the proposed test, a copy of the 200 questions on the aforementioned matters and a copy of the resource documents from which the government had drawn its 200 questions. Mr MCArthur-In English. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-Not surprisingly, Member for Corangamite, none were available. So we have the Prime Minister of this country saying to the migrant population of Australia: ‘It is time that you took a test; you are going to be tested out of 200 questions and you are going to have to answer 30 it with a pass mark of 60 per cent and it is all going to come out of a resource book. But, by the way, we haven't even done any of that. We don't even know which values we are talking about. We don't really know which historical questions there will be,' et cetera. I think that at that point the process of this bill coming into existence was exposed. There is nobody in this chamber who would deny that citizenship is a very important source of identity for us all. When we travel, we love to be considered as and let everybody know that we are Australians. Indeed, when citizenship ceremonies are held, we welcome those people who have made that momentous decision and we encourage and support them in making that great decision to become citizens that enhances their identity pres- as Australians. Nobody has argument with that particular proposition. What we on this side of the House have argument with is a government that seeks to deliberately manipulate this issue for its own political purpose. As I said, the Prime Minister made the statement and then, when we asked him to front up to the crease and bat out some questions that were involved in the test, he could not even answer them. The Prime Minister is asking people who want to take out Australian citizenship to answer questions that the government has not even thought about or thought through in proposing this legislation. The facts of the matter were that there was no test devised, there was no reference list of 200 questions and there was no base document from which the questions were sourced. So the fraudulent behaviour and confected concerns of members of the Howard government were exposed for us all to see. The government was prepared to risk community division and deliberately cause anxiety and concern among our migrant communitiesall for the sake of wringing the political rag to pander yet again to the more ugly and destructive elements of its conservative constituency. The people of Geelong and the rest of the nation deserve better. I want to share with members of government and my side of the House aspects of the Geelong experience. It is something of which our community is extremely proud. We are a multicultural community in Geelong and proud of it. I have been the member for Corio since 1993 and have seen my community mature and grow in tolerance and understanding over that time. As each new wave of settlers has sought sanctuary in Geelong to build a better life for themselves and their families, through their efforts, those migrants have made an enormous contribution to the economic prosperity of the region, and they have enriched its social and cultural life mensely. On behalf of the wider community, I thank each and every one of them for choosing Geelong as their home and for their personal contribution to making Geelong the great city and wonderful place to live that it is. Geelong's diverse ethnic communities come together under the umbrella of the Geelong Ethnic Communities Council, which, since its inception, has played a very constructive role in giving each community an opportunity to formally have its say on issues affecting migrants and the provision of services to migrant families. Not only that, it is a major promoter and supporter of Geelong's great Pako Festa, a multicultural val that is now acknowledged to be one of the best in the country. It is not only in the economic, cultural social fields that migrants have made a great contribution. There has been one in the sporting field as well. Members of this House will note that Geelong is on the top of the AFL ladder. Mr Nairn-Hear, hear! Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-The member for Eden-Monaro has entered the chamber. I know what a diehard supporter of Geelong he is. As he would appreciate, in the current team are ‘Bomber' Wojcinski, Kane Tenace and Travis Varcoe-an Indigenous player of great skill and potential. Past players with ethnic backgrounds include Peter Riccardi and Brent Grgic. Of course, we can go back in history to the great Peter Pianto and Paul Vinar and in doing so we are getting back to the era of the honourable member for Corangamite. If we go to soccer, Josip Skoko, Steve Horvat and Joey Didulica are great current or immediate past contributors to Australian national and international soccer. And, while I am on my feet talking about the importance of sport for the region of Geelong-and I note that the Prime Minister has im- entered the chamber-we will be approaching the government for a $26 million contribution to Skilled Stadium. I hope the Prime Minister will look quite favourably on that request, because Geelong is an important, iconic foundation member of the Australian Football League and Kardinia Park is a community complex. We want to secure it long term for the total population of Geelong and improve its capacity to serve those great ethnic communities that have made important contributions to the Geelong Football Club and the AFL and to soccer in Australia. In respect of the substance of the bill, I note that the Geelong Ethnic Communities festiCouncil, through the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria, the ECCV, has expressed its opposition to the new proposals in and the bill on the basis of their judgement that the discussion paper Australian citizenship: much more than a ceremony, which underpins what the government is doing in a policy sense, fails to demonstrate a convincing case for the need to overhaul Australia's citizenship requirements. I have read the ECCV's submission and I must say to the House that the views expressed are logical, coherent, substantial, well articulated and deserving",84
45,The SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",91
46,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Trade will be absent from question time today. He is travelling to Germany to attend a G6 meeting and WTO negotiations. In his absence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will answer questions on his behalf. NA Child Abuse",91
47,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's policy announcement just before question time, outlining his response to the crisis of child abuse in Indigenous communities, as revealed in the report Little children are cred. I indicate to the Prime Minister that I will do whatever I can to work with him to address this response to the crisis of child abuse in Australian Indigenous communities. On that basis, would the Prime Minister and his minister, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, provide an urgent briefing to the shadow minister and me on the proposals that he has put forward, their detail and the funding attached to them, subsequent to question time?",91
48,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will be happy to facilitate a full briefing. I will speak to my ter. I welcome what the Leader of the Opposition has said. This is a national emergency. There is no greater obligation that this parliament has than the obligation of caring for the young and vulnerable in our community. We are dealing with a group of young Australians for whom the concept of childhood innocence has never been present. That is a sad and tragic event. Exceptional measures are required to deal with an exceptionally tragic situation. That has been the substance of what I announced a few minutes ago. In the course of saying that, I pay tribute to the minister responsible, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. From the moment he assumed that portfolio, he identified this problem and he pursued it. He was ridiculed and criticised by some for doing so. If he had not pursued it, the inquiry which has led to this response would never have been established. I thank him for the contribution he has made. I know that he is very committed and will be very happy to brief your shadow minister on the substance of the matter. Child Abuse",91
49,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister advise the House now of details of the Australian governsa- ment's response to the emergency outlined in the Northern Territory report into the protection of Aboriginal children from sexual abuse?,91
50,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question and I also thank him for the advice and counsel he provided to me and to the relevant minister regarding this matter prior to the government's final decision. The measures are essentially as follows, and they are couched against the background of believing that this is a national emergency. The Minister for Families, minisCommunity Services and Indigenous Affairs put it to me very powerfully yesterday when he said that if this report had been about events in the suburb of Dickson, here in the Australian Capital Territory, there would have been a massive and immediate community response and a demand that something along the scale that I outlined a few minutes ago be undertaken by the government. We take the view that the same attitude should be adopted in relation to the Indigenous children of the Northern Territory. The actions that the government has announced will be overseen by a task force of eminent Australians, including logistics and other specialists and child protection experts. I am very happy to announce that Dr Sue Gordon, the eminent Western Australian magistrate, has agreed to assume a leadership role in the task force. Essentially, what the government has in mind is the introduction of widespread alcohol restrictions on Northern Territory Aboriginal land for six months-banning the sale, the possession, the transportation and the consumption-and broader monitoring of takeaway sales across the Northern Territory. We will be appealing to the Australian Medical Association to encourage the provision of doctors to undertake a medical examination of every Indigenous child in the Northern Territory under the age of 16. The federal government will bear all of the additional costs involved in relation those health checks. I have no doubt that the Australian Medical Association, given its long standing interest in this issue, will respond very enthusiastically to what the government has in mind. We propose a major change in the area of welfare in order to stem the flow of cash going towards alcohol abuse and to ensure that funds that are meant to be used for children's welfare are actually used for that purpose. The main intention here is that 50 per cent of these welfare payments will effectively be quarantined for the purchase of food and other essential items. That will apply to all families receiving these payments anywhere in the affected areas. We will be enforcing school attendance by linking income support and family assistance payments to school attendance for all people living on Aboriginal land. We will be ensuring the provision of meals for children at school, with parents paying for those meals. The Commonwealth government will take control of townships through five-year leases to ensure that property and public housing can be improved. That will include, if appropriate, the payment of just terms compensation. We will be requiring intensive onground clean-up of communities to make them safer and healthier by marshalling local workforces through Work for the Dole arrangements. We intend to scrap the permit system for common areas and road corridors on Aboriginal land. We intend to ban the possession of X-rated pornography in the prescribed areas and we will check all publicly funded computers for evidence of storage of pornography. In the area of law enforcement, there will be an immediate increase in policing levels, which have been woefully inadequate for many years in the Northern Territory. We will be calling on the state police services to provide at least 10 additional officers at to Commonwealth expense, and they will be sworn in as Territory police officers to assist with the policing task. We will provide additional resources to set up an Australian government sexual abuse reporting desk, and we will appoint managers of all government businesses in all of the relevant communities. Next Thursday there will be a meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, and the federal representative on that body, the Minister for Justice and Customs, will ask his fellow ministers to refer to the Australian Crime Commission a reference to allow the commission to identify and locate perpetrators of sexual abuse of Indigenous children in other areas of Australia. After the identification of those perpetrators, that will lead, hopefully, to the prosecution of those people. I also indicate to the House that the ministion ter will be bringing to cabinet at its next meeting proposals for further extending the conditionality of welfare payments to all Australians receiving income support, to ensure that these payments are used for the benefit of their children. I should put the House on notice that it may be necessary for parliament to be recalled from the winter break in order to pass the legislation needed to give effect to this package. That legislation will involve amendments to the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act and to the Northern Territory land rights legislation. At this stage I am advised that amendments to other pieces of legislation will not be required. Many in the House will know that the terrible, sad and tragic set of circumstances vealed by this report in Northern Territory is duplicated in other parts of the country. The difference between the Territory and other parts of the country is that this parliament has the constitutional power and authority to do something about it in the Territory. We do not have the constitutional power to act in the same way in the states. I would appeal directly to every state Premier who has got the same problem in some part of his state to do the same as I have announced this morning. I appeal directly to the Premier of Queensland, to the Premier of New South Wales, and particularly to the Premier of Western Australia. They know that they have the same problem, and many of them have had reports saying that. I am asking them to do the same for their Aboriginal children as we have today announced a willingness to do for the Aboriginal children of the Northern Territory. Sea King Helicopter Accident",91
51,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My quesis to the Minister for Defence. Can the minister confirm that large sections of the board of inquiry report on the Sea King helicopter crash have been deleted? Further, is the minister satisfied with the report, and will he now move to ensure that all due processes were properly followed, that all the facts relating to the accident and responsibilities for it are made public, and that all the families of the nine personnel who lost their lives are given full closure?",93
52,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hunter for his question. Today the Chief of the Australian Defence Force, the Chief of Navy and the Maritime Commander for Australia are releasing the board of inquiry report into the Sea King tragedy which occurred on 2 April 2005. Every one of the 256 re- recommendations in that report are being implemented fully. Thirty per cent have been implemented already and by the end of this year 90 per cent will be implemented. It has been a very painful process, particularly for the families of those who lost their lives, for the two men who survived and their families, and for all of those in the Royal Australian Navy-and No. 817 Squadron in particular. There are issues of natural justice which need to be addressed. A significant amount of legal opinion has been applied to the report prior to its release, and there are a number of redactions throughout the 1,700 pages of the report. Those redactions-or deletions, as the member for Hunter may choose to call them-reflect operational requirements, they reflect issues of natural justice, and they also reflect very strong legal advice which was provided to the Royal Australian Navy and the board of inquiry. I wish to reassure not only the member for Hunter and the House; I particularly wish to reassure the families and every Australian who has an interest in making sure that a tragedy like this, for these reasons, does not ever occur again. Whilst there are redactions in that report, every single one of the individuals who have been identifiedirrespective of his or her rank-will be pursued with the full force of the law but with the application of natural justice. Child Abuse",93
53,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Would the minister outline to the House the immediate steps the government will be taking on the scourge of alcohol abuse and child abuse affecting Indigenous children in the Northern Territory?",94
54,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for the question. As a man who puts the family first in everything he does, he understands the significance when a family unit breaks down because of grog, because of marijuana, because of sexual abuse, or because of domestic violence, and knows that it is an issue of national significance and national emergency. I refer to the very first recommendation of the report. It states: ‘That this be designated an issue of urgent national significance by both the Australian and the Northern Territory governments.' I have likened this to the action we should take when a community is struck by a cyclone or a flood. Certain things have to be put aside. Certain normalities have to be discarded. You have to move boldly and you have to do it quickly. When I first came into this job, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory said to me that the town camps in Alice Springs were her No. 1 priority. Here we are, some 16 or 17 months later and, unfortunately, I cannot report any significant improvement-in fact there is no improvement in the town camps. It has not been through want of trying. It has not been through lack of money, resources or will on behalf of the Howard government that it has not happened. What we are calling for here is not to delay another day. I could not live with myself and I know that not one member of this House would want to live with themselves knowing that we sat on a report like this for eight weeks and then said for another six or eight weeks that we would wait and try and come up with some answers and then start to implement them. The children deserve and need us to implement things today. The first thing that we can do that does not require legislative change, that does not need the recall of the parliament, is for the premiers of the other states in this country to stand up, to come up to the plate, to come forward with the police resources so that we can have them sworn in as Northern Territory police and have them on the ground. We know for a fact that when police are on the ground people come forward. In Kulumburru, when the Western Australian government put a police station there, in very short order a young woman came forward and as a result of her evidence we now have 13 men who have been charged with child sex abuses. That is 13 males out of an adult male population of about 90. That is just unbelievable in this country. And no-one should think for a moment that that is the only community. Without police, without someone responsible to report that abuse to, it could not happen. We can do something about that now. In the same way as this country responded to the tsunami-we had people up in the Indonesian archipelago and other places within days-we need that to happen here. We are prepared to stand by and have the military forces of this country provide their logistics, their vehicles and their communications, and the language skills of the Indigenous parts of our defence forces to support the men and women of the Australian police forces in their duty. That will give comfort. That will give real purpose to what we are doing. That is the first thing that needs to happen and it does not need to take weeks. I ask the state premiers to start working on this now in the interests of these children. One other issue that I would go to, in the multitude of things that we are undertaking here, is the compulsory acquisition under just terms. We are doing that because we need to be able to ensure that people are living in hygienic conditions, so that the conditions that currently prevail where people are living in overcrowded houses, where there are no norms and where all of the abuse can take place can stop. But we need to have control over the homes-the condition they are in, who is in them and what is occurring in them. We are asking for that now, so that we can do that and return normality over the next five years. There are three phases to what we are doing: (1) stabilisation, (2) normalisation and (3) exit. This will require the entire support of the Northern Territory government. Phase 2 will deal with the issues that many of you will think need to be dealt with. But, first of all, we have to stabilise. The grog has to be restricted. As a senior woman in Wadeye said to me, ‘Please stop the cash flowing into these communities because they are buying grog, they are buying gunga and they are then destroying our children, and this is money that we need to have.' These are the steps we have announced today. These are the steps no less that will deal with the insidious crime against the children of our nation. Interest Rates",94
55,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How can the Prime Minister claim that working families in Australia have never been better off when new Reserve Bank figures released today show a further increase in the proportion of household income consumed by mortgage interest has reached a record 9.5 per cent? Prime Minister, is it a fact that the proportion of household income consumed by mortgage interest has more than doubled since 1991, with the majority of the increase occurring since interest rates started rising in 2002?",95
56,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the case that people are buying ever more expensive houses, and they are doing that because of a number of factors. One of them is that interest rates are lower and people can borrow more. The member for Lilley is very good at selectively quoting from things.",95
57,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,95
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, he is. The Reserve Bank's March 2007 Financial Stability Review says: The average mortgage repayment on a new owner-occupied loan as a share of average disposable income is below its peak in 1989. In other words, notwithstanding the fact that people can now afford to buy ever more expensive houses, it is still below the 1989 peak. So I do not know what the member for Lilley is talking about. I recognise that some Australian families are doing it tough. I always have and I always will. No matter who is in office, there will always be some families who miss out. If you look at overall wages, if you look at unemployment, which is at a 33-year low, you will find that if fairness is the chance of a job of then, as Tony Blair famously said and truthfully said, fairness in Australia is at a 32-year high. Workplace Relations",95
59,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer inform the House of the link between a flexible industrial relations system and productivity growth. How would greater union involvement in the industrial relations system affect the Australian economy?,95
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I think I can say that all the international advice from all of the respected agencies, including the OECD and the IMF, is that the more flexible the labour market is the higher the productivity outcomes you will get, all other things being equal. The point was made yesterday by the OECD in their Employment outlook where they said: The clearest result emerging from our analysis is that too strict statutory employment protection regular contracts appears to dampen productivity growth, most likely by restricting the movement of labour into emerging high-productivity activities, firms or industries. What they are saying is, ‘Don't tie your labour market down with too strict statutory controls such as unfair dismissal laws. Make sure that it's flexible enough for people to be able to move into high-growth, highproductivity activities and for those firms to pick them up.' That is the best way of having a productivity-centred industrial relations system. This week, of course, we have been witnessing the gaffs of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to productivity. But, leaving aside all of the gaffs that he has made, what policy lessons are there to draw in relation to productivity? The first is this: if you really want a system that is pro-productivity, you will support flexible industrial relations; you will not want to have a return to the past. Another thing that you will want is workplaces where people can get on with work without having to put up with thuggery and intimidation. That is why this government introduced the ABCC: to bring an end to thuggery and intimidation. The Leader of the Opposition, it appears, has discovered for the first time in his life that thuggery and intimidation occurs on building sites in Australia. He discovered that because he has discovered film evidence of Joe MCDonald, the Assistant Secretary of the CFMEU, engaging in that very behaviour in Western Australia. It came to light because the ABCC, investigating, managed to get some video. But, of course, if the Leader of the Opposition had had his way, there would have been no ABCC, there would have been no video and there would have been no end to the continuing pattern of behaviour of Joe MCDonald and his cohorts on building sites, not just in Western Australia but as goes on on hunfor dreds of building sites and other workplaces around Australia. Having suddenly discovered what everybody who knows anything about industrial relations in Australia has known for decades, the Leader of the Opposition says that he is going to get rid of Joe MCDonald. He says he is going to draw a line in the sand. I have this question to ask the Leader of the Opposition: on which side of that line in the sand will Kevin Harkins, the ALP candidate for Franklin, stand? Joe MCDonald is not the only building official who has engaged in intimidation. One of the candidates that is lining up as a Rudd Labor candidate at the next election, in the seat of Franklin, Mr Kevin Harkins, an official of the ETU, is in exactly the same situation. He is still, to this day, being paid by the ETU, having been despatched to Tasmania by Dean Mighell. He has been described by Harry Quick, the current member for Franklin, as ‘a foul-mouthed, bullying trade union person of the worse ilk'. Seeing that Mr Rudd is now in the business of getting rid of bullying union officials",96
61,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his title.,96
62,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the Leader of the Opposition ought to have a very careful look at Kevin Harkins. You can take the word of the member for Franklin or you can take the word of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, which found that Kevin Harkins had ‘engaged in unlawful conduct'. At the Melbourne Eastlands project he threatened a builder by saying, ‘If necessary, the union will block off the entrance to our site with a truck, in the middle of a concrete pour.' That is the Labor candidate for Franklin. It is all very well to say, just because Joe MCDonald got caught on video and you are embarrassed about it, that you want to do something about Joe MCDonald, but I call on the leader of the Labor Party and the whole of the Labor Party to dissociate themselves from this ETU official, Kevin Harkins, to make it clear that they will stand up against thuggery, whether it is captured on videotape or not, and to immediately disendorse Kevin Harkins as the ALP candidate for Franklin. Broadband",96
63,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm the assessment of Gartner mobile and wireless research director, Robin Simpson, that access to the government's WiMAX broadband network will cost users in rural and regional Australia up to $1,000 in installation costs? Can he confirm that no existing laptop will be able to access the WiMAX network without the attachment of a special network card costing up to $300?",97
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I will not and cannot confirm it. Workplace Relations",97
65,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is Prime Minister aware of any support for the government's tough approach to the building industry? Is there evidence of this approach benefiting the economy? Is the Prime Minister aware of any alternative views?,97
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dobell for his very perceptive question. I can report to the member for Dobell that the level of industrial disputation in the building and construction industry is at an all-time low. There has been a fall from something like a factor of 35 out of 1,000 days of work, in the number of strikes, to something less than two as a result of the legislation introduced by this government. It is very interesting that, in the past 24 hours, the Leader of the Opposition has told the Australian people that he will adopt a policy of zero tolerance towards thuggery and illegal behaviour in the building and construction industry. They are fine words and they might be believable if they had been matched by action. But let me point out to the House that, far from exhibiting zero tolerance towards thuggery in the building industry, the Leader of the Opposition has exhibited maximum toleration towards thuggery in the building industry. He now wants the Australian people to believe that if he were to become Prime Minister he would seriously retain in its present form the ABCC-that is, the watchdog that protects people in the building industry against the likes of Joe MCDonald, Dean Mighell and Kevin Reynolds. Mr Costello-And Kevin Harkins.",97
67,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, and Kevin Harkins. The ABCC is the watchdog, and what the Leader of the Opposition is now saying is: ‘I'll keep it for two years.' That is not much of a concession on its own. Of course we all know that if he were to become Prime Minister he might keep it in its form for two years but he would deny it funding, he would withdraw its staff, he would denude it of rethe sources and he would make it an absolutely toothless operation from the moment he assumed office. If you think I exaggerate, let me remind you that, on two occasions when the Labor Party and the other parties had the numbers in the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition joined with others to stop this body coming into operation. I have got a couple of division lists. In 2003 on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill, the ayes include a number of very meritorious people like ‘M. Vaile', ‘P. Costello', ‘A. Downer', ‘A. Abbott', and so the list goes on; I think you get my drift. But I now go to the noes. I am sorry to report they include these people. There are ‘Adams' and ‘Albanese' and as I scroll down I come across the name ‘Gillard', that of the deputy leader. How was she voting? She was voting against the very laws that the Leader of the Opposition would now have us believe he has sworn to uphold if he becomes the Prime Minister of this country. If I scroll down a bit further, I come across another name. It comes after ‘Roxon' and it comes before ‘Sawford'. What is it? It is ‘Rudd'. Mr Rudd is the member for Griffith and he is now the Leader of the Opposition-and he voted to kill the watchdog. And he now wants us to believe that he would be in the corner of the average punter on a building site protecting them from the thuggery of Reynolds, MCDonald, Mighell and Harkins! Yet when he had the opportunity, he voted against this body being brought into operation. If it had not been for the wisdom of the voters of Queensland, I am pleased to say, at the last election that gave this parliament four coalition senators, we would never have had the protection of this body and Joe MCDonald would have been able to do his worse on every building site in Western Australia. The only reason this video was taken-the only reason this is an issue-was that the very body that the opposition leader tried to stop being created in the first place came into existence because we were able to pass this through the Australian parliament. The trickery of the Leader of the Opposition on this subject knows no bounds. This morning he was asked about returning the donations of the CFMEU in Western Australia. This is what he had to say, and this is a measure of how tricky he is on this subject. He said: Furthermore, others have raised with me the question of campaign contributions from the Western Australian division of the general construction division of which Mr MCDonald comes. Listen to this; isn't it tortuous? He goes on to say: I have spoken to the national secretary of the party about this this morningyou know: ‘Tell us the truth, Tim, all about this'and I've confirmed with him that the federal campaign has received no contributions from this division of the unionthe federal campaignand I have also confirmed with the national secretary that he will be seeking no campaign contributions from this division of the party as well. That is the greatest piece of trickery and a great charade. I happen to have in my hand a document. It is called ‘Donor to political parties annual return'. It covers the financial year 2004-05. The name of the organisation-I think I can read the handwriting-is: ‘Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, C&C division, Western Australia'. And who is the person completing this form? None other than Joseph MCDonald, who is shown as the ‘Assistant Secretary'. The endearing Joseph lists, in his own fair hand, donations totalling about $70,000 in the financial year 2004-05. What the Leader of the Opposition is asking us to accept is that, if the union of which the dreaded Mr MCDonald is assistant secretary gives $70,000 to the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party, none of that is beneficial to the federal aspirations of the Labor Party in Western Australia. All I can say is that on occasionsMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

The Prime Minister is in order.,99
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I just remind the House that this return signed by Brother Joseph is to the Australian Electoral Commission and that the Australian Electoral Commission, the last time. I checked, was responsible for Commonwealth electoral matters and not for electoral matters in the state of Western Australia. So if Brother Joseph believes there was a federal destination for money, are we seriously to believe this tortu- ject. ous, tortured and sneaky explanation that has come from the Leader of the Opposition about this money? The truth of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition has once again contorted the truth. He has been less than candid, he has been very tricky and he is so far in with the likes of MCDonald and Reynolds that he has to resort to those devices. As to what he is trying to do today with this meaningless stunt of having MCDonald expelled from the Australian Labor Party-and it is a meaningless stunt-if the Leader of the Opposition wanted to demonstrate how tough he is with the unions he would dump the legislation that would bring back the thugs. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I seek leave I to table the article about the CFMEU supporting the Country Liberal Party. Leave granted. Prime Minister",99

77,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hear, hear, Mr Speaker! My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House how the government's investment in road and rail will boost the Australian economy, including in my electorate of Blair, where the population of Ipswich is set to double to 330,000 people in the next 18 years? Are there any threats to the delivery of this investment?",99
78,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Blair for his question. The member for Blair would be well aware that the government is in the middle of delivering $38 billion worth of investment, via the Australian construction industry, in infrastructure in Australiamuch-needed infrastructure that will power growth and productivity in the Australian economy well into the future. Of course, very important to that in south-east Queensland is the level of commitment from our government in terms of making sure the infrastructure in south-east Queensland keeps pace with the growth in population that the member for Blair indicated in his question, particularly in that area outside Brisbane and out towards Ipswich. One of the significant announcements already made, a project to which funding will be going in the early stages of and through AusLink 2, is the development of the Goodna bypass between Brisbane and Ipswich. It is a visionary project that has been championed by the member for Blair against the nay-sayers in the Queensland Labor government and othersMr Bevis-And the Queensland Liberal Party.",99

84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Brisbane!,100
85,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and that is what we are on about. But we want to make sure that this record level of investment that we propose to make in infrastructure across Australia delivers on the ground-that every dollar we have allocated gets spent on building infrastructure, not wasted on either inefficient state bureaucracies or inefficient work practices in those industries. We have seen and heard a lot recently about some of those practices that used to exist in Australia-about a lot of the union intimidation that used to take place when subcontractors were not complying with their wishes. I mentioned earlier this week an example in my own area of a family small business that was nearly drummed out of business, sent bankrupt, because of intimidation by the CFMEU in the construction industry. To their credit, those people went along and gave evidence to the Cole royal commission into the building industry, and as a result of that and other evidence the recommendations of the Cole royal commission were implemented and today we have the Australian Building and Construction Commission as a watchdog, to ensure that those intimidatory practices no longer exist in construction industry workplaces in Australia. As the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have indicated in their comments, what we have been witnessing, what Australians have been appalled by witnessing on television in the last 24 hours, is evidence that those practices do still exist in this industry-evidence that is available only because of the existence of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which provides suphas port and advice to employers in these industries and on these construction sites across Australia. Now, we know what the Labor Party is going to do. We know what the Leader of the Opposition is going to do: he will bone out this commission between now and 2010 until it no longer exists. There will be nobody there protecting the investment that taxpayers make, protecting employers in these industries from the thuggery of some of these unionists like Joe MCDonald in Western Australia. But it does not stop there. That evidence has come from the west coast, but there are also all sorts of interesting activities on the east coast-and not just by the CFMEU; this is rampant throughout the union movement. We read with interest a story in the media today, in the Daily Telegraph, entitled ‘Union violence: officials charged'. The story read: Two National Union of Workers officials, ganisers Charlie Morgan and Bruno Mendonca, were yesterday charged with assaulting and intimidating a Transport Workers Union official, allegedly stomping on and fracturing his feet and throwing him against a wall. These are not other workers. These are not employers. These are not employees intimidating other employees. This is cannibalism within the union movement. This is about turf warfare. This is the NUW wanting to muscle up and strengthen its numbers in advance of the possible election of a Rudd Labor government-and they are salivating about getting back into power. Do you know what the slogan of the NUW is? It is not ‘The interests of workers', it is not ‘Improving the pay of workers' and it is not ‘Improving the safety of workers'. Their slogan is: ‘Organising for power'that is, political power in Australia through the Australian Labor Party. We all know the support they have provided for the Australian Labor Party over the years. While the coalition government is putting in place common sense policies that are delivering new jobs in the Australian economy, the Labor Party is preparing to wreck the economy and hand power back to the union movement.

I am glad that those who sit opposite nod their heads in agreement, because I seem to remember that the member for Fraser and his colleagues asked me the same question in 2004 and in 2001. I gave the answer then-and it was a truthful answer-that it is an enormous privilege to be the Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia. It is surpassed by only one other privilege that is even greater than that, and that is to be Prime Minister of this magnificent country. The people who decide how long I remain in my position as Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia are my parliamentary colleagues in the Liberal Party, and those who decide how long I remain Prime Minister of this country are the people of Australia. As always, I will accept with the very best of grace whatever judgement my fellow Australians make on the contribution I can make to the future of this country. Taxation",101

92,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I, firstly, acknowledge the member for Deakin and congratulate him on the way he represents the electors of Deakin. I think all people who are against thuggery in Australia will be hoping that he is re-elected against the ETU candidate in Deakin, Mike Symon-the Dean Mighell ETU candidate in Deakin. I say that in passing because this Leader of the Opposition is so deeply in hock to the brutal face trade unionism in this country that he just does not know how deeply he is in hock. This government believes in cutting taxes where we can do so. Consistent with balancing our budget and paying off debt, and consistent with funding medical services, pharmaceutical services, defence services and educational services, we believe the tax burden should be as low as possible. That is why on 1 July those Australians who pay income tax will be receiving another income tax cut. 1 July is income tax cut day. It will be done in two ways: by increasing the low-income tax offset and by shifting the threshold for the lowest rate from $25,000 up to $30,000. I also want to remind Australians that, if you happen to be an age pensioner, this week you will be receiving a bonus of $500. Every age pensioner will be getting $500 and every age pensioner couple will be getting $1,000 in recognition of the work they have done in building this economy. I also want to remind all Australians who are self-funded retirees and entitled to the seniors concession allowance that this week they will be receiving a bonus of $500 for an individual and $1,000 for a couple in recognition of the work that they too have done in building the Australian economy. These are some of the social dividends that you can get from running a strong economy-help for the age pensioners, help for the self-funded retirees and income tax cuts for all Australians. I do not want to let the session end without remembering some of the great milestones in this House in previous years. This is the last sitting day before the nation gets to the annual commemoration of ‘fundamental injustice day'. Fundamental injustice day was 30 June 1999. We have heard great speeches in this House but none in their own terms were delivered in a way which was of designed to last 100 years so that, in 100 years time, men would still say that this was the finest hour of the member for Griffith. Let us remember his words on 30 June 1999. He said earnestly to this House: When the history of this parliament, this nation and this century is written, 30 June 1999 will be recorded as a day of fundamental injustice-an injustice which is real, an injustice which is not simply conjured up by the fleeting rhetoric of politicians.

I think what he had in mind is that, if this parliament and its people should last for another 100 years, men would still say this was fundamental injustice day. Let me say what has happened since fundamental injustice day on 30 June 1999. We cut tax on 1 July 2000; we cut tax on 1 July 2003; we cut tax on 1 July 2004; we cut tax on 1 July 2005, 2006, 2007; and we will cut it again on 1 July 2008.

106,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that Mark Textor is the campaign director for the joint BCAACCI advertising campaign; and that Mark Textor brags on his website: Mark has been the common thread in Australian Prime Minister John Howard's succession of election victories, serving as principal campaign pollster and consultant in 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004.",103
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! In calling the Prime Minister, I am not sure that he is responsible for every part of that question. I call the Prime Minister.",103
108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can confirm a number of things. I can confirm that Mark Textor has done polling for the Liberal Party at a federal level since the early 1990s. I can secondly of confirm that his advice has been reasonably accurate over the years. I can thirdly confirm that he does research on a large number of things for the Liberal Party. I can fourthly confirm that that research remains confidential. I can fifthly confirm that Mark Textor, along with Lynton Crosby, a very fine former federal director of the Liberal Party, run a successful business and like anybody in business-I mean, you understand that people have more than one client in business; you do know that-they are entitled to have more than one client. In polling they do not operate a closed shop. I know that you have this mentality that a firm is only meant to have one union, but that does not apply in private enterprise. You can actually have more than one client, and Crosby/Textor have got more than one client-and good luck to them. They run a good show. They are good pollsters, and I wish them well. Workplace Relations",103
109,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister inform the House how a strong watchdog is fighting intimidation in the workplace? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?,103
110,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and note that he and people on this side of the House believe that you have to have a strong watchdog taking care of the construction industry whilst they build Australia. You cannot in any way compromise that watchdog as it goes about its business ensuring that intimidation and thuggery are not part of the building sites and that people who engage in that sort of thuggery are brought to justice. I know the Leader of the Opposition only last night discovered Joe MCDonald. Only when there was a videotape from the Western Australian court obtained by six media organisations did the Leader of the Opposition discover that in his policy of zero tolerance there was no place for Joe MCDonald. It is not as if Joe MCDonald is new on the scene. In fact, I got a list of unlawful conduct, pass and other charges against CFMEU officials, and Joe MCDonald gets a lot of naming. These are the events where he was convicted of trespass: firstly in the early nineties, and then it goes 1998, June 2000, September 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004 and October 2005. He was convicted of assaulting two managers of a building company in August 2005, and then trespass again in February 2006, November 2006 and December 2006. Of course, this is Joe MCDonald-and the Leader of the Opposition discovered it yesterday-facing charges for illegally entering Doric Constructions, Q-Con, Broad Constructions and Pindan Constructions. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday discovered that Joe MCDonald pointed at a camera held by one of our watchdogs and said, ‘Your days are numbered.' So what does the Leader of the Opposition do? He goes to sack Joe MCDonald, but he keeps the policy to make sure that the watchdog's days are numbered. He sacks the messenger but keeps the policy. If that is not hypocrisy when it comes to zero tolerance, I am not sure what is. But it goes even further. Kevin Reynolds, the branch secretary of the CFMEU, has 230 findings of unlawful conduct, the majority of findings against CFMEU officials. Kevin Reynolds is listed as a repeat offender. John Sutton, National Secretary of the CFMEU, on 19 May 2003 pleaded guilty to charges of malicious damage-the CFMEU national secretary engaging in malicious damage. But it goes further than just the CFMEU-what a surprise! The Prime Minister pointed out that in fact Joe MCDonald was donating money to the Australian Labor Party-$70,000 on one occasion. What a surprise then that the Labor Party is not prepared to chuck out two people that have serious charges in the New South Wales courts-Charlie Morgan and Bruno tresMendonca for engaging in alleged intimidation and assault. So Joe MCDonald is thrown out for swearing at a cameraman, but two officials of the NUW still have so-called natural justice even though charges have been laid against them. Do you know what, Mr Speaker? Kevin Reynolds saysMr Crean interjecting",104
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham!,104
112,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Do you know what Kevin Reynolds said today? The member for Hotham is former NUW going into bat for the boys-good on you. Kevin Reynolds said it this morning. Mr Crean interjecting,104
113,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham does not need to respond.,104
114,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it was put to him about Joe MCDonald, Kevin Reynolds said: ‘I've noticed there's a couple of other union officials been arrested for being involved in a punch-up and they are members of the Labor Party and I'm sure he'll have to deal with them now. Well, he has to.' That is Kevin Reynolds-still a member of the Labor Party. Kevin Reynolds says that there are two NUW officials currently with charges before the court, and now Kevin Reynolds is calling on the Leader of the Opposition to take action and draw a line in the sand-zero tolerance. This is thick with hypocrisy. Dean Mighell was thrown out of the Labor Party for swearing, and yet the secretary of the Victorian ALP said, ‘After the election be back.' The Leader of the Opposition said, ‘Not only are we throwing out the individual; we're going to send the money back to the ETU.' We have seen no receipt. No-one has seen any receipt. The money never went back to the ETU; it is still sitting in Labor Party coffers. Today, after he has seen a videotape of Joe MCDonald, despite numerous previous convictions for intimidation and thuggery, now suddenly the Leader of the Opposition tends to believe he has to draw a line in the sand. ‘Zero tolerance,' he says. That is not zero tolerance. Zero tolerance getting rid of the links between the Labor Party and the union movement; zero tolerance is not accepting union money; zero tolerance is not accepting union candidates in seats; and zero tolerance is tearing up the Labor Party's industrial relations laws. Workplace Relations",104
115,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I refer to the Textor opinion poll research revealed in today's newspapers which includes a quote, ‘Everyone is unhappy with the laws'-meaning the Work Choices laws. Has the minister or his office had any discussions with Mark Textor, the BCA, ACCI or their campaign team regarding the Textor polling or the contents or the timing of the BCA-ACCI advertising campaign?",105
116,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Unlike the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, we do not set out to injure business and we do not set out to injure employers. I speak to Mark Textor from time to time. He is a very wise man from time to time. What you do not need to know from polling is that the Labor Party links with the trade union bosses are not well accepted in the community. I speak to the business community all the time. I have no involvement in the business he'll community campaign. I do not even have any detailed knowledge of the business community campaign; I am only aware of what I have read in the newspapers. Out of all of that, yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was saying that we were giving our research to Crosby/Textor; today she is suggesting that Crosby/Textor are giving us their research for some reason. Ms Gillard-Exactly.",105
117,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is that right? I can tell you that Crosby/Textor have not given me is any of their research associated with the Business Council campaign. That is why we are focused on the real deal, which is jobs, employment, higher wages, fewer strikes and getting rid of union thugs. Privacy Act",105
118,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Following that positive contribution, my question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Can the Attorney-General advise the House whether the Privacy Act provides protection for people whose personal details are being misused by organisations to which they belong?",105
119,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. There has never been a more egregious example of seeking a legal opinion from the Attorney. It is out of order.",105
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I listened closely to the question. I did not pick up anything about a legal opinion. It was asking for facts. Mr Albanese-I rise on the same point of order, Mr Speaker. This question was quite clearly not within standing order 100.",106
121,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question was asking for information and details of an act. It was certainly in order. It was asking for details within the Attorney-General's portfolio. Mr Albanese-Because you did not hear the question-I think that was part of your response-I ask that the question be asked again.,106
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Hume will ask his question again for the benefit of the House.,106
123,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is addressed to the Attorney General. Would the Attorney-General advise the House whether the Privacy Act provides protection for people whose personal details are being misused by organisations to which they belong?",106
124,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on the same point of order, Mr Speaker: QED, Mr Speaker; QED.",106
125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was asking for details of an act that is the responsibers bility of the Attorney-General. Mr MCMullan-I rise on the same point of order, Mr Speaker. If a question asking for an interpretation of the implications of a piece of a legislation is not seeking a legal opinion, what is?",106
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say again to the honourable member for Fraser that this is very much in order. In fact, thanks to the Clerk, I would refer honourable members to page 543 of House of Representatives Practice. Mr Bowen-Further to the points of order raised previously and to your reference to page 543 of the House of Representatives Practice, Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the sentence which states: Legal opinions, such as the interpretation of a statute ... should not be sought in questions. This is clearly seeking the interpretation of a statute.",106
127,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Prospect, but there was more to that question than just that point. I rule the question in order and call the honourable Attorney-General.",106
128,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. I am delighted that there is so much interest in privacy matters. Mr Albanese-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. This is a very clear breach of the standing order and of the House of Representatives Practice. We would ask you to rule this question out of order.",106
129,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. I have referred further to the House of Representatives Practice, including page 544. I rule the question in order and I call the honourable Attorney-General.",106
130,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I suspect that all memknow where I am going, because the Privacy Act does provide protection for personal information that people hand over when they join an organisation. The expectation is that that information is needed for the organisation to be able to function or to be able to provide services to the person who is a member of that organisation. If the personal information is going to be used for other purposes or to be given to someone else, there is an obligation on that organisation to inform the individual at the time that they collect that information or to ask their permission. For example, it might be of concern to some union members if their union were to collect personal details from its members and then give them to, for instance, a database company, like Magenta Linus, which can then match this up with other data about them, such as where they live and the electorate in which they live. They might be even more concerned if the union decided to hand the data to a market research company, like E-lect InteractiveMs Roxon interjecting",106
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gellibrand!,107
132,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and to survey members about their voting intention and their attitude to various policy issues. Ms Roxon interjecting,107
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gellibrand is warned!,107
134,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After all, we do have secret ballots in this country. People are entitled to maintain the confidentiality of those matters. That concern might grow further if the union came back to them and started using all the information that they had collected without the person's permission to follow the tactics that are outlined in the ACTU handbook and to lobby them about their voting intentions. There are concerns about the way in which unions are using their members' personal details. I want to inform members that the Privacy Commissioner is giving consideration to starting an own-motion inquiry in relation to the ACTU tactics on this matter. The Privacy Commissioner is an independent statutory officer. She makes her own decisions on these matters. But the Australian Electoral Commission examination relating to the handbook might provide some information which could be of particular interest to her. I would remind the community and members of unions generally that if their union seeks information from them they are entitled to know why and they should make sure that it is necessary for the union's functions. If people believe their personal details are being misused in this way by an organisation that they belong to, they should make their complaints known to the Privacy Commissioner. Ministerial Staff",107
135,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Can the minister confirm that he has been allocated more staff than the Treasurer? Are these extra staff deployed as members of the secret unit that operates out of his Brisbane ministerial office, performing the same role as the secret unit that operates out of the Attorney-General's office in Sydney?",107
136,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no secret media unit in my office. Health Care,107
137,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister update the House on Commonwealth support for health services in New South Wales and, in particular, cancer services in my electorate of Page. Are there any threats to these services, and what is the government's response?",107
138,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I regret to inform him that, despite $14 billion worth of Commonwealth funding under the health care agreements and despite almost $2 billion in GST windfall revenue over the last three years, the New South Wales government is still shortchanging patients in that state. To give one example: the member for Gellibrand keeps saying that there is a dental crisis. She says that is why we need ‘Dentistry Gold', at the cost of $4.7 billion every year. Do not accept what Labor says; watch what Labor does. The New South Wales budget allocated just $4 million more for public dentistry, even though people with no teeth wait up to 2½ years and people in severe pain wait up to three weeks for treatment at the Westmead dental hospital. Above all, the people of northern New South Wales know that you cannot trust Labor with health care. In June 2004, on the strength of an $8 million commitment from the Howard government, the New South Wales Labor government promised a new cancer centre for Lismore Base Hospital. The New South Wales government promised that construction would start by the middle of this year. Now the New South Wales Labor government will not start construction until 2010 at the earliest, and the New South Wales budget delivered a paltry $145,000 for planning, not the $20 million or more that this centre will need. If the Leader of the Opposition can call a national executive meeting to expel Joe MCDonald, why can'the call a Premier to help cancer patients? If the Leader of the Opposition can make 11 phone calls to the editor of the Australian to support a lie, why can'the make a single phone call to Morris Iemma to expedite the construction of this cancer centre? If the Leader of the Opposition can phone-stalk editors to kill stories, using language that would make Dean Mighell blush, why can'the phone-stalk a few premiers to support health services? This guy sends more text messages than Shane Warne. I reckon the editor of the Australian is entitled to ask to go on a do not call ter to protect himself from harassment from the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing orders still matter: 62.",107
139,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I point out to the honourable member for Grayndler that, as I understand it, standing order 62 is about people standing up and not moving quickly to their seats. Mr Albanese-Standing order 64.",108
140,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the minister.,108
141,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I just make the point that the Leader of the Opposition should be just as interested and active in the support of patients as he is in the support of his own shabby political interests. I make this point: the people of Australia are waking up to this guy. They are waking up to this guy and they are rapidly coming to the conclusion that they will not let him do to Medicare what people like Morris Iemma and Bob Carr have done to public hospitals in New South Wales. Climate Change,108
142,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and goes to the Prime Minister's upcoming taxpayer funded television advertising campaign on climate change, which we assume will start in the break. Is the Prime Minister aware that the head of BHP Billiton, Mr Chip Goodyear, when asked this week about Labor's target of 60 per cent cuts in emissions by 2050, stated: Well targets for us, we set targets in every aspect of our business whether it is around profitability or production or cost and so on. Targets give people something to focus on and that is OK by us. Prime Minister, is Mr Goodyear wrong? Through this advertising campaign are you simply seeking to convince the Australian regispeople that climate change sceptics have somehow just become part of the climate change solution?",108
143,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think Mr Goodyear is a very fine businessman. He has run a company very successfully, and one of the things that have happened under his leadership and under the leadership of his predecessor, Paul Anderson, is that there has been a marked change in the industrial relations policies of BHP Billiton. In fact, the old BHP used to believe in centralised wage fixation. The new BHP, now in the BHP Billiton manifestation, has moved progressivelyMs Gillard interjecting",108
144,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is warned!,109
145,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to a less regulated industrial relations system. I do not have to speakMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is a question about climate change.",109
146,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I listened carefully to the question from the Leader of the Opposition. He spoke about the chief of BHP, and the Prime Minister is very much in order.",109
147,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under his leadership, the company that he has so ably led has embraced, by their tens of thousands, AWAs. BHP Billiton is a stern and resolute opponent of the industrial relations policy of the Australian Labor Party, and I endorse everything that Chip Goodyear has said about that. In respect of climate change targets, I also endorse what Mr Goodyear has said about targets, and the interesting thing",109
148,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,109
149,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do. I endorse everything he says, because what he was clearly talking about is the climate change target we currently have. That is the climate change target set by Kyoto. That climate change target is extant until 2012. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I again rise on a point of order. The question was very clear",109
150,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister is answering that question. He is relevant, and, if the member continues to take these frivolous interjections, I will deal with him.",109
151,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have a target, and that target is 108 per cent over els between 2008 and 2012. Although we have not subscribed to the Kyoto protocol or ratified it, Australia is going to be one of the few countries that will actually meet their target. Unlike many of these countries that have sermonised, hectored and lectured Australia, we are going to meet our target. The Leader of the Opposition also asked about BHP Billiton. If my memory serves me correctly, one of the members of the task force that recommended the approach to targets embraced by the government and rejected by the opposition was none other than a Mr Lynch of BHP Billiton. Foreign Policy",109
152,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister explain to the House why strong alliance relationships are vital to Australia's security? Are our alliance relationships in good repair? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies, and what is the government's response?",109
153,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Gilmore. This is the last question time of the first six months of this year, and I appreciate the many members of the government who have asked me questions on great issues of foreign policy. Mrs Irwin-This sounds like a testimonial!",109
154,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Fowler is warned!,109
155,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But not one member of the opposition has asked a single question about foreign policy in six months. That shows you how little they value the great things of Australian foreign policy like the strong alliance we have with the United StatesMr Bowen interjecting,109
156,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Prosour 1990 lev- pect is warned!,109
157,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"which they want to downgrade; the ties we have been building up with Japan, China, Indonesia and India; the pride with which we promote our country around the world; and the respect which Australia has won in many parts of the world. All I can say in answer to the honourable member's question about alternative approaches is that the reason that the opposition has not asked any questions about this issue in six months is that it does not fit in with the spin, it does not fit in with the Hawker Britton strategy and it does not fit in with the insincere and superficial approach that the Leader of the Opposition takes to public issues. But the Leader of the Opposition has occasionally ventured into the area of foreign policy and, of course, professes to be a great expert. Honourable members might recall that he made an overseas trip to the United States of America. They may not recall that, while he was in the United States of America, he did not meet with one single political leader, Democrat or Republican. So the main thing was that there were pictures of him in America, and it did not matter what happened in terms of the substance. Honourable members might remember that the Leader of the Opposition was planning a second overseas visit, and that was to Vietnam. He was going to go to Long Tan and set up a fake dawn service with the Sunrise program. He told the media that he did not know anything about it. Two days later, it was revealed that his office knew all about Of course, that is life in the fast lane. ourable members may remember that the Leader of the Opposition was then going to go to China-one of his great initiatives. He was to lead Australia on initiatives to deal with China, where he once served as a junior diplomat, and to build a climate change relationship with China. He then claimed, when it did not suit him to go-and we all know why he did not go to China-that there were scheduling difficulties. When the Leader of the Opposition sees trade union leaders behaving badly on TVnot when he knows they are behaving badly but when he sees a picture of them on TV behaving badly: swearing, bullying and threatening-he demands that those people resign from the Labor Party. That is apparently the line in the sand. But, when the Leader of the Opposition is exposed over the so-called Sunrise scandal in relation to the Long Tan fake service, he rings up the editors of newspapers and he threatens them and bullies them and swears at them but apparently does not have to resign from the Labor Party because it is not recorded by a television camera. My point is this: the Leader of the Opposition, coming to the end of this session, is a person who has been exposed as superficial and driven by focus groups and the advice of Hawker Britton, which is all very well if, beneath it all, there is a person of substance. But he is not a leader of substance; he is a weak and directionless Leader of the Opposition.",110
158,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Parliament House: Demonstration",110
159,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The members for Lindsay and Hume have asked me questions related to damage caused to the it. front doors and gift shop of Parliament Hon- House during a demonstration in 1996. While documentation related to these matters has been archived and is still being examined, in the interim I am able to offer some limited advice. On 3 September 1996 the then Presiding Officers wrote to the Trades and Labour Council of the Australian Capital Territory and sought payment of $91,000 for the cost of the damage. The Trades and Labour Council issued a press release on 11 September 1996 accepting organisational responsibility for the demonstration but no apportionment of blame was accepted for the riot. The press release further stated the responsibility lay with those individuals directly involved with assault and vandalism. On 25 March 1997 the Speaker advised the House that charges had been laid against 12 people and that a number of convictions had been made. I will provide further information to the members for Lindsay and Hume when available and as appropriate. NA Reports: Government Responses",110
160,The SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"For the information of honourable members, I present a schedule of outstanding government responses to reports of House of Representatives and joint committees, incorporating reports tabled and details of government responses made in the period between 6 December 2006, the date of the last schedule, and 20 June 2007. Copies of the schedule are being made available to honourable members and it will be incorporated in Hansard. The schedule read as follows On 21 June 2007, the Government presented its response to a schedule of outstanding Government responses to parliamentary committee reports tabled in the House of Representatives on 7 December 2006. It is Government policy to respond to parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. Howard Government affirmed the commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation. The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 7 December 2006. It also lists reports for which the House has received no government response. A schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, generally in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings. The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response. The Government's response to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee (other than reports on inquiries) and the Selection Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Reports from other committees which do not include recommendations are only included when first tabled. Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. However, responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within 6 months of tabling a report. The committee monitors the provision of such responses.

168,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"That report identified problems relating to governance, project eligibility, project cost management, project benefits and project delivery-with fault at every level of government-and called on the Department of Transport and Regional Services to exercise more stringent accountability measures. That recommendation was rejected by the department. On 20 June the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister issued an unfounded media release suggesting that the ALP in government would abolish the black spots program. That was a deliberate endeavour to mislead the Australian public. A federal Labor government will be totally committed to the black spots program. The black spots program is too important to the community for funds to be wasted. It is about reducing the loss of lives on Australian roads. But what a Labor government will not do is allow black spot funds to disappear into black holes, as the Minister for Transport and Regional Services is deliberately doing. He should come clean to the Australian public and account for taxpayers' money which has been wasted. NA Question Time",119
169,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, my question relates to your ruling during question time that the interpretation of the Privacy Act was not seeking a legal opinion. As I brought to your attention earlier, page 543 of House of Representatives Practice states: Legal opinions, such as the interpretation of a statute ... should not be sought in questions. Could I also bring your attention to the fact that House of Representatives Practice goes on to approvingly cite Speaker Morrison of the House of Commons, who said: A Question asking a Minister to interpret the domestic law offends against the rule of Ministerial responsibility, since such interpretation is not the responsibility of a Minister ... But it also offends against the rule that a Question may not ask for a Minister's opinion. Mr Speaker, could I ask you to reflect on whether your ruling during question time overturns that long standing precedent? And, for the benefit of the House, when is interpreting a statute a legal opinion and when is it not?",119
170,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Prospect. I would refer him to the following paragraph on the same page as he just quoted, where it goes on to say: Questions asking about the extent to which federal legislation would prevail over State legislation or administrative action have been permitted. In addition it has been ruled that in response to a question dealing with the law a Minister may provide any facts, as opposed to legal opinions, the Minister may wish to give. Questions asking whether legislation existed on a specified subject, whether an agency was entitled to take a particular action, whether certain actions were in breach of regulations, whether offences against Commonwealth laws may have been committed, and what the consequences of certain actions had been, have been permitted.

I think if he refers to pages 552 and 553 of House of Representatives Practice he will note what previous occupiers of the chair have seen in their interpretation of standing order 104.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",120
178,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We started this session in the parliament with questions to the government about climate change. There were questions to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources about whether he would increase the renewable energy target. Those questions were never answered. There were questions to the Prime Minister about whether he understood the consequences of climate change, and he allowed in those answers that perhaps a fourto six-degree increase in temperature might mean that things would be a little bit uncomfortable. We have the best possible evidence on climate change, and the Prime Minister and this government do not get it. Today, the Prime Minister answered the last question in the session before we go to a winter recess by speaking about industrial relations. He did not address the subject of the question at all. That is the summary of the Howard government's approach on climate change. We started the session by asking them questions that they could not answer and we end the session by asking the Prime Minister a question which he completely failed to answer. Anybody sitting in their homes or in their cars, worrying about the impact of climate change on their communities, on their coastline or on their farmlands, will now have heard clearly-for once and for all-that when it comes to the dangerous threats posed by climate change to this country, the Prime Minister just does not get it. In 11 years we have had denial, delay and scepticism. We have had occasional grudging acceptance, but mainly we have had inaction. And the great tragedy of the Howard government's inaction is that it leaves us poorly equipped to deal with the challenges that climate change represents-critically by staying out of Kyoto and by delaying all efforts to allow the market economy to do its work. Australian business has been let down, the Australian community has been let down, and the only way that that will change is for a leader like Kevin Rudd-who understands climate change, commits to addressing climate change and recognises the great moral, economic and environmental challenge that climate change poses for us-to be able to effect policies in this House. More than two years ago, I talked with the then Sydney Futures Exchange-now part of the ASX-about their strong desire for a national carbon trading scheme and the need for such a scheme. That was after nine years of failure to act by this government. Remember, the Sydney Futures Exchange had taken major steps to establish itself as a regional hub for emissions trading. Not unreasonably, it saw the inevitability of emissions trading in Australia and then waited for government action-and it waited, and it waited, and it waited. While the community waits and while the business community waits, what is the government's response? Let's examine it. For those who call for profound action on climate change, there is abuse, ridicule and denigration. For those who believe that it is important to support Kyoto, there is abuse and denigration of the protocol process. Mr Turnbull-What? No ridicule?",121
179,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"‘What? No ridicule?' says the minister, an expert in ridicule. I am sure there will be some coming from your side, Minister, but you will have your chance, don't worry. When it comes to the most important issue for Australians who want to see positive action in developing clean and renewable energies, there is no response and no action. No wonder there is a mood for change in Australia. Australians know that the Howard government just does not get it on climate change. Look at what Andrew Richards, Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Hydro said. He said it simply: … if Federal and State renewable energy targets were abolished … We would probably take that $1.5 to $2 billion investment and take it offshore to places like Chile and Brazil and places like certain jurisdictions in North America like Cali- US EPA. fornia and make those investments in those countries instead of Australia. That is already happening under the Howard government. Whether it is Roaring Forties or whether it is Global Renewables, Australian industries and Australian businesses who want to produce solutions-and who have produced solutions and technology for climate change-are actually going offshore and setting up their businesses in other countries, because the Howard government has failed to provide the right framework for them to invest here in Australia. For this government, when it comes to the climate change debate, it is all about myths and straw men. It is a myth that the government is already acting. It is a fact that the government has underspent on climate change programs by an average of more than 30 per cent over the last 11 years. The government's plan to deal with emissions trading now is to dot nuclear reactors around the country, which will be up and running in 15, 20 or 25 years. That is the government plan. Critically, our greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise to 127 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020. That is government action. In an opinion piece in April this year, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources said: Our leadership in forums such as the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate and the UN climate change framework are further examples of our active international engagement. I put it to the minister that nothing could be further from the truth. I put it to the minister that now, 18 months after the announcement of AP6, where we had a promise of some $360 million from the Bush administration and the Howard government over a period of five years, Australia has spent just $2.1 million and the Bush administration has allocated just $27 million towards this initiative-$26 million which went to the State Department and $1 million which went to the Additionally, we learnt quite recently that the government's key climate change advisers, the Australian Greenhouse Office, have admitted that they have no significant involvement in the climate change side at APEC. In a speech to the Asia Society, the Prime Minister said: The Sydney Summit will be one of the most important international gatherings of leaders to discuss climate change since the 1992 Rio Conference. But how many of our officials are now working on this particular meeting? Very, very few. If the government's key climate change advisers are not providing climate change advice then who is? The answer to that question in part lies in our refusal to sign Kyoto. As every Australian knows, Australia was going to sign Kyoto. The Prime Minister was in favour of it, the foreign minister was in favour of it and the environment minister at the time was in favour of Kyoto. But then, once the Americans had decided which way they were going to go, we followed the Republican administration on climate change policy and we did not follow the original decision taken by the Howard governmentand, frankly, a decision that should have been taken a long time ago. Another one of the government's myths is that we should not do anything about our emissions because our emissions are too small, and it is now up to China and Indiathese developing countries that are emitting a lot of greenhouse gases. This ignores the primary fact that it is up to every country to take responsibility for its emissions. Everyone has to play their part. Everybody has to do some heavy lifting. Australians want to do that. We are team players. We recognise that we need to make that kind of effort and take that kind of action. We realise that our emissions are not insignificant at all. They are significant emissions, particularly in terms of where they are going under the Howard government policies, with an increase of 127 per cent over 1990 levels by 2020. The government likes to point the finger at China and India, but the truth is we are in this together. Some 70 per cent of human greenhouse gas in the atmosphere has been put there by developed nations. It has already been put there by us and by our developed nation partners. We represent some 20 per cent of the people on earth and we have a responsibility to ensure that we act here in our own home to reduce emissions. I think one of the most significant things that have happened in the last three weeks was the decision by the G8 when it said: We have agreed that the UN climate process appropriate forum for negotiating future global action on climate change. It was at this point that the fig leaf the Howard government had erected around itself to claim that by being an observer at international agreements it was supporting the UN framework completely fell away. Why is that? Because the government has always argued that other initiatives, multilateral tiatives, are going to be as significant as Kyoto. It has denigrated Kyoto. It has talked about new Kyotos and post Kyotos, yet the G8 itself specifically said: We have agreed that the UN climate process is the appropriate forum for negotiating future global action on climate change. Let me say to the House and to the Australian people: that is Labor Party policy. That is what we have been saying in this House ever since this parliament first sat. That is policy that has been part of the Labor approach to climate change since the climate change blueprint was first developed. Yet the government refuses here and now to join in and still continues to denigrate Kyoto. The next myth that is put about by the government is that renewable energy in particular cannot make a significant contribution to meeting our energy needs and reduce emissions. The Prime Minister said it clearly on 18 May. He said: The greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear power are zilch, nothing, zero virtually, and just as good, if not better than solar and wind. He said: Now solar and wind are fantastic on the margins but you can't run a power station on solar power, you'd have to have a lot of those panels wouldn't you, they'd cover the whole of Queensland and the Northern Territory, I mean it'd be enormous. We can't rule out nuclear. The Prime Minister is wrong about baseload issues generally in terms of what can be prois the vided for baseload in this country, and a number of experts have pointed that out. More importantly, this is an irrational objection to the contribution that renewable energy can make to meet our energy needs. Instead, we get a plan for 25 nuclear reactors-not only nuclear reactors but, now it seems, following the comments from Mr Macfarlane, the Minister for Industry, Tourini- ism and Resources, nuclear reactors which will also serve as nuclear waste dumps. For all those Australians living anywhere from Port Phillip Bay up the New South Wales coast past Jervis Bay up towards south-east Queensland, where nuclear reactors could be located, they are also going to get a nuclear waste dump. For the 25 or 30 years that they have a nuclear waste dump in their backyard-the term of the reactors that the Howard government plans to put in place in this country to deal with climate changewe will see the creation of some 40,000 tonnes of the most toxic substance that humanity produces: radioactive waste. Is this a mate change solution for Australia? No, it is not. I was very interested to read in the just released Trends in sustainable development annual review report that global investment last year in sustainable energy was $70.9 billion. This UN report concluded that clean energy could provide almost a quarter of the world's electricity by 2030. Whilst sustainable energy only accounts for two per cent of the world's total now-and I know the minister will make this point-the report shows that 18 per cent of all power plants under construction are in this sector and that figure continues to grow. This is the future for dealing with climate change. Australians know we have abundant supplies of solar energy in the amount of sunlight that hits our continent, and that we have fantastic solar scientists who lead the world in technology and innovation. Why haven't we got the best solar industry in the world? Why aren't we now starting to produce power from solar energy, power that goes into the grid? Why haven't Australians got solar panels on the roofs of their homes and their schools storing that clean power, that renewable energy? If they did that, they would be making a contribution to climate change. The reason we are not able to do that, the reason we are not a solar nation and we are on the way to becoming a nuclear nation, is the Howard government. The Howard government just does not get it on renewables. The Howard government just does not get it at all. The Prime Minister insists that the only solution to climate change is to build nuclear reactors that produce radioactive waste. The Liberal Party has more plans than that. It just does not stop there. At the Liberal Party Federal Council that was held recently, an interesting recommendation was adopted and passed unanimously. It said that Australia should look at going further, that we cli- should look at nuclear enrichment and at being a worldwide repository for radioactive waste. I want to hear from the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources as to what the Howard government's plans are about Australia being a worldwide repository for radioactive waste. At the same time as climate change continues to impact upon us and we do nothing about renewable and clean energy, they are advancing a plan for Australia to be the world's repository for radioactive nuclear waste. That is the question that the minister has to answer. It was interesting when we had a debate in the parliament quite recently. I think that one of the remarks that the minister made was that the member for Kingsford Smith despises scientists. I just want to put it on the record that I actually do not despise scientists at all. In fact, the target that the Labor Party has set, of some 60 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, is a science based target. That is clearly acknowledged and well understood. I note the comments of Dr Jim Hansen, who has contributed to the IPCC reports and is probably one of the world's leading climate experts. He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and won the Duke of Edinburgh Conservation Medal last year. He and five other prominent US scientists recently concluded that ‘greenhouse gas emissions place the Earth perilously close to dramatic climate change that could run out of control, with great dangers for humans and other creatures.' When scientists bring us those reports, we understand how urgent and necessary it is for real action on climate change-not speeches but real action-and we have not had real action from the Howard government.

180,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Wentworth-Minister for the Environment and Water Resources) (3.54 pm)-I thank the honourable member for Kingsford Smith for reminding me of James Hansen's recent paper on climate changeMr Garrett interjecting,125
181,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Kingsford Smith was not interjected on at all and I will not tolerate an interjection from him.,125
182,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Dr Hansen has produced a paper which argues that the consequences of climate change will be more extreme than the forecasts set out in the most recent IPCC report. The IPCC is the leading body that addresses climate change. It is a consensus process that involves many, if not most, of the world's leading climate scientists, including many from Australia. Obviously everybody is entitled to a point of view, but the IPCC represents the most solid and reliable basis upon which to form government policies, planning decisions and so forth. It is very interesting that the member for Kingsford Smith embraced Dr Hansen's paper so enthusiastically, because one of the things that Dr Hansen said, when his paper was released, was that the world has to stop burning coal. That reminds me, of course, of the member for Kingsford Smith, who said that there can be no certainty about the future of the coal industry. I think he was referring particularly to the Hunter Valley. Ultimately, where the member for Kingsford Smith is coming from is essentially a position that deeply dislikes and distrusts a modern and growing society with strong economic growth, such as we have in Australia. It is quite interesting. He tries to change his spots all the time. He ducks and weaves. He has abandoned almost all of the positions he has had in his life-or has purported to abandon them. I noticed that the other day, on 14 June, in responding to the emissions trading task group report-which, of course, has stressed the gravity of the economic consequences of climate change and how careful we have to be in calibrating our response to it; all perfectly rational and sensible comments and insights that any business like person, any non-fanatical person, would take-that the member for Kingsford Smith said to CEDA: ... the Coalition is falling back on the outdated notion that you can either have a healthy economy or a healthy environment; but that you can't have both. We have a healthy environment and a healthy economy in Australia. The fact is that our environment would not be as healthy as it is if it were not for the healthy economy. We would not have been able to spend $20 billion on environmental endeavours in the last 11 years without a strong economy, without the surpluses that the strong economic management of the Howard government has delivered. We would not have $10 billion to invest in the National Plan for Water Security, let alone $2 billion in the Australian Government Water Fund, without a strong economy. So, quite plainly, our position and our track record demonstrate that we believe that a healthy economy can support a healthy environment, because you need to have the wherewithal for the measures to be able to afford the investments to protect the environment. The member for Kingsford Smith was in fact criticising himself. It was only a few years ago-three years and one month agoin May 2004, when he said in the Herald Sun: ... economic growth is almost always accompanied by a commensurate increase in environmental degradation. That is really the key to the member for Kingsford Smith. He does not like economic growth. He is determined to be pure by his fanatical lights. He has no regard for the economic consequences of the policies he argues for. He argues from his own selfimagined moral position. He does not care how poor we have to be in order to become pure. The member for Kingsford Smith and the Leader of the Opposition have no understanding of the environmental realities of climate change or the economic consequences of dealing with it. Firstly, Labor do not recognise the global nature of climate change. It is called global warming for a readid son. A tonne of CO2 that goes into the atmosphere has the same impact on the world's temperature, regardless of where it comes from-whether it is emitted in Australia, Europe, China or the United States. So an effective global response is vital. Labor is wedded to the Kyoto protocol. They see it as a sacrament. Again, that is a key to Labor's response. It is all about symbols and it all comes from the heart; there is no head or clear thinking. Think about this: the first phase of the Kyoto protocol, or the first commitment period as it is called, has comprehensively failed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. How do I know that? Because we know that the consequence of the measures encompassed in the first phase of the protocol will be a reduction in the growth of greenhouse gas emissions by one per cent. That is nothing. That is so far away from what the world needs to achieve by mid-century. It is a failure. Why did it fail? It failed because of attitudes that are personified by the member for Kingsford Smith. It is a fantasy that developed countries, riven with the sort of middleclass guilt that the member for Kingsford Smith manifests, should reduce their greenhouse gas emissions unilaterally and there should be no obligations on the fastest growing economies. The lack of a pathway for the fastest growing economies in the developing world, particularly China and India-and China is an industrial giant the like of which we have never seen before in the world's history-to reduce their emissions is the key to understanding what is wrong with Kyoto. That is why the United States Senate refused to ratify it. It is why President Clinton and Vice President Gore never submitted it to the Senate, any more than their successor, President Bush, did. And it is the reason that Australia not ratify it. That failure in Kyoto, that flaw, is contained in a clause of the treatythe treaty which at this juncture the Labor Party believes we should ratify. Article 3.9 says that in the subsequent commitment period-and the next commitment period is what we are discussing now because the first commitment period begins next year and ends in 2012-obligations to cut emissions should only be imposed on countries in annex 1-that is, developed countries. That does not include China or India. China and India's negotiating position is, ‘That's it! You in the developed world keep making cuts.' The problem is that if the world is to achieve a massive cut in global emissions by mid-century-whether it is 40 per cent, 50 per cent or 60 per cent; whatever it may be it is a big number so take your pick-it cannot achieve that without substantial action from the developed world. In fact, as the emissions trading task group sets out, if the developed world were to cut its emissions by 2050 to 50 per cent of 1990 levels and there was business as usual in the developing world we would still be way over 1990 levels in 2050. Even to keep ourselves at the existing level-that is, no increases from today-the developing world has to make a substantial cut in emissions. What is happening in the developing world? Some interesting statistics have come out from the Dutch government, which show that China's emissions from fossil fuels have now overtaken those of the United States. They grew last year by nine per cent while the United State's emissions were minus one per cent. Mr Garrett-What about per capita?",125
183,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is a very good intervention from the member from Kingsford Smith. He said, ‘What about per capita?' This again is where the Labor Party's position on climate change fundamentally betrays Australia's national interest. The member for Batman knows I am dead right. Because if you buy the argument that we should wait until China has the same per capita levels of emissions as Australia, emissions will be at a level not even imagined by the most dire scenarios. This of course is what I suspect the member for Kingsford Smith would like, because he cannot wait to get that hairshirt on and to suffer a bit-or at least get others to suffer. If we were to reduce our emissions to the per capita level of China's would devastate our economy. The fact is that the problem with Labor's climate change policy-there are two main planks-is, firstly, the Kyoto protocol, as it stands, is a derstand. mechanism that has failed. By the way, everybody now recognises that except for the Australian Labor Party. At the G8 summit, which the member for Kingsford Smith referred to, the largest developed nations of the world endorsed a new approach and it is exactly the same approach that the Australian government has been pursuing bilaterally and multilaterally through the AP6-that is, a process of engaging the developing countries and recognising that they need to be part of the solution because we have to get global reductions. The communique said: We recognise, however, that the efforts of developed economies will not be sufficient and that new approaches for contributions by other countries are needed. Again, Labor do not understand that. They think they can continue with the same old failed approach because it is a sacrament. It is like putting a ‘Save the whales' sticker on your car and not being prepared to do anything about it. It is empty symbolism, but it is very expensive symbolism. If we as a nation were to follow Labor's policy and commit ourselves to a very large cut in emissions by 2050 unilaterally and unequivocally-and that is what Labor proposes-then that would mean we would be putting a substantial cost on our carbon and energy intensive industries. Remember that thousands of Australian workers have jobsmany of them belonging to members of trade unions who pay for the advertising of the Labor Party-that depend on low-cost energy from coal. If we impose an additional cost on those industries which is not matched by the countries with which they compete, all that will happen is that the industries will move offshore with the emissions, so the it world will be no better off, and we lose the jobs. The phenomenon of carbon leakage is a fundamental economic factor that the member for Kingsford Smith simply does not unIf you look at the industrial growth in China, you will see that in the last five or six years China has become the producer of nearly half the world's cement, nearly half the world's flat glass, 35 per cent of its steel and 30 per cent of its aluminium. What has been happening is that developed countries, particularly in Europe, have been deindustrialising, thereby reducing their emissions, and, instead of making the cement themselves and having the emissions go up into the atmosphere from their own countries, importing it from China. Now, the world is no better off. The men and women that worked in the cement plant have lost their jobs, but the world is no better off from a climate point of view because the emissions have still gone up into the air. That failure to recognise the global reality of climate change and the dire economic consequences Labor's policy could impose on Australia is again a reminder of how you cannot trust the Labor Party with economic management-because climate change is an enormous challenge and probably the biggest one our country faces, the world faces, at the moment. By contrast, the government's emissions trading task force in its report says that the targets must be set after careful economic analysis. And, while a long-term aspirational target can be set-and that will be informed in the course of the next year by the G8 discussions and the discussions that are going to happen between the 15 largest greenhousegas-emitting economies, including Australia and led by the United States, at the meeting in Bali-every target along that time line has to be reset and calibrated in light of the cost of technology, the economic consequences of setting it and the reactions and attitudes of other countries. In other words, meet the challenge, reduce our emissions, but do so in a way that ensures we do not indulge in a futile, self-destructive exercise in moralising, which is what the Labor Party's policy is all about. It is all about sacrificing Australian jobs, sacrificing the Australian economy, in an effort to be pure by the member for Kingsford Smith's lights, regardless of how poor we must become to do so.",127
184,Ms KATE ELLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance: the government's absolute failure to address the challenges that climate change poses to the Australian economy. I particularly welcome the opportunity to respond to some of the minister's points during his 15 minutes of trying to justify this government spending the last 11 years doing nothing to seriously tackle dangerous climate change. After 11 long years of neglect, this government is now trying to play catch-up in the climate change stakes, but its efforts are transparent and clearly politically motivated. In order to effectively tackle climate change we need three essential ingredients: acknowledgement, initiative and leadership. Sadly, this government has demonstrated time and again that it is lacking on all of these fronts. For the past 11 years, we on this side have consistently called for an earnest acknowledgement that climate change is the biggest environmental crisis that we face; comprehensive and holistic policy initiatives; and a government that is prepared to show leadership, not just to its constituents but to the world. The Howard government, over the last 11 years, has shown just how comprehensively it lacks all three of those ingredients. By contrast, federal Labor has taken the initiative in bringing the issue of climate change into the political spotlight, and now the government is doing nothing more than playing catch-up. But I am afraid that, after 11 long years of neglect, it is simply too late for the government to pretend it is engaged with the climate change challenge. Recently, the issue of climate change has become heavily politicised, but tackling this threat requires more than poll driven motivation: it requires honest and earnest leadership. While the government today masquerade as believers in climate change, the reality, as we all know, is that they do not accept it. The government's track record on climate change says it all. A report released in the first half of 2007 by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change revealed that the Howard government has known about the very real dangers of climate change and its environmental, social and economic impacts since it was elected in 1996. What an absolute disgrace it is that the Howard government has known for 11 years about the threat that climate change poses to our way of life and to the quality of life facing future generations, yet it has maintained a position of ‘climate change scepticism'or, more accurately, climate change denial. The government's inaction is so evidently seen through its failure to commission economic modelling on climate change so that we can more thoroughly analyse its economic impact and the risks of inaction. In stark contrast to the government's approach, the Leader of the Opposition and the state governments have commissioned Professor Ross Garnaut to review the economic costs of climate change inaction by reviewing its impacts and costs. The government has had 11 long years to commission such research, but once again the initiative was left to the Australian Labor Party. The government's assertions that nuclear power is our only answer to climate change woes is, put simply, ridiculous, as well as misleading. As the member for Kingsford Smith pointed out, even the optimists among the government who are pushing this particular policy say that it will be possible in 15 to 25 years. I say to this parliament that we do not have 10 to 15 to 25 years to get serious about addressing climate change; we must do so now. This response by the government is reckless, and it will produce a greater environmental burden than it will relieve. The past 11 years have seen huge underinvestment in the climate change challenge and transparent rhetoric designed to polarise the debate between sceptics and radicals. The reality is that the Australian public's concern about climate change is not a radical position; it is a mainstream one-and that is the only reason the government are now attempting to appear like they are responding to it. Within my electorate of Adelaide, the issue of climate change is weighing heavily on the minds of the constituents that I come here to represent. One concerned constituent recently wrote to me outlining her exasperation about the sheer number of problems that climate change poses. She wrote: Climate change is real and I am very concerned for the future of my children and all future generations. Higher temperatures, reduced rainfall, huge changes to the ecosystems on which our lives, all lives, depend, sea-level rises, alpine area decrease, Great Barrier Reef loss … the list goes on … This is a common feeling throughout my electorate and indeed right across Australia. But, in addition to these environmental and social impacts, climate change poses a severe threat to the Australian economy. Australia's future prosperity relies on a commitment to tackling climate change and an emissions reduction framework within which businesses and industry can work. The costs of action are real, but the costs of inaction are huge, particularly for our agricultural and tourism industries. Modelling released by both the Business Roundtable on Climate 10 to Change and the Stern report has confirmed this. On this side of the House, Labor has committed to a reduction in greenhouse pollution of 60 per cent on 2000 levels by the year 2050 and to establishing an emissions trading scheme by 2010. It is widely recognised that both of these initiatives are required to tackle the environmental and economic threats posed by climate change. The Business Roundtable on Climate Change, which includes leading Australian companies such as BP, Westpac and IAG, has lent its support to this initiative, expressing unequivocally that climate change poses a severe threat to business and requires immediate action. The round-table's research found that delays in setting a carbon price signal through an emissions trading scheme would ultimately double the cost of such a target and see the cost of electricity rise and the destruction of 250,000 jobs. Labor will uphold its long standing commitment to significantly increase the mandatory renewable energy target and provide support for the renewable energy industry. Australia is one of the best placed countries in the world to establish a viable renewable energy industry, but some of our first-class scientists and technicians have been forced to take their research offshore, particularly in the field of solar energy research. A holistic approach to overcoming this challenge requires policy action at an international and federal level as well as at a grassroots level. A lot of the constituents that I represent often say to me, ‘What can I do to do my bit, even if my federal government aren't doing theirs?' There are many Australians keen to green their homes, but they are held back by the financial constraints of taking such action. The up-front costs of greening the average family home can be significant, even though greener energy is likely to save that household money in the long term. That is why Labor has committed to providing low-interest loans of $10,000 for Australian households to implement energy and water savings and provide rebates for rooftop solar power panels. Australian households need help up front to green their homes and we on this side of the House are prepared to offer this to help the community. Furthermore, any government serious about climate change must ratify the Kyoto protocol. The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources spoke about how we need to recognise that global warming has a global nature. We on this side of the House recognise that, and that is why we think we need a global solution. Labor would take immediate action to ratify the Kyoto protocol and further strengthen such action through diplomatic initiatives with China. Kyoto holds the best hope of tackling climate change at a global level and offers a world of opportunities that have so far been missed. Importantly, it also offers Australia the opportunity to have a seat at the table as the rules are developed for the international market beyond 2012. If every other country followed the rationale that the minister outlined in this House and said, ‘We will not act until they do,' where on earth would we be? We would be in a position of there being absolutely no action while everyone sat back desperately waiting for someone to show leadership. It is the role of the Australian government to show leadership and act. The Howard government has systematically failed over the past 11 years to address the challenge of climate change and to position the Australian economy for a lowcarbon future. The government has failed to step up and show global leadership in tackling the climate change burden. Instead, it has undermined global initiatives by refusing to ratify the Kyoto protocol. On this side of the House, we take the threat of climate change seriously and we will address it in government with the energy and urgency it deserves. Economically, climate change poses a severe threat but also provides a number of opportunities. Morally, it is all about obligations to urgently act. We on this side of the House will tackle the challenges of climate change head-on and embrace the opportunities with open arms. (Time expired)",128
185,Mr BROADBENT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will come to the issue of the action the federal government has taken, and that may enlighten the member for Adelaide. However, I put to you that a leopard never changes its spots, will not change its spots and cannot change its spots. I refer to the member for Kingsford Smith-a nice guy, a good bloke-who is affable and friendly and has shown himself to be highly talented inside and outside this building. However, as the member for Adelaide said, ‘given power' will he not remember his roots? Will he not remember the previous positions he has taken on matters of the environment? Will he not remember his documented attitudes? Will he not remember the zeal he had for the environment? Will he not remember that from those positions he is currently at odds with his own party? Will he not remember those things if he ever deigns to become the minister for the environment in a new government? I raise that because my constituents in MCMillan and the constituents of Gippsland are concerned about exactly those issues: with his close relationship with the Greens and their policies, what will happen if the member for Kingsford Smith becomes the minister for the environment? People in Gippsland may not all work in a power station, but every one of them knows somebody who does. They know that they are the generations of people who have supplied the baseload power for Victoria and now for Australia. They feel threatened by the member for Kingsford Smith's previous attitudes and his attitudes today. When you set a target you need to know the consequences of that target for the nation, for the nation builders of Gippsland and for the generations not only of the past but into the future. The Greens keep saying, ‘The dirty coal power station at Hazelwood,' but it is the only power station at the moment that is recycling all its water out of the Hazelwood pond. Let us start looking after and appreciating the assets that we have. The assets are those workers who are connected to the Gippsland Trades and Labour Council, and I know some of you will be listening today and if you are not listening, because you are about to do your shift, your wife, your friend, your daughter or your son will be listening. The banner holder for the Australian Labor Party is the member for Kingsford Smith, Peter Garrett. I tell you the workers shake in their shoes because they know that the Labor Party and the Greens have a mind-set to close down Hazelwood power station, put restrictions on Loy Yang and rely on the gasfired power station that is running practically full time now because of a lack of water in the Latrobe River. The Labor Party, under the member for Kingsford Smith, would be zealots and the workers know it and they are concerned about it. When the workers come to vote they will let the Labor Party know in no uncertain terms that they see what was their own constituency, what is their natural voting pattern, as an actual threat to their jobs, because the Labor Party has set a target without heeding the consequences of what it would mean to the power industry in Victoria, in the Hunter or at Collie in Western Australia. These workers know and their management knows that their jobs are on the line on this issue and we have to have regard for that. This economy, as the member for Wentworth, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, said, has to be managed. It does not just happen; it has to be managed. A major part of the growth of the economy in Australia has been the relative access to reasonably priced electricity for every household. There is a lot we can do. There is always more to do as a nation in reducing our consumption of power and resources. I am sure that not only has the government has done a lot already but it will be doing more into the future. But I am going to support the people in the Gippsland Trades and Labour Council and they are going to know that they have somebody who is standing in this place who has recognised that their interests are important and who is not acting just for the sake opportunistic political zealotry and just for the sake of the green votes in the cities. We have an important role to play as parliamentarians to protect our own constituency and to make sure that they have jobs and futures. You say: ‘But the minister has said climate change is a real issue. The member for Adelaide has said we need immediate action.' Here is the immediate action. We have taken not only immediate action but past action and you have to ask: would the Labor Party have done any better? Would the Labor Party have done anything different to that which the Howard government has achieved? I put to you that the answer is no. I know, as the Prime Minister read out the other day, that we have done all of these things. Do I need to go through them again? The Renewable Remote Power Generation Program has been established. A further $123 million was announced on 14 August last year, bringing total funding for the program to $328 million. In 1999 the Photovoltaic Rebate Program was introduced. A further $150 million was announced bringing the total funding to $202 million. In 2004 there was the energy white paper, which was so important to the seats of Gippsland and MCMillan, and which was very important in giving the power industry and those who work within that industry a guide to the future. In that white paper, the government announced that $75 million had been provided for the Solar Cities trials. Adelaide was announced as the first solar city in August 2006; then Townsville, on 26 September; Blacktown, on 13 November; and Alice Springs, on 16 April 2007. In October 2006, $75 million was allocated to a large-scale solar concentrator in north-west Victoria under the $500 million low emissions technology development initiative. On 1 November 2006-the member for Adelaide might like to note-$14.5 million was allocated to solar of energy projects under the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. The Australian government have provided industry grants of over $28 million for geothermal energy projects and recently announced the Geothermal Industry Development Framework. These grants include the following. In 2007 we gave $5 million to Petratherm Ltd to further develop its groundbreaking approach of using geothermal energy at its site in the Flinders Ranges. The government awarded $1.2 million to Proactive Energy Developments Ltd for a project that aims to develop an innovative regenerator for the production of low-cost, zero-emission electricity from geothermal reserves. In 2006 we gave $2.4 million to Geothermal Resources Ltd for a project in South Australia to map granites to assess geothermal energy potential. In 2005 the government gave $3.9 million to Scope Energy Ltd for a proof of concept project. I can go on and on. All of these things have been so important in the climate change debate. We were already in there, we were already acting, we were already looking forwards to what we would do with these issues. While the government have been acting, all the state Labor government have done is carp about and criticise what we were doing. Geodynamics Ltd in 2002 got $6.8 million to develop a deep underground heat exchanger to harness hot, dry rock geothermal energy. In 2000 the government granted $790,000 for exploration of hot, dry rock resources in the Hunter Valley. It just does not stop. The Howard government has a proud record and this motion obviously was not sensibly based.",131
186,Mrs ELLIOT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In the very short time remaining I want to comment on the fact that this government's inaction when it comes to the environment has been disgraceful and that not taking any action in relation to the environment will be its legacy. I want to raise one particular issue of grave concern in my electorate and that is this government's plan to build a dam right in the middle of the electorate, right next to the village of Tyalgum. It really is a disgrace that the Minister the Environment and Water Resources will not go and actually speak to the locals about their concerns. Many invitations have been issued to him, and I again invite him to come to Tyalgum and listen first hand to people's concerns about the devastation that this dam would cause to the rural village of Tyalgum and also about the detriment to our rivers as well. I call on the environment minister to rule out this dam near the village of Tyalgum. He needs to speak first hand to people. He cannot keep running away from this issue.

188,The SPEAKER,MS KATE ROBERTSON,"As members would be aware, one of our longest serving staff members, Kate Robertson, is retiring after 21 years. Kate started with the parliamentary catering service in 1986 at Old Parliament House, in the staff dining room, before moving into the members and guests bar. Kate was one of six staff who were sent to work on the opening of the new Parliament House in 1988, and she worked on the first ever function held here at the new Parliament House, in the post office gallery area. Kate has worked in many parts of our house. She started up here in the staff dining room, where she saw the queues on budget day 1988 stretching from the staff dining room to the members hall. From the staff dining room, Kate managed the Queen's Terrace Cafe for two years before moving up for into the members dining room and has been affectionately mothering the members ever since, being a part of our lives, a good friend and a confidante for many.

190,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"You know a government have failed when they no longer talk about policy and no longer come into this place talking about the future of Australians, the future of this country or the future of the economy. You know they have failed, you know they are panicked and you know they are spooked when they come in here and just attack other people. Personal attacks-nothing more, nothing less-are all they have left in their little kitbag of election-winning strategies. It is a disgrace, and the government should be held accountable for it. What disturbs me even more is that this is a catch-up government. After 11 years it is left drunk with power, lazy with contempt and arrogant with entitlement. This is a ernment that no longer sees its role as providing anything fair and decent for the Australian people. This is a government that no longer sees its responsibility as achieving something for the future good of this nation or the nation's own benefit. This is a government that sees itself simply now as getting re-elected and retaining the halls of power-this is all that it is now about. It is not about the future of Australia; it is about its own future. After 11 years we see catchup politics in a whole range of areas-in climate change, in infrastructure, in education and, in particular, in broadband. In the case of broadband, it is a disgracelia ful attempt by the government in the five minutes to midnight before an election to come up with a scrambled together plan. I call it a flawed plan, but, even worse, it is ‘fraudband'. This is a government that is fraudulently going out to the people with maps. I know people cannot see it on broadcast, obviously, but the government is sending information to the electorate of Oxley in Queensland and claiming that 100 per cent of people in Oxley will be covered, but, when I look at the map, I do not see any of the government's broadband spots contained in Oxley, and the red marks around them barely touch into Oxley. But what is more disturbing is that the good people of Oxley completely miss out in this government's plan. areas like Springfield, where there are black spots of broadband, there is nothing. In areas like Forest Lake, where there are broadband black spots, there is nothing from the government. In areas such as Algester, which once belonged to the electorate of Moreton but is now in Oxley, I can guarantee the people I will be fighting for their broadband future and for their kids, but there is nothing from this government-not one bit of broadband. At Seventeen Mile Rocks, another area where there are broadband black spots, there gov- is nothing at all from this government. This government has the audacity to come into this place and claim that it will be spending more than $1 billion of taxpayers' money to somehow provide 99 per cent coverage. The reality is that it is just not true. This is a failed government, with failed policy, that is out there telling people porkies. The government is copying Labor's policies, and all they are is light-‘Labor light' policies. It has no policies of its own and it has certainly not been truthful about what it will cost consumers to get the legendary wireless and WiMAX into the home and fulfil the claim that 99 per cent of all people in Austrawill be covered. The government is claiming 100 per cent in Oxley, but when I look at the nodes and where they will be it is more like zero per cent. That is the reality. That is what has been provided to me via information that was slipped under my door at five minutes to midnight because this government cannot take the decent time after 11 years to actually work on some real policy. I have a couple of questions for the Prime Minister and for the minister for communications: can they confirm advice from Telstra and Austar that the unwired signal-the government's WiMAX broadband network-is likely to drop out or denigrate whenever a cordless phone, the garage door opener or the microwave is used? Have they addressed In that issue? I know that they have not. Can they also confirm that there is no existing laptop computer in Australia that will be able to access the network without attaching a special network card, which will cost up to $300, to protect that network? We will not get any answers from the government on that because they are not interested in that either. They are just interested in the Textor polling and the propaganda that they have been out there getting information for. I further ask: would the Prime Minister confirm the assessment of Gartner wireless and mobile research director, Robin Simpson, that said, ‘Access to the government's WiMAX broadband network will cost users in regional Australia up to $1,000 in installaThe tion costs.' Is the government going to fork out for that as well? I do not think so. It is hoodwinking the Australian public and the Australian community into believing that at five minutes to midnight it actually cares about people's broadband future. Labor brought this issue to the table, and the only reason this government cares anything about the future of broadband is for its own future-for its electoral future. It has nothing to do with consumers or the future of Australians in Australia. People will not be hoodwinked. They know who cares about them and it is not this government. (Time expired) University of Western Sydney",133
191,Mrs MARKUS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak about a most important and unfortunate decision made by the US. The board announced this week that it would close the Nirimba campus of the university by 2009. I do not support this decision; in fact, I oppose this decision vehemently. This is, in my view, short-sighted and not in the best interests of current and future students of Western Sydney. Firstly, let me correct for the public record statements made by the member for Chifley today. This is not the Howard government's decision; it is the board's decision and the board's decision alone. In fact, the board made this decision without consultation with me or with the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training. Secondly, the member for Chifley asked me to make a public statement. Let me make it clear that I made my public statement on Monday. Since last Wednesday, I have been in consultation with the vice-chancellor, Janice Reid, and Rhonda Hawkins. I have made it clear that I would oppose this decision. I have also called upon them to have an urgent meeting with me and the federal minister. vice-chancellor stated that she was unavailable as she was flying overseas this Monday for three weeks. The students who are currently at her campus in Nirimba and also the future students that will be coming in from the north-west sector are more important. I will indeed fight for the best interests of not just current students but future students of the Western Sydney campus of Nirimba and the young people who are moving into this area. I have spoken directly to Julie Bishop, the federal minister, and we both confirm that there has been no consultation with us regarding this. I am extremely disappointed, as I have had an open-door policy and in fact in recent weeks have met with the vice-chancellor and a number of members of the University of Western Sydney board, professors and Rhonda Hawkins to discuss their future plans. At no point was this decision mentioned. I would like to clarify a few financial facts. Firstly, the Australian government contributes over 70 per cent of the US's revenue. In 2006, the US received $271.5 million from the Australian government, plus an additional $50 million for the medical school. The US's operating surplus is its biggest since 1996. It has grown from an operating surplus of $8.2 million in 2005 to an operating surplus of $39.8 million in 2006. The question I ask the board is this: why can't they choose to use the financial surplus that they currently have to support the current and future students of Western Sydney on their doorstep? This campus is located in a significant part of Sydney: the north-west sector, which is the size of Canberra and one of the greatest growth corridors in New South Wales, and which is on its doorstep. Students are stepping into years 11 and 12 in new schools for the first time and what options will they have? The university is talking about moving students to Parramatta and Penrith. The students of the north-west sector and of Blacktown deserve an option on their doorstep. I would like to ask the member for Chifley to follow a few things up. I have had a look at members of the board and a number of them have close links with the Labor Party. He has asked me to take action, and I will be taking every action that I can. But I would encourage him to talk to, for example: Linda Burney, who was elected to the New South Wales parliament for the seat of Canterbury in 2003; Jan Burnswood, who was a Labor member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1991 to 2007; and Kim Yeadon, who in June 1990 was elected to the Western Sydney seat of Granville. I would encourage the member for Chifley and indeed the Labor candidate for Greenway to, if they really care for the students of Western Sydney, speak to their mates in the Labor Party and persuade them to reverse this decision. I will be speaking to the students. I have asked students and staff to contact my office. I am currently collating a petition and will fighting for the best interests of students and young people. Our young people are important, and this is about their future and their education. I strongly encourage the board to review this decision and to use the surplus funds that they have to provide not just for current students but also for the future. My question is: what are they going to do for the future of the young people of greater Western Sydney? What options are they going to provide for our young people? It is absolutely unacceptable for them to make this decision, and I will be opposing it. (Time expired) Broadband",135
192,Mr GIBBONS,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to refer to the greatest fraud ever witnessed in this country since the Fine Cotton ring-in scandal. You might remember that. That was where some unscrupulous people tried to turn one racehorse into another racehorse by painting its legs with white paint. The Howard government's broadband plan announced on Tuesday makes the Fine Cotton fraud scandal look like a minor joke. This map of the Bendigo federal electorate, kindly provided by the office of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, clearly outlines the Howard government's proposed areas for the new ADSL and WiMAX wireless broadband services covering the Bendigo area. And, as anyone who knows communications coverage in the region will tell you, Telstra and other providers are already covering all of the area proposed under the Howard con trick of a plan. The Howard government, instead of painting the horse's legs white, have covered some areas on a map of the electorate with green paint, and these areas already have access to broadband services. This is hocus-pocus politics. The magicians in the Howard government want Australians to believe that they have created this great be broadband initiative when they know that in most areas of regional Australia a better service already exists. But they want to con the Australian people into thinking that they are responsible for it. The Prime Minister is a Johnny-comelately to the broadband debate. He has been in a panic to catch up with Labor since the Leader of the Opposition announced his pace-setting vision for a nation-building broadband program. All that the Prime Minster has come up with is a hyped up pre-election con job which has to be one of the biggest frauds ever inflicted on the electors of Bendigo. The Howard plan will only deliver a second-rate wireless service in Strathfieldsaye, Huntly, parts of Epsom, Junortoun, Mandurang, Marong and Kangaroo Flat. The government's briefing document for Bendigo-also provided by the minister's office-states: This landmark funding initiative will enable blanmonths. ket high speed broadband coverage across the entire electorate of Bendigo so that everyone livcon ing and working in the electorate will, over the next two years, have access to fast affordable broadband for the first time. Absolutely wrong. This clearly indicates that the Howard government is being totally dishonest with the people of Bendigo, or that it just does not understand the implications of its own policy. Clearly, the Howard government and the minister for communications are trying to sell Bendigo something that we already have-indeed, we have a much better service at that. The Prime Minister and the minister for communications obviously do not understand broadband issues and they think that everyone else is just as ignorant of how broadband works. The minister was caught out and had to perform a monumental backflip for incorrectly stating that their WiMAX wireless service will operate at around 12 megabits per second when everyone in the industry said that this was virtually impossible. Currently, ADSL2+ or broadband services of speeds up to 20 megabits per second are available in Bendigo from Telstra and at least one other provider. The OPEL project, the government's project, will only duplicate already available services. ADSL2+ is also available in Kyneton, Castlemaine, Bendigo and Kangaroo Flat. Under the Howard government's broadband confidence trick, these areas will only gain the WiMAX wireless service at far lower speeds than they are currently receiving. In some cases duplication is occurring where the federal government has already spent money subsidising broadband implementation through the HiBIS and Broadband Connect initiatives. The three exchanges listed for upgrade to ADSL2+ under the government's proposal, in Williamson Street, Bendigo, have this service already and have had it for around six The Howard government is again trying to people into thinking that this is its initiative. There will still be a country class of service, or haves and have-nots, under this plan. For example, under the Telstra bid for the original $600 million there would have been another 53 ADSL exchanges in central Victoria, providing speeds of up to eight megabits per second and with an upgradeable pathway to ADSL2+, which would secure speeds of up to 20 megabits per second. This is precisely the level of service that Labor will initiate, not just in central Victoria but right across Australia. The Howard government's plan for Bendigo and central Victoria falls well short of these objectives. Labor's fibre-to-the-node broadband plan announced in March will bring a far more reliable and cost-effective high-speed broadband service, at a minimum speed of 12 megabits per second-and in most areas 20 megabits per second-to 98 per cent of Australia. The Howard government's plan is just a con job in Bendigonobody in Bendigo will believe it-and they should be condemned in the strongest possible terms for trying to pull this outrageous confidence trick on the people of Bendigo. Autism",136
193,Mr HENRY,ADJOURNMENT,"Over the past few months, since April, I have become acutely aware of the hardships that quite a number of amazing parents in my electorate of Hasluck endure. They are remarkable people and their energy seems boundless, but I have seen the evidence that this is not always so. The one common factor they have is that they are each raising a child or children with autism. Autism is a condition which affects a large number of children in Australia. Sadly, there is no known cure, and tragically there are more children being diagnosed each year. These concerns were first brought to my attention by a group of caring, loving parents driven to desperation, who staged a sit-in in my electorate office. I was pleased that they did and drew my attention to their plight and that of their children. This plight was further reinforced by an article recently in the West Australian newspaper headed: ‘Kids born with disability miss extra payment'. It was reported that a Katherine Shuard-Banks, who has a three year-old severely autistic child, gave up her full-time career to become a full-time carer of her son but was not eligible for the carer's payment of some $525.10 as Centrelink did not consider her son's condition serious enough. Ms Shuard-Banks was quoted as saying: I have to be my child's speech therapist and his behaviour therapist. Parents of autistic children don't have a collective voice because we are too busy. This message certainly came across loud and clear from those who used their precious time to visit my office to raise their concerns. The diagnosis of autism is not immediate. It takes some time to show. Parents start to notice that, often by the age of two, their apparently healthy child does not respond in the same ways that other children do. As these children grow they become more withdrawn, depending on their ‘functioning level'-a description often used by parents with an autistic child. The parents' life is ruled by the impact of influences that the child feels. Many autistic children do not have the power of speech, so when a child with autism is upset and cries or screams, as all children do, it is impossible for the parent to diagnose whether their child has an earache, whether they have been stung by a bee or whether they are feeling stressed by something else. I have four daughters, so I know that when a child is crying the thing to do is to find out the cause of the problem and to try to remedy it. Parents of children with autism have no way to determine what can set off their child crying and screaming. When it happens, and it is often, the bouts of crying or poor behaviour can last for hours on end, with no simple solutions other than the strong love of the parents and staying calm and in control so as not to exacerbate the situation and further add to the stress of the child. Parents with autistic children need more support. They are left to their own devices to try and navigate their child and the rest of their family through a minefield of uncertainty. It takes a long time to accept that your child, who may in all other respects appear normal, has been shut out of your life, a normal family life. To not be able to show just where it hurts, what is wrong or what you are frightened of must be a horrible and terrifying experience. There is no magic solution; it is just tough all the way. As the child grows, they are often harder to help. Schools are not easy places for children who suffer autism. One of the common issues for children with autism is that they do not like change and they cannot cope with things being slightly different from the way they were yesterday. Life with a child who suffers from autism is more than challenging. All too often it is a lifelong nightmare for parents. I am truly amazed at the strength, energy and love that so many parents of these children show. Parents with autistic children have been advised that they cannot apply for the recently announced $10,000 carer adjustment payment. As a government we need to do more to assist these parents to support their children and families and to provide some respite. Their time is not their own-not for one minute-unless they get lucky and get assistance and respite. These parents keep it together. They do not have the time to lobby for a fairer go or more money. They need a hand now to help with their stress and exhaustion. We need to provide them with support. Liberal Party",137
194,Mr MCMULLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to raise a series of issues this evening concerning a growing trend in the Howard government's failure to distinguish between the national interest and the Liberal Party's interests, between public purposes and private purposes and a trend towards confusing public assets and private assets. We have seen it recently with advertising. We have seen it recently with polling. We have seen it recently with fundraising. We are seeing serious allegations raised now with regard to the overlap between the Liberal Party, the government and what was previously seen as being, quite properly, a legitimate business campaign. We are starting to see the first glimpses of it with regard to taxpayer funded dirt units. In the time available, I want to mainly about that. I also want to raise a question that has just been raised with me by some of my colleagues. It is at this stage only a question because I do not know enough of the facts to be certain. My understanding is that when the maps that the member for Bendigo referred to that we all received-concerning the broadband policy-were issued, at least with regard to the state of New South Wales they were issued on the new electoral boundaries after the next election, instead of the current electoral boundaries. That does seem strange but, of itself, for most people, it is not going to make much difference. For me, for example, the consequences are very minor. It involves a few streets in a few suburbs, but nothing fundamental. But there is a key question. If that is the case in Queensland-and I am not alleging it is, because I do not know; but it is certainly true in some states-there is a very interesting question: who got the map for Flynn? I would very much like to be reassured that it was not made available to the coalition candidate for Flynn in lieu of a sitting member for that area. I am not making an allegation because I do not know. I want to know. It is a question that needs to be asked. To refer back to my original point: I am concerned about the emerging evidence-the first glimpses-with regard to the question of taxpayer funded dirt units. We saw an article published in the Bulletin this week, and we heard the sorts of denials we always get-the clever words and evasive denialsso that when you come back six months later they say, ‘You should have read the fine print of what I said.' It was not an unequivocal denial of the existence of people doing the work described in the article. Now we have stories coming forward about a similar unit in Queensland and names being given to us talk of people who might be operating it. Because I have not been able to confirm them, I am not going to put them on the public record until I know. But it is a very serious set of allegations. You would remember, Mr Speaker, the statement of that famous politician Mr Jim Hacker: ‘Never believe anything until it has been officially denied.' The choice of words that we are getting here is very careful. There are serious questions to be answered by the Attorney-General, by the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources and by the Prime Minister about what they know about the operations of these units and to whom they are reporting. The article alleges that they report to the highest level of government and that there are reports being presented to the Prime Minister. We have had evidence of their overlap with the ever-burgeoning government members secretariat. It is funded by the taxpayers but not accountable and not subject to the normal scrutiny because the staff work for the Chief Government Whip and not for a minister. Therefore, we do not get the opportunity to ask questions about the operations of those people. We need to know how those particular services overlap and whether these taxpayer funded services are providing support to candidates and government members-including backbench members, not just members of the executive. Finally, I want to make a comment about another part of this tricky political agenda where we have ministers-in this case, the minister at the table tabling a press release at 4.30 pm-coming in at the last minute, when the House proceedings have almost finished and there is no opportunity for scrutiny of documents. We will have no opportunity to pursue this Australian Electoral Commission media release about the Kirribilli House function hosted by the Prime Minister. It is very important that these things are subject to scrutiny. The Australian people are getting used to the fact that governments that have been in office too long start to think that they, and not the people, own the assets. (Time expired) Hesse Rural Health Service Chelsea Lodge Hostel",139
195,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise the matter of the Hesse Rural Health Service at Winchelsea and the Chelsea Lodge Hostel, which is a low-care aged-care facility. I put on record that the Hesse Rural Health Service provides wonderful services for rural people in the electorate of Corangamite. It emerged from the original Winchelsea hospital and was developed to provide district nursing and other medical facilities for some of those smaller rural townships in the centre of Corangamite. Hesse Rural Health Service has been conducted by a very vigorous and hard working voluntary local committee. Over the years, they have been very much part of this facility's success. Following the development of Hesse Rural Health Service, Chelsea Lodge was developed as an aged-care facility with 21 beds. I well recall early in my time as the member for Corangamite that there was a very strong fundraising effort by the local people. I remember that Joe Kelly was president, and it was a fantastic effort by the locals. They did not have a lot of money at that time, during the difficulties of the 1980s, but they put huge funds together to develop Chelsea Lodge. This facility in the local community of Winchelsea and surrounding townships is working well, but we now have a proposition to add to the 21 low-care beds. A further 10 dementia-specific beds have been approved, so they need some more money. The local committee have found some funds, and they have put a proposition to both state and federal governments that a further $300,000 would help the project. Mr Speaker, you would be interested to know that my cousin Colin MCArthur died at the age of 101. Some of the MCArthurs live for a long while, and Colin MCArthur was a well-known identity in my family. He spent his last three or four years in Chelsea Lodge, and he very much appreciated the wonderful services of the nurses who looked after him in his last three or four years. The development of the dementia-specific wing has, the last I heard, begun. But further funding would make sure that the 31 beds21 plus the extra 10 beds-would make the operation more efficient and effective. As you know, Mr Speaker, some of these agedcare facilities are now looking at from 60 up to 100 beds to make them efficient in terms of funding from the Commonwealth government. I have been a very strong supporter of this proposition. John Carr, the president of the local committee, has lobbied me over a number of months-almost years-on this project. The committee are well known to me. They are very conscientious in (1) looking after the aged-care facility and (2) providing a range of medical services to people of the Winchelsea district. It is a very commendable project. I have approached the government to see if we can get some further funding to complete this aged-care facility. It is of a very high quality and it is well designed. It has a very good ethos and connection to the local community, and I think the residents feel they are at home in Winchelsea when they spend their last few years there, either at the low-care level or in the high-care level beds. So I support Chelsea Lodge in Winchelsea. It is a wonderful project and I have been supporting them for some time. I am hopeful that the government will support a very worthwhile project in Corangamite and that it can be a symbol of what can be done with not a lot of money, with community support, with state government support and with federal government support in looking after our older residents who have lived in the country all their lives and do not want to go to Ballarat, Geelong or Hamilton but would like to remain in their local community. So I strongly support the proposition and hope that I can persuade the government to assist them with further funding for their dementiaspecific project.",140
