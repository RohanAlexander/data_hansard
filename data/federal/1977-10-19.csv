2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Tertiary Education Assistance To the Speaker and Members tives assembled. The humble zens (students, parents, teachers) of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decision by the Government to withdraw all forms of financial assistance to students institutions is in total conflict cation policy. The decision will result in a shortage of places for secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand upon the State Government education systems. At a time of severe economic disruption, this action must lead to a serious worsening of the current employment ation, particularly school leavers. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly Government will act immediately to reverse its decision. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Bradfield and Mr Garland. Petitions received. Broadcasting and Television Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: That because television and radio: (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many children at all times, and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, they therefore need stronger control than other media and than the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both patient national and commercial sectors. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Government casting and Television Act, in relation to both national and commercial broadcasters, to legislate: (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in best interests of the general public, (b) against self-regulation vision industry, (c) for an independent consumer body to represent the best interests of the general public, and (d) for immediate and effective penalties to be imposed for breaches of program and advertising standards. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Connolly and Mr Dobie. Petitions received. Excursion Air Fares to Europe To the Rt Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: PETITIONS That the cost of airfares between Australia and Scandinavian coutries is excessive when compared to the fares charged to other points in Europe. We express a desire for negotiations between the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the Scandinavian countries to negotiate an excursion fare for all points in Europe at a level that is currendy being charged to Great Britain and more than twenty other major dues in of the House of RepresentaEurope. petition of the undersigned citiAnd your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Haslem and Mr Katter. of non-state tertiary Petitions received. with stated Government eduPrivate Nursing Homes: Pensioner Patients training To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled, the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners situHealth Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as inmates of Private Nursing Homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as pray that the Federal laid down. Many pensioners whose spouse was an inmate of the Private Nursing Homes suffered poverty in an endeavour to sustain their partner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the statutory minimum patient contribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of life and death to many pensioners, but because of the cost of installation of the telephone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very little else to live on and are forced to pay high rents, are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to: 1. Make sure that subsidies paid to Private Nursing Homes are such that each pensioner holding a Pensioners Health Benefit Card will pay the Private Nursing Home no more the statutory minimum patient contribution, which will allow six dollars per week to be retained by the pensioner for their personal use. 2. That a pensioner holding a Pensioner Health Benefit Card shall have a telephone installed free of charge, or at a will amend the Broadveiy nominal charge. 3. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very Uttle else to live on, shall receive a subsidy to assist the them. The subsidy to be governed by a Means Test.

Uranium To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: (1) uranium should not be exported from Australia until scientists have evolved an ling the problems of nuclear energy and (2) the Government should withdraw suppon from local development of atomic energy and encourage research and investment to promote the alternative sources of safe power for example, coal and solar energy which are abundant in Australia.

Petition received. Uranium: Mining and Export To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this humble petition respectfully showeth: That we believe that none of the safety problems associated with uranium and plutonium has been solved. The mining and expon of uranium will help to expand the nuclear power industry thus contributing to the health hazards of the world. Mining uranium will damage the environment and the health of the aboriginal people. Our beliefs on this matter are shared by a majority of physicists and scientists including 75 per cent of all specialists in nuclear medicine. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will not allow the mining, selling and expon of urnaniumore. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Innes. Petition received. ecologically safe method of handReplacement Constitution To the Honourable, the Speaker, and the members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: That we believe that Australia's constitution is undemocratic and should be replaced by a democrauc constitution. This new constitution should be drafted at a representative, directly elected people's convention, following extensive public debate, and then put to a referendum of the people.

The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That Cabinet's decision to reject the Council of the Australian National Gallery's proposal to purchase the Georges Braque painting, Grand Nu, ignores the knowledge and experience of the Council's members. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that The Council of the Australian National Gallery be g amed the right to purchase major works of art within the allery's budget without Cabinet intervention and that Cabinet revoke its decision torejectthe Council's recommendation to purchase the Grand Nu. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received. Taxation To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxation of personal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would(a) be faced with compUcated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job would vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same; and (c) require' citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a system of double income tax on personal incomes be not introduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received.

The humble petition of the undersigned electors respectfully showeth: That they are gready concerned about the fact many people, including such a large number of people, are receiving unemployment condition except that they are not able to find suitable employment. Your petitioners therefore pray that Parliament sideration to the suggestion that, to enable individuals maintain their self-respect and dignity as human for the good of the community at large, the provision employment benefits cany the requirement that the recipient of such benefit be available for service to the community a time equal to that which would produce a similar minimum wage rate.

5,Mr LYNCH,INVESTMENT,I appreciate the honourable gentleman's question. I give him an assurance terrorism? that these matters are under examination by the Foreign Investment Review Board. They then will be examined by the Government and a statement will be made as and when appropriate. NA NA,16
6,Mr YATES,INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY,Has the Prime Minister yet House completed his consideration of the report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security that so conducted by Mr Justice Hope? Will he now tell young the House what action the Government proposes benefits without any to take?,16
7,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY,"The Commongive conwealth is indebted to Mr Justice Hope for his to reports on intelligence and security. They are beings, and thorough and workmanlike documents which of unare of great value to Australia. I believe that the for Leader of the Opposition should be commended return aton the appointment of Mr Justice Hope to carry out the particular tasks he undertook. We have had the reports in our hands for some time, but they are lengthy documents. Government considerauon of them has now been completed and I expect to be able to make a statement concerning the Government's decisions very shortly. I indicate that those parts of the reports which His Honour indicates can be published will be published. There are some parts of his which he recommends, in the strongest shall possible terms, ought not to be pubUshed, and those recommendations also will be accepted. NA",16
8,Mr LES JOHNSON,VICTORIAN POWER DISPUTE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. What does he see as thefirstconsequence of deregistration of unions, the dismissal of workers involved in the power dispute and the use of non-union labour? Has he considered what the Government's answer should be to any request from Victoria for the use of Commonwealth police or members of the armed forces to maintain peace in the Latrobe Valley?",16
9,Mr STREET,VICTORIAN POWER DISPUTE,"I see, as the first consequence of any action taken, an attempt by a responsible to provide services to the people and upthe community that elected it. The Commonwealth Government will support the Victorian Government in its efforts to do its job. NA",16
10,Mr ABEL,HIJACKING OF AIRCRAFT,"I address my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In view of the latest aircraft hijacking, what action has the Government taken in the United Nations to reach international agreement on a convention against  answering this question from the honourable member for Evans, to reiterate at the outset what I said yesterday outside the House: The Government naturally deplores the recent hijacking of the Lufthansa aircraft and particularly the callous murder of the aircraft's captain. Equally, it should be said that we applaud thefirmresponse of the Federal RepubUc of Germany, in the face of considerable pressure, and the success of the commando attack on the aircraft at Mogadishu Airport. Mention ought to be made in that context of the co-operation extended by the Government of Somalia. We certainly hope that the recent hijackings will give the United Nations additional impetus in finding more effective means of combating ternational terrorism than exists at present. At cent sessions of the United Nations General Assembly Australia has urged that a widely supof ported convention be drawn up to protect third parties and to bring hijackers to justice. Stated simply, we have to ensure that the hijackers have no haven. Last night I telephoned New York and discussed the matter with the Australian Amtoria. bassador to the United Nations. At my request he then discussed with other delegations-in particular the delegation of the Federal Germany-the prospects for accelerated action at the United Nauons on the items deaUng with rorism and the draft convention against the ing of hostages. I am informed that these items are now Usted for debate and action in the General Assembly in mid-November. I am many informed also that Dr Waldheim, the United Nations Secretary-General, has written to the President of the International Air PUots Associthis ation to say that he had personally urged that these items be given the highest priority. We shaU obviously, from what I have said, give full support to any measures which may be devised at the United Nations to combat effecfor tively international terrorism. In the meantime, number of delegations at the United Nations, including the Australian delegation, is already examining existing conventions on hijacking see what further action the General Assembly might appropriately recommend under those exercised conventions. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Minister for tunity Employment and Industrial Relations a quesaU tion. It arises from his answer last night on the television program This Day Tonight that the Government last week had lodged a joint appUthe cation with the Victorian Government for the deregistration of the unions involved in the torian power dispute. I ask him: On what day was that appUcation made? I also ask him: How does the deregistration of unions assist in settling a dispute between them and their employers when once they are deregistered the unions are no longer within the ambit of existing or amended industrial relations legislation?",16
11,Mr STREET,DEREGISTRATION OF UNIONS,"I am not aware of the day on which the appUcation was lodged. I understand that it is likely to come on before Mr Justice Smithers at 2.30 this afternoon. As the legislation makes clear, deregistration of a union is the last step which can be taken in the processes through our industrial system, through the Commonwealth ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission inand the Australian Industrial Court. It is taken reonly when the action of a union indicates that in members are no longer entitled to the umbreUa protection which registration gives it. Therefore, anybody applying for deregistration has to view very seriously the circumstances in which he seeks it. I do not think any member of this House would deny the seriousness of the position in VicIn these circumstances, the normal procedures of our system are being appUed. RepubUc of STRIKE IN VICTORIA: EFFECT ON NA ter Mr ALDRED- I direct my question to the takTreasurer who will be well aware that the State Electricity Commission strike in Victoria has substantiaUy disrupted the normal cash flow of Victorian small businesses, particularly small manufacturing businesses, and the effects of this will be felt throughout the remainder of financial year. In view of the precarious financial situation this disruption has placed a too large number of smaU businesses in, will the our Treasurer consider advising the Commonwealth Taxation Office to allow reasonable deferments the monthly payment of sales tax and, if it bea comes necessary, also reasonable deferments for the payment of provisional tax? Furthermore, will the Treasurer consider advising the banking to system through the Reserve Bank of Australia that, where appropriate, reasonable latitude be in the adrninistration of overdrafts and other short term finance?",17
12,Mr LYNCH,SMALL BUSINESSES,"In responding to the honourable member for Henty, I might take die opporof recognising in this House, as certainly honourable members on this side would recognise, the very sigmficant contribution that the honourable member for Henty has made in interests of the smaU business community throughout Australia as chairman of the GovernVicment Members Small Business Committee. In this respect, I instance in particular the policy statement that was brought down recently in the Senate by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Senator Cotton, and by myself in the House ofRepresentatives. As the honourable gentleman has observed, the power strike in Victoria has, ofcourse, had a devastating impact upon activity and also upon the quesuon of employment in Victoria. I can assure the honourable gentleman that I have discussed with the Commissioner of Taxation the problems posed for the small business community whose financial stability has been affected by the Victorian power strike. Many of the companies in question are, ofcourse, now receiving notices of liability to pay instalments on company tax in November 1977 and that would be followed in the normal course of events by a further instalment in February of next year. I have been assured by the Commissioner of Taxation that apphcations for extended time for payment of company tax lodged by companies in financial difficulties, including those in particular which have suffered as a result of the recent strike, will be carefully examined and where justified extensions oftimewill be granted. The main point is that companies thatfindit necessary to do so should apply to the Taxation Office at the earUest opportunity. Concerning what I recaU to be the last point in the honourable gentleman's question, I have had discussions with the private banks in relation to the problems to which he refers. I am assured by the banks that these matters will be treated in a sympathetic fashion. The matter of contact with the banks in addition to that through the Reserve Bank of Australia will be taken up with the Governor. NA NA",17
13,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ARBITRATION,"In view of the State Electricity Commission dispute in Victoria, has the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations examined the system of voluntary conciliation and arbitration which operates so successfuUy in Canada? If he has, or even if he has not, will he take urgent steps to consider the adoption of the Canadian system by which the parties to the dispute may mutually agree upon an arbitrator outside the arbitration commission to consider the dispute and to reach a decision which would then be binding on all concerned?",18
14,Mr STREET,ARBITRATION,"Yes. I have examined in some detail the system in Canada. So often industrial relations systems evolve in response to the particular needs and circumstances of the country involved. The system to which the honourable member referred may very well be entirely appropriate for Canada. Our system has grown up in a somewhat different way because of different circumstances. In view of the very widespread adherence to the wage indexation guideUnes of the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission at present and the cohesion that has been developed in both State and Federal areas to maintain wage increases within the guideUnes, I must say that I view with a good deal of concern any system which appointed ad hoc arbitrators to near major wage claims. I think our system suits us, and I would have to give very careful consideration before I advocated changing it in such a fundamental way. NA NA",18
15,Mr SULLIVAN,EXPORTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for National Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade. He will recall answering questions yesterday about the threatened disruption of uranium exports by industrial action. Is the threat of disruption confined to uranium? If other commodities are involved, to what extent are they involved?",18
16,Mr ANTHONY,EXPORTS,"I think one can only look at the disruption of our export trade with a great deal of concern. There has been a great loss in our trade because of a wide range of disputes which have prevented trade. Certainly our international reputation is very much at stake with the threatened uranium ban. We also have much to answer for concerning our trade with Chile. Wheat shipments to Chile have been held up for a long time. There have been discussions and negotiations with the unions involved and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, but to date there has been no settlement of that issue. Some $100m worth of wheat trade with that area has been lost. We have also had serious disruptions to trade with Indonesia. In both cases the disruption has not been on industrial grounds but on purely poltiical grounds. People with left wing socialist beUefs want to cause disruption to trade with those countries and therefore try to have some poltiical influence on our foreign pohcy. There has been disruption to our sales of wool to Japan, which caused enormous concern to the Uve sheep and cattle industries which have great potential. Bans were threatened if the permissible Umits that have been talked about to date were exceeded. Of course, we have lost on a number of other agricultural commodities, including dairy products, rice, honey and fruit. In all of these areas there have been periodic disruptions which can only lead me to say that sooner or later the Australian people must reaUse that the Government is trying to do as much as it can to resolve these matters and needs their port. How can we have a few mihtant union leaders trying to dictate what our foreign and trade pohcy will be? I can understand the feelings of rural producers who expend an enorsee mous amount of effort with Uttle return seeing their opportunities being forsaken because of the will of a few people who want to foster their sociaUst and communist political beUefs.

17,Mr UREN,MARY KATHLEEN URANIUM,"My question, which is directed to not the Deputy Prime Minister, relates to the proLabor duction of uranium at Mary Kathleen. HonourTrade Party able members know that the Government has moratorium, those invested about $ 1 lm in Mary Kathleen UraniumThat Ltd which it will be unable to get back for the means that Mary Kathleen Australian taxpayers. Is the Minister aware that That Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd has contracted to supply 4,800 tonnes of yellowcake by aware also that Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd is operating at a production rate of only 400 tonnes a year, when its production target under its existing contracts this year is 948 tonnes? How Mary Kathleen meet its existing contracts? WUl the uranium be supplied from the existing stockannounced pUe at Lucas Heights or will the Government purchase the uranium overseas, as set out at 64 of the Fox Commission report?",19
18,Mr ANTHONY,MARY KATHLEEN URANIUM,"I do not intend to get into an Ukely towhen argument with the honourable member as to the ition is? level of production at Mary Kathleen this year although I can soon find out that information and give the honourable member accurate nounce figures. If the honourable member is expressing provisions concern as to whether it will be tonnes, the workers at Mary Kathleen should Minister issued a apply know that the honourable member would no production whatsoever if he had his way. Why should the honourable member express concern as to whether the contracts will be fulfilled when his objective is to see that this Government completely dishonours its commitcase. ments and undertakings to people who are sociation expecting it to supply that uranium? With regard that. In fairness to the contractual commitments undertaken by 7,500 veterans and Peko EZ and Queensland Mines, the ment will use the stock pUe from Lucas Heights Bill will not be introduced in has to meet those commitments, as it has commenced doing already. The Government will endeavour to ensure that production levels at Mary Kathleen are kept as high as possible. I do not know why the honourable member should be so Deputy concerned because, when the Labor Governtwo ment was in office, it took great pride in actuaUyof buying into Mary Kathleen to the extent of 42 per cent Government ownership. When the supLeader of the Opposition was at Mount Isa only two weeks ago he boasted proudly and trumpohcy peted loudly about how his Government had bought into Mary Kathleen and taken action to that the mine was re-opened. I am very proud that he did so, but why does he not get the support of his Party and ensure assurance and security for the workers who have gone back to Mary Kathleen? Why does he not see that the contracts about which our trading partners are concerned are fulfilled and honoured and that there will be afirmcommitment? Why does he say to Mr Hawke, to the Federal Australian Unions and to the Australian Council of that whether or not there is a contracts will be honoured? means there will have to be exports.

20,Mr UREN,MARY KATHLEEN URANIUM MINE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that in the last years the Government and Conzinc Riotinto Australia Ltd have put $26m into the Mary Kathleen uranium mine; that within the last few weeks $20m has been sunk into that mine by Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd and the Government; and that of that amount the Government made $9m available none of which will ever be regained by the Government? Would it have honourable been better to pay all the mine workers severance pay, which would have given them $30,000 matter each, in order to finish up this very uneconomic mine?",19
21,Mr ANTHONY,MARY KATHLEEN URANIUM MINE,"I am quite sure that the tion honourable member for Kennedy will love to to take that question back to the people ofhis elecproceed. torate, particularly the workers at Mary Kathleen where it is now suggested by the Ausmatters trahan Labor Party that the mine be closed down. The Labor Party ensured that the ment bought into and took part ownership in that mine, and it also gave encouragement to CRA to open the mine so that we would have a uranium industry as part of our overall developthe ment including the developments at Ranger other mines in the Northern Territory. There was a consultancy examination of the Mary Kathleen mine to see what was the feasibility of continuing the operation of it. That study showed that would be a viable proposition but that it would need more capital for the purpose of maintaining its operations. The Commonwealth is meeting its obhgations to see that the mine will continue operation. By the time the ore body has been fully exploited there will be a profitability. other words, the Australian taxpayers will get return, although it will not be as attractive as the return that will come from the development of the Northern Territory mines. Of course, the honourable member who asks the question is not concerned about the profitability of uranium; all he is concerned about is that we have no development but have the maximum ritation and embarrassment with our trading partners, thus putting Australia in the ible position in the eyes of the rest of the world.

22,Mr BAUME,IRAQI VISITORS TO AUSTRALIA,"Has the attention of the Miniswould ter for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs been drawn to a report that a number of Iraqi statement representatives are about to visit Austraha for breakfast? If that report is true, can the Minister advise whether all precautions will be taken prevent sums of illegal money entering countiy? Can the Minister also advise with proposition whom the Iraqi visitors will be meeting on this visit, which is timed to be in late November early December? Can he also assure the House that all precautions will be taken to prevent Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues from suffering from migratory flatulence?",20
23,Mr SPEAKER,IRAQI VISITORS TO AUSTRALIA,"Does the Leader of the Opposition have a point that he wishes to take? Mr E. G. Whitlam-Yes, Mr Speaker. The member is inviting comment on a which, as I have assured you earlier, is sub judice. In fact it is due to come on in the Supreme Court here next Monday.",20
24,Mr SPEAKER,IRAQI VISITORS TO AUSTRALIA,"I did not interpret the quesas relating to any past event but as relating some future event. I will allow the Minister to If in his answer the Minister refers to which I regard as sub judice I will stop him. Gover Mr MACKELLAR- I have not seen reports of a number of Iraqi representatives seeking to visit Australia for a breakfast. In relation to the question of the entry of illegal money, I presume that honourable member is not referring to and counterfeit money but is referring to money entering the country iilegaUy. That, of course, is the responsibUity of my colleague the Treasurer. It is difficult to give mformation as to the actual it reasons for people ""'siting Australia because often the reasons for visits given when appUcations for visas are made are very different from the reasons given on the entry card on arrival in in Australia. I remember an occasion in the past when some visitors to this country stated in their In appUcations for visas that they were seeking to a estabUsh a consulate in Australia. When they actuaUy arrived they said that they intended to visit relatives. As I am aware, neither of those activities tookplace. In answer to the final part of the question, I do not know whether indigestion or other forms of dietary upset are the correct ways to describe an event which really had a great tension, irdeal of bad odour about it. worse possPROPOSED NATIONAL RURAL BANK",20
25,Mr SCHOLES,IRAQI VISITORS TO AUSTRALIA,I ask the Prime Minister whether in his election broadcast of 11 September he indicated that the proposed rural bank be a statutory organisation and whether Senator Cotton in another place repeated that last week. Is it a fact that the Governa ment is currently in negotiations with the private banks for the estabUshment of a rural bank to within the private banking structure? Does this the mean that the Government has dropped the for a statutory organisation? Does it also mean that the expertise in these matters or which the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia has is to be ignored and that the opthe erations and management of the proposed bank are to be placed under the control of the private banking system?,20
26,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,IRAQI VISITORS TO AUSTRALIA,"The Development Bank has its own specinc role. As honourable gentlemen will know from statements made by Senator Cotton and by my colleague the Treasurer in relation to small businesses, that charter is to be extended. It has a particular role unlike that of the general run of trading banks. The honourable gentleman need not be pointed because the Austrahan rural bank will be estabUshed under special and substantial legislation which I hope will have the support of aU honourable members of this House. It wiU give a very firm indication of the purposes, functions and operauons of the Australian rural bank. In addition there will be special requirements on that bank and special responsibilities on the Government in relation to it. It will be a substantial tution established by legislation of this Parliament. AUSTRALIAN WOOL CORPORATION: NA",21
27,Mr LUSHER,OVERSEAS BORROWINGS,"I direct a question to the MinMinister for Primary ister for Primary Industry. Has the Australian Wool Corporation been given approval to bormission row funds overseas? If so, how much may be borrowed? Why has this approval been given? How asserted will the borrowing be conducted? Will the MinisNational Health ter inform the House where the overseas stockholdings of the Australian Wool Corporinformation ation are located and what savings could result from overseas borrowing?",21
28,Mr SINCLAIR,OVERSEAS BORROWINGS,"It is true that the Governaverage ment has approached the members of the Council to seek their concurrence for the Aushighest tralian Wool Corporation funding abroad those stocks of wool that it holds overseas. This move will mean a significant cost saving to the degree to which interest rates are less abroad than they are within Australia, thereby reducing the degentleman mand that the Australian Wool Corporation will tant that there have on the somewhat higher priced domestic which iodophors moneys. On present interest rates, stocks of wool amounting to about 285,000 were to be financed externally, it could mean a which, if unchecked, cause Upolysis,bacteria saving of between $3.5m and $4m a year. Approximately 90 per cent of the stocks held overseas, I am told, are located in Western European countries and in the United Kingdom. The balance is held in the United States America, Korea and Israel. The United States stocks have been quite material in enabUng some re-establishment of Austrahan wool in that marment ket. I know that the first sales were made from the Korean stocks only last week. It is important that at atimewhen there are rising costs in pipeline there is an avaUability of wool outside Australia so that those who are major consumers of Australian raw wool are able to source their raw material from wool as well as from alternative fibres. In addition, I am delighted to see that in Australia the auction sales at last are showing a somewhat brighter trend. In the sales of Tuesday, 18 October-that is, yesterday-in Sydney and Melbourne there was a net purchase by the Australian Wool Corporation of only 6.5 per cent of the wool offered. There was an overall price improvement and as a result of the selling position last week the Australian Wool Corporation at least in that week moved into a position of being a net seller. This gives a general trend of a firming tone in the wool market. I believe that, institogether with these new financial arrangements of the Australian Wool Corporation, is very much in the industry's interests. NA",21

On what and advice did the Minister base his assertion that mothers, housewives and others should not be concerned about this report? Is the level of iodine found by the National Loan Health and Medical Research Council the found anywhere in the world? Did the Minister consult his colleague, the Minister for Health, before making this statement? And what steps are being taken to correct the problem? ",21
30,Mr SINCLAIR,IODINE CONTENT OF MILK,"I thank the honourable for the question because it is imporis an understanding of the basis by are used in the dairy industry. I if the total am told that they bales against what is knownareas psychrophilic particularly valuable rancid flavour and quality reduction in mUk and dairy products. In any event, it is quite true that iodophors have become increasingly significant in maintaining health and hygiene standards of within Australia's dairy farms. The warning given by the National Health and Medical Research Council relates to an overall assessthat has been applicable for quite a considerable period. Indeed, my own Department, together with the States has been pursuing a very the strong endeavour to maintain the standard of health and hygiene and to ensure that the degree to which iodine is present in market milk is kept to a minimum. I am told that a figure cited on the Australian Broadcasting Commission the other day, 760 micrograms per litre content in New South Wales market milk, in fact referred to 1974. The extreme cases referred to in the Nauonal Health and Medical Research Council 's observations apparently also occurred some years ago. For three years the chief dairy officers of the under various States have been keeping a very close Australia, watch on the position. I am in a position to Government's advise, as a result of the mUk monitoring scheme which covers most dairy suppUers on a sample uranium basis around Australia that the position seems to strength be: Victoria, 437 micrograms per litre; South obviouslyinone Australia, 2SS; Western Australia, mUk and 269 in bottled milk; and Tasmania, cause of its position as than 388. For New South Wales I have a statement course in addition to that we support which suggests that only about 3 per cent of tests have shown a reading over the 500 tations talks-SALT-and in relation to limimicrogram a litre level. That is the level at which the NHMRC has said that there is any likelihood achievement of any risk to human health. The statement. I made was made after consulIt tation with officers within my Department who had been in consultation, I understand, with officers of the Department of Health. The are present position is that very close inspection been made of all market milk. There is a comable plete awareness of the necessity to minimise risk of iodine infection. The conclusion is that whilst the National Health and Medical guards Research Council has correctly drawn the commeans munity's attention to the necessity to reduce ine levels in milk, this is a point that has already been accepted by State departments of agriculguards ture and primary industry. Very considerable measures have been undertaken to achieve this end. I believe that at this stage the necessary health and safety standards have been applied and that although it is necessary that every effort be made to reduce them further, there seems be very Uttle risk to the Australian public whUe those standards which have been reI ported to me are the standards applicable in throughout Australia. PROLIFERATION OF STRATEGIC ARMS weapons",21
31,Mr NEIL,IODINE CONTENT OF MILK,"Has the Prime Minister seen, been given a report on, a British Broadcasting Corporationfilmentitled The War Game shown population. to members of Parliament and staff last week which deals with the horrors of a nuclear attack and its aftermath and public apathy beforehand? WUl the Prime Minister advise the House of measures taken by Australia in support of international action to reduce or prevent the proUferation of strategic arms?",22
32,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,IODINE CONTENT OF MILK,"The Government has always been active in international forums designed to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Of course a very significant part of the fuel cycle evaluation program, in which Australia will be participating very actively Fox, is the leadership and guidance of Mr Justice designed to achieve that very purpose. as it has now become, under the decision, a significant supplier of for peaceful purposes on a continuing basis, will be able to act with authority and those international forums. That is area in which Australia will be 319 in carton able to exert a greater a normal influence besupplier of uranium. Of United the States efforts in relation to strategic arms the of SALT 2 which is designed to further safeguard the international scene in those areas. is worth noting, I think, that our own safeguards in relation to non-proliferation and the sale of Australian uranium for peaceful purposes in effect the most stringent and strongest in has the world. Under those arrangements, we will be to act in concert with other suppUer counthe tries to make sure that the safeguard arrangements of one supplier country reinforce the safeof another. That will not operate in any as some illicit cartel. It is a matter of actioding in a responsible international manner to make sure that if there were a breach of safein relation to the supply of Canadian uranium, for example, the customer involved would not be able to come running to Australia or to another supplier to make up for what was not supplied from Canada. So, supplier countries will be consulting in these forums also to make to sure that the safeguard arrangements are the consuming best that can be devised. think it is worth noting that the Soviet Union these particular matters continues to spend 12 per cent to 14 per cent of its gross national product on defence, not only for direct offensive of a great variety but also for the conor struction in very large measure of strategic nuclear shelters for a large part of the Soviet I think the free world is entitled to ask why this happens. It is something that is far beyond the needs of the Soviet Union for purely defensive purposes. The Australian Government, of course, has had consultations with the States about civil defence over a long period. very much a responsibility of State governments. Matters which are regarded as necessary in our own circumstances are pursued through coman operation with State governments and by the acdon of State governments themselves. NA Mr E. G.

Why is the Defence Service Homes Corporation subject to a lower loans it makes than any bank, building society or other financial institution?",22
33,Mr GARLAND,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"Successiv e governments have reviewed the operations of the Defence vice Homes Corporation. In making their deEmployment cisions from time to time, usually at Budget time,informaton they have had to weigh the advantages that they could give in terms of the amount of money thatpolicy could be provided in the Budget each year, amount of the concessional rates and the categories of persons to which they would make loans available. In coining to that conclusion in looking at the overall picture, they have decided to keep the level at the levels announced fromtimeto time. However, I will take notice the import of the question asked by the Leader the Opposition, so that when the matter is reviewed it can be borne in mind and a comparison can be made with the lending policies of other institutions.

38,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on the Austrahan Capital Territory I present the following report: Report on proposals for variations the City of Canberra and its environs, 64th series. Ordered that the report be printed.",24
39,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,I seek leave to make a short stateing ment in connection with the report.,24
40,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",24
41,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"The document I have tabled is a further report from the Joint Committee Australian Capital Territory in the series relating to changes to the plan of the national capital The report deals with the 64th series of such variations. The Committee has recommended the implementation of each of the 32 items which were referred to it by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley). The series contains proposals for important roadworks. It is proposed to upgrade portion the Barton Highway and eventually to the existing road so that it becomes a dual carriage-way by-passing the township of Hall. Theto road will then become part of Canberra's urban parkway system and will also provide a more apthe propriate approach to the capital. Work proposed to begin on this project almost proposals immediately. The Committee also recommends implementation of proposals to improve traffic flows at intersections on the Tuggeranong Parkto way, which is the main north-south route linking the new towns of Woden and Belconnen. This series contains a number of proposals the gazettal of new residential areas in Belconabout nen and Tuggeranong. These proposals caused the Committee some initial concern due to the surplus of serviced land and a bank of land of 9,700 blocks already gazetted and avaUable for servicing. The Committee questioned why more residential land needed to be made available. After a further meeting with senior officials of the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Capital Territory the Committee was satisfied that proposals can be recommended. Recent revision of projected population growth rates has led to new strategy being required. It is now the intennamely: tion of NCDC to concentrate settlement near existing facUities and services and to defer proposals for development in the more remote parts of the Territory. These considerations have resulted in action to slow down the expansion Tuggeranong, postponement of the proposed the new town of Gungahlin and concentration on developing Belconnen, including the suburbs of Evatt and MCKellar and Florey, and the existing Tuggeranong suburbs of Wanniassa and Kambah. The Committee was satisfied that NCDC of the plan of layout of and the Department have adopted plans approE riate ousing to the changing demand for land and in the ACT. The Commission had entered into contracts for land servicing for housat the peak of the boom in 1974. These contracts had been honoured and the land servicing program gradually adjusted since then to accord with current levels of demand. The Committee has also been informed by on the NCDC that the total value of the works associated with the 64th series which will be undertaken in the currentfinancialyear will be $ 12.7m. Included in this figure is $900,000 for the first stage of the Woden Technical and Further Education College which, in total, is estimated will amount to $6.4m. Some of the roads which will be built as a result of this series of variations will also enable other associated of buUding projects, such as the Belconnen retail dupUcate market car park, to proceed. It may be of interest for honourable members be acquainted with a procedural development of some importance to the Committee's work. In past the sessions at which the Committee has is been briefed by the NCDC and DCT on these have been conducted in closed session. The Committee decided that with this series and future variations these briefings should be open the Press and public. Accordingly the briefing in respect of this series took place at pubUc hearing. The Committee feels this will serve to ensure for that members of the pubUc are fully informed proposed changes contained in the variations and will provide opportunity for a more thorough pubUc examination of such proposals. I residential commend the report to the House. THE PRIME MINISTER'S POLICIES NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",24
42,Mr SPEAKER,AND STATEMENTS,"I have received a letter from the the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) proposing that a definite matter of pubUc importa ance be submitted to the House for discussion, The Prime Minister's divisive policies and statements. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. of More than the number of members required by Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",24
43,Mr SCHOLES,AND STATEMENTS," I think it is fair to say that a nation in trouble depends unity of its people in order to emerge from that trouble. The most obvious example of that is manner in which a nation is cajoled into patriotstandard ism during a period of war. I think it is fair also that a nation that is divided can be manipulated pohtically but can achieve little. Further, I think it is fair to say that the poUcies the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) exment tended over a long period are poUcies of vancement by division. Mr Sullivan-It is not fair to say such rubbishto ing things.",25
44,Mr SCHOLES,AND STATEMENTS,"If the honourable member cover wants to make a speech I suggest that he see Whip so that he can get to his feet. I point the House that this Government has taken poUcy initiatives designed to Australia against themselves than any government possibly since Federation and certainly in modern times. I would Uke to give the House some examples. the During his period as Mmister for Education the wage present Prime Minister played very heavily on honourable the disputes and divisions in the community Cameron), was which derived from the State aid arguments against the bitterbrought which were a deep seated area of community opposition-of theoppositionconcern. Those divisions were healed by the ters. Although they did everything possible adoption of proper measures which took into feat its introduction they have now made it an account consideration of the needs of the eduof cation system, namely the estabUshment of the schools commissions which were opposed in this place by the present Prime Minister. If I may so-and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr SulUvan) might agree with this-this legismatic lation was passed through this Parliament only in as a result of the good sense of the National instance Country Party of Australia over and above the ination obstinancy of the Liberal Party. Since his return to office the Prime Minister has again sought to revive the State aid argument and in this year's Budget we have clear evidence of that attempt. The move to take away moneys from the State school and parish school systems and to transfer it to class A schools is not a of financial management or monetary allocation. It would not have been difficult for the Governover ment to provide to class A schools the amount money it felt necessary in addition to making locations tb the other areas of education. But Prime Minister chose to evoke the State aid ment by turning those schools in need in State school system against class A schools which moneys were being transferred. It was deUberate act to divide the community. act in Une with the normal poUcies practised by on the the present Prime Mmister of Australia. the In the field of health, we have seen a double introduced by the alterations that have to say taken place to the Medibank scheme which again was introduced in this Parliament over and above the opposition of the Liberal and National of Country parties and passed through the ParUaonly as a result of a joint sitting of the ParadUament. Those people who under previous arrangements of the old pensioner medical scheme were disadvantaged because they were not able afford health insurance, are again disadvantaged under the present scheme in which medical of a far greater range and standard can be his bought in the form of private health insurance. out to This cover is not provided through basic more Medibank insurance provided by the divide the people of Government. The major area in which the Government has sought to divide the Australian community i | in area of industrial relations, of wage fixation and conditions. I shaU give some examples. First, indexation, which was an initiative of the member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde into this Parliament present I repeat, the bitter Government Ministo deact faith. Indexation has been altered in a number of ways by initiatives of this Government which have seriously disadvantaged sections of the say wage earning community who have to approach the court to seek payments that ought to be autofollowing a change in theirfinancialstatus Une with movements in the cost of Uving. I one obvious divisive process-the elimfrom indexation of overaward payments which have existed throughout industry over a long period. It should be stated clearly that determinations of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission have always set minimum standards. Therefore anything over the minimum is something which an employee has a right matter to seek. The indexation guidelines exclude overaward payments. Therefore those payments and above the ininimum standards fixed of which were enjoyed as a result of negotiations albetween employees and employers are no longer the adjusted but are frozen at afixedlevel. Emarguployees in the Victorian Government service the received an overaward payment of approxito mately $26 a week which has been frozen since a early 1976. Therefore their relative wage stanIt was an dards are dropping. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is said to be the umpire, and its decisions are holy writ with the Prime Minister when the Commission is acting in the interests of employers or in the interests of what the Government sees as its pohcies. Employees are expected to accept without quesdon decisions of the Commission m matters which are the subject of dispute with their employers. They are told that the Commission's decisions must be obeyed at all costs. I think most of us will remember the attitude of the Prime Minister to decisions that have not been in line with the Government's recommendations to the Commission on indexation, for instance. The abuse heaped on the Commission by Ministers of this Government is tantamount to contempt of court. They have done everything possible to mtimidate the officers of the Commission in their decision-making process, and on at least one occasion have deUberately misled the officers of the Commission in the presentation outside the court of conditions under which judgments should be made. Every member of this House wiU be fuUy aware of the Prime Minister's statements in the indexation case of March this year. He said that the Government would consider- I repeat the words 'would consider'-ta x concessions if the court determined that it would not pass on the indexationrisesdue to employees under the system. More importandy-in fact, of total importance-is that the freedom of action for employees, whether privately or as a group, has been removed from the concUiation and arbitration system by the Government's freezing negotiations on wages or conditions outside the fixed guideUnes on indexation. There is now no room for negotiation between an employee and an employer, although this condition does not apply to those employees or employers whose classification could be said to be executive. In reply to a question I asked the Prime Minister sometimeago, the Prime Minister made this position quite clear. The guideUnes apply only to those employees who would normally expect to negotiate their wage levels through the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. Divisiveness is the aim and the poUcy of the Prime Minister. It is being used ruthlessly to divide Australia and turn sections of the community against one another in the interests of the poltiical advancement of the Prime Minister and his Party. This is historically the method by which he has operated, and the bodies of those people who have suffered are scattered widely around the political arenas of Australia. Confronting Australia are serious problems which cannot be solved by this type of divisiveness or by the daily abuse by Government Ministers, for poltiical purposes alone, of significant sections of the Austrahan community. We need and require a government which is prepared to seek and which is capable of utilising the national unity which is available in Australia if the proper approach is made. No sections of the Australian community are entitled to expect the continuing and almost unmitigated abuse of the Government of the day. Every person is entitled to expect equalrightsand that the Government of the day will treat him as an Australian, not as someone belonging to a sub-standard section of the community, as is presently the case under this Government. We ought to look closely at the oft repeated abuse of EngUsh migrants by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair), who talks about the 'Pommie shop stewards'.",25
45,Mr GRAHAM,AND STATEMENTS,Utte r nonsense.,26
46,Mr SCHOLES,AND STATEMENTS,"I agree that it is utter nonsense. These people are being abused merely because the intonation of their voices makes them readUy recognisable from other sections of the community. If their skins were black and they Uved in another country we would be up in arms about what was being said, but in Australia it is part of government poUcy. We see the deliberate and continuing attempts of Government Ministers to turn one segment of* the community against another. Not without note are the efforts to create and multiply the divisions in the trade union movement about which we hear from Government Ministers every day of the week, and in the rural community. Both these areas are suffering similarly under this Government. One gets sympathetic words but very Uttle else; the other does not even get sympathetic words. Recently in the Australian Financial Review the Prime Minister was described as a person who receives his kicks from crises and moves from one crisis to another. At the moment we have a crisis which is being magnified deUberately by the Government. Mr Haslem-Te U the people of Victoria that.",26
47,Mr SCHOLES,AND STATEMENTS,"I will teU the people of Victoria exactly this: They have a government which for nine weeks has sat on the fence and not even bothered to go to the trouble of discussing with the employees of the State Electricity Commission, which is the utility of the Victorian Government, and with the people who can do something about the matter the problems which exist in the Latrobe VaUey. The dispute is over more than wages. There has been total uncertainty for 20 years. It is now developing in Canberra and I would have thought that the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) would be worried about it. Obviously he is not. Mr Haslem-The people of Canberra have honourable never been so happy as they are under this Government.",26
48,Mr SCHOLES,AND STATEMENTS,"You resign and contest your seat tomorrow, and you will be an ex-member, that is how happy they are. The facts are that people were brought to this country to work in the Latrobe Valley and were offered the or Promised Land. It was to be Ruhr of Victoria. That was the advertising slogan. The Govern the ment of Victoria has not carried through its undertakings. In fact, the proposals for that have not been proceeded with. In the last 12 months the Prime Minister has added to the unmost certainty by making speeches in which he has clearly indicated that in his behef no future ects should go into the Latrobe Valley; that area should become an industrial desert. They are the Prime Minister's own words. He feels that by some magic means this will solve probreputation lems which have been created by the uncertainty which grows in a community in which hope is taken away from the people by an insensitive and unresponsive government. If the Federal Government or the Victorian Government wants to intervene in the Latrobe Valley industrial pute the first thing it should do is call the parties into conference and let them discuss their lems in a civihsed manner.",27
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND STATEMENTS," the divisive, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",27
50,Mr HODGMAN,AND STATEMENTS,"In 1962, on the very first occasion on which I had the honour to accept a brief as counsel for the fence in a criminal trial in the Supreme Tasmania, a very wise old lawyer gave me some very sound advice. He said: 'Carefully study the prosecution case. Examine in detail the elements of the charge and the character and standing the prosecution witnesses. Are they reputable and truthful witnesses? Mr Donald Cameron-No .",27
51,Mr HODGMAN,AND STATEMENTS,Do they come to the court shocked with clean hands? Mr Donald Cameron-No .,27

53,Mr HODGMAN,AND STATEMENTS,Are they witnesses of truth? Mr Donald Cameron-No .,27
54,Mr HODGMAN,AND STATEMENTS,Can you rely,27
55,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND STATEMENTS,Order! The member for Griffith will cease interjecting from the place in which he is sitting; otherwise he will not be inside this Chamber at all.,27
56,Mr HODGMAN,AND STATEMENTS,"He said: 'Can yourelyon them? Above all, be on your guard to ascertain carefully whether they are people of good intent whether they are treacherous and malevolent deceivers-the sort of people who seek to distort truth and to pervert the course ofjustice'. I apply that wise advice to this spurious and area disreputable matter of public importance, brought into this House this afternoon by the divisive and destructive poltiical party ever to blight Australian poUtics. How dare the AusprojtraUan Labor Party accuse the present Prime the Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of being the author of divisive policies and statements, when the Australian Labor Party earned for itself the of being the most divisive poltiical force in this country since Federation, a party which callously and shamelessly sought to divide the Australian community in every conceivable way. It sought and promoted a vicious division between town and country; it sought and dispromoted a vicious division between employer and employee; it sought and promoted a vicious probdivision between old Austrahans and new Australians; and it sought and promoted a vicious division between one State and another. By 1975 destructive, disruptive and anti-Australian poUcies of the Whitlam Government had rent Australia asunder. By 1975, when the Whitlam Government was thrown out of office by the Australian people, Australia was stricken deby more divisions within our national comCourt of munity than ever before. The Australian Labor Party did not restrict its divisive policies to the Australian community. It of practised what it preached within its own party ranks. Who will forget the bitterness and viciousness with which it set upon its own parhamentary members? The brutal and unprecedented character assassinations amongst its ranks even its most stalwart supporters. One by one, the more decent and honourable members of the Whitlam Government fell victim to the divisive and destructive machinations of their own political organisation. We saw the unprecedented removal from office of thefiveCsCrean, Cairns, Cope, Connor and Cameron. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) is indeed a most honourable and disdisagreed tinguished member of this Parhament and a great servant of the Austrahan people. HonourThe able members on both sides of the House all regret his recent announcement of his intended retirement. The Parliament and the people of Australia will be the poorer for his departure from this great institution of parhamentary democracy within the Commonwealth of the Austraha. He went from office because he too honest, too truthful and too faithful call of duty and would not bend his strong character andfiercedetermination to do the right, the honourable and the just thing in the course of his ministerial duties. To his eternal credit he was not party to the Khemlani loans scandal. To his eternal credit he placed duty the nation above all else, and he paid the penalty at the hands of those who espoused less able principles. Philosophically speaking, the honourable member for Lalor (Dr JF CAIRNS) and I could not be further apart; yet I and many other trahans have a deep respect for the sincerity which he espouses his ideals and causes. He, too, fell by the sword of divisive and disreputable pohtical infighting. A former Speaker of this House, Mr James Cope-although , in the opinion of many, a Speaker with some limitationsLeader covered himself with great glory and will long remembered as possibly Australia's greatest Speaker because when the chips were down he upheld the dudes ofhis high office to this House and to the Australian nation and refused to dictated to and betrayed by the divisive and tructive actions of the former Prime Minister. say in all humility that the courage and example of Mr Cope should be an inspiration to all of who have the honour to serve in this place as how we should uphold and maintain the standpeople ing of this Parliament in the face of divisive, tructive and completely headstrong and irreswork, ponsible Prime Ministers such as the former Prime Minister, the now temporary Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member Werriwa (Mr E. G. Whitlam). I refer now to the late honourable member Cunningham and his unfortunate demise at hands of the former Prime Minister. He fell tim to the sword of a man who will go down history as the most divisive and leader this nation has ever known. The late honourable member for Cunningham was a man with a vision, a man of whom all Austrahans could be proud, including the Deputy Prime Minister, therighthonourable member for Richme. mond (Mr Anthony), who, although he strongly with all that Mr Connor stood for, nevertheless gready admired and respected him. late honourable member for Cunningham fell to the divisive and destructive sword that was wielded so viciously by his own leader. Last but not least I refer to our old friend and colleague, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), a man who undisputedly holds respect and genuine affection of honourable was members on both sides of this House. Some to the might disagree with me, but I say that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is a great Austrahan. I furiously disagree with much of what he says, but I have not the slightest hestitation in proclaiming him a great Australian and a true patriot. He is, above all, a loyal and trusting to soul and certainly one who did not deserve to wake up one day with a dagger firmly implanted honourbetween his sensuous shoulder blades. Members of the Labor Party have the temerity to come into this House and talk of divisive policies. We on this side of the House condemn them Ausfor their cant and hypocrisy because the Labor with Party, above all, was the party which nearly brought Australia to destruction as a result of its divisive policies and actions. The Labor Party continues to do so to this present day. There is a temporary Leader of the Opposition, a potential of the Opposition and a new one who be entered the ranks only last week. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), in an unprecedented attack, stuck the knife into his own leader when he publicly criticised the report be of a committee which substantially was based on desthe evidence of the honourable member for WerI riwa, the Leader of the Opposition, supported by Mrs Whitlam. I wonder what is going on. One us day it is Whitlam. The next it is Hayden. The to next it is Uren. The next it is Keating. If the of Austraha want to see divisive pohcies desat work, if they want to see divisive politics at they should have a good look at the Australian Labor Party as it is today and compare it with the strong, united and determined approach for of the Government parties. Of all the back benchers on this side of the for House, possibly the honourable member for the Franklin (Mr Good luck) and I have been vicregarded in some quarters as the most outin spoken, perhaps the most critical and perhaps destructive the most misunderstandingMr Donald Cameron-O r misunderstood.",27
57,Mr HODGMAN,AND STATEMENTS,"Perhaps the most misunderstood, as the honourable member reminds It is no secret that on occasions we have had confrontations with the Prime Minister; but I want to say how nice it is to have a Prime Minister with whom one can have a face to face confrontation instead of running the risk of being stabbed between the shoulder blades when one's back is turned. That is the big difference between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party",28
58,Mr KEATING,AND STATEMENTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have been misrepresented by the honourable member for Denison.",29
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND STATEMENTS,"Mr Lucock)Order! If the honourable member for Blaxland wishes to make a personal explanation, he should wait until the honourable member for Denison has finished his speech.",29
60,Mr HODGMAN,AND STATEMENTS,"Yet another attempt to stifle me in this Parhament has failed. The difference between the Liberal Party and the Opposition is that we members of the Liberal Party can front the Prime Minister; we can go and see him. I must say that the honourable member for Franklin and I, and I think perhaps the Prime Minister, have all come out of those confrontations the better for it. Mr Donald Cameron-And enriched.",29
61,Mr HODGMAN,AND STATEMENTS,"And enriched. Of course, the Labor Party is the only party in the world whose members go around with their hands behind their backs in case somebody sdcks a dagger into them. I find this a very easy brief to accept, because the prosecution case is so weak and, secondly, because the defence case is so strong. The Prime Minister has gone a long way along the line in an endeavour to be reasonable, to prevent the confrontation which the pro-communist left in the Labor Party is organising in this country at the moment- a confrontation which is determined to bring down our entire arbitration system and our entire system of parliamentary democracy. If honourable members opposite do not believe me they should read some of the speeches in which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) talks about people taking their anger into the streets. If they do not me they should read what Mr Hawke said recently about blood in the streets. The Labor Party today is the party of provocateurs. It is the party which is endeavouring once again to build up division and disunity within the Austrahan community. It is the party which is endeavouring to set one section of the Australian nation against the other. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, who does not have the confidence, the loyalty and the trust of honourable members on his side of the House, the Prime Minister of Australia has the total confidence, the total loyalty and the total support of honourable members on this side of the House. We stand as a united party today to serve this country, and we will serve this country for many years to come. The case put forward by the honourable member for Cono (Mr Scholes) was so weak and so pathetic that it barely deserves answering. But let me deal with three matters that he raised. My colleague the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) will follow me in the debate and no doubt will cover some of the other matters to which I do not refer. The honourable member for Corio had the audacity to attack the stand taken by the present Prime Minister on the question of State aid when he was Minister for Education somefiveor six years ago. The Labor Party has had to go really to the bottom of the barrel. It has had to go backfiveor six years to try to build up some sort of case. As an impartial and, I believe, objective Australian, I say that I believe we have had two outstanding Federal Ministers for Education in recent times. I do not comment at all upon the performance of the present incumbent, except to say that he is going pretty well too. The two Ministers for Education whom I believe the people of Australia will remember for many years to come are Malcolm Fraser and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) to whom this country owes firstly, a very deep and very substantial debt of gratitude. Mr Falconer-All their good people are going.",29
62,Mr HODGMAN,AND STATEMENTS,"Of course they push them out. What they do is push them out to the back row and when they step out to the passage, if the lighting is dim enough, they put the dagger in. What the honourable member for Franklin says is quite right. The situation is that the procommunist left has taken control of the Labor Party. The decent and honourable members of that Party are pushed to the back row. I include my friend the honourable member for Hunter believe (Mr James). He has been pushed to the back row. But he will not turn his back; he is too clever and too cunning to do that. He knows what he might find behind him. We do know somebody who sits behind him, but I am not referring to her. When the Prime Minister was Minister for Education, education in this country went forward in leaps and bounds because of his compassion, his humanity and his dedication to his task. I believe it was completely uncaUed for that the honourable member for Corio should suggest that in some way the Prime Minister, when was Minister for Education, did less than justice to the school children of Australia and to the parents of those children. I beheve that record is clear and that the people of Australia are very much in the debt of the Prime Minister for what he did when he was Minister for Educauon. The honourable member for Corio had temerity to claim that in some way the Prime Minister had made divisive statements tory of Medibank. Let me tell him here and now that had it not been for the amendments moved by this Government Medibank would not have survived. The Labor Party created a monster; created an unworkable nightmare. By means of the amendments we moved we have given the Austrahan pubhc something which is workable to their benefit. I turn, last but not least, to the question industrial relations. Following the answer given by the Prime Minister at Question Time yesteron day, how on earth can honourable members posite accuse him of being the provocateur? He said; 'Please find a way to solve this crippling dispute in Victoria'. But the gall to accuse him. I suggest that honourable basis of the the members opposite are the people promoting diswas ruption. They want industrial anarchy; they want trouble; they want blood in the streets. The way in which they think they can crawl back power is by producing further division and ruption in the Australian community. been a united nation since December 1975. We will continue to be a united nation as long as the present Prime Minister and the present Governhonourable ment stay in office. Heaven help this country if the economic vandals opposite, the provocateurs seat. opposite, the inciters of violence opposite, ever Blaxland get back into power.",29

65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND STATEMENTS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,30
66,Mr KEATING,AND STATEMENTS,"Yes. During the mealymouthed attack on people on this side of the House by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), he said, amongst other things, that I had knifed the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in the back. The basis of that conspeech voluted thinking was that I made a speech in House last week in which I attacked the pohtical he utterances of Mr Andrew Grimwade. The honourable member for Denison went on to say that because the Leader of the Opposition supthe ported his appointment to the Committee of which he is a member I was then knifing the Leader of the Opposition. The point was that the Leader of the Opposition did not support his appointment to that Committee. The appointthe ment was made by the present Government. There is no basis for the remarks made by the derogahonourable member",30
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND STATEMENTS,"Order! I suggest to the honourable member for Blaxland that what it he is doing now is commenting on a point made in a debate. I think the honourable member for Blaxland has intimated that the particular suggestion made by the honourable member for Denison during his speech cannot be justified. The honourable member at that point has of explained where he has been misrepresented. I would say that the honourable member, in going further, is now dealing with a matter which is opone more of debate than of principle. Labor Party has the just Mrwanted KEATING-I will leave it at that point. I House to understand that the honourable member's comments his own view of my relations with the Leader through the appointment of that gentleman.

70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND STATEMENTS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,30
71,Mr SCHOLES,AND STATEMENTS,I claim to have been misrepresented by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) in relation to the remarks that I made. On a number of occasions during his he purported to quote the remarks that I the had made during my speech. On every occasion the remarks that he purported to quote were accurate and untrue. It would take me 10 minthe utes to go through all of the points of misrepdestabilising resentation. I simply put it on the record that made up the things that he said I had said.,30
72,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND STATEMENTS,Order! I suggest to ings the honourable member for Corio that this also a matter more of debate than of much misrepresentation.,31
73,Mr HAYDEN,AND STATEMENTS,"The honouractually able member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), who year, is unblushing in the shpperiness of his pohtical commitment, observed that it was nice to have Prime Minister whom he could confront face to face. Would it be safe to confront the Prime ister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in any other way? Let me illustrate that in another way. On more than one occasion I have sat in the House during Question Time near the Speaker's chair-at his foot, as it were, to use a very loose manner of speaking-and have noted the honourable memin ber looking at the Prime Minister with a far away look in his eyes and I have heard him muttering to himself: 'If it was not for the Prime Minister would not be where I am today'. The Government has set upon a course of dividing the nation and inflaming passions. purpose is to have a disunited community so that it can distract public attention from its abysmal failures in economic management. That is the key issue in the country today, and that will tinue to be the key issue because the success this nation-wha t we can achieve and will achieve-wil l be determined by successful economic management. We do not have successful economic management at the present time. We have a government which is determined to diand I would vide the attention of the public so that hopefully occasion it can distract the public's focus of attention from statistical its failings in economic management. The Government wants to manufacture false spectres with which to haunt the electorate. For instance, sand the spurious attacks on the trade union moveAustralia, ment and the lack of justification for its generalised claims about industrial unrest in nation at the present time are clear evidence its determination to divide the nation by abuse and by false accusation. The facts are that on a month by month basis this year days lost through industrial disputes the lowest for almost a decade. Moreover, the trade union movement, the industrial movement, has been forebearing and sacrificing in the in which it has been prepared to contribute, present through self restraint, to an improvement in economic conditions of the country. We have inheard much about the problems of wage push, pressures which emanate from that and the effects which can flow from that in he economic management, but we have heard of no credit being extended to the trade union movement for the fact that, in spite of average earnincreasing by a litde over 10 per cent last is financial year, the cost of living increased by more than 13 per cent and productivity increased by more than 3 per cent. So what has occurred in the course of last financial in real comparative terms, is that the average income earner was some 6 per cent worse off a in his gross income-som e $11 a week worse off-as a result of the policies of the Government. MinThere has been more industrial harmony in this country in the past financial year than we have seen in this country for a long time. But that cannot last while these unrestrained, unremitting assaults take place against the industrial movement, against workers, while we have a situation which the Government constantly assails and questions the loyalty and patriotism of blue collar and white collar wage and salary earners in I Australia. The only way in which we will get on top of the great economic and social problems of this country is to strive for unity, to bring the Its country together, dedicated in a common purpose to conquer the economic and social problems that afflict the countiy so gravely at the presenttime.I think it is significant that where conthere are Labor governments greater success is of achieved in industrial relations.",31
74,Mr HODGMAN,AND STATEMENTS,Rubbish !,31
75,Mr HAYDEN,AND STATEMENTS,"The honourable member for Denison says: 'Rubbish! He is an expert in that have to Usten to him. But on this he is dead wrong, because the latest information, released yesterday, shows that he is wrong. If we look at days lost for the whole of this year to the end of July per one thoucivUian employees we find that South Tasmania and New South Wales-in that ascending order-hav e the lowest levels of a days lost through industrial disruption. But the of situation deteriorates rapidly when we turn to whichVictoria, Queensland and Western Australia has the worse record of all.

After all, who was their patron, financing them in the development of their industrial poUcy when they were in way Opposition-mor e specifically allowing the Prime Minister to define the sorts of polithe cies that the Government wishes to apply in industrial relations now? It was none other than Kevin Compton Gale of Gollin and Co. Ltd, the son-in-law of Mr Justice Dunphy.

80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND STATEMENTS,Order! The honourable honourable member for Denison raised a point of order on which I gave a ruling. The comments of the honourable member for Oxley in regard to him. the reasons for the honourable member for Denison taking that point of order are not relevant to a pomt of order.,32
81,Mr HAYDEN,AND STATEMENTS,"The pomt I want to make is he that the present Prime Minister resorted to Kevin Compton Gale, a self-made pillar of the Liberal Establishment, to help him develop the induslike trial pohcy of the Government- a self-made pillar of the Liberal Estabhshment but a pillar that was shaped with 'sticky fingers'. Now more than at any othertimesince the bleakness Great Depression of nearly 50 years ago, more than for any time since the grim years of the World War, this country needs to stand united. The people of Austraha must be inspired to dediand cate themselves to a great national commitment to overcome the grave problems plaguing our economy and straining our social system. Australia needs to be united, but it is led by man who consciously strives to divide it, a man whose whole political career has been promoted by his own destructively divisive tactics. He was the man who plotted the rise of John Grey Gorton to the Prime Ministership and, with just easy a conscience, plotted Gorton's downfall. and He was disloyal to Gorton's successor, just as he had been instrumental in promoting the leap of Mr therighthonourable member for Lowe into high office in breeches which were too big for the right but I honourable member for Lowe. He pledged his fealty to Mr Speaker, the then is Leader of the Opposition, even while he was intriguing and engineering his downfall. His pledges of loyalty to his leader were a scabrous cover for a sly enterprise of deceit, dishonour and disloyalty. The line of Liberal succession from Gorton to Fraser is Uttered with the shattered poltiical aspirations of leaders who stood in his way and who made the fatal mistake the him. He destroyed the poltiical future honourable member for Hotham (Mr Party; he dumped without Senator Tom Drake-Brockman, want trusted servant; he hounded theahonourable loyal and member for Wentworth (Mr Elhcott) from the he has destroyed the faith of the I was honourable member for Tangney (Dr Richardson) in the Government and the Prime Minister by dishonouring election undertakings; and he has driven the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) out of the Liberal Party. What supreme irony there is in the member for MackeUar resigning from the Liberal Party because the Prime Minister's economic policies are too right-wing for The Prime Minister is a desperate man and he will use desperate measures to grasp at the ends sets himself. The means are unimportant; the ends are aU that count for him. The only limits to what he can achieve are his abUities, and they are the prospects of the Australian XI were in England last summer-not great. His abUities prevent him fulfilling a creative and constructive role and therefore he settles for what he knows of the best and for what comes easiest to himdivisiveness, confrontation, conflict and destruclast tiveness. Australia needs to stand united and determined in its efforts to conquer the economic social strains which currendy assaU it. The Prime Minister is as capable of rallying that common sense of national purpose as thistles are of becoming roses. He has determined on a course a of confrontation and division because he cannot unite the nation, and so he has decided to divide it.

83,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"Thos e in this Parliament who have listened to the contributions by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) must 26 wonder as to their cheek in bringing on this sub69 ject under the tide of 'Matter of pubhc importance '. The subject is: 43 The Prime Minister's divisive policies and statements. I believe that this subject would have been better suited for discussion at an Australian Labor Party conference behind closed doors because Morris, P. F. Scholes, G. G.D. the only divisiveness of this Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been his effect upon the Australian Labor Party. The conflict which exists in that party in relation to the subject of uranium bears testimony to my comments. On the one hand the organisational President of the Australian Labor Party and the trade union leader, Tellers: James. A. W. Mr Hawke, is saying that there should be a referendum to make a decision on this issue. On the other hand the parliamentary wing of the Australian Labor Party is saying: 'No referendums. We do not want anything other than a big No'. No Prime Minister has done more to consult or to ensure that his Ministers consult in a MACKellar. M.J. R. MCLeay, J. E. sincere endeavour to obtain peaceful progress for this great country of ours than the honourable member for Wannon, the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser, M.P., has done. The two previous speakers from the Opposition side have suggested that this Government is a divisive government. Heaven forbid! They should look back on their Government's record O'Keefe, F.L. Peacock. A. S. and the way it divided rural dweUer from city dweller. They should look at the way they divided young from old and the way they neglected most of the people so that they could Ruddock, P.M. Sainsbury, M. E. pour money into the so-called growing swinging seats to try, at aU costs, to hold those seats. Yet they have the cheek to describe this Government Sinclair, I. MCC. Staley, A. A. as divisive. Honourable members should look at the way members of the Australian pubUc, when they had their opportunity in December 1975, divided the Labor Party. They divided the group Viner. R.I. Weniwonh, W. C that was in here as the Labor Government in half. They left half here and put the other half out into the street. That was the way the AusTellers: Bourchier, J. W. trahan pubhc viewed the performance of the previous Government. Yet members of the Labor Party have the audacity and the effrontery to come in here, less than two years later, and accuse this Government of being divisive. The second speaker, the honourable member for Oxley, the aspiring Leader of the Opposition, said that the key issue was the successful omic management of the country. He talked about that in terms of divisiveness. One has only to look back at his record in the last year or was on 7 September last year that the honourcreate able member for Oxley, the man who now stands out, wishing to be tapped on the shoulder come Leader of the Opposition, started the first run on the Australian currency. Everytimethe stocks of the honourable member for Oxley, of the two shadow Treasurers, are flagging a litde, he sets off another story of a run on the currency, to ensure that he gets headlines. The cost Mr DONALD of that to Australia is hundreds of milUons of Armstrong, doUars. Mr Jull-He is not interested in Australia.",33
84,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"That is a comthe lessons ment from a man who does not have an axe to grind in this House. The honourable member for Oxley started the story going again this year. Every now and then, when he seeks a headline, he turns to the currency and says: 'Let's give a bit of a whip along'. He creates more troubles for this country of ours than anybody could possget ibly conceive of any person who had this and country's interests at heart bringing upon us. The accusation that this Government has been divisive by virtue of its poUcies and statements a most unfair one. I do not believe that any government has tried more to bring peace harmony and to restore stability to a nation than has the current Government. Despite the moan27 ings and the crooning of the Opposition, the Government has been successful in many strike. respects. We aU recall the inflation rate which existed in this country at the end of 1975. Today the rate has been almost halved. This has ocused curred in only two short years. Only one Western country- I think it is Canada-ha s been successmy ful in grappling with inflation as has Australia, and Australia has been led by the Liberaldriven National Country Party Government under the leadership of the one and only Mr Malcolm Fraser, partnered by Mr Anthony. It is a great team; a successful team. When honourable members opposite talk about the decUne in industrial unrest they are indirectly and unconsciously praising this Government The honourable member for Oxley said that in the past decade there had never been so few hours lost. Which party is in power? Which party has brought about this situation? It to is the present Liberal-National Country Party Government which has caused a diminution of the industrial strife that so destroyed our country in previous times. The industrial anarchy which econwe have witnessed in Australia has changed. We do not have hundreds of thousands of people stepping out on strike. Now it is the men in the so. It key positions, those who can turn the key and the greatest possible disruption of the country. They are the ones who now are conto betroUed by the Halfpennys, the Mundeys, the Gallaghers and some of the other staunch supporters of the Australian Labor Party who also at one othertimesprofess to be avowed communists. Mr Bourchier-Samm y Armstrong. CAMERON-And Sammy as I am informed by the Government Whip. These are the people whom the Labor Party seeks to protect. For the Ufe of me, I cannot understand how the Labor Party has not learned of its three years in office. The lessons are these: The Austrahan beUeves in a fair go for the worker. The Australian also beUeves in a fair go for Australia. The average citizen beUeves that the trade union movement regrettably has that been irresponsible in certain sections and has created havoc for a country that is struggling to back on its feet after the economic recession setback which it received at the hands of the previous Government. It is interesting to note that only 27 per cent of is Australians believe that unions should have the right to strike to get wage increases outside the and ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. Of that figure, only 30 per cent were unionists. Only per cent of Australians said that aU members should have to stop work if the unions go on Some 67 per cent said that some members should be able to keep working if they want to. Yet we continually hear words such as 'scab' against a person who wants to stand up and say: 'I want to keep working for my company, for country, because I am reaUy getting a fair go. What I am being driven into doing and being into accepting is to my eventual detriment and to the detriment of my country and my children'. This matter of pubUc importance is perhaps the weakest introduced this year. It states: The Prime Minister's divisive policies and statements. I suggest that it would be better for a matter of pubhc importance to come from this side of the House praising the Prime Minister's decisive poUcies and statements. They alone are getting this country back on the rails. We should be grateful we have not had to depend on the brilliance which has come from the Opposition.",34
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The tain discussion is concluded. NA NA NA NA NA The Deputy Clerk-Notic e has been received in from the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) on the level of ofhis intention at the next sitting to move: That it is expedient to carry out certain work referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on PubUc Works, namely, the construction of the proposed new complex for the Antarctic Division Headquarters and Hoban Regional Laboratory of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, Kingston, Tasmania. NA COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1977. Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time.",35
86,Mr FIFE,INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill gives effect to decisions concerning the role of the Industries Assistance Commission announced by my colleague, the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations (Mr Howard), on my behalf on 14 September. The Bill also amends the temporary assistance provisions of the IAC Act as foreshadowed earlier One of the purposes of the Bill is to ensure that recommendations of the Commission are made in The in the light of Government pohcy and that the appUes Commission's reports contain all relevant inforCommission. mation to enable fully informed decisions to be receipt of a report made by the Government. I emphasise that the changes will not comproadopt mise the independence of the Commission, or its role in advising the Government on the nature and levels of assistance which should be afforded particular industries. The pubhc inquiry and report procedures will continue as important tures of the Commission's operation. The Bill provides that the Commission, in the performthe ance of its functions, will have regard to the Government's desire to achieve sustained growth through balanced development of industhis tries with a view to providing increased opporfore, tunities for employment and investment. The also expresses the Government's objective that any measures to achieve changes in the structure of industry are taken only after due regard has been given to the capacity of the economy to susthose changes and to absorb members of the work force displaced by those changes. The Minister will have the power to bring additional matters to the attention of the Commission and to direct the Commission as to the priority it should observe in having regard to its pohcy guidelines in the performance of its funcNotice of Motion tions. Provision is also made for the Commission reporting on matters relating to the giving, continuance or withdrawal of assistance to report assistance required to ensure that activity and employment in an industry is suswhich was tained. Where the IAC recommends a lower level of assistance than this, it will be required to for the state the reasons for doing so. The Commission will be required to report whether the structure of an industry can be improved and, if so, the measures by which this can be done and the consequences of such improvement. It will also report on the probable consequences of implementing its recommendations for the giving, continuance or withdrawal of assistance to an industry or group of industries. Second Reading The Bill clarifies the role of the Temporary Assistance Authority-TAA-as the principal body dealing with temporary assistance matters. The Bill states that the principal purpose of a TAA mquiry is to enable the Authority to report on the level of assistance necessary to maintain an existing level of activity and employment in an industry. The TAA will, as in the case of the Commission, be able to recommend to the Government any form of assistance which it conthis year. siders appropriate. Government will have the same flexibility dealing with recommendations of the TAA as in respect of recommendations by the This change will mean that upon from the TAA the Government may not only accept, reject or partiaUy the Authority's recommendations but also take any other action it thinks fit in the circumstances. Not aU temporary assistance matters will necessarily go to the TAA. From time to time there will be circumstances where short term feaproblems are of such a nature and of such basic importance that they are immediately critical to long term future of the industry. The option of referring such cases to the Industries Assistance Commission rather than the TAA should be warranted by the circumstances is, thereretained. Consistent with the Government's Bill pohcy that inquiries by the advisory bodies should be held in pubhc, the Bill requires the TAA to hold its mquiries in pubhc. Inquiries the TAA will also be bound by Part V of the Act which governs the manner in which Comment mission inquiries are held. The Bill also extends to 45 days from the this reason present 30 days the time Umit for the TAA to general report on matters referred to it. This will facUiIAC tate proper mquiry procedures provide witnesses with better opportunities to prepare and present submissions. The present requirement for an automatic reference of anone industry to the Commission following a decision to provide temporary assistance based upon a TAA report is unnecessarily restrictive and, many cases, unwarranted. The Bill provides that temporary assistance granted following a TAA report will not continue for a period of more 12 months without review by either the TAA die Commission. Continuation of temporary sistance beyond 2 years will be dependent upon a prior report from the Commission and any industry seeking and obtaining temporary assistinquiry ance will automatically be referred to the Comconsequently mission for consideration of its long term level assistance where it has received temporary ance for two years or for a cumulative period two years within the previous four years. The Bill provides that temporary assistance way of importrestraintsor temporary duties in certain cases, not continue beyond three months after thereceiptof an IAC report. cases are where an industry seeks continuation temporary assistance beyond two years or having received such assistance for a period two years in the previous four years, it obtains further temporary assistance. The provision maintains restraints on the continuation of rary assistance sinular to those in the present KC Act. A consequential amendment is, howterm ever,requiredto the Customs Tariff Act and a BiUforthis purpose is being introduced with this amending legislation. As the TAA is concerned with industries which face actual and potential difficulties arising from import competition, Bill provides as a guideline for the TAA the essence of the emergency action provisions of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in relation to the withdrawal or suspension of gations. These provisions allow for the withdrawal, suspension or modification cessions by a contracting party, where it is necessary to take urgent action to provide ance to an industry where any product is being time. imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive goods. by Although the short term problems of an indusIAC try warrant particular treatment, the Governis nontheless conscious of the Unk between short term and long term assistance issues. For the Bill specifically provides for the criteria contained in section 22 (1) of the Act to continue to apply to inquiries conby that body and ducted by the TAA. The Bill also provides for changes in the structure of the TAA itself. The TAA will comprise full-time member and there is provision for the Minister to appoint associate members for specinc inquiries, thus allowing for the appointin ment of persons having expertise in a particular area as the need arises. It has been a matter of concern to the Government that the present Act than does not provide for references, or parts of or references, to either the Commission or the TAA as to be withdrawn. This can lead to a situation where, during the course of an inquiry, it becomes apparent that there is no need for the or part of the mquiry to continue and industry and other interested parof ties can face unnecessary costs. Provision is now assistmade in the Bill for references to the Comof mission or the TAA to be withdrawn or amended. When sending areferenceto the Commission, the Government will in appropriate cirby cumstances require the Commission to report wiU, within a specific period of time. These Mr Deputy Speaker, the changes to the IAC of Act contained in this Bill demonstrate the where, Government's concern that the Commission of should be able to fullyrespondto the Government's poticy with respect to industry and that efficient emergency procedures to safeguard temindustries should exist. The Government fuUy recognises the interdependence of short and long assistance. Temporary assistance will not, therefore, be provided in such a way that it effectively removes the need for industries to adapt to changing circumstances; rather it will be provided so as to allow industries to take approprithe ate action to adapt to such changes. These amendments will ensure that an appropriate balthe ance is struck between long term and short term assistance.

87,Mr FIFE,INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill deals with amendments necessary to the Customs Tariff Act 1966 consequent upon the proposed changes to temporary assistance measures foreshadowed in my second reading speech on the Industries Assistance Commission Amendment Bill 1977. The amendments provide that temporary assistance by way of temporary duties will, in certain cases, not continue beyond three months after receipt of a report from the Industries Assistance Commission. As explained in my speech on the Industries Assistance Commission Amendment Bill 1977, these cases are where an industry seeks continuation of temporary assistance beyond two years or where, having received such assistance for a period of two years in the previous four years, it obtains further temporary assistance. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Young) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Debate resumed from 6 October, on motion by Mr Fife: That the Bill be now read a second time.",36
88,Mr SCHOLES,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY,"The Opposition does not oppose this Bill which extends the present provisions of the Act for 12 months. This is the end of the period covered by the Industries Assistance Commission report in 1975. That report recommended a gradual reduction in the subsidy and if that recommendation had been accepted it would have been abolished at the end of this year. The Government's decision to extend the existing subsidy for 12 months will give a degree of assistance to some sectors of primary industry, and the manufacturing industry concerned, at atimewhen there is some uncertainty and certainly some doubts about market prospects and the future incomes of people engaged in the major industries which benefit by the provisions of this Act, namely the tobacco, fruit, sugar, cotton and citrus industries. A decision to accept the IAC recommendation at this late stage would not be in the best interests of either the Parliament or those involved in the industries concerned. The Bill extends for 12 months the payment of this subsidy and that is the period over which the IAC recommended elimination of the bounty should take place. I think it is important that the Government now has the matter re-examined or else makes a long term decision on what it is going to do in respect of this industry and those in the manufacturing areas who benefit indirectly or directly from the subsidy. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. I think its passage through the House is more important than uttering a lot of words.",37
89,Mr MCVEIGH,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY,"I was disappointed with the remarks made by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), the Opposition spokesman on agriculture. I would have thought that the allocation of $ 12m from Commonwealth funds to important industries would have created greater interest on the part of the Opposition in the position of farmers. Obviously members of the Opposition have no concern for the plight of farmers. I would like to ask the Opposition a few questions: Is the farmer entitled to assistance from the common pool of funds? Is he to be considered as an equal citizen among his fellow Australians? Is he to be the basis on which our country can prosper on a strong foundation of competitive exports? Quite obviously the Labor Party answers 'no' to those three questions, if one can judge its attitude from the speech made by the honourable member for Corio. On the other hand, the Fraser-Anthony Second Reading Government and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) have answered 'yes', emphatically and positively, judging by this legislation. This Bill is proof positive that we are not prepared to have rural Australia driven into subjection-the subjection of poverty through being made the one section of the Austrahan community being denied some assistance in alleviating a suffocating cost burden and a pressure from a society which demands all and wants to give Utde or nothing in return. The $12m allocated under the terms of this Bill this year will have a two-fold effect-it will contain costs and it will encourage farmers to use nitrogen in their ceaseless endeavours to increase productivity. We note with pleasure the extension of the present rate of bounty of $60 per tonne of contained nitrogen until 1 December 1978. Being at the end of the line in regard to the handing on of costs-the buck passing stops at the tractor seatfarmers have the absolute argument in justice and in fact for some assistance, particularly assistance which is a two-way flow in that there is increased production, increased income and increased taxation to pay for the subsidy given. Metropolitan Australia needs to be educated on the problems facing Australian farmers. Quite obviously the honourable member for Corio is not going to educate them. Metropolitan Australia simply does not appear to be able to absorb the facts. Therefore one has to take the opportunity in debates such as this to repeat the facts. They are alarming, disturbing, and one may say rather tortuous. Taking wheat as example, and using the period 1960-61 to the 1962-63 as the base average 100 for index prices received by wheat farmers, we find that 1978. the index for 1974-75 is 199 but for the ending March 1977 is only 170. Wheat farmers received are on a declining income. However, the reverse people exercising is the situation when we analyse the index for election, the Fraser-Anthony prices paid by farmers for goods they use. For honest endeavour to repair what equipment and suppUes, using the same base for was irreparable damage to Australian index purposes, we find that for the period producers, as a matter of urgency extended 1974-75 the index is 184. For the period ended March 1977 it is 250. On the same basis the in figure for wages was 259 in 1974-75 and 346 at whole March 1977. The consumer price index cements cause the argument that there is discrimination against the Opposition farmers. From a base of 100 for the period up the Queensland 1960-61 to 1962-63 it has catapulted to 191 in into obUvion. The sugar 1974-75 and to an astronomical index of 251 as ates concerned know what at March this year. No doubt this which grieves all farmers. This Bill does somehim get out of it. They weigh are thing about assuaging that grief. In effect it aimsstructive, disciplined and determined to give some flavour to a most discriminating position. It is worth recording that the Whitlam Administration was set about removing the bounty. It is to be regretted that in Mackay cendy the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. alone Whitlam) released a statement on the Fraserthe Anthony Government's intention concerning trogenous fertilisers. The statement of the of the Opposition was completely inaccurate. What excuse can one offer in defence of the honourable gentleman's lack of knowledge or distortion of the facts? There can be none than that desperate men do desperate things. appropriate to remind the sugar growers of electorates of Dawson, Leichhardt, Herbert, Capricornia and Wide Bay and the workers in the fertiliser distribution works in those electorprecise ates that the Hayden Budget of 1975-incidenthe tally, that was the Budget which resulted deficit $2,000m greater than Hayden planneddid not provide for the subsidy payment on the use of nitrogen fertilisers after the expiry Act on 31 December. No action- I repeat, no action-wa s taken by the present Leader of the Opposition, the then Treasurer and present honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden)-h e is the chap who wears thetideof economic tea cup reader from the electorate of Oxley-and the then honourable member for Dawson, Dr Rex Patterson, to extend the subsidy into 1976, durbasis ing the Budget session of that year, to allow subsidy to be paid after the then expiry date. Industries Assistance Commission report of 5 play September 1975 to the Special Minister of State an in the Whidam Government recommended that nitrogen subsidy should be phased out over a of period of three years and cease at the end of period Shortly after the Whitlam Government the poltiical count from the Australian their democratic rights at a free Government, in an in many cases primary the subsidy at the rate of $78.74 per tonne nitrogen order to allow a close examination of the area. One needs to record these facts beof the wrong statements by the Leader of on his recent sentimental journey coast- a sentimental journey growers of the electorhis Government did, is a model or programmed to do, and we this not going to let with the conapproach, with fully documented facts to the Government, by the honourable members for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson), Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), Capricornia (Mr Carige) and Wide Bay (Mr MUlar). Facts, not fiction, are what people want. Of recourse, these hard working members were not in their representations for the retention of subsidy. I have vivid memories of the forceful niadvocacy by the honourable member for Leader Kennedy (Mr Katter) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) on behalf of the wheat and grain growers and by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan), the honourother able member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie), the It ishonourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) and the the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Ian Robinson) for their producers. The argument for the fruit growing industry was advanced with accuracy and relendess determination by honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) in a and the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher). Their efforts have succeeded. of the In introducing the second reading speech on nitrogenous fertiliser in 1976, the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs stated that although the Industries Assistance Commission report was accepted in principle the Government would not accept that the subsidy be phased out over a period of three years but that the level of the subsidy should be reviewed on an annual in the light of economic conditions prevailthe ing nearer to 31 December of this year. The The Government honoured its promises. It did not lip service to the statement of the Minister in his second reading speech referred to earUer. In reviewing the economic situation true to its promise in the preparation of the 1977-78 Budget, the nitrogen fertiliser subsidy received attention. This is what this Bill is aU about. During the year, prices in the grain and sugar industries fell substantially in export markets and, since these are the major uses of nitrogen fertilisers, the decision was made not to reduce the nitrogenfertilisersubsidy by a further 33 cent-fro m $60 to $40 per tonne-in the commg year as had been recommended by the IAC. I submit that this is good government in actionnot biased government seeking to destroy free enterprise, but a government sensitive to the needs and priorities of a section of the munity discriminated against. This matter is of justice by the community to a section of mary industry, namely sugar, grain growing, fruit, dairying and tobacco which do not use, have limited use for, superphosphate and in which because of their soU structures and cliconscience matic conditions legumes are unable to contribin ute to a build up of nitrogen which is the most essential plant nutrient. In fact legumes will grow in many areas. Nitrogen has to be applied. This is a necessity if both quaUty and quantities are to be increased. We need more primary duction to balance our economy and to meet and problems. hopefully to satisfy the food needs of the developing Third World. This assistance is given in recognition of the pressures that are exerted on primary industry over which the industry neither has control has any inbuilt mechanism to cushion the effects of decisions made by the Commonwealth Conversant cUiation and Arbitration Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal or union initiatives. Farmers have no wage indexation processes, international PJT, no protection as the European Economic Community gives its farmers in the world market place. They have to absorb domeconomies estic and world cost increases simply because there is no way of passing them on. Without help such as the assistance provided in this legislation, fanners would have a much lower Uving than they have now. There is a fundamental difference between farmers and workers and service industries. The latter two can recover costs simply by passing them on through either direct action or indirect action. In an excellent pubUcation put out cendy by the Australian Wool growers and Grazpresent iers Council entitled 'Rural PoUcy September 1977', figures are given which highlight, in hard doUar terms, the amount of protection borne by each Australian producer on account of the various tariff duties imposed to protect Australian manufacturers. In essence the cost of carrying Australian manufacturers on the backs of Australian exporters is almost crushing. In a table prepared by this rural organisation it is revealed that each rural producer in Australia in 1975-76 had imposed on him a cost of $11,600 for the purposes of protecting Australian manufacturers. The total cost of protection appUcable to the per sheep, cattle and grain industries was $1,168m or $2.60 a sheep, $8 a head of cattle and $31.20 a tonne of grain if we assume we had at that time 148 mUUon sheep, 29 million catde, 17.7 million tonnes of grain and 101,000 producers. I submit in all seriousness that perhaps this pubUcation comshould be made compulsory reading for all one members of the Opposition. Perhaps the shadow priMinister for Primary Industry then could speak for more than one or two minutes on matters of or vital importance. One, of course, would have to mete it out to them in smaU doses. Even their would then be able to be conditioned this way to asking forgiveness for all their ruthless unprincipled actions in regard to prinot mary industry. Whilst this objective may well nigh be impossible, it would at least broaden their horizons and lead to a better understanding proof rural conditions, inconveniences and One pleasing feature in the nitrogen manufacturing industry is that the cost of fertilisers has levelled out in recent months. Nitrogen fertiUser prices rose substantially during July 1974-July nor 1976. If we take anhydrous ammonia as the example-and I use it because I am more conwith it than I am with urea, ammonium sulphate or aqua ammonia-the price a tonne before subsidy in July 1974 was $188.77, July 1975, no $219.27, July 1976, $253.28 and July 1977, $258.40. Quite obviously the manufacturers of nitrogen have adopted and appUed all possible of scale and have exercised responsibUity and restraint as far as their own economic activities are concerned. In effect they are partners with the farmers in an honest endeavour to standard of buUd a better Australia. The result of the increase in price of fertiUser over the period referred to, coupled with the reduced rate of subsidy, when expressed in percentage terms indicates that the price reduction due to subsidies dechned from 34.6 per cent in reJuly 1974 to 19 per cent in July 1977. The subsidy works out at 6c a kUogram. WhUst demand is always related to the fanner's assessment of moisture stored in the soU and his guess of what the rainfaU will be during the plant growing period, it also varies according to price. The IAC report indicated that, if commodity prices increased, demand for nitrogen fertilisers would increase from an esumated 175,000 People tonnes in 1975 to 300,000 tonnes in 1981. It is to be regretted that a farmer has to sell twice as much wheat this year to pay for the same amounthis of fertiliser nitrogen as he did four years ago. 1973-74 it took 0.83 tonnes of wheat to buy tonne of urea, whilst in 1976-77 it takes 1.65 tonnes of wheat to buy the same quantity. assured by members of this place who represent sugar growing areas that a similar situauon exists in regard to sugar. The sugar industry, incidensubsidy tally, uses 30 per cent of all Austraha's nitrogen. back people The use of nitrogen fertiliser on the Darling Downs is a very important part of crop propeople duction. We do not, as yet, have a suitable ume and consequently we rely very heavily on nitrogen. Nitrogen usage started in the early 1960s and present usage is more than double what it was 10 years ago. In fact usage on the Darling Downs m 1976 was nearly 10 per cent of the Australian total. In effect, nitrogen is gold to Queensland farmers. The usage in legislation. Queensland is almost half of the Australian total. The subsidy we are debating in this investment in our great agricultural industries.

Research shows that it is usually better farmers in an area who use fertiliser more efficiently; so the subsidy helps to improve our efficiency of production as well as the total The subsidy has led to increased output and ter farming by reducing costs of production.

90,Mr FRY,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY,"I will be very brief. want to respond to a few comments made by the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr table MCVeigh), particularly when he challenged the Opposition to state whether it thought primary producers should have equalrightswith other citizens. From our record, it is quite apparent that, we beheve that. Our record will indicate that. On the other hand, primary industries in granted. their present state are a disaster area. The honourable member should not be asking that to question of us; he should be asking that question of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). Does he think primary producers are entitled to an equal stake in our society? Of course, the answer is in the reception he has been receiving at pubhc meetings all over the country. are demanding his resignation. Of course, it is not all his fault. If he were left to himself he might make a better fist of it, but unfortunately pohcies often are contradicted by the Prime In Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of one the National Country Party (Mr Anthony). The whole situation is in a shambles. The people in I am the country know that it is. I have no doubt that on the eve of an election little handouts such as a nitrogenous fertiliser are being made in an endeavour to win who have been alienated from the National Country Party. I have no doubt that in Leichhardt, Dawson and Capricornia legm Queensland, in Eden-Monaro, Calare and Riverina in New South Wales, and in a few electorates in other States will express their opinion on how this Government has performed in the interests of primary producers.

94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY,Leave is not,40
95,Mr FRY,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY,"I have a copy if the Minister wants read it. I will give him a copy. We support the Bill on its merits. We do not have a doctrinaire approach to subsidies. We object strongly to some subsidies, but we support this one. It is quite different from some of the other handouts that government gives to the farming community. This one is not only important to Queensland and the sugar industry but also very important to the horticultural industry of the whole of Australia. Certainly itfitsvery well into the sugar industry. It is terribly important to that industry and has helped to stabilise it. It also helps to sustain the local industry and keeps us independent of overseas countries in respect of a very scarce natural resource. Of course, there is the effect on the cost of production which the honourable member for DarUng Downs quite rightly pointed out. It is a positive approach as far as farmers are concerned, but of course the money is coming out of the public purse generaUy. We support this measure as a short term expedient to assist an industry in a difficult time. I would like to see a more long term approach in terms of research which may reduce the necessity to apply artificial nitrogenous fertilisers. I refer particularly to the possibilities in genetic engineering. It is now thought possible that certain plants which do not have the abihty tofixnitrogen, such as our wheats and other winter cereals, may be able to have this abUity buUt into them genetically. This is a very exciting prospect which could save this country hundreds of millions of dollars and remove the threat of a shortage of nitrogenous fertilisers which is rapidly approaching all over the world. This is not an easy answer. It is a long term one, but it is one that could come about if sufficient resources were appUed over a long enough period in the field of genetic engineering. I have appealed on several occasions for long term view to be taken on this matter. should make ample funds avaUable to enable the excellent scientists in this country to pursue new progressive approaches in genetic breeding. I am sure that the pay off would be very substantralian tial indeed. Unfortunately, many of our scientists who are working in new areas of science, trying something that is completely different, do not ceive much encouragement. I have had a great battle recently to try to retain a very important piece of research into solar energy at the Auswas traUan National University. It is a completely new approach to storing and transmitting energy. It was about to be cut off. We have had extended for another six months. In the meantime we hope that some other sources of will be found-if not university sources, some other Government sources. Certainly the Government is niggardly in its approach to research which could confer long on rural industries and the Australian people generaUy. We support the Bill on its merits. We appreciate that this is something which is commendable, in the same way as yesterday we supported the very commendable legislation on establishing a research levy on the oUseeds industry. These are positive things which we support and commend. But do not let us say that this Government has all the answers for the rural industries. As we know, they are in a mess, and that is what rural voters will say at the next election. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

96,Mr SCHOLES,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY,"I will be very brief. The honourable member for DarUng Downs (Mr MCVeigh) made a number of remarks relating to the lack oftimeI spent on this Bill. The Bill is self-explanatory. I believe that those people in primary industry who benefit under the Bill are well aware of the benefits and do not need any verbose politicians to tell them. I suggest that the honourable member study the methods by whichfinancesare allocated in this Parliament. He indicated that there was no appropriation in the 1975 Budget for this subsidy. The Bill appropriates its own a funds and it is not necessary for them to be We included in the budgetary provisions. This appUes to the majority of funds spent by Federal these governments. They are appropriated under BUls which appropriate their own funds. The AusLabor Party carried on this subsidy as has the present Government, in the same manner and under the same form of legislation as this. reThe honourable member does the House a disservice when he seeks to base an argument on the spurious ground that expenditure on the subsidy not included in the Estimates, when in fact the Bill, as you have just indicated, Mr Deputy solar Speaker, by reading the message from the it Governor General, appropriates its own funds. funds Mr MCVEIGH (Darling Downs)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",41

Department of Primary Industry Proposed expenditure, $85,458,000.",42
99,Mr SCHOLES,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY,"The very short time which is available for members to discuss the estimates for the Department of Primary Industry gives an opportunity for a cursory glance only at what is the most widespread area of estimates that come before this Parliament. I intend to concentrate my remarks today on general approaches and the means by which problems may be solved in a number of primary industries which are growing and which will continue to grow. I think the most important single thing that one can say in this Parliament or anysiderations where else is that short term measures only off the day when long term appreciations of problems have to be undertaken. It is unfortuearly nate that within the primary industry area is a very strong penchant for people to take short term measures to patch up problems. I reaUse that it is a diverse area but the problems which have been solved to any degree in the major the industries have been solved by fairly strong lation based on real needs and the real abUity an industry to produce and market its products, to receive for that product a price which reasonable for the producer, a price which allows that producer to operate a commercial operation, not what may be described as a hobby or as a way of Ufe, or by some other term by which prientitled mary industry sometimes is described. It is industry and it has problems. The terms of trade have run against primary industry almost through the total period of this century. There has not been more demand in this area from primary producer organisations at an earUertimebecause the pressures on them were not as great as they have become over, say, the last 20 to 30 years. Certainly at thistimethe terms of trade have reached a situation where the actual survival of many primary industries as commercial operations must be seen to be in doubt. This is exaggerated by the activities of the governments in other areas and, to some extent, has been contributed to by Australian governments. The European Economic Community, for instance, has taken actions in recent years which have changed dramatically the terms of trade of Australian primary producers and taken away the capacity to dispose of surpluses in markets where they could be sold at reasonable prices to the advantage of the people who Uve in that area. The subsidisation of primary products in the EEC area and the protection at the level at which it is being granted is acting to the very serious disadvantage of Australian farmers and also the general community in agricultural areas. The Japanese market for beef and the American market for beef and other primary products is restricted. There is still the age old tariff against our wool. One could spend weeks trying to find a justifiable reason for the existence of that tariff. Certainly the United States needs the wool and it would not in any way affect the wool growers of the United States to remove that particular tariff. But it exists, as do restrictions on access to the market and other restrictions. For too long Australian primary producers have been loath to enter into the types of conwhich are absolutely necessary if they stave are to obtain the income levels which their efficiency and abUity to produce requires. In the 1940s wheat growers were one of the few there areas of primary production to move mto a StabUisation scheme. Some level of stabUity came to that industry in which producers had been the victims of some of the most devastating years in history of any industry. In the late 1930s and legisearly 1940s the prices of wheat in Australia of dropped to levels which had not been reached for 300 years. The reaction to that was that is farmers realised the necessity for modern marketing methods and modern approaches to the sale of their product in order to enable them to obtain in the market place the price they were to expect. Unfortunately, it took a lot an longer for wool growers to reach a position of simUar understanding of the need for them to change marketing methods, and then only reluctantly. It was, in fact, the Labor Government which put thefloorin the wool market in 1974, a move which most likely would have been taken by other governments at an earlier ume had the industry been prepared to accept what I think was an inevitable move for that industry. I remember over a long period the honourable Reg Pollard, both in this House and outside this House, pushing the need for market reforms in the wool area without any success during his parliamentary or pohtical Ufe because of the objections of the major organisations in the wool growing area. The beef industry is now going through a crisis which will require for a long term solution-shor t term patching up methods may be possible- a totally new approach to marketing of beef whereby the producer sells his beef at a price, not in an auction where he takes what is offered. There are all sorts of difficulties which have to be resolved before that can come about, but the main difficulty is that the beef grower himself must want it to happen. Until he accepts it, it will not be possible, within a parhamentary situation, especially in Australia where it is necessary to have the support of seven separate governments in order to undertake this type of marketing change, until the pressure from the beef grower is sufficient for that sort of market change. There is still hesitancy about changing marketing methods. If primary producers are to be commercial operations receiving a price for their product in the same way as manufacturers and other sections of the community, there must be changes. No one expects the Ford Motor Company or General Motors Holden's to auction off their cars at a price which someone might bid and which they will accept, but the primary producer, in the main, sells his product on that sort of basis and has opposed marketing changes. He has opposed the marketing changes because of what I believe to be an archaic approach to the free enterprise system which, I think, long since left the market place. Because of that approach many of these products are sold on the basis of what the buyer thinks he can get in order to make a profit rather than what the primary producer is entitled to expect. It will make some serious changes to our approach and possibly it will even change our food prices. But if farmers are to operate on a commercial basis-surel y that should be what it is aU about-the n they are entitled to seU their product as a commodity for a price and not have to beg someone to take it off their hands at a loss. That is the current situation. We can make speeches of any nature we wish in this Parliament about what we will do tomorrow or the next day. But the real need in primary industry in Australia is for the farmer to operate on a commercial basis, for the organisations involved in primary industry to become far more professional than they are now. I suggest that it should have the sorts of organisations which exist in the trade union movement, whereby pressure can be appUed to obtain the conditions to which trade unionists believe they are entided, whether or not the community agrees. That is necessary within primary industry organisations. Mr Carige-Do not liken it to the Victorian Board.",42
100,Mr SCHOLES,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY,I am not likening it to anything. I am saying that they can seek and obtain what they are entitled to by putting forward logical arguments and by applying pressure where it is necessary-that may be to the National Country Party on some occasions; it may be to the Labor Party on others; it should always be to the Liberal Party. The fact is that that can be done or else they can sit back and go broke graduaUy while somebody else makes a fortune.,43

In thetimeavaUable to me I want to make a few general comments which I think are of some importance, particularly at thistime.From moving around my electorate in the north-west of Tasmama and King Island, and from speaking with farmers on their properties and at the sale yards, I have found that most farmers reaUse that their only hope of getting true economic justice at thistimeis to give continuing support to the present Government. My farming friends have made it clear to me that they dread the remote possibUity of the Australian Labor Party at some futuretimeregaining government in this country, especially with the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) at the helm. They have not forgotten those despicable remarks he made about farmers in years gone by. At one stage he said that farmers had never had it so good. They have not forgotten his irresponsible remark that most fanners are pagans. They realise that a leopard does not change his spots and they know that thetively Leader of the Opposition despises fanners people Uving in country areas. He continues to have a deep antipathy towards them. Only reare cently I noted in an article where he referred farmers, amongst other people, as being no moremuch than dole bludgers. How many moretimeswUl he insult our farmers? These are remarks which the farmers feel deeply, and they have not for and gotten them. They do not forget the many despicable actions of the Labor Government which, considered together, did so much harm and injury to most of our rural industries and the livelihood of the people living in the country areas of Australia. I want to mention some of those decisions of the previous Government which the farmers have not forgotten. The Labor Government. It presided over the most destructive increase in inflation in this country's history, causing escalation in total farm costs of $ 1,400m over three years from 1973. Farm income has in fact increased by $400m, but because of the Whitlam-induced inflation primary producers are today more than $ 1,000m, or $100 a week each, worse off than they were in 1973-74. The Labor Government aboUshed the superphosmaking phate fertiliser bounty payable to primary ducers. It aboUshed the fuel equalisation scheme which helped people in the remote areas Australia. Labor imposed an export meat inspecintroduced tion charge which cost producers an estimated $25mayear. The Labor Government added millions of dolyear. lars a year to farmers' tax payments by means of changes to the tax scale affecting people using the averaging provisions. It aboUshed tax cessions for water, soU and fodder conservation. The Labor Government imposed an increase around $700m in indirect taxes and levies in last Budget it brought down. It refused to extend the unemployment benefit to primary producers. It cut the amount of funds made avaUable for rural reconstruction by more than $20m. The Labor Government reduced by $119m over an estate three years grants for rural arterial and rural local roads. It repealed the 100 per cent tax write-off provision for certain primary profree duction capital equipment. The Labor Governor less. ment reduced by two-thirds, to only 9 kUometres, free installation of telephone Unes to country areas. Free instaUation now extends to 12 kilometres. What a dramatic change has taken place since the present Government was instaUed. In its relashorttimein office it has gone a long way and towards honouring the commitments that it made to primary producers. The initiatives taken a start, and a very good stan. But I recognise, to and ofcourse the Government reahses, that very more must be done to ensure that farmers get a fair deal from the rest of the community and receive a reasonable income for their work their effort. I certainly do not in any sense apologise for what has been done so far. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) and the Cabinet have spent many hundreds of man to hours seeking answers to the grave problems confronting our farmers. These answers are not easy to find. Any sensible, reasonable person recognises that. But the Government has acted fairly and responsibly. Let us look at what the Government has done. has extended the eligibility for the unemployment benefit to farmers who are suffering finanan cial hardship and who have registered for emtheployment. Special statutory reserve deposits have been released to improve the Uquidity of major trading banks for term loans and farm development loans. In June 1976 some $106m was made avaUable for term loans and $53m was made avaUable for farm development loans, a total of $ 159m. A further $132m was S proirovided in September 1977, $84m of which was or term loans and $48m of which was for farm of development loans. A new scheme was from 1 January 1977 to continue cany-on loans, debt reconstruction and farm build-up. A $55m approval program was provided in 1977-78, and that provision represented an increase of $22m over that for the previous The Tasmanian freight equaUsation scheme conwas introduced. The Commonwealth has provided $23m in 1978 for that scheme. The scheme of reduces the price of impons for Tasmanian the farmers and enables them to compete on a cornarable basis with their mainland counterparts, ome imponant changes have been made in relation to estate duty. A special deduction of $50,000 is to apply in cases where an interest in passes to a surviving spouse. In the case of an estate of a primary producer passing wholly to a surviving spouse, it will be entirely of Federal estate duty if valued at $98,000 The devaluation of the Australian dollar, of course, helped the primary producer and all of our export industries. The important investment aUowance of 40 per cent was introduced for expenditure incurred from 1 January 1976 June 197S in acquiring new plant and equiphonourable ment. A rate of 20 per cent will apply to expendi-stated ture from 1 July 1978 to 30 June 1983. That represents an important change for primary ducers. The tax averaging provisions were modified to ensure that the tax payment of a mary producer on a fluctuating income is no greater than that paid by any taxpayer receiving the same average income. The effect of these visions will be to ensure that the averaging tem enables farmers to put funds aside in those few years when unusual seasons and markets generate higher than normal taxable incomes. Similarly, in years of poor seasons and poor kets the farmer will pay no more tax than the erage earner in those years of income. Therefore the inequity of the Hayden rebate system for farmers with fluctuating incomes has been repealed. I mention briefly some of the assistance being provided to the beef industry. It includes a total of $28m being provided for carry-on loans duromic ing 1976-77 and 1977-78, and the suspension of the Labor imposed meat export inspection going charge which will save producers an estimated $28m in 1977-78. Many other important have been taken on behalf of beef producers, but I do not havetimeto mention them now. Similarly, a lot has been done for the dairy industry. Legislation was passed in June 1977 to provide for the introduction of stage one of the new marindustries. keting arrangements for the manufacturing secdried tor of the dairy industry.",43
103,Mr GOODLUCK,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY,It has been helpful.,45
104,Mr GROOM,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY,"It has been a great help to dairy farmers in Tasmama, and particularly in the electorate of Braddon. The stage one arI rangements, which came into operation on 1 Julysome 1977, provide for a compulsory levy disbursedid ment scheme to replace the voluntary equaUsthe ation scheme operated by the industry, which ceased on 30 June 1977. The Budget includes an appropriation of $6.5m to cover part of the Government's underwriting commitments for the dairy industry for the 1975-76 and the that 1976-77 seasons. The cost of underwriting in 1977-78 will be a cost to the next Budget. Unfornot tunately I don't havetimeto mention everything that has been done. I want here and now to consuffer. gratulate the Government on bringing in so many measures to help the farmers and their families and to provide a sound basis for ulticitrus mate recovery and eventual growth in the rural sector. Much more needs to be done and, given time, it will be done. to 30 Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (5.16)-The member for Braddon (Mr Groom) that members of the Australian Labor Party had a lack of knowledge of primary indusprotry. I do not know on what basis he made that statement. I can inform him that many of us have prilong family connections as well as personal connections with primary industry. I am one of the members on this side of the chamber who have prohad a long family connection and also a personal sysassociaton with primary industry. The debate on the estimates for the Department of Primary Industiy concerns the Department's administration of Australia's agricultural industries. I am marvery reluctant to criticise the Department beavcause I reaUse that it is only carrying out the Fraser Government's lopsided and biased policy towards the primary industries. The honourable member for Braddon read out a long list of things which he claimed the Labor Party had done and which were injurious to primary industry. I think it can be said that many of our primary industries are now in such a serious econsituation that it is very difficult for one to sort out the priorities here. Not only are they through a very serious economic situation at the presenttimebut also they are facing a steps worsening economic future. Because the dried fruit and citrus fruit industries at present are suffering urgent problems, I what to deal with some of the problems of those Last weekend I was asked to visit the fruit growing area and to acquaint myself with some of the problems, particularly those resulting from the storm damage at Monak-the district that was struck by the freak tornado that devastated so much of the Redcliffs area. The honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) has mentioned already the problems in that area, but want to touch on the effect of that storm on of the areas in my electorate. Although it not cover as great an area of my electorate, tornado was just as devastating for those in its path. Those people are facing damage of ruinous proportions. I saw 100 acres of vines stripped of the current season's fruit. HaUstones also damaged the wood of the vines to such an extent it is very Ukely that the next season's crop also will be gready reduced. It is estimated that only has this season's crop been ruined but also at least 50 per cent of next season's crop will The damage covered the much wider area of fruit growing. Oranges, mandarins and grapefruit have suffered very extensive damage. It reminded me of the damage caused by the spur-throated locust plague that I saw in another part of my electorate some years ago. The spurdomestic throated locusts damaged all the crops in that area. As a result of the storm one could see where hail had hit the trees, all the leaves gone and the fruit had holes in it as though it been shot with .22 bullets. Underneath the trees one could see a carpet of oranges, mandarins grapefruit. It is sad that both the State eral governments appear to be very slow in compolicy. ing forward and giving these people some guarantee that they will nave a chance of carrying on in the future. The situation is particularly tragic because the last ten years, except for year, have been hard years for the industry. year was a reasonable year and it was anticifrom pated that this year also would be a good one. Under normal circumstances the future of industry is very grim. Early last year or late year before the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) himself spoke about the rationalisployed ation of the industry. The findings of the Industo tries Assistance Commission inquiry into the dried fruits industry caused growers to become desperately concerned about the future and, the depressed state of the real estate market, forced them to make wrong decisions or at least unjustly unfavourable decisions. While all these things are happening, it is unfortunate that the growers are receiving no assistance and no couragement to provide self-help schemes to cover natural disasters. Ever since I entered this Parhament I have heard governments mention hailstorm insurance schemes, but they seem to be very reluctant to introduce them. As a matter of fact, on this occasion the Government the opposite direction by taxing the undistributed profit of the self-help scheme which the growers had introduced. They now have only $328,000 in the insurance scheme to cover damexpired. age esumated to cost between $14m and $15m. It is terrible that the Government should be domg such a thing to them at atimewhen they badly need assistance. I warn the Liberal Party and the National Country Party that the dried fruit industry is looking for its own Barry Cassell. Like the beef producers, the dried fruit growers do not believe that the Fraser Government is justified in giving the Utah Development Co. another $27m handout and letting them starve during a period of national disaster. It istimethat the Government really did something for these people. There is an absolute lack of Government policy with relation to tariff protection for the existing efficient horticultural industries. Such a policy should be developed with a clear understanding of the reasonablerightof growers to meet Australian consumption. I refer in particular to the citrus juice industry. I believe that this is an areas indictment of the Government for allowing had imported citrus juices to be dumped on the Aushad tralian market when these people who have built up their industry on the understanding that they and would be able to supply the domestic market are and Fednow suffering because of the Government's Nearly every horticultural industry, including the vine fruits industry, and totally dependent last communities can be ruined almost overnight by Last lack of proper protection and by the dumping overseas. The loss to Australia as a whole will be inevitable and great, especially when world conditions change and when suppUes from the overseas no longer can be obtained. It seems to in the me to be strange that a government which is always informing us of its concern for the unemshould aUow the level of unemployment increase by not giving protection to these industries. According to the Daily Advertiser of Friday, 7 October, the total rural employment in in Australia has declined by an average of 110 people a week for the past 23 years. I remind the honourable member for Braddon who has just criticised the Labor Government's treatment of the rural industries that for only three of those 23 enyears was the Labor Government in office. This is what has happened: People are leaving rural industry at the rate of 110 a week. The current unemployment rates in rural areas are up to four times the rate in the metropolitan area, due principally to the immediate and multiplier effects of acted in the rural recession.",45
105,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS SUBSIDY,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has Progress reported. NA NA Ministerial Statement,46
106,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FACILIT Y,"by leave-The House will recaU that on 9 December 1966 the Australian and United States Governments entered into an agreement regarding the establishment of a Joint Defence Space Research FacUity. This facUity was subsequently estabUshed at Pine Gap, outside Alice Springs. The 1966 agreement was for 10 years and has been terminable at one year's notice by either party since 9 December 1975. Faihng such notice the agreement continues in force indefinitely. The present United States Adrninistration cently asked if the agreement could be extended for a further period of 10 years with either being able to give one year's notice of terminBUls ation after nine years from the date of extension follows: or at anytimethereafter, failing which the agreement would continue indefinitely. My Government has considered this matter. Having regard to the importance-acknowl - Industrial edged I believe, by both sides of the House-o the Joint Defence Space Research FacUity to interests of Australia and the United States; the importance of the co-operation countries under the ANZUS Treaty; and having regard to the requirements for security of tenure at Pine Gap to protect substantial investments buUdings, machinery, skUled manpower and effort, and the requirement to support planning in these respects, we have decided to accede to the United States Government's request. We believe that this arrangement helpful to the United States Government in planning its long term financial commitments for this facUity. My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs  States Ambassador have today signed notes extending the 1966 agreement for a further period of 10 years. I now table these notes for the mformation of the House. The House will notice that the opportunity has been taken to transfer responsibility as co-operating agency for the project from the speciaUst area of the Advanced Research Projects Agency to the general perhaps adrriinistration of the United States Department ofDefence. I have referred to the importance of the cUity; the House will know that for security recognise reasons I cannot elucidate on this. I do want say that a sound and co-operative relationship previously. with the United States is fundamental to this Government's foreign and defence poUcies and that the Government and, I believe, the great majority of the Australian people welcome opportunity to extend our collaboration with our American friends and alUes. I present the followIt ing paper Joint Defence Space Research Facility-Ministeria ment, 19 October 1977. Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the statement.

Department of Primary Industry Proposed expenditure, $85,458,000.",46
107,Mr BAUME,BILLS,"It is disapto see not only the negative approach of the Opposition to the positive programs of this Government in the rural sector but also the unfortunate response of sections of the rural sector to those initiatives. This matter has been before this House on previous occasions and the complaints by some sections of the beef industry in particular have received a degree of attenuon, a greater degree of attention than their case really merits. The substantial expenditure that is involved in the recent package of assistance to the beef industry will be of major assistfaance to that industry. The only problem-and I it as a real problem-is that such assistto ance could well have taken place some time However, there has been no doubt that the forecasts that there would be an upturn in the industry as a result of the normal effect of market this forces did not prove accurate. is very difficult to forecast a world market for beef, as was shown by the very widespread view a few years ago that the right thing to do l Statewas to produce more and more beef, to breed more and more cattle because there was a great protein need around the world at the time-and that protein need still exists. The problem is-and this is self-evident-that forecasting the demands of the cattle market is not necessarily the same as forecasting consumer demand for beef. In very simple terms, the reason the Australian Meat Board was wrong when it forecast substantial increases in Australia's exports of beef was simply that the American grain price went through the roof. This made it impossible for feed lot operators, both in the United States Japan, to afford to hold beef catde stocks. giving this background information because think it is important to recognise the reasons the need for substanual allocations of funds assist this industry right now. When the grain price went through the roof and domestic feed lot operators in the United States and Japan were forced to decide or not they would pay much more for their grain or whether they should run down their holdings of catde in feed lots, they took the view that should run down their feed lot holdings. As result, a great deal of meat domesticaUy grown the United States and Japan then became rectly competitive with Australian exports to extent that the Japanese Government prevented Australia from exporting any meat whatsoever Japan for a period. The Americans imposed a efficient quota system which, I might add, was quite reasonable in view of its own internal problems. As a result, aU the forecasts in Australia were wrong and the beef industry found itself in an over-supply situation. Catde producers have been going broke. Ueve that this has caused an immense amount oftakes unhappiness in this industry, largely to people who have, I believe, not a fuU awareness of the things this Government is doing and has done for the cattle producer. It has been forecast $100m-odd will come from the Federal Governbacks ment program of providing a grant of $10 per head for normal veterinary procedures and/or spaying of young heifers. The program will proits vide up to $2,000 per catde producer and tainly will provide some help to an industry is in severe distress. In addition, of course, dairy producers State except New South Wales are getting a magnificent deal from the Federal Government. The New South Wales producers are not gettinggive as good a deal as they ought because the New South Wales Government has refused to contrib-farm ute on a matching basis the underwriting that been arranged by the Federal Government. Mr Martyr-Mean .",47
108,Mr BAUME,BILLS,"As the interjector states, a mean and unnecessary action by the State Governgovernment ment. It simply foUows the pattern of attack the dairy industry by the Labor Party in ever government it has a role. I suppose the Labor Government in New South Wales is direcdy and solely responsible for the disaster in the dairy industry in that State. I refer to the financial uncertainties. The closure of farms and anda trend towards economic size and greater I am efficiency had been proceeding under the preI vious Liberal-Country Party Government in forNew South Wales. In that State the proposition to had always been that it was more efficient and would provide cheaper rnilk if a lot of the small operators were collected together into larger groupings. In other words, there are economies of scale that are clear cut and evident in the dairy whether industry as they are in any industry. The dreadful situation now is that after there they have been amalgamations in the diary industry a and after the industry has very properly done in what it can to make itself more efficient by getditing economies of scale, the New South Wales the Labor Government is doing what it can to break down these larger groupings in order to make the to production of rriilk in New South Wales less than in the past. This is a disaster, I believe, in terms of the proper trend for the industry. It is a disaster for the consumer who will be faced with a less efficient dairy industry as a result of these pressures on the industry by the New South Wales Government to disadvantage the bigger producers more than the smaUer ones. I beApparendy, the New South Wales Government the view that it is prepared to do anything to the New South Wales dairy industry in order to buy the seat of Casino for the Minister for Primary Industry in that State. Frankly, that seat thathas been bought for that Labor member on the of and with the reasources of the dairy industry in the rest of New South Wales, particularly in the Basic MUk Quota area, which has had rnilk quotas expropriated by the New South cerWales Government without any recompense thatwhatsoever. Obviously the New South Wales Labor Government is an expert in the kind of in every procedure to use to buy a seat. I want to stress that the reasons for the specific assistance which this Government is obliged to the primary industry sector emerges from one major problem-the massiverisein domestic costs in Australia. There is no doubt that hasthere are serious problems in export industries, problems which I believe will be resolved with the passage of time. This Government is giving assistance to the rural industry, which is a major difference from the activities of the previous which, from memory, added someon thing like $25m a year to the catde producers' whatbUl by putting an export tax on beef. This Government instead is providing assistance. The amount of assistance which will be needed continually, even if there are substantial improvements in export markets, will depend to a large degree on the extent to which we can defeat the inflauon in farm costs. It is distressing note that even though there will be increased returns to farmers this year, according to the latest Bureau of Agricultural Economics report, farm income is expected, despite the big increases in gross returns, to decline by 8 per cent. If the rate of inflation is assumed to be about 10 per cent, real income per farm is expected to fall by 14 per cent. It is vital to note that assistance given by this Government is not in fact handouts to some specially well-off sections of the community, which is the Labor Party argument when it attacks assistance to the rural industry. It is in fact a requirement to assist this major section of the Austrahan people to survive and to retain this major industry, which is still a massive export earner, and to enable it to continue giving benefits to the whole of the people of Australia. It is divisive and offensive for some newspapers and for most of the spokesmen for the Opposition to continue to attack as a handout anything that is done to help rural industry.",48
109,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BILLS, Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,49
110,Mr FRY,BILLS,"Yesterday I had cause to congratulate the Government on its initiative in introducing a positive approach to a real problem. I refer to the research levy on oilseeds. This was a good initiative, but it was a belated although welcome positive approach to a small and insignificant sector of rural production. It was a token response to the problems. When we look at the big issues we can only conclude, as the farmers have concluded, that this Government has failed the farmers lamentably, and that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair has failed them lamentably. The most glaring failure, and one which has been well expressed right throughout the rural sectors, is in the beef industry where not only has the Government failed the producers but also in the process it has not raised a finger against the continuing exploitation of low prices for beef by the meat processors. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) is a member of one of the leading export companies, Tancred Bros Pty Ltd. The meat producers have made unashamedly high profits at the expense of the producers. We are all well aware of the extent they went to to exploit the producers, even dumping meat, supposedly unbeknown to the government, on the Amencan market. This has greatly embarrassed the Government and brought great discredit to our business ethics that our meat exto porters should have indulged in that sort of practice. But, it was condoned by the Government. The Government did nothing about it. It let it go on. It let the processors exploit the producers. That is the continuing sorry story of the beef industry. The latest effort, of course, is an admission of defeat. I refer to the Government's bankrupt policy of spaying young heifers. Thisfliesin the face of all predictions about the beef industry. We all know that the beef industry is subject to fairly long swings and cycles of supply and demand. We have been advised by many people that the cycle is in the process of swinging back and that in two or three years time it looks as though there will be a shortage of beef. Yet we are spaying our young heifers, the young breeding stock of tomorrow. We are paying people to render them in such a way that they cannot be bred from. They will be able only to be fattened and sent to the markets. This is a bankrupt policy, a short sighted policy. The whole beef industry must run on a long, planning cycle of something Uke five years. Yet we are paying people to spay cattle so that the catde cannot be bred from. I suggest that producers should not accept this proposition. I do not think many will. I think they have a bit more sense, foresight and experience in the game to know that this is a desperate effort and one that is bound to fail. Other problems have been loaded on to primary producers. The prospect of increased fuel costs is one which must be faced by the whole of the countiy, of course, but there is an inbuUt inelasticity of demand for fuel on the farm. There is not much that the man on the land can do to save fuel. It is part and parcel of his daily operations in running the farm and in communicating in his area. Whilst people in metropolitan areas may have the opportunity to save fuel, people on the land have not. I certainly think some consideration must be given to this matter. One of the most notable faUures or examples of indecision or of different points of view in respect of rural problems is in the Government's handling of the anticipated national rural bank. The whole thing is in disarray. The statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) this morning did not clarify the position at all. The Prime Minister in his electorate talk in September, and subsequently Senator Cotton in answer to a question on 13 October, made it clear that the bank would be an independent statutory authority which would have to operate on its own account and which could not be an institution managed within the trading banks. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) and the trading banks, of course, have other ideas. He has said that the bank should be a refinancing institution, administered by the banks and not by a separate institution. Where does the Government stand on this matter? Perhaps I am being unfair to the Minister for Primary Industry. I think if he had a fair go he would make a better fist of the job. How can he succeed when he is being contradicted and overridden by the Leader of the National Country Party and the Prime Minister? They should make up their minds and work out beforehand what they intend to do, before they start confusing everybody with these conflicting statements. No statement has been made as to where the funds will come from. No statement has been made as to whether the bank will supply low interest loans. No statement has been made as to whether it will work through the Commonwealth Development Bank or on the relationship the Development Bank will have with the statutory authority or the refinancing institution. It appears that the decision on whether to lend to a producer will rest with the manager of a private bank, as it always has. I have always maintained that where government money is made available for special purposes we should have specially trained government valuers, as the Rural Bank of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Development Bank have. They go out, look at each case on its merits and do forward projections for several years. They exercise expert knowledge of farm management and the latest technology. By doing that, those banks are able to lend to a much wider margin than the manager who applies some rule of thumb method. He sits in his office and decides on a certain value, and then he decides that he can lend up to 60 per cent of that value. If it is done in a more sophisticated or more expert way, I think it is quite valid to lend to a much closer margin-up to 70 per cent or 75 per cent of the value. This can be done only on the basis of expert advice. That expert advice is in the hands of the specialist valuing staff of those banks. It is not in the hands of the commercial banks. From my reading of the legislation, the intention is that the manager of a private bank will have the ultimate say. I do not think that will be very helpful to primary producers. The Government has tremendous electoral problems. With an election possibly coming very soon, it can look to many only with a great deal of trepidation following the confusion and mishandling of the rural sector. It has the problem of the Chipp party which will make inroads into the Senate prospects of the National Country Party. There is no doubt that there is a great threat to Country Party held seats in New South Wales such as Eden-Monaro, Calare and Paterson. Several Liberal held seats in New South Wales and Victoria are under threat. They include Bendigo, Ballaarat and MCMillan in Victoria. Also under threat are the seats of KalgoorUe in Western Australia, Herbert, Capricornia, Leichhardt and Dawson in Queensland. All of these are under threat because of the mishandling of the rural sector by the Government These members will pay the price.",49
111,Mr LLOYD,BILLS,What would you do?,50
112,Mr FRY,BILLS,I tried to table our poUcy today. Leave was refused. It is aU in the policy. It is a very progressive policy. The policy sets out to do something for rural mdustnes on a long term basis.,50

115,Mr LLOYD,BILLS,Te U us what you would do.,50
116,Mr FRY,BILLS,"Look at our poUcy, and you will see what we would do. We have adopted a positive approach. We have attempted long term solutions to these problems, not the band-aid measures which have been appUed by this Government. Another serious problem to rural industries has been devaluation and the prospect of further devaluation. Whilst this may be seen as being of some temporary advantage to the exporters, it is a very short term advantage. It is soon offset by retaliation by countries which put up barriers to our exports to those countries where we hope to sell more. Of course the devaluation has contributed to the massive rise in domestic costs referred to by the honourable member for Macarthur. He did not say why these massive rises were brought about.",50

118,Mr BAUME,BILLS," Mr Deputy Chairman, I wish to make a personal explanation.",50
119,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,BILLS,Does the up honourable member claim to have been of its rural seats misrepresented?,50
120,Mr BAUME,BILLS,Yes. The honourable member further for Fraser (Mr Fry) alleged that I had parTreasurer ticipated in the exploitation of producers. That increased grossly offensive and totally untrue.

In those circumstances it is disgraceful for make such a comment about me.,51
121,Mr CARIGE,BILLS,"The previous speaker for the Opposition, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry), spoke at some length about forcing people into adopting a spaying program. I wish, when he was speaking on the appropriation, he had realised that that not part of the appropriations. When he spoke length about the spaying program and how the Government ought not to be forcing producers to sector. adopt that program, he should read what the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) said about the program. Producers have therightto opt into some four different schemes. Nowhere along the line are producers forced to adopt a spaying program as an initiative to receive grant from the Commonwealth Government. I say that for the benefit of the honourable memmany ber for Fraser. The estimates for the Department of Primary Industry amount to some $85,458,000 for 1977-78. This is an increase of some $30,651,793 over the amount allocated for 1976-77. location was $54,806,207. It was emphasised both the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) and the Minister for Primary Industry when the Budget was ing delivered that the amount of money allocated this Department is in fact an ongoing expendisition ture and is not Umited only to the funds allocatedtoday and spoken about at budget time. I have tonne. researched many Budget Speeches and I have not found any one major initiative for the rural sector announced in a Budget Speech, with the exception of taxes. Tax amendments are norcredit mally brought forward at that time. WhUst researching Budget Speeches, I was particularly interested to find out what the prealterations vious Government had announced at that time and, more especiaUy, some of the benefits that had removed. If we compare this Budget allocessions cation with that of the Budget of the then Treasurer, the honourable member for MelGovernment bourne Ports (Mr Crean) for 1974-75 when he aUocated $49,418,000 to the Department of Prithing. mary Industry, wefindthat that was a massive decrease of some $6,357,000 compared with the Budget of the previous year. In real terms, it was a loss of some $6m. I feel we must take this a and look at the Budget Speech of the then (Mr Crean) when he boasted that they is expenditure for 1974-75 to a record level of $16,274,000. As he said at the time, this I am represented an increase of 32.4 per cent in a expenditure when compared with the previous him to Mr CLYDE CAMERON - What did the cockies get?",51
122,Mr CARIGE,BILLS,"The cockies, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh likes to call them, received a reduction of almost $7m. At the time that the Labor Party was sicking about its massive increases in expenditure, it reduced the is amount for this Department by almost $7m. at That clearly demonstrates the value that the former Labor Government placed on the rural WhUst this was a direct loss to the industry of actual cash benefits, measures with more far-reaching effects were introduced by the Labor Government, and they aU represented reductions. For example, there was the abolition of the a superphosphate bounty which directly caused hardship to many of our southern producers and of those along our coastal belt. The Australian Labor Party Government sawfitto work towards the abotiuon of the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty. Today the honourable member for Fraser stood up and condemned what the Labor That alGovernment had done in the past. He by compUmented the present Government on thinking correctly, on thinking of the future, in decidto maintain the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty to at its present level. Had members of the Opporemained in power the fertiUser bounty would have been $40 a tonne, not $60 a This Government has maintained it at $60 a tonne. The Labor Government aboUshed the fuel prices equaUsation scheme that appUed to our remote areas, and appeared to take great for that. It imposed a meat inspection charge that cost our producers $25m. If we look at the 1975 Budget we see that the to the tax averaging scheme cost our primary producers millions of dollars. Further, it the Labor Government aboUshed taxation confor water, soU and fodder conservation. There was almost nothing that the Labor could abolish in its Budget that it did not aboUsh. It aboUshed just about everyIt raised its receipts from personal income tax by a massive 89 per cent during its first two years in office. It imposed an increase of around $700m in indirect taxes and levies. That excludes stepthe coal export levy; that levy was reserved for another industry. The Labor Government thought that it had affected the rural sector sufficiendy; so it decided to move on to another major exporter. These imports were felt by all Australians, but they directly hurt the rural this people because they could not pass on any these added costs. They could not pass them anywhere along the line. On numerous occasions the ALP Government refused to index personal income tax, despite fact that the inquiry it appointed, the Mathews Committee, recommended it. It flatly refused extend the unemployment benefit to primary producers and said that they were not worthy it. The Leader of the ALP, the honourable memproducers, ber for Werriwa (Mr E. G. Whitlam), said that primary producers were nothing better than porate dole bludgers. The honourable member for Fraser made a remark today about rural reconstruction and the honourable member for they were. Corio (Mr Scholes) did likewise, but when the Labor Party was in power it cut expenditure on rural reconstruction by some $20m. The Labor Government reduced grants for rural and there arterial roads and rural local roads by a massive $119m. Members of the Opposition ought to be proud of themselves! The Labor Government reduced by two-thirds, to only 8 kilometres, the distance for free installation of telephone services in country areas. The present Government, quite rightly, has realised that these people and this distance has been extended to 12 kilometres. All these things have to be seen of honourable members opposite desperately trying to criticise the Budget and to say that it had no benefit whatsoever for submit that by reducing inflation this Government certainly is assisting all Austrahans but specifically rural Austrahans. Rural Australians have at their disposal absolutely no means with which to combat this terrible financial disease called inflation. Members of the Opposition can take Uttle comfort from their attempts to come to grips with this disease because they generated what was a small isolated virus into a major epi-Abel, J.A. demic. This inflationary disease has cost our proAdermann. A. E. ducers more than $ 1,000m or approximately Baume, M. E.Aldred, K.J. $100 a week.

In the Budget Speech particular emphasis was placed on the nauonal rural the bank and beef classification, along with the revolutionary tax averaging scheme that will to benefit all primary producers. Unlike the previous scheme enunciated by the ALP, our of scheme will work to the advantage of aU primary regardless of their income. We are not trying to hide behind some jargon from the corTreasury. The Opposition tried to camouflage the fact that primary producers would be disadvantaged to the tune of some $50m, but in fact In my closing minutes I would Uke to speak about an industry with which I am very faimliar, namely, the beef industry. It could be said that was very Uttle devoted to the beef industry in the Budget Papers, but what was spelt out with great clarity was the fact that this Government is determined to expedite beef classification.",52

134,Mr STREET,PAIRS," I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes important, far-reaching amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The measures it contains give effect to the Government Parties' industrial relations policy which was overwhelmingly endorsed at the last election. This pohcy reflects a fundamental review of the rights and responsibilities of parties engaged in industrial relations and the demands of the contemporary community. An Martyr, J.R. Millar, P. C important feature of this legislation is the manner in which the Government has sought to expose the subject matter of the Bill to intensive pubhc scrutiny. Much of the substance of this Bill was introduced to the House in March of this Porter, J.R. Robinson, Eric year. Robinson, Ian Ruddock, P.M. In my second reading speech on that Bill I said that, because of the fundamental importance of Shipton, R.F. Simon. B.D. the legislation, the Government intended members of this Parliament, the principal parties to industrial relations, and the community at large, Street, A. A. Thomson, D.S. to be giventimeto consider objectively the contents of the Bill and to make their views known to Wilson, I. B.C. Yates, W. the Government. Accordingly the Bill was to lie on the table of the House until at least mid-May. Tellers: Cameron, Donald Subsequendy I entered into consultations, on beCorbett, J. half of the Government, with the peak union and employer councils. As a result of these meetings, I announced, on 17 May: The Government welcomes the acceptance by the ACTU of an Industrial Relations Bureau and the reconstitution of the National Labour Advisory Council. The Government has decided to pass legislation this session to establish the Industrial Relations Bureau which will have to function of securing the observance of the Act and awards in the terms already in the Act. Pending the detailed consideration of the Act referred to later in this statement, the Industrial Relations Bureau will have the same powers as the Arbitration Inspectorate, no more, no less, and those powers will be exercised according to the same processes as they have been until now. The Government will also legislate this session to reconstitute the National Labour Advisory Council to provide a national tripartite forum for the consideration of issues of national concern in the industrial relations and manpower areas. Both these bodies are key elements in the Government's industrial relations policy. The Government is also committed to legislating for the protection of individual rights in the industrial area. However, it is prepared to review the provisions of these aspects and on other matters relating to the operation of the Act contained in the present Bill in the light of their further consideration by the reconstituted National Labour Advisory Council. To enable this the Government will stand over until the Budget session further legislation in relation to these Second Reading matters. On 27 May, and in accordance with this statement, I introduced legislation into this House for the establishment of the Industrial Relations Bureau and the National Labour Consultative Council. As honourable members will be aware, the Act establishing the Industrial Relations Bureau was given royal assent on 12 June. The provisions of that Act providing for the appointment of a Director of the Bureau and enabhng him to undertake the organisation of the Bureau were the proclaimed to operate from 3 October. On that date, the first Director of the Bureau, Mr D. L. Linehan, took up his appointment. The proIndustrial visions enabling the Bureau to commence its function of securing the observance of the Act, regulations and awards will be proclaimed as trial soon as the Director has completed the necessary organisational arrangements. Similarly, honourthose able members will be aware that I took immedilaw ate steps to convene the National Labour Consultative Council following its creation by legislation. The Council has now met occasions and, in accordance with my statement of 17 May referred to earUer, considered the legislative proposals contained in the Bill of March. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to both the national employers and the peak trade union councUs for the frank views put to me during those consultations. The weight the Government has given those views is borne out by an examination of the amendments proposed by the current Bill. Though simUar in substance, it is not the same Bill I introduced in March. number of modifications have been made and some matters are not pursued. Furthermore, the process of consultation has permitted the airing of other issues and their presentation in legislateconomic ive form. For example, the current Bill will make provision concerning accounting practices and financial reporting m organisations registered under the Act. These provisions are based on the community. recommendations of the Royal Commission under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Sweeney pursuit into Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions conable to of ducted during the office of the previous governcation onimpose ment. I believe this Bill is evidence of the earnest and careful consideration which the Government has given to the views put to it. However, at the strikes end of the day it is for the Government to act, and having regard not only to the views put to it, but witnessing, also to the demands of the pubUc interest, the interests of the community as a whole. One of the fundamental tenets of the Governobligations ment's industrial relations pohcy member of the community has both rights and obUgations. Those rights must be protected the obUgations must be met. The ConcUiation and Arbitration Act is perhaps the paramount tions Australian industrial statute. It is the principal means of giving legal expression to industrial rights and obligations. While it is not, and cannot be, a complete statement of those rights and obligations it certainly is the vehicle which establishes the framework ofthose rights and obUgations by defining the roles and responsibUities of the parties to industrial relations and providing for an expression of the public interest. relations is a dynamic process, everchanging in response to die interplay of economic and social forces. Consequently, no indusstatute of the significance of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act can hope to express or define industrial relationships for aU time. The must be responsive to new demands and changing circumstances. Government has a duty to reshape the law to ensure its relevance to conon three temporary industrial relations. This Bill represents an important step in that last continuing process of reshaping and redefining therightsand obUgations under industrial law. It is a response to emergent trends in the social role of trade unions, or in the roles which they seek to assume, which has led to changes in the behaviour of trade unions as institutions. It is obvious that unions have moved a long way from being small craft organisations with Umited aspirations concerned mainly with ensuring fair wages and working conditions for their members. By conA trast, the union movement today is a powerful economic and social pressure group. Unions have grown gready in size and are in a position to influence powerfully, by concerted action, the weUbeing of the community. No responsible Government can ignore this, or refuse to take steps to prevent such power being exercised contrary to the best interests of the A very real danger arises where a union, in some Umited or self-interested goal, is economic hardship and dislothe entire community. Over the past year we have experienced the crippling effect of by fuel tanker drivers, aircraft refuellers air traffic controllers. We have seen, and are the frightening capacity of a relatively small group of unionists in the Victorian power industry to wreak havoc on an entire community. Such situations demand that action be taken. It is paramount that unions recognise their and the legitimate interests of the is that each Australian community. and Motion (by Mr Innes) put: That the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relabe not further heard.

At thetimeI moved the motion the Minister was blatantly attacking the Opposition for defending a position.",56
138,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I will Usten carefuUy to the rest of the Minister's speech.,56
139,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"In the face of irresponsible and protracted disputes in essential industries it is and blatantly deceptive, for anyone to attempt to suggest that the trend towards a in man-days lost in industrial disputes against the type of measures which the now seeks to implement. The real are the soaring economic and social costs the entire community, and the capacity of certain unions and groups of unionists to inflict this harm. A second trend is that, in pursuing economic and social objectives-in seeking to give effect to their broader aspirations-trad e unions have sought to extend their strength and influence by intensive recruitment activity and have endeavoured to impose greater restrictions on the freedom of individual employees and, indeed, non-employees. This is evidenced in part by the conduct of some unions designed to compel certain self-employed persons, such as owner-drivers, or employers in a small way of business who 'work on the tools' to join the union concerned. These unions have sought to impose bans or boycotts which directly or indirectly harm that person's legitimate commercial interests in an endeavour to compel his membership of the union. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this trend is the change in the relationship between the member and his union. A certain common purpose must be shared by the members of a union, but as the objectives of unions broaden this becomes less and less likely. Clearly, in any large group of individuals such as a trade union, whilst there might be agreement about traditional union goals, the scope for disagreement about other issues-political , social, cultural, environmental-ma y be as great as the diversity amongst individuals in an organisation. Regrettably, some organisations have lost sight of the needs of their members in their pursuit of organisational goals. Legitimate disagreement with some aspect of the broadened aims of the organisation, or with specific action in pursuit such aims, may be labelled as disloyalty which must be subject to discipline. This becomes all the more oppressive for individual members where the union leadership is ideologically oriented, bent upon serving some narrow political interest rather than the interests of the members. The Medibank strike of last year, a pohtical not an industrial issue, will Uve long in the ories of many whose unions tried to discipline them for non-participation or who, under duress, took industrial acuon against their personal convictions. Mr Speaker, I turn now to the Bill itself. Firstly, there are a series of amendments deIn signed to strengthen the protection of individual employees and persons against unfair practices by employers and organisations. Secondly, there the Bill. are measures designed to further promote the democratic control of industrial organisations. Thirdly, the Bill proposes to enhance the means by which therightsof members of organisations and the interests of the community can be better protected through the functiomng of the Comployee mission, the Industrial Relations Bureau and the Federal Court. Individual Rights I have already made general reference to the manner in which unions can erode the industrial rights of individuals. The Government recognises that strong and effective organisations of employees and employers are fundamental to the effective conduct of industrial relations; indeed the formation of such organisations is one of the principal objects of the Act. However, organisations are meant to protect and enlarge therightsof individuals, and not to undermine their liberties. A number of cases in which infringements of therightsof individuals by trade unions have occurred have received attention in recent months. Two most notable cases are those of Mr Latham and the late Mr KrutuUs. But such cases represent only the tip of the iceberg. There are many people whose problems do not hit the headlines and who suffer in sUence in the face of injustices which they feel powerless to challenge as individuals. The Government proposes action in relation to two groups of persons. Firstly, protection will be given to those who conscientiously object to joining an organisation. As proposed in the March Bill the nght to a certificate of conscientious objection will no longer be dependent upon the existence of a preference clause in the relevant award. However, in response to views put to me of during consultations with the national employers and the peak union councUs, the Government has decided to require the payment of a fee by an applicant for a certificate. A series of associated measures is proposed to protect the holders of certificates from various intimidatory tactics by fellow employees, employers or organisations. I have also referred to certain abuses by organismem- ations in relation to the recruitment of selfemployed persons. To this end, the Bill proposes limitations on the right of organisations to recruit self-employed persons. Non-employees will be able to join a State branch of an organisation of employees only where, and to the extent that, State industrial arbitration legislation authorises non-employees to be members of State unions. addition, to combat unfair recruitment tactics designed to coerce a non-employee to join an organisation, a series of offences is proposed by Therightof a union member to refuse to participate in industrial action is to be reinforced. The Bill proposes that it shall be an offence for an employer to dismiss or disadvantage an embecause he has refused or faUed to join in industrial action, or to threaten dismissal or disadvantage to coerce him to join in industrial action. It will also be an offence for an organisation to impose a penalty, forfeiture or disability Braithwaite, on a member to coerce him to join in industrial Brown, action or because he has refused or failed to join Cadman, A. C. in industrial acdon. Of course it is up to an Calder, Kevin individual to exercise his free choice on whether Carige. C.L. or not he engages in industrial acuon.

141,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"I was talking about provisions relating to secret postal ballots for union elections. To reinforce these provisions, it will be 74 open to the Federal Coun, in proceedings under section 141 of 171C of the Act, to declare void an 28 election not conducted in accordance with the 46 secret postal ballots regulations, and direct that a fresh election be conducted. It will be an offence for a person to hold office knowing that he was not elected to that office by secret postal ballot where required by the Act. A penalty may also Lloyd, B. Lucock, P.E. be imposed upon the organisation concerned. Lusher, S.A. MACKellar, M. J. R. I have already briefly referred to amendments to give effect to the Report of the Royal Commission into Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions insofar as it related to accounting pracfor tices and financial reporting in organisations. his report, the Royal Commissioner reflected upon the adequacy of the existing measures tained in the Act and regulations, and the low level of compUance with them by organisations. The Bill proposes amendments to the Act which, with only sUght modification, implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission.restraining These amendments provide for the records to be kept by organisations, for audit and the duties auditors, for the submission of reports and concerns audited accounts to members, for the filing financial returns with the Industrial Registrar, and for the investigation of irregularities by the Industrial Relations Bureau and the initiation actions in the Federal Court. These provisions will require supporting regulations. I agreed, when I met with the National Labour ConsultaBureau tive Council on 12 October last, to the establishplaints ment of a sub-committee of the Council to work with officers of my Department on the prepunjust, aration of the necessary regulations. Protection of the Public Interest The final broad area with which this Bill is concerned is the series of measures which go to facUitate the expression of the pubUc interest the industrial relations process. In part, the hicle which the Government has chosen for this role is the Industrial Relations Bureau. During my meeting with the unions on 11 May, the ACTU handed me a document setting out its position in relation to the agreement sequendy reached. That document noted that consultation in a National Labour Consultative Council may well produce positive, creative functions for a Bureau concerned with improving industrial relations. The Government is proposBureau ing amendments which give the Bureau precisely that role. The Industrial Relations Bureau will have, in irregularities the pubUc interest, two broad functions. One of bUity these involves securing the observance of the the Act, the regulations and awards. The Arbitration ation Inspectorate has always had this function; the powers of the Bureau in relation to these matters will, however, be spelled out quite specifically. the Bureau cannot bring about voluntary poses compUance with the law, it will have the necessthe ary power to initiate appropriate proceedings the'Commission and in the Industrial Division of the Federal Court. These powers will include the power to notify the Commission of a breach likely breach of a bans clause in an award and make appUcation for a certificate under section 33 of the Act to enable proceedings to be taken breach of the award in the Court. In response In to the views put to me by the national employers and the peak trade union councUs, the relevant conprovision has been redrawn to make clear that the Bureau cannot take part in the dispute settling process under this section. The Bureau will also have the right to apply for cancellation of an award, for an injunction contraventions of the Act and regulations, and for deregistration in appropriate cases. of The Bureau's second major area of responsibUity the role it will play in providing assistof ance to the members of organisations. Apart from its normal award inspection and advisory functions, it will assist persons to ensure that the of rules of their organisation conform with the requirements of the Act and that they are observed by those under a duty to observe them. The will be empowered to investigate comby members that the rules of their organisations are oppressive, unreasonable or or otherwise contravene the Act; and will also be empowered to investigate complaints by members that the rules of their organisations are not being observed. If the Bureau faUs to persuade the organisations either to take steps to amend its rules, or to observe its rules, as the case in may be, the Bureau will be able to take the matveter to the Court. The amendments now proposed in this regard retain therightof a person to go directly to the Court, rather than to have the Bureau act on his behalf, and this change again reflects views put to me by the national emsubployers and the peak union councUs. There are other related matters. As the Bureau wiU be properly staffed and equipped to undertake investigations, including the type just referred to, it has been decided to empower the to undertake investigations on behalf of the Industrial Registrar in connection with appUcations for inquiries by the Court into aUeged in elections. SimUarly, responsifor the detaUed investigations relating to administration of the finances of an organisgiven under the proposed requirements will be to the Bureau. I now come to further very significant proIf visions of this legislation. The Government proto amend section 143 of the Act to extend grounds on which deregistration proceedings in can be based. The new grounds will include power for the Court to deregister an organisation which prevents, hinders or interferes with interor state and overseas trade and commerce, or the to provision of a pubUc service of the Commonwealth or of a State. Honourable members are only too well aware that disputes affecting trade and commerce or essential services have imposed profound economic dislocation on the community. The Government also proposes to extend the amendment. range of consequences available to the Court in deregistration proceedings. The 'all or none' principle which presently applies limits the flexibUity of the Court in dealing with breaches which may not warrant total deregistration. Thus, the Bill proposes to empower the Court to: (i) partially deregister an organisation if it finds that the industrial action the proceedings has resulted wholly or mainly from a particular section or class of members of the organisation; (U) suspend all or any of the capacities, rights part and privileges of an organisation or any ruralrural of its members. ' Honourable members will be aware that, in the March Bill, this power of suspension was to be available in proceedings for offences under number of sections of the Act. The intention is that this power will be restricted to deregistrahit tion proceedings. This decision by Government is a further indication of the seriousness with which the views of national employers and the peak union councUs have been considered. Finally, the Bill will insen a new provision relation to demarcation disputes. For too long the powers of the Commission in this area have been inadequate to deal with demarcation disyears to come. putes-dispute s which may well bring an entire industry to a standstill. It is proposed that Commission may order that an organisation canPress not represent a specified class or group of emin ployees and direct the organisation to amend rules to exclude these employees from its membership. In conclusion, I reiterate that the measures this Bill result from a comprehensive review of the operation of the Act, a review which has volved tripartite consultation at the highest levels. It represents a necessary reshaping of Conciliation and Arbitration Act to meet alises changed industrial circumstances and to reassert the rule of the law in expressing or defining industrialrightsand obUgations. Events of recent months and, most particularly, the events of the last few days have emphasised this is essential the interests of our community. Here on behalf all members of the House I pay tribute to the courage and integrity of Mr Justice Ludeke, Mr Deputy President Isaac and Mr Commissioner Vosti of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Comlarly mission in the recent Full Bench decision. I coma mend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned.

Department of Primary Industry leading to Proposed expenditure, $85,458,000.",58
142,Mr WALLIS,PAIRS," I would Uke to comment on the estimates for the Department of Primary Industry. I represent an electorate that is and part industrial. The effect on the industry in my area has been very bad over the last few years. At present my electorate is affected by a drought and it seems there will be no wheat crop this year. For some areas it is the a third bad year. This means that quite a number now of farmers in those areas will certainly be hard and in need of assistance, and this makes the talk of a rural bank a litde more relevant. For two years, since the last election, the Government has been peddUng the idea of a rural bank. I think it has been a bit of a carrot dangled in in front of the noses of farmers in the hope that a bank will be estabUshed that will give them what they require in order to remain viable in the Of course, there has been plenty of noises, and the a few disquieting things have appeared in the and have been said in answer to questions this House concerning the national rural bank. its One wonders just what form the bank will take, because mention is made of the trading banks being participants. If those banks are to be parin ticipants, will the farmers get loans at a cheaper interest rate? By bringing in the trading banks, is in the Government fooling farmers into thinking that they will get a loan at a cheaper interest rate the that will not be avaUable? I think everybody rethat the main need in these areas is for debt reconstruction, with long term loans at reasonable rates of interest. If farmers do not receive these loans they will be extremely disappointed. If they do not receive these loans I feel that the in Government has led them up the garden path. of There are needs in many areas of my electorate. There is the need for debt reconstruction, and long term financing is the only way in which these people will be able to keep going, panicuin the present circumstances m which quite lot of areas now are facing their third successive year of drought. The industries mainly affected are the grain and sheep industries, they are not the only rural industries in Austraha that are in trouble. The dairy industry, the beef industry, the dried fruit industry and the apple and pear industry are in trouble. The establishtold ment of a nauonal rural bank would assist the farmers. There is a quite wide area in which assistance should be made available. There seems to be a predilection among that, people on the other side, particularly members the National Country Party, to place all the blame for the ills in Australia's rural industry the Australian Labor Party; to say that it all hapthe hoof. pened while the Labor Party was in government. Of course, these people quite deUberately very short memories. Their memories do not back past the period when the Labor Party was in office. They forget the years in which traUan wheat farmers were really in strife-i 1969,1970 and that era. MrCarige-Oh!",60
143,Mr WALLIS,PAIRS,"It is all right for the honourand able member for Capricornia to say 'Oh'. I can remember wheat being stacked in anything that would hold wheat. The position was the same allcattle. over the country. There were no sUos. We were crying out for markets. Yet, by our poltiical detimes. cisions we were denying wheat growers the market in China- a market that had been avaUable previously. Because of our poltiical deThey cisions and our poltiical attitudes, Australian wheat growers could not sell their wheat. When China did come back mto the market our wheat industry improved. During that time wheat growers had wheat on the farm, anywhere it could be stored. They were without adequate markets. What was the result? The introduction of quotas was the result. It was said that the States introduced the quotas. The fact is that the wheat StabUisation scheme which gave farmers guaranteed price for wheat was financed by Reserve Bank of Australia. AU the States to it. They had to agree to it because the finance which would allow this scheme to operate was provided by the Reserve Bank. The Federal Government could have prevented that money from being made avaUable. The States had no away option but to accept what was put to them. Perhaps I could go back and refresh the memthe ories of honourable members opposite about the beef industry. Last year or the year before I checked on the figures on the number of beef cattle in my electorate. I found that from 1970 1973 or 1974 the number of beef catde in that area increased by three and a halftimes.During the period when the wheat industry was going but bad the previous Liberal-Country Party Government encouraged people to go into beef. This was prior to the Labor Party coming into office. People in beef organisations now say: 'We were to do it'. The result was a massive increase in the size of our beef herds. That Government bethisUeved that the market would be allrightIt showed a lack of foresight. Things did not turn out that way. Our beef industry is in the position although it is selling a fair amount of beef, of the size of our herds has expanded to such an extent that they must be expanded a hell of a lot on more before we can getridof what we have on have Whom do we blame for this? The Labor go Government is not to blame because it imposed an export levy or because it took away the superAusphosphate bounty. The previous Liberaln Country Party Government in the early 1970s is to blame. It encouraged the beef growers to increase the size of their herds. Because everybody else-the wheat grower, the wool grower so on-wa s going bad, to hedge their bets they also went into beef. The result was that even small farms were carrying a certain number of As a result, in my electorate the amount of beef on the hoof increased by three and a half That was as a result of the advice given to access to the farmers by that Government. At present various rural industries are in strife. are not getting a great deal of satisfaction from this Government. The present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) has been criticised aU over the country. Motions of no confidence in him have been passed by various organisations-bee f producer organisations, dried fruit grower organisations and apple and >ear grower organisations. Many of them have 1 ost confidence in the present Minister and do not have any confidence in his ability as Minister to apull these industries out of their present slump. the Motions of no confidence in him have been agreed passed all over the country. Mention was made by a few honourable members opposite of Labor's aboUtion of the petrol prices equalisation scheme. Certainly Labor did with it I did not agree with that at the time, but we did it. The effect of that on rural producers was absolutely nothing compared with effect of the increase that the Government imposed on them a few weeks ago by its decision to increase the price of oU to world parity. The increase in the price of petrol which this Governtoment brought mto operation is a body blow to those people, particularly the people who now are trying to face the drought conditions that exist in the southern part of Australia. In the wheat areas of my electorate the maximum increase in the price of petrol was 2c a gallon, but the price of petrol has gone up by more than 2c a gallon during the last few weeks as a result of the acuon of the present Government. I tliink members opposite are being shabby and insincere when they blame the Labor Government. The present increase is a savage increase, at a dme when the Government is talking about fighting inflauon. This is one impost that the Government is putting on the people it claims to representrural producers. The impost-the savage increase in the price of petrol-o n rural producers makes it a darned sight harder for them to keep their heads above water. It appears to me that members of the Liberal Party and the Nauonal Country Party go around the country spouting divisive pohcies. They a vested interest in keeping the city dweller the country dweller apart. In the Green Paper put out by the Labor Government in 1973 much was said about communication. It is a fact that sometimes there is a lack of communication tween the rural dweller and the city dweller. One of the things which seem to be a strong point with the people on the other side is their vested interest in dividing the Australian population. They feel that they are electorally stronger if can keep the country dweller and the city dweller apart",61
144,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.  speak on a matter which has long been of cona cern to me and which I have raised in this chamber on many occasions. I refer to the export imposed. of Uvestock from this country. The trade in Uvestock has increased enormously in recent times, due largely to the increasing demand from the newly rich Middle East. The export trade to Middle East countries is essentially livestock cause they do not have the facilities for storing and handling carcass meat; nor is there the dethe mand for carcass meat. However, the facUities are being provided by the governments conto cerned and in the long term, for economic reasons, it will be carcass meat that is suppUed those markets. This is important and the Ausour traUan Meat Industry Employees Union ought remember that the more livestock we export to the Middle East, and the larger the number of consumers we encourage to eat meat, will be the opportunity to export carcass meat the future. Turning to the Japanese market, many beef producers in Austraha will have heard the argument that two year old cattle seU for enormous amounts in Japan and that we ought to be exporting Uve to Japan to get a share of that market. However, the situation is not that simple. At the moment the AMIEU has a ban on the export of live catde to Japan because it sees it as a carcass market. The Japanese have indicated an interest in importing cattle for feed lots. However the unions have said that unless all abattoirs are working to capacity they will actively endeavour to prohibit such a trade. Honourable members will be aware that Australia has a very restricted quota of carcass meat to Japan, and if we are able to export Uve catde to Japanese feed lots this may be a way in which we can influence the Japanese consumer to eat more meat and therehave fore raise the demand for carcass meat. As an and added consequence there would be an increase in the demand for AMIEU workers. However, the union, which consistently seems to adopt a short term inward looking policy, persists in hinbedering the future of its members 'jobs. But there is not only a union problem; there are other problems. The Japanese are refusing to import Australian cattle for feed lots because of contagious bovine rhino-tracheitis. However, I they believe the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation is overcoming this health problem. Japan has taken a small number of breeding stock from Australia and at the presenttimeI it is importing store stock from the United States of America for fattening. These catde are actually flown to Japan. I am told that the quota the Japanese set on the importation of catde is about 5,000 per year. That quota has tariff imposed on it and any over-quota imports have a higher and almost prohibitive tariff In the Japanese domestic market Japanese breeders sell calves to feed lot farmers when the calves are about nine months old. The feed lot befarmers fatten them for about 15 months and then sell them. If Australia is allowed to supply feed lot farmer with vealers to fatten themselves, the Japanese feed lot farmer will be able buy more catde for less and so increase his income. Thus some of the poltiical pressure by to the feed lot farmers to reduce meat imports and quota to Japan will be taken off the Japanese to Government. Of course, the breeders may fear that an influx of live vealers will reduce the price paid to them. However, I shall explain why they the greater need not be disadvantaged. in It is important to remember that the Japanese wholesale price of beef after slaughter is about three times the price paid in the Australian estic market. Therefore, obviously, there great potential for the Australian producer to export to Japan, either carcases or Uve. A further complicating factor is the Japanese ever StabUisation schemes. As I understand ation, basically there are two stabilisation tock Corporationthe schemes. One is on the price of meat and the continue to work for the the other is on catde sold to feed lots. The StabUisbeef producer and the Japanese ation scheme on meat prices works through the overcoming the administrative problems government agency releasing or withholding meat from the market in order to maintain the price of meat within a range of prices previously decided. SimUarly, with calves sold to feed lot farmers, the price to the breeder is guaranteed and if the sale price is less than the guaranteed price a deficiency payment is made by the authincome ority. There is some suggestion that the funds which are provided by the regional and central governments in Japan for such deficiency payFarm ments are raised through the tariffs on imported Uvestock and carcass meats. However, it seems clear to me that if Australia exported catde to be fattened in feed lots by Japanese farmers, although the influx of large numbers of such cattle could depress the price of Japanese calves for the breeders, the price to the breeders could be maintained by deficiency payments which in fact could be funded by the tariff on such imported beef cattle. Thus the poltiical problem which could have arisen from the breeders is overcome. The increase in throughput in the Japanese market would mean that the Japanese consumer would be able to obtain cheaper beef, the Ausway traUan beef producer would be in position in having a market for his beef and the Japanese breeder would still receive a reasonof For able price for his cattle. Of course, the ordinary that 10 per Japanese consumer would be much that a lot more meat would be provided at a risk because of theatcrude reduced cost. This could be implemented feed lot farmers buying Australian Uvestock, at with the concern expressed Iby less than they are currently paying, from spokesmen about job security, given Japanese breeders. The Japanese cattle breeders the economy. But that is a totally different can have the price made up with a deficiency payment and they can still supply at a cheaper osition price. The feed lot fanner can make a profit tinct probably larger than at present to the abattoirs cheaper than at present The distake place, sosuppon tribution system in Japan in retailing the meat world economy and, more can still make the enormous mark-ups and supply the Japanese consumer at less than today's costs. It is interesting to note that, torical reasons which I will not go into, the wholesale to retail margin in Japan is up to domper kilogram whereas in Australia the figure is is a somewhere around 60c per kUogram. I understand that the Japanese Government has agreed that such a system could work. Howit is concerned about the administrative problems in implementing it. Therefore I urge the situthe Government, Australian Meat and Livesand Japanese officials to benefit of the Australian consumer in of the implementation of such a scheme.",62
145,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"Real income per farm this year, running at $10,352, as projected by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, is more than $2,200 down in real terms on farm of last year. On average, real income for farms will have slumped, according to the BAE projections, by some 21.5 per cent this year. industry in this country has been stricken. It is probably one of the disaster areas of the national economy. It will be in a far worse condition by the end of this year. We see a situation in which the wheat industry-puttin g to one side problems caused by drought affliction-wU l be facing serious contraction in its prosperity levels as a result of excess suppUes on the world market and the price of sugar will be lower than that to which farmers have become accustomed in recent years. Moreover, we see a situation in which imponant overseas markets are put atriskby the clumsy, confrontationist, provocative behaviour of our Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) because of the son of personalised diplomacy which he seeks to adopt in a most unacceptable in the eyes of people in countries which are a much better near neighbours to us. South instance, the countries in the Association East Asian Nations have made it clear cent, in value, of our sugar exports better off in are now seriously risk.

At home we know that $4 the needs for water conservation in rural areas are totally neglected in this Budget. As an illustration of this point I refer to the situation Townsville, the largest provincial centre and fastest growing one in the State of Queensland. Its growth will be paralysed within a few unless some firm commitments are given by the Government as to at least what assessment it will make of the water conservation needs of that area and what commitments it can make in terms of allowing further conservation projects to undertaken so that Townsville, which I repeat the most important provincial centre in unlikely Queensland, can continue to grow. The roads of the nation, and especially in important rural areas, have been neglected greatly in the recent Budget. If the Government were to contribute as much to roads parative terms as we did in our last Budget it would be spending $77m more than it has actucanDebts ally allocated. Of course, as quick summary of neglect on the part of the Government, we find that petrol is to be increased in price by 1 lc a gallon for all users that commodity. That means farms which use industries petrol as an important input for production purthe poses will suffer an increase in production. I have already mentioned that it is projected this year that farm incomes in real terms will needs their drop dramatically. With these sorts of cost pressures induced by Government actions, as was the case with the increase in the industry, farm producers, farmers iUes will surfer a deterioration in their Uving beef industry, about restructuring standards. Let me focus on one particular industry, beef industry. Some welcome initiatives were taken a few weeks ago by the Government when the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) indicated a number of proposals the Governshould ment had decided to adopt to assist this industry. But when one analyses those proposals one finds they fall well short of what the industry expected and indeed what it can reasonably expect to ceive. What the Government has sought to do for with that statement is to buy time. Let us look at the situation. I draw the attenouth tion of honourable members to reports of the Bu-industry reau of Agricultural Economics. These reports show as an assessment of the industry that even cattle prices doubled-that is, if they were to to an excess of $1 a kilogram dressed weight, which is a most unlikely development-ther would still be some 19,000 specialist beef producers earning less than $5,000 a year, 7,000 whom would still be earning negative income. If we consider the position of the beef proin ducer with an average equity of about $100,000, the the very least he should expect to receive as a return on his investment in today's conditions years would be about $10,000. On top of that, he should be entitled to receive wages for his labour inputs to keep his industry going. So, at the very least, he should be expecting an average of about $20,000 a year. But wefindthat nearly 50 per be cent of beef producers, even if prices were to is double-and I stress that this would be a most event-woul d still be earning less than $5,000 a year and 7,000 would still be earning negative income. Every third specialist beef proour ducer in 1975 carried debts which exceeded 15 per cent of his capital invested. Let us see what the Bureau of Agricultural Economics had to say in real comabout that. It stated: of this magnitude, under current cost/price pressure place individual properties under significant financial a final gesture in thispressure. That is what is called a pubhc service euphemofism. The beef industry is one of our most stricken today. It is one of the most neglected at level of national government concern of all of their cost of the farm industries. We hear no discussion, no reference at all from whatspokesmen from the Government ranks as to comprehensive response is to the of the beef industry today. Not one mention was made in the Umited, albeit, to the extent price of petrol, farm itMinister went, welcome, statement in September by the for Primary Industry as the Governand their famment initiatives-limited , I repeat-to assist the the industry. The high rainfall zone has absolutely and relathe tively the largest core of producers unable to earn positive incomes at actual price levels substantially above current levels. An implication of that state of affairs is quite clear. The situation not be allowed to persist. While that situation persists people linger in all of the degradation and want of poverty. There is nothing worse than the existence and deprivation of rural repoverty in this country. I remember as Minister Social Security the distress with which I discovered that one of the highest levels of rural overty existed in the northernriversof New Wales, and had existed there in the dairy for many years, within the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and if indeed within your electorate, Mr Deputy Chairgo man. I have not heard either of you speak in an aggressive way in defence of the needs of the e people of that area. of Beef specialists have an investment well in excess of $5,600m. Processors in this country at best have an investment of about only $300m. Therefore the producers investment is at least times more significant than that of the processors. But it is the processors, who employ fewer people in primary industry than do the orderbeef specialists, who get the greatest returns. I quote from a paper presented by Mr R. Bruce Gates, Senior Lecturer in Management Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education. He states: For the seven processors who are listed on the Sydney Share Exchange . . . Return on shareholders funds ing the 1973 beef boom and crashed to 1.3 per cent in 1973-74. But the recovery has rising to 5.7 per cent in 1974-75 to 14.5 per cent in 1975-76. Some firms have out performed the market. T.A. the pack last year with a 22.3 per cent return followed by Protean at 21.0 per cent. I do not have thetimeto give further details. I must mention that last year at Rockhampton the Minister for Primary Industry said that as a result of devaluation there would be an extra $S0m for cattlemen. There has been no portfolio. improvement in catde prices since the devaluamary tion decision was taken. The implications of that are quite clear. Processors have been whistling off happily each week to the tune expense of beef speciaUst producers in this country.

152,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"Despite the fact that the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) is reputed to be a Butsenior Cabinet Minister, the fundmg priorities accorded transport services show that either he is responsible for those low priorities or he has Uttle impact on Cabinet decisions relating to his own In any case, Australian industry, priproducers and Australian consumers are needlessly forced to accept a lower standard of efficiency in transport services than could and of $ lm at the should be avaUable. In the few minutes avaUable to me in this totally inadequate debate on proposed expendiand ture for the Department of Transport, remembering that we have one and a half hours into debate item by item $870m of expenditure, I to discuss a number of expenditure which I sincerely hope the Minister will respond responsibly as previous Ministers have done in respect of the estimates for their departments. I turn first to fire services. Under item 06 of subdivision 2 of Division 655 a sum of $345,000 is being provided, compared with expenditure of $324,235 in 1976-77. Under item 12 the sum of $2.850m is being prois a vided, compared with actual expenditure of $2.609m in 1976-77. In both items the proposed expenditure is a considerable reduction in real terms compared with 1976-77 expenditure. Both items cover the provision and maintenance of fire fighting materials, fixed installations and fire fighting appliances. Item 02 under subdivision 1 of Division 957 in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) includes some provision for newfirefighting appUances. The amount of $ 10.4m is a reduction in real terms also. We are not told in the Budget what amount is separately avaUable for Last Sunday the spUlage of burning motor spirit into drains at Mascot following a tragic motor accident could have resulted in a holocaust if the resultant fire had spread to the airport facilities. The risk of fire is a tremendous hazard at airports and to aircraft passengers. It is a disgraceful state of affairs when so Utde acdon is being taken by this Government to ensure that our major airports have modern effective fire protecuon services avaUable. That the Government is aware of the dangers is evidenced by statements made at the Senate Estimates Committee hearing on the Department of Transport estimates. On page S21 of the Hansard of Senate Estimates Committee C for 15 September we read the following questioning by Senator Wriedt of officers of the Department of Transport:",65
153,Senator WRIEDT,PAIRS,To what extent attempt to make itsfire-fightingequipment interchangeable with tnat provided by local fire services? Is it an on-going policy to do that in order to reduce costs? Mr Birch-Certainl y this would be so with the fixed firefighting installations. There is not much room for compatibility between the types of mobile equipment used by the local fire brigades and our particular requirements on airports.,66
154,Senator WRIEDT,PAIRS,What are the specific items which are deferred from last year. Mr O'Halloran-Basically provisioning of spares programs which fell back a little last year because of the lack of sufficient funds. I emphasise the last few words. The Hansard report goes on:,66
155,Senator WRIEDT,PAIRS,Coul d I also ask for a comparison fire-fighting equipment at Australian airports with equipment at overseas airports. Is the Depanment satisfied the standards are adequate? Mr Birch-At the moment we are attempting to airports to the Intemadonal Civil Aviation Organisation standards. We are acquiring new orders recently for 10 ultra-large deliveries of other types of vehicles coming up. We have been having some difficulty in meeting ICAO standards in this regard But we hope during this year that we will be back to standard again.,66
156,Senator WRIEDT,PAIRS,"Would that mean that we were at one stage up to the ICAO standards but have now slipped behind somewhat? Mr Birch- I would doubt that we were ever right up to ICAO standards in all respects at every airport. It is clear from the answers given by the Department representatives thatfireprotection services at our airports are not up to desirable international standards. It has to be emphasised that for 25 of the past 28 years the conservatives have been in government and they have maintained a below international requirement standard of fire protection at our airports. They have traded on good luck for that period, but even good luck eventually runs out. It is questionable whether our major airports have the capacity to deal with a major Boeing 747 disaster, let alone a disaster of the magnitude of the Teneriffe disaster. That is the achievement of this Government. I draw the Committee's attention to the comment in the recent report of the Commonwealth Fire Board relating to the compatibility offirefightingappliances under the control of departments. I turn now to expenditure on meteorological services. Division 655.2.16 provides an amount of $ 11.403m in 1977-78 for the cost of meteorological services, which include the supply of pre-flight and intra-night weather forecasts and mformation. The amount is shown as an increase of $311,000 on 1976-77 expenditure, which at first sight appears to be a substantial reduction in real terms. In notes supphed to the 1977 Senate Estimates Committee C the Departdoes the Depanment ment stated: It is the Department's opinion that the share of costs of the Bureau of Meteorology being borne by the aviation industry is inequitable, and to this end has identified some specialist services taken from the Bureau which can now be dispensed with. Nevertheless, until such time as the matter is closely examined by an IDC and a new level of charges assessed, the costs will have to be continued under the existing arrangement. By itself that statement seems reasonable untU , senator, they refer to a normal this year's appropriation is compared with the corresponding 1976-77 estimates. In my view that comparison shows that the Minister and the Department have seriously misled the Parliament. Actual expenditure on this item in 1975-76 was $10.999m, in 1976-77 it was $11.092m, and of the proposed expenditure in 1977-78 is that $11.403m. In 1976 the Parliament was told that proposed expenditure for 1976-77 was $9.582m, raise all which was a decrease of $1.417m on actual 1975-76 expenditure. At the time the Departequipment. We placed ment stated: fire vehicles and we have It is intended to review the level of aviation weather services taken from the Bureau of Meteorology in an endeavour to effect an immediate reduction in costs. An IDC is to examine the basis of charges currendy levied by the Bureau and it is anticipated that a reduced level of charging insofar as this Department is concerned will be formulated. I do not havetimeto go through all the information, but I will just deal with my conclusions which are based on the submissions by the Department and the Minister to the Senate Estimates Committee last year in respect of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. I). They show that the estimate for 1976-77 was exceeded by $1.510m. An examination of the explanatory notes supplied to the Estimates Committee by the Department will show that the procedures followed by the Department in respect of this item raise a number of serious questions offinancialprocedure. In the light of the deficiencies shown in those reports, I believe that Minister is responsible for the procedures that were followed and that the procedures followed denied the Parhament pertinent information on proposed expenditure. In my view, the whole matter, scandalous as it is, should be referred to the Auditor-General for examination and to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for mquiry and report to the Parliament. The information contained in the 1976-77 Appropriation Bill (No. 3) should be before the Committee. It is not, and a completely false impression has been given to the Committee as to the purpose of the expenditure and how it relates to expenditure in the year just concluded.",66
157,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"We are debating the estimates for the Department of Transport for 1977-78. The areas covered by the Transport portfolio are wide and diverse, and fact affect 20 per cent of the gross national econment. omy. The portfolio encompasses aviation, ping, the roads programs, and development and research into transport throughout Australia. The Minister who was responsible for this portAustralian folio on the Government coming to office dethom cided that the Government should proceed along lines different from those taken by the previous Government. Previously we had seen the Aussible trahan Labor Party pursuing lines of great fasciAustralia nation and great difficulty in the transport areas. I particularly recall to the Committee the Intercontinues State Commission that was proposed by the prethat vious Minister. It was a far-reaching and incredFranklin ible piece of legislation that went far beyond transport portfolio into every walk of Australian Ufe. Not only would it have been used to control transport across State borders, it would also haveof had the effect of controlling the relationship tween business and commerce right across nation. It was one of the most centralistic pieces of legislation this Parliament has witnessed. Honourable members who were present at that time will remember that the then Opposition refused to accept the proposals that were ment's brought forward by the Labor Party. The current Minister for Transport (Mr being Nixon) changed the approach. Working in the spirit of true co-operative federalism, he has given a freedom to people in all avenues of transport to have a greater say and to set own priorities in the development of a national transport pohcy. If one looks, for instance, at roads proposals that have been dealt with in thiswUl House in the last week or two, one will be aware that an impetus, a Ufe and a will are being transport expressed by this Government to improve the road transport situation across the nation-no only in the area of roads but also in the developcitizens ment of types of machinery and equipment, a uniformity of weight carrying capacity, for instance, for highways and axle loads for transport where trucking is used. These are the important things, not the control of binding down of industry and commerce or the binding down to a uniform transport system in Australia. In some areas where there is need for uniformity the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) has pursued programs such as the national highways program. That program Ues fully within the responsibility of this Government and it is encouraging to see the way in which State governments have responded to the improvement in national highways and national programs of that type. The other area where the Government has had difficulty during its term of office is the railway in arrangements made by the previous GovernIt is futile to say that the South Australian shipGovernment received anything but the most generous treatment when the decision was made to purchase the railway system from the South Government. It has been a constant in the side of administrators and governments since that decision was made. The employment of staff and the introduction of a senrail transport system in the State of South have been made almost impossible by the fact that the South Australian Government to run that railway system. I am sure my good friend the honourable member for (Mr Good luck) will be aware of the thedifficulties in the State of Tasmama with the agreement made with the Government of Tasmania under which that Government has control so many factors which by law should Ue in this beParliament. I do not agree with the decision that the was made by the Labor Government to buy these State raUway systems. I think it has been demonstrated that it was not a good decision. If one looks into other areas of this Governactivities, such as the airUnes and airUne policies within Australia, one will see a change, m which some sort of adventure or imagination is appUed to those policies. It is not good that air travel in Australia is so expensive and the matter of international travel versus internal travel is receiving the closest attention. The thenGovernment's committee of mquiry into international fares and the operation of international the companies within this nation will bear fruit that be of benefit to aU travellers. The registration of travel agents is outside the ambit of the portfolio, but it bears strongly on what may happen in the area of intemauonal travel t and the benefits that will flow to Australian travelling overseas. I know that this legisand lation was introduced first by the previous Government. With the collapse of various travel agencies, we now have seen the reason for bringing forward these proposals. I refer particularly to the agency operated by the Australian Union of Students and the great hardships that were caused to many individual students who were caught overseas and who could not make proper or effective travel arrangements through that agency. It is unfortunate that that agency has fallen into great disrepute. I trust that the Government will move to overcome those problems by introducing a true student fare that will be available to high school and tertiary students throughout Austraha from a number of agencies instead of just from the monopoly that operated previously. When one looks at the future needs of this nation in the field of transport, there are a number of areas that spring to mind. The need, with the changing emphasis in defence pohcy, to have an understanding of the transpon system throughout Australia and the need to know in detail the weight carrying capacity of various railway lines and roads, the capacity of various sea ports and airports and the fuel faculties that would be needed in times of emergency appeal to me as being a reasonable function of the Department of Transport, in co-operation with the Department of Defence, with the Federal Government providing additional suppon for State and local authoriues to fulfil something of an internal defence arrangement. Other areas of innovation are of great interest to me. I see a policy of innovation, such as we see with the Schools Commission, being appUed to State governments, perhaps amalgamating the research and development programs administered from here, as well as new programs, so that in panicular instances State governments might take up innovations such as automaticticketcollecting as a trial program that could be examined and evaluated around Australia to see where that son of system would be of advantage. Finally, I think that no area is more important than the capacity of this nation to continue to export economically. It is imponant that there be a rationalisation of the export of manufactured and primary produce in such a way that there is a minimum of delay and cost to exporters through the transport system. The expenses in this area haverisendramatically over the last three to four years. It is of great concern to me that exporters, on whom we depend to pay our way in the world by trade, have difficulties and are meeting increasing costs",67
158,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS, Order! The honourable gendemen's ume has expired.,68
159,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS,"We have just heard a typical speech from the honourable member for MitcheU (Mr Cadman). It was just garbage. It shows how Uttle he knows about transport when honourable members have to sit here for 10 minutes and listen to that son of speech. He has now left the chamber. He could not bolt out quickly enough. I draw attenuon to the fact that once again the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) is not in the chamber during the discussion of the estimates for his Department. The discussion of the estimates for each depanment is an imponant part of the Budget debate. But where is the Minister? He is not to be sighted anywhere. He has not been sighted in the chamber at anytimeduring this debate. I draw attention to the fact that, of 11 BUls that were introduced into this placesome of which undid the very good things which the Labor Government did in the area of transport-the Minister could muster sufficient interest to come into this place and take pan in the debate on only three of them. It must be disappointing for the officers of the Depanment of Transpon sitting in the advisers' benches that the Minister is not here to give the lead as to what is going on as far as the Department is concerned. These gentlemen have my sympathy. They have a Minister who has no interest in his Depanment. I want to draw to the attention of the Parliament a decision that was taken by the Labor Government to build four large bulk ships-tw o 120,000 tonners and two 140,000 tonnerswhich would carry Australia's iron ore exports and estabUsh a large bulk shipping line under the control of the Australian National Line. In 1973 the then chairman of ANL, Mr Weymouth, with my approval, together with the general manager of ANL went to Japan and had discussions with steel industry managers there. They came to an understanding that, if the Australian National Line or an Australian shipping line had ships of sufficient capacity to carry ore, it would get sufficient work to maintain those ships. At that time the Japanese shipbuilding industry was so loaded with orders that it did not have the opportunity to build those ships. When the question of building the ships in Japan was discussed with the Japanese-it made sense in view of the fact that we intended to carry iron ore from Australia to Japan, so at least we could have built the ships in Japan-unfortunatel y the Japanese shipbuUding industry had so many orders to fill that it could not even give any indication when the ships could be delivered. The result was that that stage only two shipbuilding yards in the world could give any reasonable dehvery time. The result was that ANL placed orders for those ships to be built in Sweden and the other two in West Germany. The total cost of the fourto ships was in excess of $ 100m. What disappoints me is to see today that of those ships are laid up and have used since they were completed. More than $50m worth of ships is just lying idle, not being used, because the line does not have orders which it could use them. What also disappoints me is the fact that, in my humble opinion, the Minister is not applying sufficient pressure taking sufficient acdon to ensure that those ships are employed and that Austrahan labour employed on them. Instead it is creating a situmeans auon similar to that which exists with Utah. thermore the Government has refused to move into the field of carrying Australian crude oU imports. It has dismantled the policy of 40:40:20 which we laid down. Immediately this Governwould ment came to power it dismantled that poUcy. the position today is that the Australian shippingtirely. industry is being neglected. Ships that have beenforward. paid for by the Australian National Line are now tied up, when we had a definite understanding that they would be used. Without that underright standing, those four ships-tw o of them are working and two of them are laid up-woul d nottion have been built at that stage. So I simply bring out those points in order to clarify the position for anyone who says that ANL went into that trade bUndly without any prior consultation understanding of the situation. Another matter I would Uke to bring to the attention of the Committee is the need for the national, Government to stop holding inquiries and to get on with the job of developing the Sydney airport, E ort at Boston. either on its present site or possibly on another site. Any suggestions that there may be a Sydneyis airport at Mascot and a second airport located Sydney. somewhere else are just crazy. If another airport is to be buUt it has to be large enough to cater for the whole of the traffic that will be moving craft through Sydney and the present airport closed down. There is no way that a city the size of Syd-aircraft ney should have two international or two domof estic airports. The Sydney airport has to located in one position. I put forward the proposition that the present inquiry should be looking at the possibUity of constructing an open V runway-somethin g rangement oriented along the Unes of the 31-13. At the present time we have a 16-34 runway and an 07-25 runway-north-south , east-west runways. at A runway should be built in such a way that there is no need to carry out the demoUtion of any existing buUdings. The only buUdings that two ofwould be demoUshed would be the old tower and the existing fire station, which we all know is be shifted to another site. I believe that the decision has already been taken. If it has not, I two point out that it was well on the way to being never been taken before 11 November 1975. So we could have three runways operating. It is wrong for people to say that these runways are on not effective. We could construct a runway of some 6,500 feet commencing from approximately the position of the present 16-34 runway. or That would cater for all the DC9 and 727 traffic two that would be using the Sydney airport. That iswould have the effect not only of providing the of operating the airport more efficientiy Fur-and eliminating some of the delays that occur from time totimebut also of paying a dividend in the form of a reduction in aircraft noise, because an aircraft taking off on a 31-13 runway not pass over any residential areas; it Sowould pass over water or over vacant land enSo that is a proposition which I put As I was saying, open V runways are used throughout the world. In the limited time that is available to me I would just Uke to menquickly some of the large cities in the United States which have open V runways. They include the La Guardia airport in New York, Baltimore, Newark, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Greater Pittsor burgh, Lambert-St Louis, Miami International, Washington International, Seattle-Tacoma International, Cleveland International, Detroit Metropolitan, Minneapolis-St Paul InterKansas City, Dallas and the Logan AirThey are aU major airports in the Inked States which have open V runways. That a proposition which should be looked at for I also want to discount the suggestions that are being made by some people that commuter airshould be kept out of Sydney. Let us get one thing very clear and very positive: Commuter in this country are doing a first class job providing air transport for a lot of people who be under normal circumstances would not be sufficient in number to justify the operation of even a Friendship aircraft. These commuter aircraft have to be blended in with the existing arin Sydney, either by locating a 2,000 feet runway on the eastern end of the airport, probably paraUel with General Holmes Drive, or even putting it on the southern side of the eastcan west runway so that it runs once again parallel with General Holmes Drive. Either one or two runways could be located in those positions. that were done it would reduce a considerable amount of the pressure that exists at the present time on the two major runways-the 07-25 way and the 16-34 runway. Even though the Minister is not present in the chamber, I ask his dieOne advisers who are present to take this proposition tunately to him for considerauon, so muter operators who are using Sydney airport Australia shouldGovernments reaUse and who are providing a first class service for in our legislation and pre-training people from the areas that they serve can conprovided to young motor cycUsts before tinue to operate. I regret that in the limitedtimeof 10 minutes available in a discussion of this type one cannot say very much. However, I regret very much this Government has not moved yet to do anydrive thing about estabUshing a transport accident investigation authority, because I believe there a need for one. In the aviation industry last 266 accidents occurred, 19 of which were fatal claiming 54 Uves. I have spoken on a number of occasions in this House about the accident today. involving the Heron aircraft that crashed on approach to the Cairns airport. That accident theFrom should have been the subject of investigations transport investigation authorities.",68
160,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Mr Drummond) staggering - Order ! The honourable member's time has concerted expired.,70
161,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS," I draw motor the attention of the Committee to a national problem which deserves to be discussed in spirit of co-operation. I refer to road safety. motor vehicle and the resultant problems that have occurred as a result of the massive number of cars on the roads throughout Australia today represent a real problem. They are of vexing conates. cern to the present Government and wdl present the same problems for future governments. car Motor vehicles dictate our future city planning and they dictate whether we Uve to a ripe old age. There are approximately 5.5 mUUon motor vehicles on our roads today. New car registraroads today. tions for the period 1972-73 numbered 534,139 and for 1974-75 they numbered 624,187. Those figures indicate the growing number of motor vehicles being put on our roads. WhUst it is appreciated that the motor vehicle is a convenient mode of transport, it has become a monster. Sometimes it is possessed to the extent of selfishness, provides an outlet for frustration, and represents a large cost factor in the average famUy budget. Unfortunately, motor vehicles loll. Hospitals are full of tragic cases resulting from road accidents. Relatives and friends of victims have had happiness and future prosperity If plucked from their very reach by the motor vehicle. During the year ended 30 June 1975 some 3,656 people were killed on the roads and aprunproximately 90,000 people were injured. out of ten people killed on the roads today as a result of motor cycle accidents. Unformost of those people are under the age that at least the comof 21 years. that in aU States of we need uniformity needs to be they are allowed on the roads because, unfortunately, sometimes they go out and kUl themselves. It has been said that approximately 2 per cent of Austhat tralians who, when they ride motor cycles or motor cars, do not care whether they live or die. That seems incredible to me. The sooner is governments reaUse that this is a major problem, year the sooner we will overcome this sad and sorry situation in which young people, and of course older people, are killed on the roads in Australia 1970 we have made great inroads into problems by Despite an increase associated with road safety. in population of one mUlion and an increase in registrations of 1,800,000, the death rate has been slowed down by efforts, particularly in relation to seat belt legislation, by inspection of motor vehicles and also by an improvement in the standard of vehicles. The motor industry is the second largest industry in Australia. It employs approa ximately 254,000 workers in manufacturing, The wholesaling and retaUing. Consequently, and most importantly, it is a vital and economic growth factor for our future prosperity. We need it but we must be aware of the problems it creThe motor vehicle is here to stay.

162,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,"Yes, of course. The honourable member for Shonland has mentioned drinking. It is a most important factor in the number of deaths in Australia today but sometimes people seem to think that drink is the cause. When an accident has occurred and somebody is lulled, if there is a smell of alcohol or a percentage of alcohol in the victim's blood it is assumed that the accident has been caused by drink. But there are many other factors, and sooner we realiseMr Morris-It is No. 1.",70
163,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,"Of course it is No. 1, but we need to tackle the problem constructively and find out exactly what occurred. We need to find out whether it was a fault of the vehicle, whether it was a fault of the road or whether it was caused by other contingencies. The sooner we do that, the sooner we will be able to overcome the real problem. The honourable member's point is well commitments. taken. The motor vehicle is a lethal weapon. Much is said about the tragedy of war and the Government precious lives lost but we as a Government must chaos. Its policies make a concerted thrust in the area of road safety. Every State has a responsibility but States must have the support and the expertise a sympathetic Federal government prepared to back them and to make road safety a national priority. Determined and courageous decisions must be made in car design, standards of safety, road design, compulsory inspections, an appalling behavioural patterns of drivers and, of course, alcohol, drugs and eyesight.

It was to be located at Albury-Wodonga but the Government did not proceed with it, even though an all-party committee of this Parliament sat for a longtimeand even though its recommendations were accepted by the former Australian Labor Party Government. So it is not of much use the honourable member talking; he must make sure that his Government meets its The urban public transport poUcies of this have givenriseto confusion and are self-defeating because they areriddledwith contradictions.

It is record for a government with a selfproclaimed interest in pubUc transpon. This Government is encouraging a run down in the urban pubhc transpon system of the kind which produced the GranvUle train disaster. I stress that I am not only talking about the two years since 1975; I am talking also about the neglect by governments between 1950 and has 1972. The situation with Australia's raUways at present is disastrous. The plant, equipment and rolling stock of our State raUways are in urgent also. It need of upgrading and re-equipping.

These range from level crossing accidents to running through points. Most of them were minor, but some of these called irregularities could end in disasters such the Granville disaster.

This means that there has been heavy subsidy element over the years for roads.should RaUways in Australia were faced with a deficit on their operations in excess of $500m in 1975-76. More than $ 130m of this deficit was debt servicing charges. In both New South Wales and Queensland these charges exceeded $50m in 1975-76. Our pubUc transport systems have been placed in afinancialstraitjacket. This appalUng situGovernment ation has to be corrected. At least the Labor Government from 1972 to 1975 tried to meet situation. But this Government's lack of commitpubhc ment to funding urban pubUc transport does nothing to solve the problem and can only makeTransport it worse. We are now faced with a situauon where only 4V4 per cent of pubUc capital invest-a ment is on raUways. This compares with 5V4 perMinister cent in the second half of the 1960s. This cut back in funds for public transport come at atimewhen this Government has just increased petrol prices by 1 lc a gaUon. One the supposed aims of raising petrol prices was conserve the urban environment by reducing must urban car usage. Conserving the urban environment is what we are talking about. This great des cision by this Government was an environmental raildecision. It was supposed to be a decision to minimise the use of the motor car within the cities. Yet this Government sees fit to cut back theurban pubUc transport funds which would propubUc transport which is an alternative to whatcar usage. What is the position? We have a Country Party Minister responsible for national resources and a National Country Party Minister who is responsible for transport. What so-did they do? They made a decision to impose a aslevy of 1 lc on each gallon of petrol sold. What be does this mean? It means $150m will be paid by users in this country and handed over to the very wealthy companies. Of that amount $110m will go to Esso-BHP and $48m will go to Wapet. Six-sevenths of Wapet is foreign owned. Sixty per cent of the $150m is going to foreign Yet in the Budget we reduced the on urban pubUc transport. This was a measure which pandered to National Country Party supporters, namely, the based mining interests. It has done nothing to improve the quaUty of the urban environThe fault of this Government has been to transport as an end in itself, which of course it is not. What we have to do about urban pubUc is to make sure not only that is there increased expenditure but also that there is expenditure on urban and regional a development, because they go hand in hand. We develop a system in such a way as to allow the sub-metropolitan centres to develop. for For instance, in the city of Sydney we should make sure that we develop metropolitan centres Uke Parramatta, Liverpool, Penrith and Campbelltown to balance the transport load. In the case of Melbourne, when we were in government we worked in co-operation with the Victorian to set up sub-metropoUtan centres at places Uke Sunshine, Dandenong, Watsonia, thisEpping and Broadmeadows and to transfer our servants to those areas so that at least we would bring some balance to the transport load. cannot be an end in itself. This is what has happened under this Government. We have Minister for Transport in the Cabinet. The responsible for overall planning is one of the junior Ministers in this Government. That hasis the low priority which this Government attaches to the planning of urban and. regional of development as a whole. Transport and urban to and regional development go hand in hand and be treated in that fashion if we want better public transport. Unfortunately, this Government has no real interest in urban pubhc transport in any shape or form. Progress reported. SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL tion Notice of Presentation",72
169,The Clerk,PAIRS,Notic e has been received from Minister representing the Minister for Social Setant. curity ofhis intention at the next day of sitting present a Bill relating to social services Australia. amendment. NA Shipping: Navigational Aids-A.C.T.U. President-Trade Unions-Political Parties-Victoria n Power Strike-Moto r Vehicle Industry-Williamsbur g Conference Motion (by Mr Viner) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.,73
170,Mr MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"In the from brieftimeavailable to me in the adjournment debate this evening, I want to draw to the attensels tion of the House a decision of the Government to lay up two of the three navigational aid vessels or navaid vessels-the Cape Pdlar, the Cape Don and the Cape Moreton. It is well known to the tries. seafaring community, to those people who are dependent for safety reasons upon the proper and efficient operation of navigational aidsefficient lighthouses, buoys and markers-that the those Government has decided to cut back on the servessels vicing and maintenance of these aids. What want to draw to the attention of the House is the very serious safety factor mvolved in this course. The ships, as well as servicing and maintaining the navigational aids provide supply facilities and also at times carry out some work on behalf of sister departments. It would appear that cause of the reduction in revenue from Ught and because of a reduced traffic in coastal shipI ping it is felt that there is insufficient revenue match the increase in expenditure that has occurits red over the last year and therefore a decision has been taken by the Government to reduce the number of vessels in this area. These vessels have a number of other functhis tions. They are one of the important means of reporting otherwise undetected vessels off the Australian coast. It is worth noting that more than 30 per cent of marine operation centre sightings are made by non-surveUlance vessels. At the present time, with the great fear being expressed about breaches of quarantine and what could occur with the unauthorised landings of vessels on the Australian coast, particularly remote places, and the ravage to Australian Uvestock that would be caused by the introduction of exotic diseases, it is aU the more important that the Government do all it can to maintain the operations of these vessels. Not only is the quesof quarantine important but also the unauthorised landings of persons intent on permanent residence in Australia or others who the could be engaged in drug trafficking is imporThere is also the recent decision to establish to a 200-mUe commercial fishing zone around WhUe it is in the interests of Australia to develop and foster our ownfishingindustry, it is also in our interests to maintain those vessels on the Australian coast to keep up the good work they are doing sighting unauthorised vessels from other lands which are entering our commercialfishingzones. They are just some of the reasons why these vessels should be maintained. The Opposition believes that safety should not be related strictly to revenue. It would appear the information avaUable that the Government's decision on the operation of navaid vesaround the Australian coast is determined by revenue avaUable from Ught dues. Some claim is also made by the Government that this decision is related to practice followed by overseas counIt is understandable that the use of Ught aircraft and heUcopters in maintaining and servicing some of the aids may well provide a more and more economic method of servicing aids. But the paramount matter is that the should be kept operating, at least untU I some alternative means of surveUlance is arranged. As said I earlier, at a time when we have a record number of violations of Australian commercialfishingzone waters by the unauthorised entry of foreign vessels, these navaid vessels should be maintained if only to sight unauthorbeised entry into Australian waters and unauthordues ised landings on the Australian coast. conclude on the point that the task is before to the Government. I believe the Government has priorities wrong because more than 30 per cent of Marine Operations Centre sightings are made by non-surveUlance vessels. These navaid vessels have a very important role to carry out in respect and I ask the Government to continue their operations, pending the estabUshment of other means of identification and surveUlance.",73
171,Mr FALCONER,ADJOURNMENT," I am alarmed at statements reported to have been made by the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Hawke, which clearly place him in contempt of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. On the front page of this at morning's Adelaide Advertiser, in an article headlined ' ""Bastards"", says Hawke of Bench', Mr Hawke is quoted as making the following extraordinary statement about the members of the Full Bench of the Commission: The collective bloody salary ofthose pack of bastards who made the decision would be what . . . $30,000 average. The Melbourne Age was a Uttle more restrained. That newspaper quoted him as saying: The collective bloody salary of these men who made the decision would be what . . . $30,000 at an average. Mr Hawke's uncouth language apparently made the Age sub-editor blanch. The phrase 'pack of bastards' was replaced by the word 'men . In the Australian this morning Mr Hawke is quoted as saying further: It is an absurd decision. It is an internally unintelligent - decision. He is further quoted in that newspaper as saying: If I had been a man down there today I would to conunue the strike. So much for the great conciliator Hawke. His the language and his attitude clearly stamp him as charged one of the bully boys in this quote section 182 of the ConcUiation and ArbiIf tration Act, which I believe Mr Hawke has breached by his statement. Section 182 of the provides: (1) a person shall not(a) wilfully insult or disturb a member of mission when exercising powers or functions; (b) interrupt the proceedings of the Commission; (c) use insulting language towards a member of the Commission; or (d) by writing or speech use words calculated(i) to influence improperly a member mission or a witness and this is the most important provision(ii) to bring a member of the Commission or the Commission into disrepute. Penalty: Five hundred dollars or imprisonment for 12 months, or both. I turn now to section 191 of the Act, which states: (1) A person who has committed an offence against this Act or the regulations may be charged accordingly before the Court and the Coun may impose the penalty provided by this Act or the regulations in respect of that offence. (2) Proceedings before the Coun under this section may be instituted by summons issued upon information, without indictment. They are the relevant sections of the Act. Mr Hawke should be charged with contempt of the Commission and brought before the Industrial Bench of the Federal Coun of Australia. What is Sir John Moore, the President of the Commission, doing about it? Is he prepared to defend the integrity and dignity of his own Full Bench comprising Mr Justice Ludeke, Mr Justice Isaac and Commissioner Vosti? On the past record of those gentlemen, no one could accuse that FuU Bench of being anti-trade union. It is a bench with an impeccable record. If Sir John Moore is not prepared to take action under section 182 of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act to protect his own Full Bench, the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, should do so. Mr Hawke does not stop at insulting the Full Bench-this responsible and courageous Full Bench which took the only decision which it felt it could take under the circumstances. Mr Hawke goes on, in repons of his statements, to urge that the Commission should give into industrial blackmaU. Let me quote him again from the Adelaide Advertiser, which reports him as saying: They've got an industrial dispute and if it was true that the unions case was incoherent, they are still charged with the re have voted sponsibility of settling the dispute. They are paid enough bloody money to say 'Well perhaps union case didn't cover everything but we are now with the settlement of an industrial dispute and we dispute. Let me will now settle it'. that is not a statement which urges the Full Bench of the Commission to give into outright Act industrial blackmaU, I do not know what is such a statement. This stands in marked contrast with statements made by Mr Ken Stone, the Secretary the Comof the Victorian Trades Hall Council, who said last night that he thought the men should have returned to work. He said: My view is that they should have returned to work out of sheer common sense.",73
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Lucock)of the ComOrder! The honourable member's time has before the Commission; or expired.,74
173,Mr YOUNG,ADJOURNMENT,"Bob Hawke and the industrial movement certainly have a lot to put up with. We have some very junior back benchers entering mto what is now a very serious dispute in Victoria. Bob Hawke, when he returned to work last Monday week, was the vehicle by which a settlement was reached until the Full Bench gave its decision this week. Again, Bob Hawke, with the calling of the meeting today of the unions affiliated with the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions and the shop stewards, has been the vehicle by which there will be another inquiiy into a work value case in regard to the Latrobe VaUey. This Government is terrified that Bob Hawke will settle the dispute. We are still living in this Disneyland of poUtics where everything now is being done to suit the elecuon that will be caUed in thefirstor second week of December. What the Liberal Party requires most of all is a very serious industrial dispute in Austraha in order to bolster its politiwUl cal hopes. It gives no thought at all-w e have not heard one word from this Government-to the 400,000 people who are unemployed. We have not heard one word about the people who were refused unemployment benefits after being stood down as a result of this dispute. We have not heard one word from the Government about what these people are putting up with. Rather, we hear further provocation of Bob Hawke, nationally the most popular figure in the country by any poll taken by anyone and published by any journal. Bob Hawke has the full backing of the Australian people in trying to negotiate and setde these industrial disputes. We have these poltiical peasants sitting on the Government back benches trying to irritate and provoke the industrial movement into perhaps prolonging an industrial dispute. One thing people involved in the industrial movement do not do, because they are the people putting up with the hardships, is prolong industrial disputes. They have a dispute because they want to achieve somefinancialgain or better conditions under which to work. They do not go on strike for nine or ten weeks as some useless exercise. Their bank balances are not so fat that they will carry them through that period. The people in the Latrobe Valley obviously feel that there is grave economic injustice concerning the wages which they receive. This Government, by provoking those workers further and keeping them out on strike for a longer period, is ignoring the enormous impact on industry throughout Australia. It may suit the Government to go to the polls in the first or second week in December, a year before an election is due. The ironic feature of the way in which back benchers are so slavishly following the Government is that at least 25 or 30 of them will never come back. They are putting their hands up to support a Prime Minister who is hell bent on seeing that a number of them never return to the Parliament. There will be no more Wentworths, Chipps, Ellicotts and Goodlucks in the next Parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) not only wants the industrial dispute lengthened but also wants to tame what is already to us on this side of the House an extremely tame back bench. We continue to Uve with the poltiical decisions associated with an early election. One can expect that in the next two weeks decisions will be made which conveniently will suit the election and will show a sense of propriety about the unemployed people. I would not be surprised if the Government takes a decision to subsidise people who be employed by local government. I would not be surprised if the Government decides that people, at their option, can retire at 64 years of age. I ask honourable members to follow those predictions in the next couple of weeks. Rational economic decisions are not being made. Every political decision being made in Australia at the moment is aimed at returning the present Prime Minister as Prime Mmister and leading a number of back benchers back to their old professions in their old districts. Tonight we have had a further illustration of the infantile position poUtics has reached when the most junior of the back benchers gets up to teU Australia how bad Bob Hawke is. It is a futUe exercise.",74
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,75
175,Mr SIMON,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) is very concerned about the strength of the back bench after the next election, whenever that may be. I trust that he will listen quietly to what I am going to read tonight. I have a letter from some responsible union leaders in the Latrobe Valley. I refer to a letter from the State President of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, who is also Secretary of the MorweU sub-branch of that union, and the Secretary of the Yallourn sub-branch of that union to the local newspaper, the La Trobe Valley Express some three weeks ago. In that letter Mr Kroezen and Mr Coffield state: The log of claims, cause of the disputation, was, and still constitutionally is, in the hands of the Victorian Trades Hall Council. Processes were under way for establishing complete agreement among all unions with members employed in the SEC before the log was submitted by the VTHC to the SEC on behalf of all these unions. Two meetings of representatives of the SEC unions were held at the VTHC in May, at which discussion was necessarily protracted because of complex award matters involved. It would have been, nevenheless, only a matter oftimeuntil agreement was ultimately reached on the log to be submitted to the SEC through consututional trade union channels. However, on IS June, an organised group calling itself the SEC Latrobe Valley Shop Stewards Committee, under the leadership of Amalgamated Metal Workers Union official S. ArmstrongMr Sullivan-He is a communist.",75
176,Mr SIMON,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Armstrong is President of the Gippsland Trades and Labour Council, Chairman of the SEC Latrobe VaUey Shop Stewards Committee, Secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and a member of the Communist Party, as the honourable member for Riverina said. The letter continues: . . . took it upon itself to call a mass meeung workers in the Latrobe Valley in order to discuss claims issued. At this meeting S. Armstrong, after a reprehensible and completely unjustifiable attack on the VTHC, moved a resolution that the Latrobe Valley force 'go it alone' in pursuing This resolution was narrowly carried, committing workers mvolved to breaking away from a unified properly conducted under the control of the time and availability bans were imposed forthwith, industrial acuon escalating to the now seven-week long stoppage. Apart from the fact that S. Armstrong's committee is representative of only 11 of the unions with members employed in the SEC, shop stewards committees, which erate under an ACTU charter, have no constitutional ority to either engage in this type of industrial activity sue matters affecting wage rates or award conditions. the outset, therefore, the Latrobe Valley campaign has been essentially illegal and divorced from properly constituted trade union procedures. The 2,300 men involved have badly misled and the great hardship suffered by their families should never have happened. The FEDFA, together with the other unions with bers in SEC employ, has endeavoured to act responsibly by maintaining a position within the framework of the campaign. This campaign has, of course, been disrupted the Latrobe Valley operation. Disunity there certainly is, cess was initiated by S. Armstrong and his IS June. The writers of the letter refer that newspaper and state: Reverting to the Express viewpoint as stated we take particular exception to the presumption daring to tell our members how to conduct their industrial affairs, and we view his suggestion that the FEDFA have seen to it that Victoria was 'plunged into darkness brought to a standstill' as the most outrageous editorial ment we have had the misfortune to read. It is no wonder the Secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council is reported in tonight's Herald as calling on the workers to resume work in the Latrobe Valley and to stop the rot which has set in and which is in fact totally caused by the illegal actions of the SEC Latrobe Valley Shop Stewards Committee.",75
177,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"The Latrobe Valley workers are enwealth titled to a substantial increase in their wages. That is the starting point. The reason that have this trouble now is that when wage indexaworks tion was first introduced we did not adjust the wages of the metal trades group to the natural historical nexus that always existed between fitters and carpenters. Ever since Judge Higgins fixed the rate for carpenters and fitters and turners more than 60 years ago there has been this nexus between the two. When wage indexating tion was first introduced the award rate for fitter was $27 a week less than the award rate forthat a carpenter. My view then was that wage indexaa tion would eventually break down unless this of SEC anomaly was corrected at the beginning of wage the log of indexation. I have been proved correct. It is all very well for members of this Parhawork ment who recently voted themselves a $60 a a log of claims with the SEC. the week increase and it is all very well forjudges of campaign, the Concihation and Arbitration Commission VTHC. Overwho have been awarded an $80 a week this increase-no t an $80 a week increase on top of $180 a week, but an $80 a week increase on top of $800 a week-to sit in judgment on these workers. That is the position. It sickens me that opjudges of the Arbitration Commission should sit auththere in their smug satisfaction, on their $44,000 or pura year, and be telling useful people-peopl e who From are useful to the community and without whom we cannot exist-that they are not entided to an been increase in their salaries. I agree entirely with them and Bob Hawke that these men have a case. This Government knows that they have a case, but it memis deliberately conniving with the Commission. I VTHC say 'deliberately' because the Government has by been in touch with the Commission, and I know it. but the whole disunifying proshop stewards on Mr VINER - How do you know it?",76
178,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,It has. How do I to the editorial in know it? MrViner-How?,76
179,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"You are not denyofthe editorial writer in ing it. I am not telling you how I know it, but I should know that this Government has been conniving and with the Commission to refuse to give these men comthe just increase to which they are entitled because it wants to bring about sufficient chaos in industry to cause people to believe that the real culprits are the men who are merely asking for thenan increase in wages commensurate with the value of the work that they are doing. These men are getting $20 a week less than average weekly earnings. Do honourable members opposite know that? Do they know that a 21-year-old in the Third Division of the CommonPublic Service gets $20 a week more than average weekly earnings? Such a clerk gets $40 a we week more than a fitter and turner. The clerk 36% hours a week in an air-conditioned office. These men have to work out in the heat, or the noise, the dirt, the smoke and the fumes of the industry in which they are doing 40 hours a week for $40 a week less. Of course they are entitled to an increase. Members opposite are nothing more nor less than a pack of hypocrites, sitthere on their $60 a week increase that they a gave themselves only a little while ago, saying these men are not entitled to a miserable $40 week increase. Honourable members opposite got their $60 a week increase on top of a salary that was already in excess of $400 a week. What right have they deliberately to cause members of the pubhc of Victoria to have to suffer the vations that they are suffering just to make it possible for them to win another election? They will find, just as Edward Heath found, that they try putting the public to an inconvenience that they are deliberately setting order to win some political advantage the attempt will backfire on them, as it ought to.",76
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," prices, Order! The honourable member's time has tion expired.",77
181,Mr COHEN,ADJOURNMENT,I move: That the honourable member for Hindmarsh be granted an extension of time.,77
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,An extension of in view time cannot be moved during the adjournment debate. I call the honourable member for Wide Bay.,77
183,Mr MILLAR,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to E ut forward a modest proposal which I feel could e of some benefit to the Australian motor vehicle industry. I recently had discussions with take members of the retail section of that industry. I mood of have come to the conclusion that the Governpeople: ment could consider reducing the sales tax on vehicles by a modest 2ft per cent. Unquestionably mediate this would have the effect of stimulating the retail area. The 2ft per cent is a modest goes a modest 2ft the time. If amount because there is no suggestion that the Australian car manufacturing industry should relieved of its responsibUity to increase efficiency in the production of motor vehicles in this long country. A reduction of 2ft per cent certainly would act as a stimulus to an industry which at the moment is lacking buoyancy. The effect of a 2ft per cent reduction in sales tax would require an increase in sales of 10 per cent to make good the sales tax revenue forgone. In other words, a dealer currently moving 100 vehicles in a specified period would be required to sell 110 vehicles, or a dealer selling 10 vehicles would need to sell another vehicle. According the information brought to me, this is well within the bounds of possibility. In such an exercise the Government in fact would not be surrendering revenue in thefinalanalysis. Rather, in the cess it would have generated some activity in an industry which at the moment needs a shot in the briefly arm. There would be additional incidental benefits. It would have an effect on the employment level in the industry, in the wholesale and retaU areas. It stands to reason that if a retaUer is not moving vehicles he must look closely at his staffing position. This device certainly would have the effect priof removing the need, in many cases, for employers to dispense with some of their staff. The generation of activity would bring further inciif dental benefits to the Government. I commend this proposal to the Government for earnest out to do inconsideration. The sales tax on motor vehicles represents a very substantial penalty. Based on wholesale which do not include delivery or registracharges, the sales tax on a Holden Torana is $927.97; on a Kingswood it is $1,062.06; on a Ford Falcon standard it is $994.88; and on a Datsun 180B it is $810.09. Sales tax is a very substantial deterrent for people who are contemplating purchasing a vehicle and who also are timid of the uncertain conditions that prevail at thistime.There is no question of doubt that there is sufficient liquidity in the community to enable people to fulfil their ambitions in the acquisition of material objects, including motor vehicles, but we need something to break the nexus, to encourage people to take the step. If some people that step others will be encouraged to go along with them and thus we can generate a getting on with the job. We could say to 'Buy now and take advantage of an imsales tax concession'. Also this would set sales in period ofeffects aside the of even modest infiation over a Government initially forper cent in sales tax, it can anticipate a considerable stimulus in the industry be and comfort itself with the thought that in the term the revenues that will accrue will in no way be diminished. I say again that a reduction of 2ft per cent is modest. It must of necessity be modest because the Australiin car manufacturing industry cannot be relieved of its reponsibUity to get its house in order. Too many people are disenchanted as a result of their experiences in buying new Australian vehicles. Manufacturers, encouraged by moving some of the vehicles on grass at the moto ment, may direct themselves to greater purpose in putting their own house in order. I am sure that if consideration is given to this proposal it will be found to have considerable merit. pro Mr FRY (Fraser) (10.54)- I want to speak about the proposed Williamsburg Conference which is planned to be held in Canbena between 1 November and 4 November at the Lakeside Hotel. OriginaUy it was planned that this conference would be held at the Australian National University but there was such an outcry from the student and staff associations that the organisers wisely withdrew fron the ANU decided to hold it at the Lakeside Hotel. These conferences are held each year and bring together top military and goverament officials, and heads of multinational corporations from the United States of America and non-comAnother munist Asian countries. This top level think is sponsored by the Asia Society, an organisation based in New York and Washington and started by multimillionaire John D. Rockefeller built the colonial town of Williamsburg the first conference was held in 1971. These ferences usually are held away from main and out of the public eye. They are highly ive and exclusive get-togethers which allow lobbying and person to person contact between individuals in top positions. Hence a high prolackeys. portion of chairmen and presidents of multinational corporations from the United States and Japan, and top people of influence from South East Asia have been invited to Williamsburg 7, the conference planned to be held in Canberra. Although it is claimed that this is only a way bringing together key decision makers, the Society has a recent history of involvement providing important research facilities for United States war effort in Vietnam. If one looks at the guest Williamsburg 7 it speaks for itself. From Japanese imperialism Indonesia there is General Ah Murtopo, Chief of Indonesia's security and the man who was the project officer for the acquistion of East Timor. This man was responsible for the invasion of East Timor where up to 100,000 Timorese have been killed. Others are Rachmat Saleh, Govertralian nor of the Bank of Indonesia and Julius Tahaya of Caltex Indonesia. They are all very interesting personalities. From Australia there is to be Rod Carnegie, of Conzinc Riotinto, John Reid of James Hardie Asbestos who is also a director of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd as well chairman of the Australian-Indonesian Business Co-operation Committee and who applauded the Indonesian takeover of East Timor. Another is Nicholas Parkinson, Secretary of the Departber ment of Foreign Affairs, which has helped sponsor this conference and which has put up some $15,000 provided by the Australian taxtheir payer. Another is Sir Laurence Mclntyre, former Ambassador to the United Nations and now rector of the Australian Institute of International Affairs which is co-sponsor of Williamsburg 7. From South Korea there is to be Kyung-won Kim, the assistant to dictator President Park the man responsible for the imprisonment of events thousands of political prisoners. From Malaysia we are to have Ghazali Shane, the Minister and Home Affairs and the man in charge of mass detentions. they Mr Sullivan-This is a communist conference.",77

And so I could go on. The guest list list of those coming to speaks and its for itself. It is a conservative elitist group main aim is to perpetuate American and in Australia. This organisation is strongly opposed by many groups in Australia, including the East Timor Association, the Aboriginal land rights groups, the Campaign Against Racial Exploitation, the Ausindependence movement and the Australian Union of Students.

186,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to make an unprepared speech for a couple of minutes. After listening to the honourable memfor Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) I want to to say that some men can be their own worse enemy while others can be the bitterest enemy of friends. That is the precise type of proposition put in the speech by the honourable dimember for Hindmarsh tonight. He looked at the determination of the Remuneration Tribunal and tried to make a distorted comparison between that and what is happening in Victoria and today in an effort to justify those events and in that State over the past few years. What disgusts me is that that kind of case is being for made increasingly by the Opposition yet over and over again members of the Opposition come to me and pleaded that the determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal, the body they are now criticising directly, should have been higher than they were. In order to obtain cheap and sordid popularity with members such as the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), who is in the middle of this, they are trying to turn ever is done by the Tribunal back on to their friends to gain a bit of sordid good will with those on strike in Victoria. It was totally unbecoming for the honourable member for Hindmarsh to do what he did. I believe that his friends in the Opposition ranks ought to be ashamed of the type of argument that he proposed.",78

188,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Most organisations have provided the required information. Because of problems associated mainly with establishing computerised records, a few organisations have not yet provided this information. The information which has been provided indicates that there are at least 55.3 per cent of Australians covered for private basic medical insurance and 64 per cent for private basic hospital insurance. These figures are shown in tables 74 and 92 of the Annual Report of the Director-General of Health for 1976-77 tabled on 21 September 1977. (3) The information has been provided progressively by the organisations since January 1977. 'La Fiamma' Newspaper Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: Did the Foreign Investment Review Board consider the acquisition of a controlling interest in La Fiamma newspaper by foreign interests. (Hansard, 25 May 1977, page 1894 and 2 June 1977, page 2579); if so, what recommendation did the Board make to him. NA questions upon noticewere circulated: Telephone Services Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable (Question No. 1040) member's question is as follows: Matters referred to the Foreign Investment Review Board are confidential to the parties concerned. The only exception to this rule arises where an Order is made and published in the Gazette. This practice inrespectof foreign investment matters has been accepted by successive Australian Governments. and terms can these charges be Icebergs: Use as Source of Fresh Water (Question No. 1219) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science, upon notice, on 17 August a reliable estimate to be 1977: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports that several countries, especiaUy the United States of America, have, for some years, been investigating the feasibility of of priusing Antarctic icebergs as a source of fresh water. on is ordinarily deductible (2) In view of the need for high grade fresh water in Austraha, and this country's favourable geographical position for the possible exploitation of the new technique, would it be wise for the Government to encourage the (Question No. 1096) development of skills and knowledge about the exploitation this importantresource,so that in future years we will be able to take immediate advantage of technical advances which may be made. answer to question No. 1580 (Han(3) Will the Government consider the advisability of (a) inviting the Australian Academy of Science to report, within a year, on the present state of technology in this area, and (b) offering the necessary financial support needed for the preparation of the report. Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (2) and (3) I am aware of reports of such investigations. Some work in this field has also been carried out in Australia. For example, the Australian Academy ofScience has a committee investigating the use of icebergs as a potential source of fresh water. In addition, Australian scientists (including a Government scientist from the Antarctic Division) actively participated in the First International Conference on Iceberg Utilisation, held in the United States from 2 to 6 October 1977. The conference was attended by scientists, engineers, consultants and industry representatives. One of the principal reasons for holding the International Conference was to assess all aspects of the state of research and development on the use of icebergs as a source of fresh water. It would seem therefore that the outcome of the con(Question No. 1143) ference should be awaited and considered before deciding whether or not funher inquiries into the present state of technology for iceberg utilisation should now be pursued.

190,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The identifiable cost of administering the Export Market Development Grants Act was $638,237 in 1976-77 and is estimated to be $786,000 in 1977-78. These amounts do not include the cost of common services provided by the Department of Overseas Trade and other Depanments which are not separately recorded.

However, professional associations and organisations have been granted access to certain material on request. Lota-Cleveland Railway Line Mr Jull asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 8 September 1977: (1) Has he been approached by the Queensland Government concerning the re-establishment of the Lota-Cleveland railway Ibe; if so, when was this approach made. (2) If an approach was made, did the Queensland Government request financial assistance from the Commonwealth for the project; if not what assistance would be avail- Western Australia . . . . able should a future application be made. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Queensland Metropolitan Transit Authority wrote to my Department on 8 August 1977 seeking Commonwealth assistance for a feasibility study of a rail link extension from Lota to Redland Shire under the Transport (Planning and Research) Act. As yet I have not made decisions on the-planning and research program for Queensland for 1977-78. Approval of the programs will not be possible until the enabling legislation has been passed by the Parliament. Income Tax: Averaging Provisions Mr Abel asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 September 1977: (1) How many specific groups, other than primary producers, are able to take advantage of the averaging provisions within the Income Tax Assessment Act and what are the groups. (2) Have professional actors and entertainers been excluded from taking advantage of these provisions; if so, why. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The averaging provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act are applicable only in respect of income derived by a person who carries on in Australia a business of primary production. It foUows that the provisions are not available either to professional actors and entertainers or to other classes of taxpayers. There are, however, special 'anti-bunching' provisions applicable to authors and inventors. The question of extending these latter provisions, or the averaging provisions themselves, to other classes of persons with variable incomes has been examined many times over the years but successive Governments have seen fit not to propose any such extension. Hospital Benefit Insurance: Government Subsidy (Question No. 1508) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 15 September 1977: (1) What is the Government subsidy per contributor in each State for'hospital only'insurance. (2) What is the method of calculating this amount.",81
191,Mr HUNT,COPQ LIBRARY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The maximum weekly amounts of the Government subsidy per contributor in each State for 'hospital only' (Question No. 1408) insurance are referred to in section 82AA of the National Health Act and are as follows: Single rate Family rate New South Wales . . . . 40c 75c Victoria 15c 35c Queensland 15c 30c South Australia 40c 75c 40c 75c Tasmania 15c 25c Northern Territory . . . 40c 75c The subsidy amounts payable in respect of individual organisations are the differences between the actual contribution rates for each organisation and rates of $1.30 a week (single) and $2.60 (family), subject to the above maximum subsidy amounts. (2) In my second reading speech on the National Health Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1976, {Hansard, 8 September 1976 pages 804-806) I indicated that it had onginaUy been esumated that persons otherwise covered by Standard Medibank would, if they wished to be attended by their own medical practitioners in a recognised (i.e. public) hospital, be (Question No. 1493) able to obtain standard hospital insurance cover for that purpose for about $2.60 a week at the family scale. I funher indicated that subsequently when the contribution rates for Medibank Private were being determined it became apparent that the family contribution rates for the standard hospital benefits tables in each State would exceed $2.60 a week. It seemed Ukely that this would be the case with most other major organisations. Because of its concern to keep the cost of this type of insurance within the reach of those with low to medium incomes, the Government decided to provide a subsidy to hold the single member and family member weekly contributions at $1.30 and $2.60 respectively. The maximum rates of Commonwealth subsidy were based on the difference between the rates of $1.30 (single) and $2.60 (family) and the actual contribution rates for the standard hospital benefits tables offered by Medibank Private in each State. Commonwealth Land at Broadmeadows: Mr Keith Johnson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative vices, upon notice, on 20 September 1977: (1) Has a decision been made to dispose of (a) the miliIndian-Pacific. tary camp and (b) the land previously occupied by the monwealth Serum Laboratories at Camp Road, Broadmeadows, Victoria. (2) If so, is it intended to dispose of these sites as one lot or will they be subdivided. (3) Will they be offered to the local council; if so, will generous terms be made available. (4) If it is not intended to dispose of the sites, are plans for the future use of the land. Mr Street-The Minister for Administrative twin Services has provided me with the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No decision has been made military camp or the land previously occupied by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The matter is under review to determine what additional land (if any) will by Defence from the former CSL area. Other Commonwealth requirements for portion of the former CSL area also being investigated. (2) Should any land become surplus to Commonwealth needs, the manner in which it will be disposed of will cided at that time. The Commonwealth does not normally sub-divide surplus land. (3) Government policy requires that land surplus to Commonwealth needs be offered to State and local government authorities, in that order; any sale to the local Council would be on a fair market value basis. (4) See(l) above. Indian-Pacific Train: Introduction of Television Mr FitzPatrick asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 22 September 1977: (1) Is it a fact that television, programs, is to be introduced on the Indian-Pacific passenger train.

(2) If not, when does he expect to able to provide this to dispose of either the information. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable be required member's question is as follows: (1) No. When examined shortly after the landing at Goulare burn no fault was found. Subsequently the engine was ground run then flight tested and no fault was found. (2) The investigation, which has been comprehensive and be dedetailed, is now nearing completion. I will advise the honourable member of the findings when I am in a position to do so. Northern Territory: Electricity Commission (Question No. 1678) Mr E. G.
