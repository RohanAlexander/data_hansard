1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Mr MILES,Unknown,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (9.32 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill gives effect to a request by the states and territories to alter their replacement payments for tobacco under the safety net arrangements. These arrangements were introduced at the states' request to protect their finances following the High Court decision of 5 August 1997 affecting state business franchise fees. Under the safety net, the Commonwealth uses its taxation power to collect, on the states' behalf, revenue that they previously collected by way of business franchise fees on petroleum products, tobacco and alcoholic beverages. The revenues so collected are returned to the states-after the deduction of Commonwealth administrative costs-as revenue replacement payments under the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The distributioI). of revenue replacement payments among the states and territories is in accordance with shares agreed among them and set out in a schedule to the act. The states and territories have asked the Commonwealth to adjust the shares for tobacco related payments at the earliest opportunity as part of new arrangements for the taxation of tobacco under the safety net involving a lower revenue target and a shift from a weight based surcharge to one based on both weight and value. Separate bills have been introduced dealing with the revenue side of these new arrangements. The bill also seeks authority for any future changes in the distribution of tobacco, petroleum or alcohol revenues to be prescribed by regulation. This will provide flexibility should the review of the safety net arrangements, to be conducted within six months, give rise to further requests by the states to alter the existing shares. Any such change would be implemented only at the states' request. Early passage of the bill will enable the Commonwealth to return tobacco collections to the states and territories on the basis of the new shares with minimum delay, assisting them to fund rebates for petroleum and alcohol-consistent with the objective of avoiding as far as possible price increases for these products. I present the explanatory memorandum for the bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Kelvin Thomshares of revenue son) adjourned.

3,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (9.35 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Capital gains tax roll-over relief for small businesses The bill proposes amendments to the income tax law in relation to capital gains tax roll-over relief for small business. These amendments were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 24 March 1997 as part of the government's response to the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. Specifically, the bill will extend the capital gains tax small business roll-over relief to the disposal of certain shares in companies and units in unit trusts. The roll-over relief measures currently allow capital gains on the disposal of active assets of a small business, where replacement active assets are acquired. These amendments will allow a capital gain on the sale of a business to be rolled over where this is done through the sale of shares or units. In addition, certain shares and units will be able to be nominated as replacement assets for the purposes of the provisions. Minor technical changes will also be made to the roll-over relief provisions to ensure they operate as originally intended. The extension of the roll-over relief to shares and units will apply to disposals of assets from 1 July 1997, which is also the date of effect for division 17 A. The technical amendments have various application dates. Amendment of the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 The amendments made to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 by schedule 2 of the bill will establish a new sales tax regime for suppliers of computers and related goods to combat sales tax fraud involving personal computers and related goods. The amendments have been developed following a successful period of consultation with the industry, sales tax practitioners and other interested parties. The government and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) have received numerous representations from business about the adverse effects that sales tax evasion is having in the industry. The impact is especially disadvantaging smaller legitimate operators who are often much less able to absorb the competitive disadvantage. A particularly worrying consequence of the fraud is that a large number of legitimate operators who claim their business survival is at risk are reluctantly being drawn into dealing with the fraudulent operators. In doing so they not only contribute to sustaining the fraud but also put themselves at serious risk of being a party to an offence. It is also apparent that a number of industry operators, while not directly involved in the commission of the fraud, are taking commercial advantage of the cheap source of supply. It is estimated that such fraudulent activity is costing the government approximately $80 million per year. Whilst that threat to the revenue is of concern to the government, the major concern is that fraudulent operators should not continue to enjoy a competitive advantage from failure to comply with the sales tax laws. The amendments contained in this bill will remove this competitive advantage and place all operators in an even position. Operators who can only compete on a fraudulent basis may be driven out of the industry. This is a result which the government would welcome. Given the entrenched nature of this fraudulent activity and that normal administrative action is not effective, it is considered that the most effective approach is to remove the opportunity for the fraud to be committed rather than rely on after the event enforcement action. The central feature of the new scheme is that access to tax-free personal computers and related goods (defined as part 7Agoods) will be denied to taxpayers who have not established, to the Commissioner's satisfaction, that they are likely to fulfil their obligations under the tax law. People who have established, by satisfying certain criteria, that they are likely to fulfil their taxation obligations will be accredited. Generally, only accredited people will be able to quote effectively, a procedure which allows them to purchase personal computer and related goods tax-free. The quote will also have to be authorised, a process designed to guard against the fraudulent use of accreditation numbers. If a person is accredited, that person will be able to carryon trading in much the same way as he or she has done in the past, and the person's sales tax obligations will remain the same, except for the extra requirement that the quote must be authorised and there will be some extra record-keeping and payment requirements. It is intended that authorisation will be available over the phone, so that it will not hinder trade unduly. Existing entitlements to end user exemptions will not be disturbed. However, accredited people will take on extra obligations when they buy goods from unaccredited people. As a safeguard against attempts to frustrate these measures, there will be a requirement on accredited purchasers who purchase tax-paid from unaccredited persons to withhold an amount, equivalent to the tax owing on the sale, from the purchase price and remit that amount to the commissioner. Certain entities, such as public benevolent institutions, will be exempted from the requirement for accreditation. If necessary, the withholding requirement will be extended to retailers who purchase goods from unaccredited wholesalers. This extension of the withholding arrangements retailers will only come into effect if a review of the operation of the new regime indicates that such an extension is necessary. This is not the first occasion on which tices. serious sales tax fraud has occurred. In past similar problems have arisen in relation to other goods including motor vehicles, video cassette recorders, amusement machines, and stereo equipment. The amendments have been developed to provide a general strengthening of the law to counter evasion. The scheme is project. designed to be flexible enough to apply to other goods if serious evasion is uncovered in other industries. Land transport facilities Another measure in the bill contains the legislative rules for the new infrastructure borrowings tax rebate that was foreshadowed in the last budget. Resident lenders to new public road and rail infrastructure projects which are approved by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development against specified criteria may qualify for a tax rebate on their interest income at the general company rate of tax. To the extent that the lender's interest is rebateable, borrower will be denied a deduction in respect of interest payable on the borrowing. The rebate applies only for the first five years an eligible project's borrowings. As a transitional measure, the rebate scheme is also open to infrastructure projects which were eligible under the infrastructure borrowings tax concession which terminated on 14 February 1997. Projects which had applied to the Development Allowance Authority by 14 February 1997, and extensions of projects which had received certification, may qualify under the transitional rule. In addition, projects certified after the cessation of the previous concession may apply for approval. Removal of exemption of the Commonwealth Rebate for apprenticeships full-time training (CRAFT) scheme payment The bill removes the tax exemption of amounts payable to employers under the Commonwealth rebate for apprenticeships full-time training (CRAFT) scheme in respect of apprentices who commence their training to on or after 1 January 1998. The tax exemption is being replaced with a budget outlay to . support employers of new Australian qualification framework level 3 and level 4 apprenthe Minor te-hnical and drafting corrections Finally, Mr Speaker, schedules 5 to 11 contain a range of minor technical and drafting corrections and presentational improvements arising from the rewrite of the income tax laws under the tax law improvement I present the explanatory memorandum and I commend the bill to the House.

9,Ms ELLIS,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"1 appreciate the opportunity to conclude my comments from the previous day. I would like to highlight my major objections to the government's plans in the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 as they will affect the childcare system as we know it in Australia. I NA strongly condemn the government for its cuts of $820 million to child care over the past two budgets. These cuts have led to fee increases of up to $20 and more per child per week, lower quality child care, the closure of services and job losses within the child-care sector, changes which are forcing people to stop working. As I have said in my previous comments in this debate, it is absolute fact, from talking to constituents in my electorate and in my community generally, that families are now being forced into the position where they have to make a choice: which one of a twoparent family can maintain employment, given the overriding increases in child-care costs? It is no longer an economic reality for them to be able to maintain that employment. It is forcing mainly women out of the work force-something that I deplore and find hard to take, given this government's stance that it has a proud record on women's affairs. People are being forced to take their children out of child care. As I have said previously, we now have a situation where some people ill-advisedly are relying on non-accredited or non-professional child care. I also feel very strongly about the decision by the government to cap child-care assistance to 50 hours and to limit emergency child-care assistance to four weeks in any 12month period. Emergency child-care assistance is paid to the operator of a child-care service when they believe that a child is at risk. A child is considered to be at risk if at risk of physical, emotional or psychological provide abuse. The operator of a child-care service can apply for that emergency child-care assistance. The payment is for up to four weeks and can be paid only once during a 12month period. I do not understand why children in emergency care should not be able to get far more than four weeks emergency child-care assistance in anyone year. I do not see why children in emergency situations have to suffer because of this government being hell-bent on cutting money from child care. The 50-hour limit for each week of work related care imposed through the guidelines is now enshrined in legislation. I deplore that decision as well. There are some parts of this country-maybe not in my electorate in the ACT, where people are fairly geographically close to most work employment bases-where working parents have to commute quite a distance between home, the area in which a child could be in child care and their employment base. The Central Coast, Liverpool or Campbelltown in New South Wales, Adelaide Hills in South Australia, or the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne-these are areas where it is not a long bow to draw to conclude that families need to have quite a bit of commuting time outside of their employment hours. To limit child-care assistance to 50 hours a week really puts a constraint on families who need additional time to commute between the child-care centre, the employment base and home. It is another example of the mean-mindedness of this government. The government's Child Care Payments Bill 1997 has added more pressures to child-care services on top of last year's budget cuts, which are already hitting families with fee increases of $20 and more. The changes are forcing people to stop work, others to take their children out of child care, and some families are being forced to rely-ill-advisedly, as I see ii-on backyard or non-professional care. The National Association of Community Based Children's Services, as I have already said and want to highlight again, has said that 67 per cent of families have left centres and have been using informal care since the changes of the last budget relating to community based services came into effect. There is absolutely no reason for us to believe other than that a similar example will occur when these additional changes come in. The federal government cuts are sending the child-care industry in this country back to the dark ages of unaccredited, low quality care. This is a direct result of this federal government cutting $820 million from the child-care sector over the past two budgets. I feel very strongly for the women in the community and in my electorate in respect of the dramatic improvements over the past few years to child-care provision in this country. What we had was a highly regarded professional system of optional care. We now have . the situation where child-care places are being limited; child-care fees are being forced up; flexibility is being removed; out of school hours care'is now under threat; and children in emergency situations are now going to have limits in terms of what sort of additional care they can get. I know what this government has in mind, and the women and the families in my electorate are starting to tell me what they see it has in mind. It wants to bring employment rates down, force people generally but particularly women out of the work force, and reduce access to child care in this country in a most deplorable fashion. Women, families and children in our community deserve nothing less than access to flexible, optional child care to suit their needs-whatever they may be and for whatever reason they exist. This government is engineering changes to such a degree that optional, flexible access to child care is now totally and absolutely under threat. I deplore the government's bill. I strongly support the amendment. I encourage all of those members opposite-particularly the female members-to get behind us and to consider very carefully what they are supporting when they support the government's initiatives in these bills.",18
10,Mr MAREK,SENATE,"Capricornia) (10.08 a.m.)Firstly, I would like to congratulate the former Minister for Family Services for her comprehensive restructure of the child-care industry. Although there are some who would disagree with my compliments, as per the last speaker, the honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis), I believe that the former minister has done a great job to curtail excessive waste and duplication in the industry and, at the same time, provide the means for a full range of appropriate child-care services which can be allocated, including exemptions for certain low income families who require the provision of additional care. As a result of the funding changes to community based long day care centres implemented in the May budget, I have received a number of submissions from concerned parents and centre operators who claim that these centres have to increase their prices to make up for the loss of government subsidy. As a result of these claims, I held a meeting with the community based long day care centre directors in my electorate to discuss the changes and how they would impact on the centres. During these discussions, everyone of the representatives from the community based centres told me that they would have to increase prices by a minimum of $20 a week and, in some instances, more. But all of these community based centres were already charging per week at least the same as or more than the private child-care centres in my electorate. With the increases, the community based centres are pricing themselves out of the market with fees of up to $200 per week in some instances, which is $20 or $30 more than private centres are charging. I have visited both private and community based centres in my electorate and I cannot find any material differences in their operations that would require one sector to charge 10 per cent to 15 per cent more for the same service. When I spoke to some private child-care centre operators, they told me that they fully meet all accreditation standards at their facilities, provide the same level of service community based centres and still make a profit. These private centres have the latest toys, the best equipment, clean and tidy premises and efficient, qualified staff, yet the community based centres are struggling to make ends meet with increased prices. The question must be asked: why? One of the reasons for the differences, as I see it, is that the community based centres are not running their centres as a business but more as a bureaucracy where every job has a demarcation line and no-one steps over it. If a light bulb needs changing, they will call in an electrician. If the grass needs cutting, they will bring in a professional cutting serviceall at cost. Mr Laurie Ferguson-You could do it for them.",19
11,Mr MAREK,SENATE,"Most certainly. I would not have a problem with that. The private centre operators do these things themselves to keep the costs down. I have tried to convince some community based centre directors to do the same thing. All I received was a lot of abuse and was told, 'You don't know what you're talking about.' That is interesting. They are wrong. We have had a very close look at it and, for what it is worth, demarcation is the problem. The private centre operators need to get stuck into this so that they can bring the child-care centre prices down. 'You cannot expect every child-care worker to do that,' was their reply. Well, I do expect them to muck in when necessary or even to have a parent roster where some of these duties can be conducted without cost. After all, they are meant to be community based child-care centres, which means that the community using the facility should provide some voluntary help similar to the school P&Cs. That way the additional costs can be kept to a minimum. Basically, the operations that were introduced by Labor were nothing more than that good old socialist welfare mentality where the government pays for the lot and nobody mucks into help. That is where the problems have come from. But some of these community based child-care centres believe it is as their right to fully charge the taxpayer for all and sundry. As I said, it is typical socialist welfare mentality. Some private centre operators have contacted my office, concerned about the money being provided by the taxpayer to upgrade community based child-care centres in my electorate. While I appreciate the former minister's initiative to fund these upgrades to bring them up to scratch before the subsidies cease, most private operators say that they have to fund any upgrades they make from their takings and then they ask why the community based child-care centres cannot do the same. It will come as no surprise to learn that a lot of these community based centres are in dire need of upgrading. Whether it be a coat of paint, protective railings or extensions of facilities, it shows that these centres have not spent any money on improvements and have continually waited for the government to provide the necessary funding. So when you look at it, they have been getting all the taxpayers' dollars, the same amount of money, or more, than the private ones and they are providing a service of a lesser standard. One must ask the question once again: why? If the private centres can meet the cost, the community based centres should be required to do the same, which I am sure will be the case once this funding round has been completed. One of the newest community based childcare centres in my electorate, built 12 months ago from Commonwealth funding, made an operating loss of $160,000 last year. With a cut in subsidy funding this year of around $50,000, the centre is facing a $200,000 shortfall. The local council is seriously considering its options because it cannot afford to subsidise this amount of money. It is absolutely ludicrous. This could find the centre closing its doors or raising its fees to a prohibitive amount just to survive. Again, the question has to be asked: why? When the centre was originally planned it was anticipated that more families would use the centre than had been the case. But, before this centre was built, a private centre was opened and this took some of the potential custom. However, rather than cut back on staff and services according to the need, they continued to provide a service over and above what was required. This is not good business sense and, if it was not for the private centre, the owner would have folded or rather would not have continued to have provided a service beyond the centre's means, which is plain business common sense. It would appear that when you are spending taxpayers' money it does not matter; there is plenty more where that comes from. But that is not the case anymore. Community based centres will have to run their operations like a business and be 'responsible to their shareholders, the families that use the centre. If they do not, then they will not be able to compete and they will either lose money or close, or they will have to put their prices up so high that they will lose custom as a result. Following the cuts to the operational subsidy, three community based centres in my electorate jointly took out half-page advertisements in the local newspaper saying 'Free child care for one week'. The headline is crazy. Taxpayers paid for the local advertising as well. The offer of free child care for one week was essentially to attract new customers to the community based child-care centres. However, this is illegal under the act. Section 8.3.2 states: Same fee for same service. All users must be charged the same level of fee for the same type of care. In section 8.3.4, 'Discounted fees', it says: Services may offer discounted fees as long as all families using the service are offered the same 'discount rate, all families have the opportunity to pay the same fee for the same type of service and discounted fees are advertised to all families. Yet strangely enough the directors of these community based long day care centres took no notice of these rules and regulations and went ahead with the advert. After my office fielded a number of complaints from private centre operators, who were the only ones who would lose their customers, I took the matter up with the council which is responsible for these centres. Even though the council agreed the advert was illegal, in accordance with the act, the council could not convince the directors of these centres, who argued they were doing nothing wrong and did not want to withdraw the advert. Fortunately common sense prevailed and all the advertising was withdrawn by the council, as well as the discount offer. But this situation and other issues that I have raised here make me wonder what type of people we have running these centres. I compliment the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) for allowing disadvantaged areas access to funding, as these centres are often the only ones in the community and they would find it difficult to raise the fees in these disadvantaged areas. I am talking about areas like Middlemount, Moranbah, Clermont and all those sorts of places in Central Queensland where they do need the benefit of the Commonwealth funding and fall into the criteria. If they do fall into the criteria, then they should get it. . I also compliment the minister for providing exemption for families of disabled children from the 20-hour week for non-work related subsidised child care. This section of the community do find it hard to manage when they have other children to care for, so it is change that will certainly assist these people to continue to access the level of service they require. I now tum to another issue which, as far as I am concerned, affects all young people throughout this country. A survey on juvenile delinquency taken by the Morning Bulletin, a reputable regional newspaper in Central Queensland, indicated that a considerable number of people want harsher penalties for juvenile crime. The message was that governments need to get tougherMrs Crosio-Where does juvenile crime fit in with child care?",20
12,Mr MAREK,SENATE,"You will have your tum. Parents must regain control of their children. It is absolutely imperative that government gives parents the ability to discipline and control of their children. Parents must be able to police their own youth without hindrance from government and bureaucracy. Finally, I commend the bill to the House.",22
13,Mrs CROSIO,SENATE,"I must say that the electorate at large of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), must be overwhelmed by the type of nonsense we have just heard him comment in this House today. I feel sure that child-care workers and parents in that electorate will be only too pleased to receive a copy of that speech in the mail! In speaking in the cognate debate on child care today, I would like to bring to the attention of the House that in electorates like mine across Australia, particularly those areas that are heavily populated by families of lower and middle incomes, the public child-care system is today, under this government, quite simply in crisis-a crisis from which there appears to be no respite and no end. It is a crisis for which the blame can be laid fairly and squarely at the feet of the Howard government and the woefully inadequate and ill-equipped previous Minister for Family Services, the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan). It is a crisis brought about by this government, which has no understanding of how its ideologically driven plans for the child-care sector are actually being felt in a practice by thousands of struggling Australian families. The legislation we are debating here today is just another indication that this government remains oblivious to the damage it is causing among thousands of those struggling families. This is a government and a Prime Minister which supposedly stand for choice in child care. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said just before the last election: We are going to provide people with greater choice aboutlhe caring arrangements for their young children ... it's the role of the Government to facilitate choice. Now, that's the policy, that's the philosophy, the attitude, the approach. Yet for hundreds of families, for hundreds of parents in my electorate and throughout western Sydney, there is increasingly but one choice thanks to this government: pull your take kids out of child care. The Prime Minister said in 1995: We have long accepted in the Coalition that the provision of adequate, affordable, available childcare facilities ought to be part and parcel of the armoury of facilities and policies that are available for both. men and women in Australian society in the 1990s. Does the honourable member for Capricornia remember that quote? Yet in areas like mine the Prime Minister, now in power, is slowly dragging adequate, affordable and available child care out of the reach of lower and middle income families. I am not being alarmist. I am not overdramatising the situation. This is the predicament on the ground in my electorate and others like mine. I know that the same pain is being felt right across the entire country. We all know because it is an established fact that, as a result of the Howard government's c.uts to the community based child-care sector of over $820 million, ly all centres were forced to increase their fees and reduce the amount of services they offered in order to survive. The consumer price index figures released in June of this year showed child-care and education costs had gone up nationally by 6.3 per cent in the previous 12 months. The National Association of Community Based Children's Services has stated that community child-care centres increased their fees by an average of $18 per week after their operational subsidies were taken away. A survey conducted by the Australian Services Union in May and June of this year found that over 70 per cent of the 21 councils it contacted in Melbourne, for example, had increased their fees or planned to do so by 1 July this year. Fee increases were planned to be in the range of $7 to $30 per child per week. It is the same story all over Australia. In my electorate, and in those centres just outside my boundaries which are populated by many children who live within my electorate, weekly fees rocketed by over $40 per week per child in some cases. It has reached the ridiculous situation where parents sending their children to exclusive private schools are paying less money per year than those parents sending a child to community based care. Parents are now spending over $8,500 a year to have their child receive community based care in my electorate. But you send a child to an exclusive primary school such as Loreto at Kirribilli, just up the road from the Prime Minister's house, and you are looking at around $3,500 per year in fees. I think, and those in the House would agree with me, that this situation is just slightly ridiculous. As a result of such increases many lower and middle income families have found childcare fees completely beyond their reach and have been forced into withdrawing their children from care. A survey of over 1,000 community care centres by the National Association of Community Based Children's Services shows quite clearly that more than 4,000 families across Australia have withdrawn children from long day care or have dramatically reduced their hours in care over virtualthe last three months. As was predicted 18 months ago by us, parents who have withdrawn their children from care or who have greatly reduced the amount of time in care are leaving them in backyard childminding operations. Sixty-seven per cent of parents now leaving the community based child-care sector are making or have made arrangements to place their child in informal care-unregulated and unaccredited care. These operations are little more than rudimentary childminding services. There is no actual child care to speak of. In these operations the ratio of children to child supervisor is often completely unacceptable. The supervisors themselves often have no experience or background in caring for children. In my community there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that parents are taking, or have taken, their children from community based centres and are leaving them with outof-work young people-many of whom have only recently left school themselves and who are on unemployment benefits-and paying them around $80 per week to keep their child under supervision. These young people are often virtually children themselves, having just left the education system. They have not received certification or accreditation for their child-care skills. They have no concept of the importance of professional child care in the development of an infant. Parents in desperation have been forced into these arrangements and the only losers will be the kids. The devastating effects of poor quality child care have been well documented. Whether it be through abuse or neglect, untrained staff controlling children with punishment rather than effective programs, inadequate nutrition, dangerous play areas, high stress levels among staff or a high staff turnover, poor quality child care can do permanent and substantial damage to a child. Damage can include poor emotional, social and language development in the child, aggression, depression, inferior health and an inability to form close and long lasting attachments. One need only consider the exhaustive .27year study carried out by the American sociologist Dr David Weikart which found that children who had attended safe and caring preschools developed into adults who committed less crime, earned more money and were able to commit to relationships more easily. He also found that every dollar spent on high quality child care saved approximately $7 in juvenile delinquency costs. Dr Weikart said, and this should be of interest to the Minister for Family Services today: Do we pay for long-term social costs that result from poor-quality child care, or pay now for a children's-services program that will ensure quality outcomes with reduced social problems in the future. This government, in creating an environment where parents are being forced into choosing inferior care for their children, and in putting forward bills such as the one before the House today, is quite literally gambling with the health and welfare of the next generation of Australians. And it is not just the safety and health of those children under five for whom we should be concerned. The previous budget and this bill launches an all-out assault on outside of school hours child care, which caters for children aged between five and 12 years. As with community based care centres, operational subsidies for outside of school hours child-care operations are to be abolished. The flow-on from this is that many of those parents unable to pay the extra fees demanded of them will have to either leave work early in order to care for their child personally or allow them to look after themselves-alone in the house and perhaps caring for another brother or sister-until either mum or dad can make it home. We are now retuning to the latchkey kid syndrome. A survey conducted in May last year found that 22 per cent of Australian children under the age of 12 with working parents were already being left at home alone both before and after school. Following the Howard government's cuts to outside of school hours care, that number is bound to increase. In areas like mine where parents do not have the disposable income to accommodate a $30 to $40 per child per week increase for outside of school hours care, we are going to see an explosion in the number of latchkey kids when these cuts come into effect. And if children are not being left in backyard childrninding operations, if they are not being left alone at home to fend for themselves, it is their parents-invariably the mothers-who are now reducing their hours of work or dropping out of work completely in order to care for their children themselves. So much for the Prime Minister's choice. I am meeting women regularly in my electorate who have either substantially reduced their working hours or have dropped out of work completely because of the prohibitive cost of child care. Perhaps the results of such a drop-off of women from the workplace are already being seen. The number of women in full-time employment fell by 23,000 in June of this year whilst the number of women in part-time work went up by 20,000. Of course, I do not suggest that the spiralling child-care costs are the sole cause of such figures, but at the same time we cannot-discount them as a contributing factor. But don't expect this Prime Minister to raise a finger to stop women leaving their jobs under duress and staying at home to care for their kids. Since coming to power, the Prime Minister's stance on a number of policy issues has exposed him as being completely out of touch with Australian women and their needs in the 1990s. More than out of touch, the Prime Minister's agenda has been consistently anti-women. We have a Prime Minister whose vision of the perfect woman is trapped somewhere between a TV margarine advertisement and Her Majesty. Judging by the way his child-care policies are shoehorning women out of their jobs and back into their homes, a woman's primary role, in the Prime Minister's eyes, should be that of a housewife-I won't go so far as to say barefoot and pregnant, but certainly in a pair of sensible shoes and in a nice floral number, with a stiff drink or a cold beer in her hand when hubby comes home after a hard day at the office. The Prime Minister sees the child-care industry developed by Labor as catering for minority special interests. When did looking after women's concerns become catering for minority special interests? He sees child care as pandering to the demands of the feminist elite rather than simply assisting women achieve workplace equality and social manoeuvrability. And don't think I am being partisan in my criticism. What did Avril Henry have to say? Ms Henry, in case members are not aware, was nominated in both 1995 and 1996 for the Telstra Businesswoman of the Year Award. She is currently the Director of Human Resources, Asia-Pacific Region, for the DMR Consulting Group and one of Australia's leading women business figures. Ms Henry said about the government's changes to child care, of which this bill is part: I think the new government is just seeking ways incent women to stay at home. And throughout it all one thing stands brilliantly clear. For all the women on the other side of the House who have crowed about their numbers since coming to power, they have proven themselves powerless to stop their Prime Minister in regards to child care; and that just goes to prove my point. He doesn't listen to women or their concernswhether they be a minister of the Crown, a backbencher or an average suburban mum. The Prime Minister doesn't know what women need from their government and what issues concern them. I know this must be extremely galling for members like the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) or even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), who is at the table, who I believe deep down perhaps have a greater understanding of what is at stake here. But, no matter how much they try to reach him to convince him, the Prime Minister remains oblivious to their concerns. As children are being wrenched out of our community child-care centres in their droves, whether they are being placed into backyard care operations or whether they are remaining at home with a parent, the result is that community based child-care centres are in many cases now suffering enormous numbers of vacancies, and this carries with it very serious consequences. Enormous numbers of vacancies mean less money coming into keep the service running, less money for staff wages and less money for special services such as nappies, hot food and bed linen. Less money in community based centres means closure. In my electorate, vacancies at community based child-care centres are now running at an all-time high. Whereas before the fee increase a community based centre would have an average of close to 300 kids coming through its doors each week, some of them now are struggling to maintain over 100 regular childcare attendees. Their waiting lists, it is hardly surprising, are now a thing of the past. And those kids who are coming in are staying for to shorter periods. Whereas prior to fee increases children would attend child care for between three and five days, now most parents are bringing their kids along for only one or two days at the most. In fact, in my electorate there are enough vacancies, with parents withdrawing their children from community based centres, for the council to close at least two of its operations down. Thankfully, due to the professionalism of the child-care staff and the support of the parents, new arrangements have now been drawn up to try to keep the centres which are currently operating open. But this is being done at a cost. While centres will continue to function, the pay-off is that permanent staff hours have been reduced and casual staff have been laid off. Those special services which I mentioned before, such as nappies, hot food and bed linen, have either been drastically curtailed or completely stopped. I must commend those in charge of coordinating the community based child-care centres in my electorate. The deal they have brokered with the parents in order to stop the centres closing down is as balanced as was humanly possible under the circumstances. But I still hold grave fears for the future of community based child care in my community. I know that elsewhere in western Sydney community based centres have already closed down because of unfillable vacancies. If public child-care centres in my electorate continue to shed children at current rates, it will only be a matter of time before closures become unavoidable. In the broader community, 'and particularly in the Prospect electorate, we will be the loser. The strain of the government's attack on child care and families has already seen the demotion of the previous Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan). All I can say is that we now have her political scalp, which I don't cherish. But, considering the state of the public child-care system in this country, we can ill afford another bumbling deadweight for a minister sitting on the front bench handling that portfolio when we need action now to remedy the mistakes that this government has made in the last 18 months. If the member for Hindmarsh, the member for Moncrieff, the member for Adelaide, the parliamentary secretary, or one of the other senior backbench women figures on the government benches could do a better job than the current Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith), and I believe they can, then for goodness sake the Prime Minister needs to be convinced to get somebody in that portfolio who is able to protect the children in this country and also return those millions of dollars worth of funding to the sector. They should stop taking what is now being dished out to them, and I stress that they should act now. With measures such as the ones presently before the House, the Howard government is plunging public child care further and further into crisis. Australia once had an internationally admired and unique child-care system of which it could be proud. Now it appears we are on the way to a second rate system which divides child care between the haves and the have-nots a la the USA or the United Kingdom system. According to the bankrupt ideology of the Liberal and National parties, we should be aiming for more choice in child care, but only for people who can afford it. If you cannot afford to pay for extra choice, you quite simply have little or no choice at all. In relation to child care, little or no choice spells the end of community based care for many parents in my area. Government members should really try visiting some of the less privileged areas of Australia to find out just how their ideology of 'more choice'-their words-is affecting child care. They would then realise that for many of these people 'more choice' is simply empty lip-service which does not translate into equality or reality. The only choice many of the parents in. my electorate have is between leaving work to care for their kids, taking up a second job to pay for higher fees or leaving them with some shonky backyard operation down the road where heaven knows what happens to their kids during the day. Is this what we want? Is this what this government is pretending is the choice? The government inherited a public childcare system second to none. The fact that it now stands on the brink of disaster is one of the greatest tragedies of this administration in its first 18 months in power. I, for one, do not thank them for it. When you talk to the communities, the parents, the people and the very efficient staff who are running these centres, they too do not thank this government. The promises that were given prior to the election are not even worth the paper on which they were written. The Prime Minister, when Leader of the Opposition, made all of these idle promises, and all we have now in government is the rhetoric for which they were worth. The kids are not going to suffer continually under this government because, come the next election, the parents, their children and the staff administering the centres are not going to be there to say, 'Thank you, Prime Minister.' The parents and staff will record their disgust in the ballot box. I condemn the government for the type of action it is taking and for the mean way by which it believes it can put cuts into budgets without even explaining to the people what it really means at the end of the day. The kids are the ones we should be looking after. As I have said in my speech, they are the future generation of this country and they are the ones that we should be protecting. I condemn the government for this.  to support the child-care payments legislation second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and, indeed, to endorse the remarks made by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) in her contribution to the debate. Before I tum to her remarks, I want to comment on the remarks made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), who saw this legislation as involving a matter of parental disciplining and the rights of parents over children. Indeed, the honourable member is a member of the backbench commi.ttee that promised so much change in the chIld support area but has delivered so little. I just say to the House that I am looking forward to debating with the honourable member on 9 November in Brisbane child support issues and the lack of progress by the government in implementing reform. Perhaps it is uncharitable of me to draw to the attention of the House that no government has been returned with as many women members amongst its ranks as the Howard government. Without being mealy-mouthed about it, I wish to congratulate them on that. I could offer qualifications but that would only detract from the sentiment that I wish to express. Perhaps it is unfair to all those new - omen .members to point out how singularly meffectIve they have been in this whole family services area-the absolute shemozzle that the nursing home accommodation bonds represent, the absolute bashing of the elderly, who so strongly supported the election of the Howard government. And here we are debating another similar issue. The honourable member for Prospect repeatedly pointed (lut the promise of the - rime Minister (Mr Howard), when in oppositIOn, that he would be offering more choice. But really I think the people of Australia cannot get away from the idea that the government, particularly the Prime Minister is obsessed with a stereotype family, that is: a famil- that lives in a house with a picket fence WIth the husband at work and the wife at home minding the children. The government has no conception whatsoever of the nec-s.sity in today's society for so many - amlltes to have both parents earning an mcome and contributing to the family. In my electorate, as, I am sure is the case in the honourable 'member for Prospect's, I serve two local government areas, Blacktown and Penrith. It is said that the number of child-care centres in those two local government areas are in fact the highest in Australia. Why is that so? Because we have a lot of young families moving in, setting up their homes or buying their first homes in these electorates. To pay mortgages in this day and age out in the western suburbs of Sydney overwhelmingly means that you need both p-r-nts working. Child care is absolutely cnttcal to women being able to return to the workplace. There has been a whole revolution in the roles of women in society in the past 20 years, which I think we should be proud of. Re-lly, there is nothing that they cannot aspIre to by way of an occupation and a career. I, for one, rejoice in that; I think it is terrific. But being able to have the security of the knowledge that, whilst they are in the work !orce, their children are receiving proper attentIOn and proper care is absolutely fundamental to - hat. It is true that in the community based chIld-care centres the operational subsidy has been cut out. For those many child-care centres in both the Blacktown and P-nrith LGAs, the councils have made up the dIfference-and congratulations to them-but it has still meant that there have been fee increases. Of course, where they are not counci--run child-care centres, the parents have pIcked up the full measure of the first tranche of the slashing of child care-that is the $820 million that the Howard government has ripped out of child care and forced parents to pick up. There is that issue. The second issue is that even though Penrith and Blacktown are stili - ncreasing dramatically in size, so that there IS a requirement for even more child care places, this government is reducing the number of new chi.ld-care places-7,000 per year. One of the thmgs we were very proud of in our term of government was that the number of child-care places increased dramaticallyby some 500 per cent. What did that mean? It meant that the government was offering women choices about being in the work force or not being in the work force, bearing in mind that for many families it is not a matter of choice. Like the honourable member for Prospect, I am noticing that children are being withdrawn from child-care centres and, because opting completely out of the work force is not an option, they are being placed with people who do not have the training, the skills or the accreditation to look after them. This government is always happy to characterise people who are unemployed as dole bludgers. It has put in place a horrific work for the dole scheme. It is very happy to light on single parents and say that they should be getting them back into the work force. Under us, the percentage of single parents in employment was pretty healthy-about five per cent below the intact family percentage, I think, from memory. Increasingly these people are going to find it difficult to get into the work force, to get into employment. People have told me in my office that they are now going to be faced, after getting into the work force and paying for the increased child-care fees, with being significantly worse off financially. The family income is being sacrificed to get back into the work force. That is a ridiculous situation. The problem is not confin-d just to that sort of situation. We all know that the Howard government is shedding full-time jobs at the rate of knots and replacing them with part-time jobs. You will find that the occasional care centres are often an attractive proposition for those who are in part-time employment. They do not want child care for the whole week. They may only want one or two days a week. This is where occasional care centres can playa very useful role. I am very proud to have been associated with Gumnut Grove Child.Care Centre. I saw it develop out of the John Armitage Centre, where it started. We were able to get premises for it not very far from my office. A group of ordinary women are on the management committee of this child-care centre, and the patronage is dramatically falling off. They cannot continue without support. I noticed that the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) was here a moment ago. I called his officials to a meeting of the Gumnut Grove Child Care Centre. I suggested that it was ludicrous to see this community based centre go out of business. The department could not make any offers of assistance to keep it running. Probably the only solution to the centre's problems is for Blacktown Council to take it over, because of all the changes that have been made by this Howard government. Occasional care is very attractive for people who are not in the work force but who want a bit of a break from their kids when they go shopping or have a day off. One of the things we are not very good at is giving families a bit of respite from their kids. We give respite care to parents of disabled kids, and I certainly support and encourage that. But, in terms of strengthening the family unit, giving mothers-in the main, or the caring parentsan occasional break from their children's constant need for attention is very good for both the parents and the children. This is the other point. These parents can only use occasional care, so putting the bite on occasional care does not strengthen family units. It puts them under more stress. And this is the type of family that the Howard government is obsessed with: that is, the family where one of the parents is working and the second parent is at home. This is the so-called 'ideal model' of the Liberal family. You will hear them-the member for Capricornia, for example-getting up and extolling the virtues of this type of family. I am not so judgmental about it. Bt:t even these so-called ideal families are victims of the pressure that has been put on and the possible forced closure of occasional child care. And then there is out of school hours care-before and after school hours-where the operating subsidy has been removed. There are several of these child-care centres in my electorate, and I am convinced that by the end of the year we are not going to see the same number operating. They are going to go out of business. What does that mean? It means that you are going to see an increasing incidence of so called 'latchkey children': that is, children who go to school and go home and,· when they go home, there is no-one at home to look after them. Parents will go through the trauma of worrying about home invasions and about whether or not their child has gone directly home. Is this the sort of family life that Mr ard envisaged when he said he wanted Australians to feel comfortable? With parents being forced increasingly into having their children as latchkey children, can they be comfortable? Or is this a condition that is specially set out for working-class suburbs like the electorates of Lindsay or Chifley or the electorate of the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). Is this special medicine for us for having a Liberal government? Certainly every member on this side of the chamber has had a reaction to these child-care measures now being introduced by the Howard government. But, because the changes actually have not been implemented, the tidal wave of change has yet to hit. I sincerely hope that the Minister for Family Services, who is at the table, .has learned something from the fiasco of the accommodation bonds. I see that he is deferring the implementation of these measures until April. If he is, I welcome that. But he has got himself into one black hole; let me warn him that child care is a second black hole. I want to conclude on this point: as a federal member, privileged to be in this place, I have always been obsessed about education. Out in the western suburbs of Sydney, the level and degree of education that you get often predetermines your life chances. I have always believed that the children in my electorate are every bit as good as children in any other electorate. But I do say this: I think children are advantaged-in terms of their social skills and their learning-by having the experience of attending child care. I believe it gives them a great introduction for their entry into kindergarten. It may be of utterly no concern to government members that they have ripped out this $800 million from child care in their first budget and that they propose to rip out another $200 million in their second budget. It may be of no concern to them that people are being forced out of proper child care. But the diminishing opportunities for child care, particularly for those of us in the western suburbs of Sydney, mean that, again, our children are getting a second-rate chance at life. They need a pretty good escalator for How- their introduction into kindergarten, into schooling-it does not matter whether it is long day care or occasional care; it is out of school care if they are already at school. Long day care and occasional care not only give children a great opportunity to socialise, develop their motor skills and learn but also give them a fabulous introduction into kindergarten. The children who go to occasional day care centres in my electorate get those benefits. There is also a great deal of liaison between the child-care centre and the primary school the children are going to. Instead of a child fronting up to the school with an unknown personality or characteristics, the school gets a good and professional breakdown of the child. What a great way to start school. This government is denying people out in my electorate the opportunity to send their children to child care. How ridiculous that now, under the Howard Liberal government, it can cost more to send your child to child care than it does to send them to a posh private school. It is absolutely ridiculous-and this is for families who are very dependent on the second income. In my electorate I have a lot of Filipinos, and I am grateful about that. I think they are wonderful people. They are great homemakers, obsessive homemakers. They cannot wait to get into a home and start paying it off very quickly. But you will always find that both parents contribute to this great task by working. This group of people think what a wonderful country Australia is. In this country they have the opportunity to acquire a home which would be beyond their wildest dreams in the Philippines. Yet what are we doing to these families when they want to use child care? We are pricing child care beyond their reach. Again, I say to the minister: you did not develop this policy. Do not fall for the same mistakes you did with the accommodation bond issue. Start to learn what the implications of this really are. If you want to come to my electorate, I will be happy to sit you down-not set you up-so that you can talk to those at the child-care centres and to some of the parents. You will then understand first hand the imposition, the pressure, this is placing on families in a western suburbs electorate. Far from helping children, far from helping families, you are putting a huge burden on them.",22
14,Mr OCONNOR,SENATE,"Corio) (10.58 a.m.)May I once again congratulate the member for  tion to debate in this chamber. What he has had to say has been echoed by other members on this side of the House who are extremely concerned about the adverse effects this legislation will have on the ability of working families to access child care. I must say that I feel sorry for the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith), who is now at the dispatch box. We on this side of the House regard him rather highly, and it is rather disappointing to see the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) once again handing him a really bad sandwich. He really got the short end of the stick when the Prime Minister said, 'Look, you take responsibility for our hopeless, inadequate and devastating nursing homes policy.' Now he has been given responsibility by the coalition government for the carriage of another area of bad policy. This legislation continues the Americanisation of the Australian policy landscape. The regrettable thing about the Prime Minister that we have leading this country at the moment is that he is bereft of any original Australian framework that develops Australian responses to Australian conditions. We have seen the Americanisation of the industrial relations debate, the Americanisation of the health debate and the Americanisation of the provision of public services. In the child-care area the objectives of the government are to drive out of the sector those important community child-care centres that deliver quality, accredbered ited child care to working families and to encourage the proliferation of private childcare centres in high socio-economic areas where they can chase the money and the profits. I am very proud to stand in this chamber and state the achievements of previous Labor governments in the child-care area. A lot has been said by members of the government in criticising the previous Labor government's achievement in the child-care area. I could not enter this debate without challenging some of the rather wild and inaccurate statements that have been made by government members. The member for Chifley summarised the situation accurately when he said that Labor in government had been responsible for an increase of over 500 per cent in the provision of child-care places in this country. The previous Labor government introduced proper accreditation procedures for child-care centres throughout this country to ensure that quality child care was being provided to our young people. I might canvass some of the achievements highlighted in the last year of Labor administration in 1995, before we left office in 1996. In 1995 we had five times the number of places that were in existence over the previous five years. Almost 400,000 families were using Commonwealth funded child care in the year before we left office. Almost a quarter of a million families were receiving assistance with child-care fees and more than 200,000 families were receiving the child-care cash rebate. Support for families did not stop there. More than 800,000 families were receiving the parenting allowance, and in that year an additional 51,000 child-care places were provided, at a cost of $162 million, to residents in rural and regional areas so that quality child care was available to them. That is an achievement that we on this side of the House are very proud of. We will brook no criticism from government members today who seek to rip hundreds of millions of dollars out of the child-care budget. An unjustifiable criticism of the previous Labor government is being levied by government members in this debate. It should be rememthat in the two Howard budgets that have been delivered, this very important area of social policy has virtually been emasculated. In the first budget we saw $820 million taken out of the child-care budget. That process has continued in the second budget. Among the people who are affected by these changes are the working families in my electorate of Corio in Geelong. Many of those working families are financially hard-pressed. They fall into the category of the working poor. It is necessary for both parents to work and earn income to sustain the family household. They have faced, as a result of what the government has done, an increase in the fees that are being charged by their community based child-care centres because the Commonwealth subsidy has been scaled back. Now they face the prospect of those childcare centres, which they have been able to access at a reasonable cost, being closed. The message that is being sent by this government to those working families is: 'We do not want two of you working. We only want one of you working. We would prefer that the woman in the household stays at home.' That is the message that is being delivered in the child-care area by the two Howard budgets. The income situation of many families in my electorate has been exacerbated by the uncertainty created by the government's industrial relations legislation. It is an absolute mockery for the Prime Minister to now parade himself around this country to workers as the champion of the Aussie battler, saying that his industrial relations legislation led to workers being one dollar worse off. That is not the case in practice. The workers in my electorate know that. Not only did they face inadequate wages before this industrial relations legislation was put into place; they now face an industrial relations climate in which their wages and conditions are being wound back as well. Developments in the economic workplace have been alluded to by previous members, such as the development of part-time jobs. We have not seen this government in the business of creating full-time jobs. That seems to be anathema to the government, yet it promised that it would continue the high growth in full-time jobs that had occurred under the previous Labor government. I happened to pick up a newspaper today in which our Prime Minister, in London, was lauding the government's achievements on the inflation rate. Well he might do that because we all know that when John Howard left government in 1983 he left Labor with an inflation rate in excess of 10 per cent. Thankfully, when he came to power in 1996, he was left by Labor an inflation rate of between two and three per cent. We broke the back of inflation in this country and now the Prime Minister, from London, tells the Australian community that this is going to be the platform on which he is going to, hopefully, achieve a four per cent economic growth rate in this country. Let me remind the Prime Minister that, in the last four years of Labor in government at the national level, we averaged a four per cent growth rate over that period. We left that to him and he has not been able to replicate that achievement or sustain it. The Prime Minister, having delivered uncertainty to the Australian work force with a climbing unemployment rate, now seeks to drive out of the work force those people who seek to improve the living standards of their families by having the woman in the household working. Families in my electorate face considerable economic uncertainty. They are not receiving the support from this government that they should in the child-care area and the message has been delivered: get out has not of the work force. The reason why the participation rates have dropped in this country is quite simply that the support that should be delivered by the Commonwealth government, channelled through local governments into community based child-care centres, has been withdrawn on a massive scale. John Howard really wants women out of the work force. The sad feature of this particular legislation is that many of them are withdrawing from the work force. I am really concerned at the effect this legislation will have on access to child-care and the quality of child-care provision in my electorate. I have at least five community based child-care centres that will be affected adversely by the changes that are proposed in this legislation and by previous actions of the government. There are nine such centres in the City of Greater Geelong area that will be affected. What the government's actions will mean is a subsidy withdrawal of $350,000 across the City of Greater Geelong. That has occurred and that loss will have to be made up by the City of Greater Geelong at a time when the city's revenue base is being squeezed by restrictions imposed by the hapless Kennett state government in Victoria. The absolutely hopeless mismanagement of the local government sector by the Kennett government has left many municipalities in a very precarious financial position indeed. They are not in a position to shoulder an extra $350,000 burden, which is what the City of Greater Geelong is going to have t<;> find if it is going to keep these community based child-care centres open. The only alternative to that course of action is to close those community child-care centres down and restrict the access of working people to them. It has not been an easy task for local councillors in the City of Greater Geelong to meet the demands for services by residents in the face of such state government ineptitude in handling the local government sector. The real danger in this, as I have alluded to already, is that the community sector may fall out of the system in my electorate without substantial Commonwealth support. Honourable members on the other side of the chamber, in supporting the government's legislation, have suggested that Labor governments in the past have not really planned child-care developments throughout the length and breadth of Australia and addressed areas of real need. I can tell you what is happening in my electorate. We have seen the proliferation of private child-care centres in competition with the community based centres. While those particular child-care centres have to comply with planning permits, those private centres in my community are not allocated in response to community demand. There is really no control over where these particular child-care centres are being built and there is no attempt to regulate to spread the service to meet community need. What some of these private operators are doing is chasing profit in high socio-economic areas of the city. My plea today to the councillors of the City of Greater Geelong is not to close those community based child-care centres, because they are servicing the needs of hard-pressed working families. At all cost, they must make sure that those centres are kept open for working people. Much has been said already in this debate about the detail of this legislation. I do not intend to go over that here. But let me say to the minister who has carriage of this piece of legislation that the invitation that the honourable member for Chifley extended to him I also extend. We consider the minister to be a reasonable and intelligent man. It is not our fault that he has been given all the bad aspects of the last two budgets to carry. Indeed, our sympathies go with him. We know that he had his finger in the pie back there in the 1980s to make sure that John Howard never reached the position of Prime Minister. We know that this is the payback for the minister. We really feel sorry for him; he is an intelligent and reasonable man, and we know that he can grasp, at times, the complexities of the legislation that the government brings forward. We would therefore issue that invitation to him to come into some of the electorates where working people are struggling very hard to make a living. They really need the support of these community based child-care centres so that the second parent can work and bring that income into the family and so that those working families can know that their child is going to a child-care centre that is accredited and that is providing a quality service. What we are hearing from these centres is that, in their attempts to come to grips with the massive cuts that have already been introduced by this particular government, they are cutting back on the provision of service. Equipment is not being replaced. Maintenance is not being carried out. Staff who are not trained-they are well meaning but they are not trained-are being employed on a part-time basis to cover the loss of trained staff who simply cannot be afforded by these particular centres. I want to pay tribute to the child-care workers in my electorate. There is a very professional group of people in my electorate in child-care centres looking after our young. The centres that exist in the City of Greater Geelong are quality centres, especially the community based child-care centres. I want see that quality retained and improved. It important area. cannot be done while this government is withdrawing funding for those centres-$820 million in the first budget and another hit the second budget. The minister has a big task ahead of him cope with the outrage that will come upon the government when this particular legislation comes into effect. He might think he is the having a hard time with nursing homes-and we know that he has aged in the brief that he has had the portfolio-but· that is nothing compared with what will happen to him when this particular legislation comes into effect on the ground and he incurs wrath of parents not only in my electorate also throughout the length and breadth Australia. Although the minister has a pleasant smile and a pleasant countenance in the face of such bad and poor legislation, he will not able to maintain that pleasant countenance, that happy outlook and that smiling face the world. He will not be able to maintain in face of the outrage that will confront him and his government when the working parents of Australia realise and appreciate just what this government has done to them. He might think that the holocaust has arrived nursing homes, but let me tell him that what is coming up the straight is a tidal wave of parental anger over what this government has done to the child-care sector in this country.",30
15,Mr WARWICK SMITH,SENATE,"I want take this opportunity to make some summing up comments before the House divides on the second reading amendment of the shadow the minister. At the conclusion of that, I will moving two amendments which we have per shared with the opposition and which I underwill stand will enjoy their support. Firstly, I want to thank all members their contribution during this debate. Unfortuearlier nately, this debate has been a lengthy one, and therefore I have not been able to sit in and listen to all speakers. I thank them generally for their contributions. I indicate to them that their comments are constructive and will be taken into account in the further considerto ations that I will bring to bear in this very The Child Care Payments Bill 1997 brings together into one major piece of legislation in some particular elements: the child-care assistance paid to centres under the Child to Care Act 1972; the child-care assistance paid to family day care, outside school hours care and occasional care not currently covered by legislation; and the child-care rebate paid to families under the Childcare Rebate Act time 1993. So this is a consolidation. The bill includes the necessary legislative arrangements for child-care assistance and the the child-care rebate to be paid by the new but Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, of Centrelink. The bill also implements the child-care policy changes announced in the 1997 budget by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) which introduce four clear things: a new child-care assistance arrangement for school be aged care; a 20-hour limit on child-care assistance for non-work related care; a 7,000to place limit on new private centre growth in it 1998 and 1999; and a link between eligibility for child-care assistance, the child-care rebate and age appropriate immunisation for children under the age of seven years. As I mentioned, there will be some amendments which I will with speak to at a later time. The rapid growth in child-care places has resulted in a dramatic increase in child-care assistance outlays over the past five years. The last two budgets have introduced a number of measures to slow the rate of to growth in child-care subsidy outlays while protecting the benefits of low and middle income families as far as possible. As a result, real rate of growth in child-care outlays be will be reduced from nine per cent to three cent per year, but substantial real growth continue. I think it is important to understand that real growth continues. Indeed, as for the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) said in the debate, it is anticipated that there will be an additional 83,000 new childcare places created over the next four years. The reforms which are implemented by these bills will certainly simplify the system of child care. That will be welcomed by parents. Parents will only need to deal with one Commonwealth agency, Centrelink, to receive their child-care payments. They will bring most child-care payments within a legislative framework, subject to parliamentary scrutiny. This has not been the case in the past. They will provide strong incentives for parents of children in child care to immunise their children for the benefit of both those children and all the other children with whom they share child care. For the first time, this legislation will put into place ·a new planning framework to influence the location and rate of growth of new private child-care centres. I am grateful for the support of the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) in terms of the value of the incentives to immunise. The member is uniquely qualified to comment on the importance of immunisation, and his strong support on this matter is certainly appreciated. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), the shadow minister, has called for the government to reverse its decision to cap child-care assistance at 50 hours. This limit reflects the view of the government that it is not reasonable for the community to support payment of care for more than 50 hours per week, unless it is actually being used for work related purposes. People who genuinely do need more care in order to work are entitled to assistance for the greater period and in fact do receive this assistance. This limit was first implemented back in April this year. Data from the first quarter cifter implementation showed that only six per cent of families actually used more than 50 hours of care a week. The only people affected by this change are those using less than 50 hours but being charged for more. Any financial impact on centres and individuals from the 50 hours measure depends solely on the charging practices of individual services. I hope these data help to assist the member forJagajaga to see what the impact of the policy would be in this area. The new limit of 20 hours child-care assistance a week will be introduced for families which do not have work related commitments. This move is strongly supported· by the Australian Early Childhood Association, which believes that families should be allowed up to 16 to 20 hours of non-work related care per week for children between two to five years of age. We have also recognised that families with a child with a disability need additional help. Mrs Moylan, the former Minister for Family Services, announced on 22 September in' her address to the Australian Early Childhood Association National Conference that the government had decided to exempt children with disabilities and their siblings from the 20-hour limit. I know that the opposition supports that particular measure which will be moved formally in the amendments. A new planning system, which I mentioned at the commencement of these remarks, to influence the location and growth of new private child-care places is a very important part of the 1997 budget child-care reform package. Extensive consultations were completed between November 1996 and February 1997 on a range of options as to how best we might approach this matter, including the implementation of new planning limits. A cohesive and integrated child-care planning system is absolutely critical to ensure that future child-care growth is directed to the area's high work related need. In part, this is the process that will address the concerns  just a moment ago. What we are trying to do is to make sure that new centres are created in those areas where they are most needed. Planning in child care is certainly not a new concept. The Commonwealth has always planned the growth and distribution of community based long day care centres, family day care and outside school hours care. The government is now extending needs based planning to the private sector, to the benefit of those who will use those centres. There is no point in having a whole range of new centres being built in the wrong locations so that the people who need them do not find it convenient to use them. Since August this year the Commonwealth has established planning advisory committees in each state and territory. These planning advisory committees involve all levels of government, the child-care industry and consumer representatives. I would urge all members of the federal parliament to make sure that they take some interest in the work of the planning advisory committees because they work at the community level where many of the key decisions will be made about the location of child-care centres. If we are concerned in this place to make sure that they are created-to deal with those extra 88,000 places over the next four years-I think, as representatives of the community, we could all be enhancing the viability of the proposals that are in this legislation. Their role is to assess the demand for new child-care places and to provide recommendations on high need areas by the end of this month. I know that some sections of the child-care industry expressed concern about the detail of disallowable instruments and regulations to be made under the bills not yet being in the public domain. The previous minister recognised this concern and agreed to issue the instruments as exposure drafts. I am pleased to tell the House that a number of these instruments have already been released for comment by the department at my direction, and the remainder will be released for comment over the next two weeks. My department will be consulting with the industry about these instruments as, indeed, they have been consulting with the industry about the preparation of this legislation extensively over a long period of time. I think I should take the opportunity to congratulate them for the extensive work that they have done in the child-care unit in the family services department, because it has not been an easy undertaking, I am sure, to prepare legislation of this extent and this detail and to do it in a way that it is going to enjoy---even though there is a second reading amendment-the support of this House. Most of this material in the draft disallowable instruments is technical and replicates or replaces current policy contained in disallowable instruments under the Child Care Act 1972, the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, administrative guidelines, handbooks and agreements. Importantly, for the first time all of this material will be open to scrutiny by the parliament. So, again, I emphasise the point: with planning advisory committees at the community level and with the disallowable instruments arrangements that will be available to the parliament to scrutinise, the whole planning arrangements and processes of delivery of child care will be available for the all parliament to comment on at any time, and I think that is a step in the right direction. It will give parents greater comfort and it will give every member of both this chamber and the other place the opportunity to be involved in making sure that child care is delivered in an appropriate way in this country. Some members have also expressed concern about the removal of operational subsidies from community based long day care centres. That decision taken in the 1996 budget is about equity---equity between the 200,000 families using private centres which have never received any operational subsidies and the 70,000 families using community based centres that previously received the untargeted operational subsidy. National governments need to take steps to ensure that equity policy is in place. Those community based centres receiving the subsidy of around $20 per week have fees which are only $4 per week less than private centres, and community centres provide fewer places. So, for high cost care, for example, for babies and children with additional needs or for low income families receiving maximum child-care assistance and in rural and remote areas, the government continues to provide strong support to the child-care sector. Approximately $1.2 billion has been allocated for the 1997-98 period and, as I said at the commencement, there is a rapid increase in the number of places88,000 in the next four years-and the policies are designed to cater for that need but also to make sure that child care is better targeted. Fundamentally, there is a shift of focus from service providers to parents. There is a balancing between the two and we are supporting that by income related child-care payments direct to families, regardless of the type of service they use. There is a multiplicican ty of services in child care and we are focusing on providing to families the opportunity of a greater choice as to how they meet their child-care needs. From January 1998 it is proposed, I am advised, to have a child-care card to ensure that the payment is used in an approved childcare facility. I have not talked this morning at length about quality but, as all would know, we are focused particularly on making sure that quality is a priority in those child-care centres. We want a less prescriptive service provision system. We do not want to be so concerned about who provides the servicepublic or private-as long as it satisfies regulation and quality assurance requirements. There has been some mention of aged care, and that is part of what is behind the detailed policy changes in aged care. We want a national child-care information system to assist parents make choices. We have to recognise that child care is an issue which touches many families. One of my personal early priorities is to make sure that I am in touch with all of those who represent peak bodies in the child-care area to ensure that we have that continued commitment, not just from the government but from those bodies also, to the enhancement of quality. We want to make sure there are safety nets, which I mentioned at the commencement of my remarks, to ensure that families or children who require that additional support are able to access the child care that they require. Indeed, that is the genesis of the amendment that we will be moving shortly about the extension of the 20-hour limit to be available for those with disabilities. I believe that the child-care legislation breaks new ground. It has been through a very extensive consultative process. I commit to continuing that consultative process in conjunction with the officers in my department. I would always be keen to hear from those in the industry, and indeed from those in this place, who can see that there are ways to improve this system. We are moving to a time when technology be utilised in the delivery of child-care services. We will see that with the child-care card in 1998, which will alleviate the necessity for additional forms. We are moving to a time when the delivery agency Centrelinkit is a new agency of only three months-will be involved actively in the provision of advice, dissemination of information, processing of claims and so on. It will be a one-stop shop approach, utilising technology . You can ring a 1800 number from anywhere in the country to reach the 400-odd Centrelink offices around the nation. A whole new age is dawning for the delivery of services, and child care will be part of that. One of the final points I will make is that concerns were expressed by the opposition, the sector and my own colleagues that a more appropriate starting date for these new reforms would be a time other than 1 January next year. I have heard those concerns. We are moving an amendment today relating to changing the start date to after Easter. I think that that is more amenable to families. I myself have a young family, and I know that 1 January is a time when you like to turn off getting ready for the next year ahead. I think that Easter will give both Centrelink a little more time and certainly the community more time to absorb the rationale behind the changes. There will be some time to look at those documents which now, for the first time, are going to be subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny. All in all, I thought that that was a very good and balanced decision. I know that the opposition support me in that as do the Democrats. I know that that amendment will enjoy support also. Finally, I thank again all those who have contributed to the debate. This is a major piece of legislation. I therefore commend it to the House.

It will actually create 83,000 new places over the four years, and also the card I referred to starts in 1999. I thank the opposition for that. The amendments make two significant changes and three minor technical changes to the Child Care Payments Bill that has just instead been passed. Both of the significant changes are beneficial to families and have no adverse impact on the child-care industry. One amendment makes additional child-care assistance after available to children with disabilities. The 1997 budget measure to introduce a 20-hour per week limit on child-care assistance for non-work related care is implemented through the Child Care Payments Bill 1997. This bill includes exemptions for children at risk of abuse or neglect, families in crisis and families where the sole parent has or both parents in a couple have a disability. Children with a disability and their siblings were not included in this exemption. Parents with a child with a disability often require more than 20 hours of non-work related care to fulfil their caring responsibilities towards both that child and other children in the family. Child care is frequently needed for siblings when a parent attends therapy sessions and doctor visits with a child with a disability. The parents themselves are more likely to suffer illness than other parents due largely to the strain of managing the highlevel support needs of their child, further compounding their need for additional care. This amendment makes sure that these families are not subject to the 20-hour limit by exempting both the disabled children and their siblings from the limit. The second significant amendment deals with the retrospective claims for child-care assistance or the child-care rebate made in respect of children who have not been immunised. The Child Care Payments Bill as it stands provides that, where a family makes a prospective claim for a child-care payment and the child in question has not been immunised, the family has a period of 28 days in which to commence the appropriate immunisation catch-up program, to provide evidence of medical contraindication or to declare a conscientious objection to the child being immunised. If they take no action, child-care payments will cease after the 28 days. This amendment introduces a similar concession for families lodging a retrospective claim for child-care assistance or child-care rebate. It means that, where a family's first claim under the new arrangements is retrospective and the child is not fully immunised, the family will be given the opportunity to fulfil the immunisation requirements I have just outlined and so receive the payment. Families whose child-care usage is too irregular for them to be able to anticipate their needs for child care will, for practical reasons, claim retrospectivity-that is, they will claim for care already provided. Under the existing bill, if the child is not fully immunised, the family will not be given the benefit of the 28day grace period in which to fulfil the vaccination requirements. This amendment will overcome these problems. One of the technical amendments redefines the term 'immunised' to cover children who, while they have not received the appropriate vaccinations under the standard schedule, have had the vaccinations required by an approved catch-up schedule. The second technical amendment remedies an omission by defining the term 'secretary' as being the secretary to the department. The third technical amendment flows from the deferral of the implementation date for new child-care payment arrangements to 27 April 1998, which I just outlined in the summing up of the bill just passed. The amendment is required to allow for the allocation of child-care assistance hours to take into account arrangements in existence from the payment commencement date. The other amendment relates to the change in the date.",37

19,Ms MACKLIN,PAIRS,"Jagajaga) (11.48 a.m.)The opposition does support the government's move to exempt families with children with disabilities and those families where there are children at risk from the 20-hour restriction. We do recognise, along with the government, that these families are under significant pressure. We appreciate the government's recognition of this and their move to support those parents. So the opposition is very pleased to support those amendments. We also are very supportive of the government's moves as far as immunisation is concerned. It is the case that this country does need to improve its immunisation rates. The changes that the government has put in place to see that improvement are welcomed by the opposition. We are also pleased to see that the government has taken the opposition's advice and delayed the commencement of the changes, particularly as they affect out of school hours care. The government would be aware that there is considerable concern amongst those who are running out of school hours care programs all around the country that the government's changes are going to create considerable hardship both for the services and for the families using those services. It is the case that the government is removing operational subsidies from out of school hours care. The removal of these subsidies is removing the certainty about the incomes that these services have enjoyed. So they do have considerable concern about the changes that are being made and I am sure they will appreciate at least the delay in the implementation of these changes. However, the out of school hour services would prefer the government not to proceed with the removal of operational subsidies. These are services that are at this stage still, to use a colloquialism, run on the smell of an oily rag. They are run very tightly. They certainly do not have any extra fat in their services to cut and they are concerned that, as a result of the government's changes, some families will face considerable increases in fees and, as a result, may take their children out of out of school hours care. This is not something that I am sure the government would want to see. Certainly the opposition does not want to see any return to the past where we had children going home alone, going home to houses where there were no parents. The only way to ensure that that does not happen in the future is to make sure that out of school hours care programs are properly funded. So I ask the government, now that it has acknowledged these changes cannot be rushed through, that in its reconsideration of these out of school hours changes it does reconsider the removal of operational subsidies. This area certainly is not overfunded. It is an area under considerable pressure and one that the government needs to reconsider, given that it has given itself some more time. But, as I said, the opposition will being these amendments. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Warwick Smith)by leave-read a third time.

20,Ms MACKLIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I want to take this opportunity today in the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997 to draw the government's attention to the effects of its policies on Australian families and especially low income families. I am sure I do not need to draw this to the attention of our Australian families because they already know. They are right to be concerned about what is happening now and to be concerned about the things that look like happening in the future. Our· Australian families, particularly low income families, are support- facing uncertainty and insecurity. Under this government they are right to be concerned that they may not have a job next week. Under this government they are right to be concerned that their already stretched household budgets may not be able to meet the extra costs that this government has imposed on them. Many have had to spend more because of higher child-care costs. We have just dealt with the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 here in the House which will see many families pay more for their child care. They have had to spend more on increased prescriptions for themselves and their children when they get sick. And they have had to spend more on community care services. If it is the case that they can afford to have private health insurance at all, any benefit they might have got from the rebate has gone in increased premiums. They are also right to be concerned about the future if they are looking after frail, elderly parents because they face the prospect of having to raise the money to pay an accommodation bond if their parents need to go into a nursing home. If they have young children they face the prospect of being unable to find suitable or affordable child care. If they have children aged between 16 and 25 they face the prospect of having to support those older children while they look for work-work that is not to be found-or helping with the costs of technical, further or university education. Under the government's new industrial relations arrangements they face the prospect of unpredictable wages and eroding conditions. Older families in particular also face the prospect of having to run down their savings, including their superannuation savings, if they become casualties of continuing high unemployment. Australian families know that this government has cut more than $10 billion from health, housing, education and social security in its first two budgets, and that means that that money has come out of the pockets of low income Australian families. They know because they are feeling the effects in lower incomes, in struggling harder to make ends meet and in declining quality of the services they use. As one very astute constituent put it to me, 'They might have a surplus, but I don't have anything. I don't have a local primary school or hospital any more. My kids can't get into TAFE any more.' Let us have a look at the specific provisions of this bill, which are· also going to make some people worse off. From 20 March next year schedule 1 amalgamates the existing parenting allowance and sole parent pension into a new payment called 'parenting payment'. Sole parents are the losers in this arrangement introduced under the guise of simplification. Under the new arrangements sole parent families, which I might remind the House are still our poorest families, will lose their payment completely once their assets reach the relevant assets test threshold, instead of having their payment reduced by $3 a fortnight for every $1,000 of assets above these thresholds. More significantly for low income sole parents, those who claim parenting payment having lost their job will have to serve an income maintenance waiting period if they have cashed out annual, sick, long service or maternity leave paid as part of their redundancy payment, and overseas portability of their payment will be reduced from 26 weeks to 13 weeks. There are some current parenting allowees who are winners as a result of these changes, but let us not lose sight of the fact that the net effect of this measure is to take nearly $7 million a year away from low income families with children. Let us not lose sight of the fact that these families are going to lose another $7 million as a result of this government's changes. Simplification this measure is not. It might be changing the name to one name, but there are still two sets of rules. Schedule 2 makes changes to the child disability allowance. On the positive side, they are changes that we support. From July next year, two children will be able to be added together to qualify a person for the child disability allowance. Secondly, the opposition does support the move to increase the allowable respite days for parents caring for children with disabilities. That is going to be increased from 42 days to 63 days. That measure too is welcomed by the opposition to ensure that parents with children who have disabilities get a bit more of a break. On the negative side, there are a number of changes. From 1 July next year the eligibility for child disability allowance will be based on a prescribed list of disabilities and a child disability assessment tool. Secondly, the child disability allowance arrears will be cut from 12 to six months. These new arrangements are part of what I can only describe as a concerted assault by this government on people with disabilities. Firstly, we have seen in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997, which will soon be returned from the Senate for our consideration, the introduction of new disability impairment tables to assess people's eligibility for the disability support pension. Thousands of people with disabilities will have to look for work when there are no jobs available even for people who are skilled, educated and able-bodied. These disabled Australians who will be thrown off the disability support pension by this government's new tables will find themselves without any income support at all. Of course, it is not the case that the government is doing anything extra to help these people with disabilities to get a job. Secondly, my office has received dozens of calls from the parents of young adults with disabilities about a new crackdown on mobility allowance. Unless people with disabilities are in vocational education or training, looking for work or in employment, they will no longer qualify for this payment. In particular, disabled adults who are in activity therapy or living skills training will no longer qualify, despite their need for assistance to travel to these courses. As one constituent has written: I am sure the government does not understand the ramifications of such action. Whole Day Training Centre transport services will collapse, lose out and Day Training Centres may even have to close. The disabled will be confined to their residences . . . what are the answers for the abled who are disenfranchised from access to our community at large? Thirdly, we have all the changes that are taking place as far as the Commonwealth-state disability agreement is concerned. It is nothing short of a fiasco. This government is now renewing this agreement month by month. It is supposed to be a five-year agreement that gives certainty to the states and certainty to those services that are delivering care, accommodation and other services to people with disabilities. By its incapacity to negotiate a decent new agreement with the states for people with disabilities, this government is creating terrible uncertainty in the minds of people with disabilities and in the minds of those who deliver services. It is the case that the government knows there is great need in the community for more and improved accommodation services for those who are disabled, great need for increases in employment assistance and also great need for an increase in day activity centres all around the nation. But what do we have from this government under the Commonwealth-state disability agreement? Yet another attempt to take a cut from a very vulnerable group of people and an incapacity to negotiate a decent agreement with the states to ensure that these services are delivered. Fourthly, there are the measures that are in this bill before us. So we have a range of ways in which this government is attacking people with disabilities. The government claims that its rationale for its proposals is to change the objective of the child disability allowance from 'encouraging family rather than institutional care' to 'providing recognition of a child's disability and its impact on the family'. It further claims that a universal rate of payment does not acknowledge those with very high care needs and that tighter targeting may allow greater scope to provide increased assistance to those who need it most. In fact, of course, as is now well known from this government, the rationale is much simpler than that. It is all about saving money-saving money on the backs of children taxis will with disabilities. The government is concerned about the dis- increase in the number of claimants for the child disability allowance. They have doubled in the five years to 1997; there are now 102,000 recipients of the child disability allowance. The government claims-and this is a question which I want to give some detail to, so I ask that, when the Minister Representing the Minister for Social Security (Mr Ruddock) makes his concluding remarks, he help us clarify this point-that: ABS research found ... close to 21% ofrecipients have no handicap, do not require personal help or supervision and have no difficulty in performing self care, mobility and verbal communication tasks. That comes from the Portfolio Budget Statements for 1997. The government points to the shift in profile of child disability allowance recipients compared with those previously qualifying for the handicapped child allowance. Forty-seven per cent of child disability allowance children have asthma, behavioural and learning problems including attention deficit disorder, epilepsy or diabetes as their main disabling condition whereas severe physical and intellectual disabilities predominated amongst the previous handicapped child allowance recipients. Disturbingly, however, the Australian Bureau of Statistics contests these figures. In a letter to the Geelong Community Legal Service, an ABS representative said: I have attempted to validate the figure quoted, that 21 per cent of children attracting the Child Disabiliremind ty Allowance did not have a disability or a handicap. The exact source of this figure is not clear but it is not supported by data from the 1993 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers. As I said, I would appreciate the minister clarifying this matter for us in his concluding remarks; it is obviously a very significant point if it is not the case that recipients of this allowance have no disability. Finally, I want to talk about the effect of these changes which of course will tighten eligibility for the child disability allowance. The government estimates that 4,000 fewer children will qualify for the child disability allowance each year and that the changes will save a considerable amount of money. This is another area that I would appreciate clarification from the minister about because we have seen two different figures in different places in the budget papers. In the Portfolio Budget Statements, the government talks about savings of $97Y2 million over the next four years. These savings, as I understand it, will result from children no longer being eligible for the child disability allowance and from the change in arrears. I would appreciate the minister clarifying the exact amount of savings that the government anticipates and the government breaking that down for us into those who will no longer be eligible for the child disability allowance and how much the government expects to save as a result of changing the arrears arrangements. Some of the savings from the changes to the child disability allowance will be used to fund additional support for carers, and there is no question that the Labor Party, along with the government, does acknowledge the vital role played by carers. We certainly do support additional assistance to these people, but we do not think that this additional support should be provided at the expense of children with disabilities or their families. As with many recent government changes, the impact of these measures will fall most heavily upon women because they constitute 93 per cent of recipients of the child disability allowance. I also want to take the opportunity to the House that this is not the first time that the government has tried to cut child disability allowance arrears. The government's attempts to cut arrears from 12 months to three months was rightly defeated in the Senate late last year. We argued then and we continue to argue that parents take some time to have their child's disability diagnosed and, importantly, we need to recognise that it does take a considerable period of time for parents to come to terms with the implications of their child's disability. It can take a considerable length of time for them to establish what their child's needs are and to realise that they are having to provide the extra care and attention sufficient to qualify them for the child disability allowance. At the same time that these families are struggling to come to terms with the changes that a child with a disability can bring, when they are more concerned about getting and giving the best possible care for their child and when, frankly, dealing with Centrelink is going to be the furthest thing from their minds, they are being asked by this government, as a result of this change today, to be quick off the mark-to get down to Centrelink and claim the child disability allowance quickly or lose out on up to sixmonths payment. That is the impact of the changes that we are debating here today. The opposition has opposed this measure before, and we will oppose it again. Again, let us not lose sight of the fact that the net effect of these changes will be to take money away from families who have children with disabilities. These are families who are already under enormous pressure and this government, as a result of these changes, is going to make this pressure worse. Schedule 3 of the bill before us today makes 255 amendments to the Social Security Act to change the name 'family payment' to 'family allowance'. I will be very interested to hear the government's rationale for this change. I cannot understand it; it seems to be entirely oriented to taking up the time of this parliament. I remind the House that the last time the payment for children was renamed 'family allowance' was in June 1976 under Prime Minister Fraser. Certainly the Liberal and National parties seem to be very keen on sticking to their name 'family allowance', even if it requires 255 amendments. That will also require a massive reprinting of information products and forms, all at taxpayers' expense, and the money involved could much better be spent on supporting families-for example, those who have children with disabilities. Schedule 4 standardises the arrangements for determining when 'severe financial hardship' can be invoked to waive ordinary, income maintenance and liquid assets waiting periods. A person must have liquid assets of no more than two weeks payment. For income maintenance and liquid assets tests they must also demonstrate that they are in this financial predicament because of what is, in the view of this government, 'unavoidable and essential expenditure' . ' Unavoidable and essential expenditure includes replacing or repairing your fridge but does not include buying your children a new pair of shoes. It includes money for food, housing and utilities, but it is not clear er it will include the cost of taking your child to the dentist for a check-up or to buy a new pair of glasses. This kind of paternalistic attitude is typical of this government. Put any way at all, the people to whom these arrangements apply are either families who have less than $600 in the bank and no prospect of income or single people who have less than $350 in the bank and no prospect of income. By any definition, these people are poor. They need this community'S help and the support of this government. They do not need the sorts of changes we are seeing in this legislation. We should not insist that our public servants make judgments about the worthiness of helping people who are so obviously poor. Schedule 5 extends the health care card ,eligibility to di-abled children who do not otherwise qualify for the child disability allowance ,and bases the health care card eligibility on income averaged over eight weeks-it is currently based on income averaged over four weeks. The opposition will not be opposing these two measures. However, we are concerned about how the administrative arrangements which will have to be put in place to provide health care cards for these children with disabilities will work. This is another question which I would appreciate the minister responding to. Who, if not Centrelink, is going to determine that a child has a physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability which is likely to be permanent or to exist for an extended period? Who is then going to determine that, because of that disability, the child needs a level of care and attention on a daily basis that is substantially more than that needed by a child of the same age who does not have a disability? If the minister could respond to that, we would appreciate it. Schedule 6 amends the Data Matching and Tax Act to replace references to specific social security payments with a generic reference to payments under the Social Security Act so that data matching can continue when the government introduces a new payment such as parenting payment or when it changes the name of a payment to, say, wheth- 'family allowance'. Amendments also allow information to be provided to source departments with tax file numbers intact and via online transfer. Despite the government's rhetoric about ensuring that such transfers of information are to be made by secure on-line connection to protect people's privacy and to ensure that personal information is not able to be used for unauthorised purposes, the amendments do not require the on-line connection to be anything, let alone secure. Labor's amendments in the Senate will insert the requirement that this transfer happen by secure online connection. During consideration in detail of this bill we will be interested to hear the government's explanation of how the Privacy Commissioner interprets these provisions and to hear whether or not any concerns have been expressed. I will conclude my remarks by saying that there is little in this bill which gives low income Australian families any hope for the future. This is more of the same from a government which has already run out of new policy ideas and which shows no inclination to improve the lot of Australian families. This Howard government continues to take money away from Australian families, and this bill is yet another example of that. It is yet another example of a government which is only concerned about the bottom line and not about the state that Australian families find themselves in. To that end I move the following second reading amendment to this bill: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give reading, the House: (1) condemns the government for its continuing assault on low income Australian families through, for example, the abolition of dental health program, higher costs prescriptions, higher child care costs and introduction of accommodation bonds and income tested daily fees for aged care; and (2) calls on the government to reconsider plans to further penalise families with children with disabilities and sole parents"".",41
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Is the amendment seconded? Mr Lee-Yes, I second the amendment.",46
22,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Longman) (12.21 p.m.)Before I commence to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill, I would like to comment on what occurred in the chamber certain this morning, when we saw a political stunt by the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). When referring to the government's Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997, he moved the point that there were 19 members of the government's front-bench who had some form of trust and that, therefore, perhaps there was a conflict of interest. Mr Lee- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I know the honourable member is new to this House, but he has to understand there is a standing order on relevance and he cannot make comments about trusts, about a vote that took place some time ago, when we are discussing issues relating to matters raised earlier today by the member for Jagajaga.",46
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Order! I was listening very closely to the honourable member for Longman to see how he would develop the issue. I will listen a little further to ascertain whether he is directing it to the bill before the House.,46
24,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Very much so, Mr Deputy Speaker. The point I wish to raise is that perhaps the opposition does not feel it correct of me to be speaking on a bill to do with parenting because I am a parent. Therefore, if you are going to draw such a long bow to deal with trusts, perhaps we should not be a . discussing things to do with taxation since we all deal with taxation. Where do we draw the the bill a second line in the sand? I simply wish to make the point that we in this parliament, on both sides, should be the dealing with issues such as the Social Security for Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other the Measures) Bill, running the country and doing what is best for the nation, not making political points which have no relevance to the its wider community and which, quite obviously, are not to do with the good governance of this country. This bill is a continuation of the government's improvements to the social security system which has been seen, after many years of Labor, to become a most convoluted excuse for a system which is no longer representing the needs and the aspirations of the wider Australian community. We have set goals, aspirations and objectives when dealing with the Social Security portfoliothe single largest expenditure within the budget. We wish to see the efficiency of the service improved. To this end, we have introduced Centrelink which combines many cif the different facets of payments to the wider Australian comtive. munity. We have seen greater accountability enforced and, to this end, we have seen large amount of money retrieved on a weekly basis-some $20 million-from a combinaon tion of social security fraud, overpayments and administrative glitches. We have also seen the streamlining of service delivery so that, with such things as the youth allowance, we have combined a series of payments into far fewer payments, simplifying access to the social security system for Australians. Most importantly, we have ensured that the limited resourceswas Australian taxpayers' money-are best direct13 ed to those genuinely in need of support from the Australian tax system. These are all commendable objectives with which this government and this minister have set about to ensure the social security system does represent a system that the Australian taxpayresident er is happy to contribute towards. This particular bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997, has six schedules, and resident. I would like to take issue throughout with some of the points made by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) in misrepresenting some parts thereof. The first section relates the parenting payment. In particular, it towards some of our objectives of ensuring that we get rid of complexities and simplify the system. The new parenting payment introduces single payment for parents by replacing sole parent pension and parenting allowance from 20 March 1998. The sole parent pension has always very much had a social stigma attached to it. For whatever reason, there are many people in this community who receive a sole parent pension who are embarrassed to actually state that. By removing that name, I think we make a very clear indication of the social conscience that we as a nation should have. The parenting payment recognises a person's child-bearing responsibilities, irrespective of their marital status, and treats parents in a far more consistent way-and I thought it very belittling of the member for Jagajaga to somehow deride such an objecThe new payment achieves greater equity between lone and partnered parents. The a member for J agajaga was quick to point out that the mobility restrictions that we placed sole parents had been reduced, but she did not point out that the restrictions on parents, those in a partnership, had been expended our· and, in doing so, made the two uniform. To make that quite clear, a sole parent was able to travel overseas for a period of 12 months or 52 weeks and continue to receive the sole parent benefit while out of the country whereas a parent who was part of a couple able to receive such a payment for only weeks before it was discontinued. In recognising that the role and responsibilities of parents are not dependent upon whether they are single or a couple, we have ensured that that particular requirement is now uniform for both situations. We are also reducing requirements for lone parents from five years to two years, with immediate access to the parenting payment for those who become a lone parent while an Australian There is the application of an income maintenance period for lone parents under which lump sum payments, such as accrued to annual leave and long service leave-as goes mentioned by the member for Jagajaga-are treated as income for a period equal to the period of leave to which the payment relates. This simply means that, if someone who has a been employed takes three months long service leave and another month's worth of holiday pay, they are not able to access the social security system until they have used that money for that period of time. To me, that is fair and equitable. It shows that these people have been paid and that there is no reason for them to be on the social security safety net-not the gravy train. There is a big difference. The new payment simplifies administrative arrangements-and this, once again, goes back to our objectives of addressing the need to simplify administration, saving money in this area and ensuring that the funds are directed and end up in the hands of the people who genuinely need it. It provides continuity of income support for parents support pension.' whose marital status changes. If someone who is single becomes partnered again, they longer have to reapply; they simply will have their pay:nents changed, and there is less administration and less chance of there being a miss in payment. It is important to remember that the core conditions of the new payment, such as the rates, income tests and concessional cards, are all maintained. Consequently, lone parents to will be paid parenting payment at the pension rates, they will be subject to the pension inequities income test and they will be entitled to of concessions that are available to pensioners. Moving on to the next schedule, relating to the child disability allowance, this was the the focus of much of the attention from the member for Jagajaga. She pointed out that somehow we were giving a tough time to believe, people receiving child disability allowance. the first instance, she referred to had been put forward in a previous bill. This meant that unemployed people in Australia assessment would now be subjected to a table so that it no longer would be a hit and miss affair the start whether or not they were able to receive a a disability allowance and in fact within certain categories. She said that people categorised as 'very low disability' who at present are receiving disability pension would be removed and It is thrown back onto the unemployment heap. I of think this really flies in the face of what we eliminate are trying to achieve in Australia. We all appreciate that there are not enough jobs. amendment. There were not enough jobs for 13 years; we reached over one million unemployed. That is certainly not the situation today. What it means is that if a person genuinely is able to work and has some minor disability we are condemning them to a life of unemthe ployment if we do not take them off the disability support pension, place them back into the employment market and provide them with some skills, support and training, which this government is dedicated to, ensuring that they can have a fulfilling role within Australian society rather than saying: 'Let us hide them from the social security and unemployment figures and keep them on a disability I have brought in with me today some no comments from different groups around Australia on the changes that we are introducing to the child disability allowance. I would like to quote from some of them. This is the Australian College of Paediatrics: The Australian College of Paediatrics has asked me to the proposed changes to the Child Disability Allowance. I think first and foremost it is important say that the intention to change the criteria is welcomed by paediatricians in general. Paediatricians have been concerned about the apparent of the previous system, whereby families children with apparently minimal disease have been successful in being awarded the allowance. It is believed that the proposed system is fair and proposals as suggested are reasonably complete. This flies very much in the face of what the member for Jagajaga was leading to us to but she has the form in this matter of In not necessarily stating the real situation. The tables that Asthma Foundation writes: Congratulations on your paper outlining the new tool for Child Disability Allowance. We can appreciate the work that has taken place since of the review . . . It is not easy to produce review of an area that carries with it such sensihad to fall tivity in the community. This is a sensitivity which the member for Jagajaga is always wont to heighten. The Western Australian Deaf Society states: particularly pleasing to note that hearing loss greater than 70dB will be considered a manifest condition as of July 1998. This will certainly the previous issue of discrepancies in awarding CDA to deaf children and is a welcome I have reviewed the CDA assessment questionnaire and find this tool to be a much more reasonable and appropriate form of measurement. And there are others. This measure, part of a broader carer reform package, will improve targeting of financial assistance to individual carers. It will increase the adequacy of payments to those with the largest caring loads and help ensure flexible but consistent customer service. The important point to remember is that if a family is unfortunate enough to have more than one disabled child, both having disabilities of a minor nature, we will be adding the two disabilities together to recognise that there is an additional workload in that family, an additional caring need, and the disability allowance would then apply. The CDA reform package also contains rationale several other components, including a reducthree tion in the period for which arrears are paydetermining able and an increase in the number of days for which a parent or guardian can place their child in respite. Once again recognising the extra special needs of these carers, they now be able to place their children into care for 63 days a year and still be able to receive hardship .. the additional assistance. Previously it was just 42 days. Far from what the member for Jagajaga outlined, this government is very much aware of the needs of the disabled and their carers, and through budget measures and this measestimated ure has shown where our care and responsiers bilities lie. Once again, in her speech the member for Jagajaga mentioned the change the family payments to family allowance. think she said that the Prime Minister was then Mr Fraser, in 1996. I do not think was Prime Minister then; he was a little earlier than that. I am sure that was a freudian slip. My understanding is that the description ship. 'family allowance' was used from 1987 to 1992 under the Labor government. The reason for the change is quite simple. The change of name amendment will allow families to easily understand their entitlements. On both sides of the House we have constituents come to our offices who struggle constantly with their entitlements, unsure of these changes. Because we have combined the sole parent It pension and the parenting allowance, to become known now as the 'parenting view, payment', we felt it appropriate, to save confusion, to go back to the name that I know I and many others have used, and that is arise. family allowance. So there is a clear differentiation between the two and that confusion is removed. There are no substantive changes to the nature of the current family payment. The point was raised that there were 255 amendments. We were simply referring to the name change. There are no amendments. No scare campaign can be mounted on this issue. Schedule 4 amendments apply to consistent hardship rules to ordinary waiting periods, the liquids assets test period and the income maintenance period. To put it simply, the for this is that currently there are separate criteria to be undertaken when people's eligibility for hardship. At present the provisions dealing with ordinary waiting periods, the liquid assets test . waiting period and the income maintenance will period, all provide for the waiver of the periods when they cause severe or significant However, these waiver rules vary depending on which provisions apply. Once again, it just has creates confusion and anxiety amongst the people who are most in need. Our attempt here is to simplify and streamline it. It is that approximately 50,000 customwill benefit from this measure by having part of their waiting period waived. Customto ers who are unavoidably in severe financial I hardship will have their waiting period waived all together. Common rules for deterhe mining hardship and waiting periods are easier for customers to understand. The proposal simplifies waiting periods by adopting a standard rule and allows the waiver of part or all of the waiting period due to hardWhen a customer of Social Security goes into Centrelink and states their situation, they are not familiar with the legislation, they are not familiar with all of the ins and outs and they do not necessarily describe it 100 per cent accurately. They get given information by Centrelink on one of the three provisions. turns out that it was not the provision that they were requiring. They are given, in their the wrong information. By simplifying any this there is now one rule for all, which means that that situation of uncertainty cannot The amendment to the Health Insurance Act will ensure that any child with a mild disability whose parent or guardian loses or would lose qualification for the child disability allowance through the introduction of new qualification criteria is still able to retain eligibility for a health care card to cover cost of pharmaceuticals, treatment, aids applications. That is a most important thing to establish. There should be no dispute from the opposition that this is necessary because they are the big cost items. They may not have a major disability but the cost of taining their health is a very important lem faced by many parents, and I amendment will therefore be most welcome. We are also amending, in relation to the health care card, the income test. As it rently stands, for an itinerant worker who generally does not work over Christmas, for argument's sake, we look at the last four weeks of their income and assess that, yes, they are eligible for a health care card, and course that is for six months. But they could well do this knowing that they are going to back at work shortly after receiving the health care card, on above average weekly earnings, ey. and that they would therefore not be eligible for it. We have simply extended this period to eight weeks so that we can have a look at what the pattern of employment is whether or not there is a real requirement for the health care card. This is about ensuring that the Australian taxpayer's money is going to people who genuinely in need, not those able to use the system to their own advantage. There is a clear difference. The Labor party in government, and still in opposition, fail realise that the average Australian believes that we all have rights and responsibilities when accessing the public purse, in particular the social security system. The final amendment relates to data matchby ing. The data matching program has been place since 1991. It has been very successful in identifying incorrect payments to social security recipients. It has been further extendhave ed under this government, and that has sured that we are collecting a greater number of anomalies, if we can put it that way. I know the opposition does not like us to refer to some in the community as rest of us, but that is reality. The various terms referred to throughout data matching program are defined in the bill. their These include the term 'assistance agency', the which is defined to include, among other and things, the Department of Human Services and Health. This reference is no longer· correct, however, as the department is know known as the Department of Health and Family Services. It will thus be amended. It mainis a straightforward and simple amendment probwhich has no negative impacts and a negliam sure this gible financial impact. In conclusion, this bill is just another in the series that this government has introduced not curin a mean spirited way, as painted by the member for Jagajaga, but in a way that will provide equity and accountability, ensuring that the very limited resources provided by the Australian taxpayer are directed to the of people most in need. I do not think any fair minded Australian can disagree that these are be the sorts of objectives that any responsible government should have for taxpayers' monI reiterate that we are about improving the efficiency of the service. That, as I said, has good been done through the introduction of and Centrelink, greater accountability of taxpayers' funds, streamlining of the service so all of the recipients find the system easy to access, and ensuring the resources are directed are to those genuinely in need. I commend the who have been bill to the House.",46
25,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"That is just wonderful. Isn't that to terrific? Now we understand what they mean by 'selling the accommodation bonds': do not tell them the whole story. One would imagine, hearing the member for Longman"" (Mr Brough), that this legislation is driven solely concern and care for those who are affectin ed. The funny thing is that it is actually driven by money. If that were not the case, how come the money is being cut? What we here is more of the 1996 budget, finally encoming back to the surface and now being painted in the most glowing terms. And there was a nice touch of hypocrisy. The reason for changing part of the name is the stigma that defrauding the is attached to it. The same speaker went on to talk about the people on the gravy train. For a year and a half, this government has castigated, bagged, labelled and stigmatised tens of thousands of good Australians, good immigrants and good aged people in all kinds of ways-and they do it every day, day in and day out. Then they talk about family values and about how they are helping families. The hypocrisy is awesome. Now I can understand what they mean by 'better marketing' of the accommodation bonds, because they can do that-they have no trouble with their conscience. They do not say, 'The system we are putting forward is faulty, therefore we should change it.' They say, 'The system we are putting. forward is shonky, therefore let's sell it better.' I am reminded of an incident some years ago that the then Senator Button used to recount. He was talking to the CEO of one of our major automotive manufacturers about a particular model of car. The manager said to Senator Button, 'It is a real lemon. It is a dreadful car. We have a big problem with it.' John Button said to him, 'What are you doing to do about it?' The manager responded, 'We are going to have a major marketing campaign.' That is what the government are doing. They have a bagful of lemons from their budget of 1996, and what are they doing? They are out marketing them, pretending that they are all sweet. You cannot change a dud. This legislation is aimed at saving money, not at making things better for people. It if was making things better they would be helping people more. The fact is, people are going to miss out on the child disability allowance. We do not know how many yet, but people who would normally have received it will not get it.. The government save money on sole parents. They say that this is somehow making the system better and fairer. So we get the flip side of the gravy train-the idea that Australians are not fair minded; that people are cheating, rorting and ripping off the system; and that they are not entitled to it. The pure hypocrisy is awe inspiring. Last week members of the government finally started to understand the age accommodation problem. It finally sunk in. Rather than then saying, 'Let's fix it because it doesn't work,' they all started complaining that the minister was not selling it well enough. No wonder politics is held in such low esteem. Quite frankly, the people in the community understand that. They can see the pure cynicism and hypocrisy of that. It is oozing out of the place. It was summed up yesterday when Doug Moran and members of the government talked about bludgers; silvertails squatting in nursing homes. They said that people should have to sell their houses before they go into nursing homes so they do not become silvertailed squatters. The people in my electorate who are aged and who own their own homes are invariably women. They have been widows in some cases for many years. The idea that they have to sell their house to avoid becoming a silvertailed squatter bludging in a nursing home is disgraceful. It is an appalling concept. Not only is it inappropriate policy; it is obscene. And the government wants a big campaign to market it. The government wants to spend lots of taxpayers' money gilding the lily-not the lily but the rot that is inside it. It wants to spend a lot of taxpayers' money pretending that it is a good thing. What an obscenity! In the first six or eight months or the first few months after last year's budget, I did not mind hearing the contributions of the new government members because they were new. They were not aware of all the details. They had not had constituents come to them and explain how things worked. Their ignorance was understandable and their naivety was allowable. But we cannot make allowances any more. They know, as we know, that this is going to is nonsense. All those government backbenchers know, as we know, from their constituents that what they are doing to people who require support, who are unemployed, who are aged, frail and ill and who have children with disabilities is obscene. They are being told this virtually every day and in some cases many times a day. The letters they are getting we are getting. The hide of ministers in this chamber in recent weeks to suggest that cases have been made up is unbelievable. I suggest they go and answer their letters. That is one of the problems: we are not getting answers. We put forward letters from constituents with these problems and we do not get answers. The minister pretends that they do not exist, that they are fictitious. They are not fictitious. We know that, as do the government backbenchers, but they are trying to pretend to the community at large that these are fictitious, that we are scaremongering. What surprised me is that it has taken the aged community so long to become vocal. Many of these changes were announced in August last year, over 12 months ago. One of those changes was back here today: the pushing back of the arrears payment for the child disability allowance to 12 months. This is a savings measures. It was in the budget last year, and it is back again. It was defeated in the Senate and it is being brought back again. That is how persistent they are. If they lose this year, they will bring it back next year. If they lose it before this election, they will bring it back if they are re-elected in the next parliament. Do not be mistaken into believing that they will have a change of heart. These people are committed to these views, and they will revive them and recycle them. Anybody who thinks that the coming changes to aged care would not be revisited in the next parliament under a Howard or Costello government should think again. We are voting on issues today which were first announced in the budget last year, which were defeated in the parliament and which have been brought back. You can forget any idea that these people are learning from their mistakes because they are not. The government is making savings in this legislation from people with children with disabilities. These are the so-called dole bludgers, the welfare frauds and the gravy train people. These are the people who have apparently not been accessing the system fairly. They have been manipulating income over eight weeks rather than four weeks. If people lose their income, they lose it. Pushing up the test to eight weeks is a savings measure. It is not a welfare measure or a support measure; it is a way of saving money. Every time we see a headline about savings on welfare, just remember where the savings are coming from. We are making savings from people who are aged, who are unemployed and who have children with disabilities: the worse off people in our community. That is where the savings are being made in the main. In the last two budgets the government has saved $10 billion from that group of people. As all members of parliament know, they come to your office and say, 'I have not cheated. I am not a fraud; I am not a crook. Why am I being treated like this?' I wonder what government members are saying in response. I find it awfully difficult, and it is not my fault; I voted against it. I knew what the government was doing. I wonder how those who voted in favour of it explain themselves. I wonder how those opposite will explain it to the families in their electorates who miss out on the child disability allowance-the one they are about to vote for. I wonder how they will explain it to their constituents when they ask, 'Why can't I get it? I would have been able to previously. Why did you change it?' Will they talk about the Beazley black hole? What kind of melodramas will they use? More importantly, how do they explain it to themselves? Their constituency understand that, if they can rationalise that, they can rationalise anything. In other words, the double standards that this government is putting forward are overwhelming. We have saving measures dressed up as a simplification; saving measures dressed up as preventing stigmatisation; and saving measures dressed up as making a fairer system. The fact is that you can respect it for a little while, but eventually both the community and those opposite know and understand that this action is deliberate. The government is deliberately deceiving the people of Australia by pretending that these measures are in some way aimed at benefiting the recipients. When one looks at this government, all the way through one looks for the inverse. Whenever a minister says, 'This is good for the people on this system,' look carefully, look really closely because usually you will find that it is not. We have been here through debate after debate and the same things recur. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) moved an amendment, and I guess I am speaking more to the amendment than to the legislation itself. But, as someone who has dealt with community problems and with the departments for some time, when I hear a member of the government talk about simplification via Centrelink, I know what that means in my electorate. It really means a cut in services; it really means there are a lot fewer people doing a lot more work. I quoted in the House not long ago one of the senior staffers of the Department of Social Security who telephoned my office to advise that she was leaving because she could not take any more. She was not leaving simply because what she was being required to do was unfair, unjust and totally unpalatable but because their staff had been reduced and there were fewer of them doing more work. We saw the marketing campaign for Centrelinkand I wonder how much that cost the taxpayers-on the pretence that it is a better system. It is not a better system; it is a cheaper system. It has fewer people doing more work. Centrelink is simply a saving. What we have coming towards us now is a common youth allowance. It sounds terrific. It is a simplification-why have more than one allowance? It is actually about saving money. What the government is really saying is that families with children between 16 and 18 who are not in full-time training and education-because there are not enough places, by some 30,000 or so-will have to look after them. Forget their income, it does not matter. Forget the internal tension in the family. Forget the fact that the child may have a learning disability. Forget any of those things. Those children are their responsibility; they are no longer ours. Those families with young adults up to 21 will have any income support means tested on Austudy rules. This is not a simplification; it is actually a massive saving. That implies that those families should not need support. It implies that they are on a gravy train, as we heard earlier. The implication all the way through is that people who are being supported by our community are somehow inappropriate, somehow improper and are somehow getting a benefit that we should not be giving them or that they should not be asking for. The whole implication of that is that we are giving out charity-we are going back to the last century where our welfare system was a charity system. If you were really down and out and had no hope at all, no dignity and no self-respect then the charities would give you a bit of a hand, the soup kitchens would give you a meal. That is the way it will be in the future. There will be no sense of right as a member of society who has contributed, in many cases, for all of your working life, and then have to pay for the nursing home your taxes built. If you are trying to learn and have a disability or some inequality, education is not an entitlement. You have no rights anymore. You get benefits only if you really are in an undignified mendicant position. So we are going back to the charity model of last century. Step by step every bit of legislation cuts away a bit more. What is it all in the name of? You are either a charity case or you are on the gravy train. That is the simple analysis; you are one or the other. If you are not a charity case then you are on the gravy train, and you should not be on there. People are being told this over and over. What is happening is that people are reluctant, people are withdrawing and not putting themselves forward. And we wonder why there is a sense of insecurity, alienation and despair. On all the figures available on the economy, our employment rate should be growing enormously. Why isn't it? Because out there there is a sense of frantic despair. Uncertainty, insecurity and alienation are growing daily, and you can sense it. For those of us who know our electorates, we know. If we walk down the streets, what are people saying to us? They no longer feel confident. Part of that is because they are being told on the one hand that they themselves are bludgers or on the other that if they are not - all the people getting benefits are. There was a very succinct letter in the newspaper recently which I thought put it very well. It applies right across so many areas. It said something about the lO-point plan taking 400 pages of legislation but that it was all summed up in a biblical statement that one should not covet thy neighbour's possessions. That is a really interesting way of putting it because right across this legislagovernment tion, right across this government's philosophy, is this conceptthat people are somehow cheating, that people are somehow trying to rip off something that they should not be. So there is a sense that all people are things wrong-whether it is in aged care, in unemployment support or in children's disabilities. Of all the people in our community the most vulnerable are children with disabilities. They are caught up in this philosophy, in this new radical Liberalism with a capital 'L'. The member for Jagajaga moved an amendment condemning the government for its assault on low income Australian families. Remember those figures? They have taken $10 billion in two budgets essentially from low income families-and there is more to come. The forward savings in hostels and nursing homes in particular are really quite substantial. Those savings will grow because there is an iceberg effect. They will actually accelerate. So the savings that are being talked about will, in years ahead, be much greater. Somehow the idea is that our aged people want to become squatters in - nursing homes and are silvertails because they own a house in Wickham, Tighes Hill or Islington. They have probably lived in the house for 60 or 70 years. It has all the family memories and history in it and their late husband probably built half of it-and perhaps did so more than once. Those women are being told that they hav- to sell the house, because if they do not they are hoarders or will become silvertail squatters in nursing homes. That is what this government has been saying. If one looks at the comments on the public record by Mr Moran and his company about the aged care changes and then starts working out who gets the savings and where they go to, it becomes fairly clear. The government says simplification; I say hypocrisy. The government says improving the system; I say ripping people out of it. The government says people are manipulating; I say it is the government that is actually rorting. These people are our society and community. They have needs. They are entitled to fairness and decency. From this they are getting neither. They are simply constantly getting the argument about budget cuts and budget savings and this legislation should be opposed.",50
26,Mr HARDGRAVE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"This government is a government which cares. This is a government which shows on a daily basis that it cares in a sensible, straight forward and transparent way, while those opposite seem to spend their time scaring various groups in our community. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), was talking about all sorts of matters in his contribution today. He was talking about matters relating to aged care, to families and to disabled children. When are we going to get some decent conduct from those opposite in the debates before us in this place on a daily basis about matters important to groups in our community? When are we going to get an opposition that ceasefires on this unbelievable ongoing scare campaign, picking on vulnerable groups in our community, making them feel more and more insecure, creating greater insecurity and uncertainty in the broad community, and impacting on people's desire to get on with their lives and invest in themselves, their businesses, families, friends and, indeed, their country? When are we going to get an opposition that stops picking on older Australians on a daily basis, gladly trying to gamer votes over the emotional carcasses of a generation that has given so much to this country, which has survived depression, wars and created a legacy for people of my generation? When are we going to get an opposition that starts to deal fairly with the facts, instead of daily getting on the wireless, on the television and in the press continuing to perpetuate rumour, innuendo and mistruths, all of which are hurting everyday Australians? The previous speaker suggested that any cutback in expenditure had to be bad. Mr Deputy Speaker, I submit that, if throwing money at problems in this country had indeed solved problems in the past, then the previous Labor government would not have had one thing left to be fixed. When we came to power there were that many things lacking and wanting, and throwing money at a problem simply does not fix it. Looking at the individual needs of individual Australians and attempting to get a bureaucratic framework that accommodates that variety of needs and aspirations is really about fixing the problems in this country; not just throwing money at it. The member for Newcastle has stated today that he is against those students who decide to stay on through to year 12. He is against the common youth allowance. That is an initiative by this government to help those who, because of financial circumstances, may have been tempted to leave secondary education to go out and work like some of their peers. The previous system encouraged them to just simply leave school and go on the dole. Of course, the common youth allowance will reward those students who choose to stay in high school to better themselves and, of course, in time the entire community. It also recognises university students in the same sort of way. The member for Newcastle-I imagine he is speaking for all of those opposite in the Labor opposition-is against such fairness. He is against convenience for Australians as far as Centrelink is concerned, the one-stop shop approach which allows in a lot cases elderly Australians and everyday Australians in general to be able to access government services in one location, instead of traipsing all over town. He seems to be against Australians being treated as individuals. It really disappoints me to see the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) getting to her feet every day in this place continuing to hurt people in my electorate, elderly Australians who are very frustrated and concerned by the quite ridiculous over the-top headlines that she generates each day. I do not blame the media for reporting her. After all, she is using an elephant man type of approach to draw attention to herselfanything for a vote. I would like to deal now with this bill. I think it was important to put on the record in this place my absolute contempt for the disgraceful scare campaign that the Labor opposition quite knowingly and quite devoid of all the facts keeps embarking upon daily in this place. It is certainly part of my job-and in my electorate I am doing my bit-to dispel Labor's lies. This bill contains measures that were announced in the 1997-98 budget and also one non-budget item. This really is all about fairness. It is all about simplification. It will introduce a single parenting payment which replaces the current sole parent pension and the parenting allowance. This new payment will start on 20 March next year. It simplifies income support arrangements for parents whether they are partnered or not. People with child rearing responsibilities after all will be well supported by this government. This measure also aims to remove the stigma, which is often attached in our society to those who receive a sole parent pension, by putting everybody under one status. If you are a parent, whether you have a partner or not, your child is important and this government is supporting you through these measures. In practical terms the parenting payment aligns the various conditions under the existing payment schemes and, as a result, arrangements are simplified for the administration of this program, especially for those people whose status moves from lone to partnered parenting and, of course, in reverse. After all, it is the children who suffer under the current arrangements which Labor left us. As people's status change, parents have to cancel one payment before they can access another. The basic standard conditions for accessing these payments-income testing, rates of assistance and concession cards-will and continue. I do not understand what the member for Newcastle was saying in his contribution. After all, a parenting allowance, as well as the sole parent pension, has in the past-as will this new payment-been paid to assist in the raising of children. The new single parenting payment is a sensible and just measure by the Howard government. It recognises a parent has a responsibility for the caring and raising of their children, regardless of marital status. It is certainly consistent with the hallmark of this government-simplicity, common sense, people focused and fair. This bill also amends social security allowance provisions aimed at simplifying the hardship rules which apply in relation to the ordinary waiting period, the liquid assets waiting period and the income maintenance period. Labor left us a raft of rules of waiver for various waiting periods in the legislation and they were certainly very inconsistent. They had different definitions of hardship and different types of expenditure were considered. It was very confusing and very difficult to administer and everyday Australians deserve better. This bill makes the amendments necessary to introduce a common approach and a common sense approach at that. The hardship rules are standardised. The first requirement, severe financial hardship, has· a simple test and that is summed up in these words, 'is a person's readily available funds less the appropriate fortnightly rate of allowance.' It is very simple to follow. The bill also fixes up some other unfairness which was left by Labor when it comes to the liquid asset waiting period. Unlike Labor, we recognise the need to allow this to be partially waived. This will align the liquid assets waiting period provisions with those applying to the income maintenance period. For both these particular aspects, the liquid assets waiting period and the income maintenance period, the simple, easy to follow requirement is that the expenditure which caused the severe financial hardship must have been unavoidable and essential-things such as emergency medical treatment or perhaps the mortgage rent payments falling due in the waiting period. They are real life examples of what goes on and what individual Australians face every day and every week. These are matters which the Labor Party had chosen to ignore during its time in office. This whole thing is fair. This is all about caring about the particular circumstances in which individual people find themselves from time to time. This is not a cold bureaucracy crushing people, as those opposite might like to suggest. It is not about a bureaucracy crushing people when they are at their most vulnerable. This is just another one of those sensible measures which the Howard government has undertaken which the Labor Party never took. We have heard this morning that throwing money at a problem fixes it. We now have $10 billion worth of reasons to show that that was never the case. As a result of these changes, this bill amends and also simplifies the data matching program assistance and the tax act 1990. It will remove references to specific payment and program types dealt with by the social security portfolio and replace these with a generic reference. This will remove the need to make legislative amendments each and every time a new payment is created or an old payment is removed. Other amendments will also be made to the act to streamline the administration of the program. Therefore, not just the end user-not just the Australian who receives the benefit from the government-but also the process and the system will be simplified and streamlined. All of this reflects a sensible, caring and downright decent reform and yet another one that this government has introduced in so many bills. It is certainly reflected in this bill. This bill makes sensible and decent changes which will also help the parents of children with disabilities. Significant reforms in the area of child disability allowance will come as a result of this bill. A simpler assessment process and child disability assessment tool will be used for all new claims for child disability allowance from 1 July 1998. This assessment criteria will measure the impact of a child's disability on his or her functional ability, communication, mobility, self-care and community living standards against developmental milestones. The honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough) in his contribution today read a number of references and endorsements from organisations around this country which applaud the fact that the government has recognised the range of disabilities which exist in Australia today and that there are many individuals with their own individual disabilities which need assessment and this government has acted. The measure will also assess a child's behaviour, emotional state and special care needs. This is not a matter of keeping people simply as numbers within a system and applying the criteria that they either get it or they do not. This is all about helping individuals and treating them as individuals. This is all about helping children who are profoundly deaf and helping people with attention deficit disorder. This is all about looking after the extra special needs of children and also their parents and their carers. We are making child care available to parents and carers at a greater rate than the Labor Party did. It is up to 63 days and my mathematics tells me that is a 50 per cent increase on Labor. The Montrose Home for Crippled Children in Queensland, which is just outside my electorate, has said that this new assessment tool appears satisfactory for use by their clients and they have mentioned a number of other matters. They applaud the need for a list of manifest conditions to provide fast track entry into the program for children with severe disabilities which are unlikely to improve, and they also hope that this will obviate the need for full-scale regular review of these children's entitlements. After all, the emotional state of parents and carers, not to mention the children involved when they have to face ongoing and needless reassessments as their condition deteriorates or improves, is something this government wants to try and alleviate with this bill. The assessment tool is a simpler, more objective means of assessing eligibility for child disability allowance than the current criterion of 'substantially more care and attention'. It is a more objective method of assessment for parents and treating medical professionals. It is meant to minimise the subjectivity and inconsistency of the current criteria-the criteria the Labor Party left us. It will reduce the number of reviews and appeals. It will increase the level of understanding of the program by staff, parents and the medical profession. This is a measure which will address matters Labor ignored for years in office. As a result of this bill, parents with very disabled children, who have been concerned that the child disability allowance payment has not worked properly over recent years, have reason to be happier. The reality of it all is tough enough for them without the bureaucracy and the system making matters worse. So, as a result of this bill, we have set the rules. We have acted. We have listened to what those people have told us and we have done something about it. It is not a matter of throwing more money at a problem. It is a matter of using resources correctly and ensuring the problems are solved. I said in my first contribution in this place last year that maintaining a system in itself seems to have been the basis of government up until the Howard government came to power. We are all about getting outcomes-outcomes for people and outcomes which make sure this country and its people benefit by the process of taking tax dollars, expending them and targeting them. A list of manifest disabilities and a list of chronic medical conditions attached to the assessment tool tables will provide fast-track entry to the program and less frequent medical reviews. This is something which will be welcomed by parents of children with disabilities. Those who have already received the child disability allowance will be protected by a five-year savings provision. We will also increase the number of days allowed in the temporary cessation of care provisions and a reduction in the maximum period for which child disability allowance arrears are payable. This bill also seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 for the purpose of health care cards. A couple of changes are there. The first is a part of the major overhaul of the child disability allowance. Due to the amendments to the child disability allowance qualification criteria for a disabled child, some parents or guardians may not qualify for child disability allowance so, instead, we assist those children by maintaining their eligibility personally for a health care card. Currently there is an assessment period of four weeks over which a person's income is assessed for the purpose of determining whether they are a low income, disadvantaged person who is eligible for a health care card. The second measure in these changes is that the government is extending this to eight weeks. Finally, in a procedural sense-though it fits the theme of this bill in this government by making changes that are simple, straightcertainly forward and easy· to understand-we are changing the term of 'family payment' to 'family allowance'. Again, it is a sensible people-focused measure to help people more easily understand their entitlements and indeed the social security system itself-a system which became cumbersome and impersonal over the years of Labor; a system which seemed to perpetuate its own importto ance rather than necessarily generating proper outcomes. Various terms have changed over the years. 'Family allowance' was part of and probably still is, even though it was an term used to describe family payment entitlejourned. ments between 1987 and 1992. But the term 'family allowance' is, as described in this bill, a non-discriminatory, straightforward and selfdescriptive one-one which will be appreciated by those parents who have partners and those parents who are sole parents in their own right. It will help them in the sense that first time. it will remove the temptation from some smal.l-minded people in our, community to unfatrly label parents who are running the difficult battle of raising children on their own. It will remove the stigma they face quite often, unfortunately, in their daily lives. This bill is a sensible bill; it is a sensible measure. I guess, given the weeks of scare campaigns we have heard in this place from those opposite and, unfortunately, throughout the media across the country, it makes sense that the Labor Party will oppose anything that is sensible and that helps people. All they want to do in relation to the measures within this bill is distort the facts-or talk about anything else but the facts in an attempt to grab another headline and in an attempt to hurt more people. Today they have added p-rents of people with a disability to their list of those whom they are trying to scare. They have added those people to the list today in an attempt to cause them emotional harm and grief. They have added them to a list to try to garner some additional votes in a vain attempt to play politics with sensible measures. I think all of us in this place should act in the best interests of this country. This bill does and it is a great pity those opposite continue to try to create scare campaigns, continue to try to create excuses as to and why this government has had to act and has had to crack down on things such as social security fraud to the tune of $19 million a week-$1 billion a year. We have taken the challenges that have been issued to us by many people in Australia. We have listened their concerns; we have acted, and this bill - ertainly proves w- have acted. Those opposIte should stop theIr scare campaigns and get behind this government and assist us with our job of running this country well. I commend the lexicon the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Adams) adNA 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Speaker and read a . , Second Reading",54
27,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill I have just presented is a historic development for the parliament. It provides, for the first time, for the establishment and admi.nistration of a separate Parliamentary ServIce to support the operations of the houses of the Australian Parliament. The staff at present providing the parliament with its support services operate under administrative and staffing structures established by the Public Service Act 1922; however, it has been decided that the parliamentary administration s-ould have its own legislation which recog-Ises and - an dates that the primary obligatIOn of ParlIamentary Service staff is to serve the parliament as a whole. The Parliamentary Service Bill follows as much as possible the philosophy, content and structure of the Public Service Bill 1997, which changes significantly the structure of public service employment, with certain modifications necessary to ensure the independence of the parliament from executive government. It establishes an employment framework which mirrors that proposed for the Australian Public Service generally and provides specifically for the reciprocal mobiliimpartial ty of staff between the two services without loss of accrued entitlements. Arrangements will also be put in place to ensure mobility for staff currently engaged under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act. There are significant differences between the Parliamentary and Public Service Bills which recognise that staff in parliamentary departments serve the houses of the parliament. That distinction is reflected in the object of the bill which is to establish an apolitical Parliamentary Service that is efficient and effective in serving the parliament. The Parliamentary Service Bill contains a statement of Parliamentary Service values and a Code of Conduct, provides for the appointment of a Parliamentary Service Commissioner, makes specific reference to the offices of Clerk of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and provides for appointments to those offices. Tenure as clerk of either house will be for one 10-year period. The bill also stipulates conditions for earlier termination of those appointments. Occupants of the office may retire earlier once they attain the age of 55 years. Secretaries, other than clerks, are to be appointed by the Speaker and the President for five-year terms with termination arrangements similar to those applying to secretaries of executive departments. There are transitional arrangements to ensure the continuation in office of current heads of parliamentary departments. The bill also creates the new office of Parliamentary Service Commissioner with a role similar to that of the Public Service Commissioner. The Parliamentary Service Commissioner will have the task of advising the Presiding Officers with respect to the management practices and policies of the Parliamentary Service and, if requested by the relevant Presiding Officer, of investigating and reporting on specific issues. In broad terms, the Presiding Officers will have the same employment powers as ministers under the Public Service Bill with advice from the Parliamentary Service Commissioner. Consistent with the need to preserve the independence of the clerks as advisers, the Clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate are not to be subject to direction from the Presiding Officers in relation to the nature of their advice provided with respect to either house, to members or to committees. Secretaries of parliamentary departments, including the clerks, cannot be directed in relation to the exercise of their powers in respect of specific individuals. The Presiding Officers will have the power to give secretaries of parliamentary first departments, including the clerks, general directions relating to the management and leadership of the Parliamentary Service. While the bill provides specifically that the Parliamentary Service Commissioner is to be appointed separately and independently by the Presiding Officers, it is expected that normally the same person would fill both of these offices. This would assist in ensuring overall compatibility and consistency between the two services. However, the bill specifically provides that the commissioner cannot be subject to direction by executive government in relation to the Parliamentary Service. Secretaries of parliamentary departments, including the two clerks, are to have the same employment powers as those proposed for departmental secretaries in the Australian Public Service. As mentioned earlier, the bill incorporates a legally enforceable Code of Conduct and a statement of Parliamentary Service values. These values reflect the fact that staff serve the houses but in other respects mirror those of the Public Service Bill, with a parallel reference to the requirement that employment decisions in the Parliamentary Service be based on merit. In summary, this bill gives legislative effect to the decision that the parliamentary administration should not continue to be covered by the standard Australian Public Service Act. It establishes a statutory framework and administrative arrangements broadly consistent with those for the Public Service while incorporattaries ing the changes necessary to accommodate the unique circumstances of serving houses. It provides the houses with a set of arrangements which will allow them to contime tinue to attract and provide a career for staff who will be equipped to deliver the high level of service the houses currently enjoy. The government is presently considering recommendations made by the Joint Committhat tee of Public Accounts in its advisory report on the Public Service Bill 1997, and it is expected that any amendments accepted by the House will be applied in the relevant instances to the Parliamentary Service Bill order to preserve the parallel nature of ployment conditions and to ensure the unfetcorporated tered operation of mobility between the two Bill 1997. services. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned.

28,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Parliamentary Service (Consequential which Amendments) Bill 1997 deals with the conseAmendment quentiallegislative amendments arising from Bill, will do. the provisions of the Parliamentary Service Bill 1997. The Parliamentary Service (Conseorganisations quential Amendments) Bill refers specifically to the following acts: Archives Act 1983; Audit Act 1901; Long Service Leave (Comdefunded. monwealth Employees) Act 1976; Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973; and the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Act 1997. The consequential amendments insert references in the relevant acts to the parliaingly mentary departments established under the provisions of part 6 of the Parliamentary Service Bill 1997, or to the clerks and secrefortunate, of those parliamentary departments, so as to continue the application of those acts to the the parliamentary departments. This bill will come into effect at the same as the Parliamentary Service Act 1997 those commences. The proposed amendments have no financial impact. Transitional arrangements pursuant to the enactment of the Parliathe mentary Service Bill are covered in part 8 of bill and deal with employment matters relating to the staff of the Parliamentary Service in a manner equivalent to the transitional provisions of the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment in Bill.

NA AMENDMENT (PARENTING AND 9THER MEASURES) BILL 1997 BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",60
29,Mr ADAMS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The a previous speaker, the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), said that we never made decisions to make these cuts when we were in government. We certainly did not. We did not prevent 4,000 families with children with disabilities from receiving those benefits, this bill, the Social Security Legislation (Parenting and Other Measures) The member for Moreton spoke about endorsing what this government is doing through this legislation. Organisations that do not endorse this government get Organisations that do not agree, develop policy, have ideas, go against-or threaten to-what this government does will be defunded. This government is a meanspirited government, as evidenced by this bill. As I rise to speak on this bill, I am increasaware that I am one of the fortunate in our society. I am employed, in general good health and relatively young. I know that I am because barely a day goes by when my office does not receive at least one phone call from a constituent who is having problems in making ends meet, including buying food, paying the electricity, the car insurance and the registration, the medical bills and the chemist fees-the list goes on. Many of these people are pensioners: sole parent pensioners, aged pensioners, disability support pensioners and carers of the ill and infirm. This bill seeks to replace the sole parent pension with a parenting allowance, partly to reduce the social stigma of being a sole parent receiving income support. I do not know if this bill will achieve that, but I am sure that renaming something is not going to help people who are struggling to survive on a fixed income. Some of the stigma comes from people on that side who are constantly attacking people on benefits. Struggling families will not be assisted. They will have to follow some very complex and intricate guidelines. To attack the parents of children with disabilities is particularly underhanded. Within this bill's recommendations, 4,000 fewer families with children with disabilities will qualify for child disability allowance because of the new prescription list of disabilities and the use of the child disability assessment tool; 4,500 families will lose up to six months arrears of child disability allowance. Like the aged care legislation, the government is forcing this legislation through without providing the details of the prescription list of disabilities and of the child disability assessment tool. It is a fact that pensioners all categories, but particularly the aged and the sick, are doing it very tough. A low inflation and interest rate environment, coupled with increasing wage rises, means that people on fixed incomes are always going to fall behind-and they are. Low interest rates, welcome as they are, do nothing to help pensioners pay for increases in basic foodstuffs. Low inflation does not take into account things such as charges for home and community care services, which have increased under the present state government in Tasmania, and increases in prescription costs and nursing home charges. These taxes by the Howard government are taxes on the family, the elderly and the sick. Pensioners, who did not even receive the benefit of the September CPI increase, will help pay for them. No-one would dispute that low inflation is a good thing. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) can give thanks to the previous government for the record lows announced this week. It is perhaps time to revisit the idea of using the CPI as the official benchmark for living standards because, in my view, it is beginning to fail. With some foresight, the previous government commissioned a study by the Social Policy Research Centre to review budget standards for Australian families, including pensioners. I await with interest the final report from this research, because I suspect that it will confirm that the CPI has had its day. During the parliamentary break I had the opportunity to visit some of the hamlets that make up my large eleGtorate. Many people that I spoke to told me how hard it was to keep up with increases in the cost of living. If you read the papers today you will see that there are no cost of living increases, yet everybody knows that the cost of living is increasing. Somewhere along the line something is wrong. Pensions are not being increased to meet the cost of living because we are saying that there is no increase in costs, inflation is in decline, interest rates are right down and, according to the CPI, there are no cost increases. Somewhere along the line the CPI is in failing the test, because these people keep telling me that their cost of living is increasing and that they have to find more income, which is difficult because they are on fixed incomes and benefits. Therefore, their standard of living is falling even further behind. The unofficial benchmark of male total average weekly earnings was subject to debate in this House earlier in the week. I am pleased that the government has legislated Labor's long-running practice of pegging pensions to a minimum of at least 25 per cent of the total average weekly earnings. I am also pleased that we, in opposition, were able to remove the government's proposal to impose a five-year sunset clause on this legislation. This proposal exposed the cynicism of this mean-spirited and fiscally obsessed government. How else would an outside observer interpret the unrelenting attacks that this government has made on the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in our society? How else would an outside observer interpret the defunding of organisations set up to represent the interests of pensioners? What a meanspirited thing to do! An organisation which gets a very small amount of money to run a national office and which represents the aged in Australia has been defunded. Mr Miles-Miserable.",60
30,Mr ADAMS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The parliamentary secretary and member for Braddon uses t-e term 'miserable'. That is a good term to describe his government. I would have thought that someone like him, a fellow Tasmanian, might have stood up in the party room and had a go. But I do not think that there are too many on his side standing up in the party room and having a go against the executive that is imposing these harsh decisions on the people of Australia; people who are less able to defend themselves. How else would an outside observer interpret the scrapping of the Commonwealth Dental Health Service and the enforced selling of someone's home just to enable them to get a nursing home bed? This government's retreat from the basic principles of human compassion is to be deplored. But don't just take my word for it, read the papers. You will see that churches, community organisations and social commentators from across the political spectrum are condemning the ruthless attacks by the government on those least able to defend themselves. When Mr Howard was elected to the highest office in the land, he promised to govern 'for all of us' . The shallowness statement is now obvious to all. Australia is fast becoming a country divided through a lack of leadership and an abrogation of the fundamental responsibilities of public administration. As a Tasmanian, it saddens me greatly that the two people who have had primary carriage of much of this legislation, which is proving so destructive to the fabric of our society, come from my home state. The member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith) and Senator Jocelyn Newman have betrayed not only their own constituencies but the rest of Australia as well. Of all people, I would have thought that they at least would have understood the impact of their proposals on people living in rural areas, so many of whom must contend with the problems of isolation and the lack of amenities. But, if they have forgotten-as they seemingly have-I remind them that it is not uncommon for me to hear of instances in my electorate where age pensioners living in rural areas have had to resort to getting food vouchers so they can afford to put petrol in their cars to travel to the city to get even basic medical attention. Mr Miles-Food vouchers to put petrol in their cars?",62
31,Mr ADAMS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The member for Braddon thinks that this is a very funny situation. I will clarify for him what I meant. People need to get a food voucher so that they can afford petrol for their car in order to gain other services that they might need, such as taking someone to receive medical assistance. In areas that I represent, there are many pensioners who live in small hamlets and isolated areas where there is no public transport whatsoever. They need to maintain a vehicle to have any sort of mobility. I believe that these people will soon be unable to even afford to keep their cars on the road. Perhaps, further down the track, the same people will have to sell their homes just to get a nursing home bed in an area hundreds of miles from where their families live. They may be forced to live at the other end of the state, well away from any family support and miles away from where they originally grew of this up and have lived most of their lives. In recent times, a constituent of mine, who is living with his elderly and frail wife whom he cares for just outside one of the small areas in my electorate in the middle of Tasmania, has been told that he has to pay an extra $10 a week towards his community service home help. For a lot of people $10 a week is not a considerable amount of money, but for people on a fixed income, such as a pension, $10 a week-for two visits at $5 each visit-is a considerable amount of money. This man is on a fixed income. He has to run a car in order to take his wife to the doctor, to buy medications or merely to do b,asic household shopping. There is no public transport and no other means of transporting him to the nearest town. But he has been told by the people that run home and community care that he would have to sell his car to meet his obligation of $5 a visit for community home help. I think that it is very. unfair, it is unjust and that it should not occur. But it is occurring. I. believe that it reflects policies of this government and its meanness to ordinary people. There is no dignity left for people who have to struggle to find $10 to enable their partner to have basic health care. This is not helping families stay together. This sort of attitude is becoming the norm rather than the exception in dealing with older people in our community-user pays whether you can afford it or not under this government. Someone ought to remind the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that many Australians currently receiving income support, especially in the form of the age pension, built this country with the taxes they paid during their working lives. Many others defended this country in times of conflict, and most brought up a new generation of Australians in very hard economic times. They have already invested their taxes in what should be a reasonable retirement. We owe them our respect and our support, but all this government is able to offer is excuses and a harsher climate to live in. This bill once again is attacking families, particularly those with children with disabilities and adding to the difficulties of sole parents. These changes cannot be seen in isolation from other parts of the social securithat ty system. Those who have the misfortune of having to rely on government assistance are not being dignified or helped to get out of their poverty traps-these changes merely entrench them further-and the Australian battlers who might have been heartened by the Prime Minister's promises during the election have become Howard's forgotten people, forgotten by this mean-spirited, nasty government.",62
32,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Fisher) (1.49 p.m.)Listening to the contribution made by my colleague opposite, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), one could have been forgiven for thinking that he had forgotten that he was supposed to be addressing the provisions of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997. This bill seeks to implement mostly that budget measures-and one non-budget measure. It also seeks to implement changes which the have been widely accepted in the Australian community. I am very disappointed when I hear those opposite try to suggest that somehow this government is responsible for all of the social problems that we have in Australia. It is interesting to note, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you personally would know, that the former Labor government was in office for 13 years, yet the suggestion is that all of the social problems we have in Australia in 1997 have somehow been caused by the policies of the coalition since its election in March 1996. This particular bill makes a number of changes which will improve the administration of our social security system. This legislation is not designed to hurt those people who are underprivileged or to pull away the social safety net. It is designed to make some very practical changes which are compassionate and which will improve the administration of the social security system. The bill before the House will introduce from 20 March 1998 a new income support payment, the parenting payment, which replaces the sole parent pension payable to lone parents and the parenting allowance payable to partnered parents. Labor suggests we are not looking at the circumstances of those people who are greatly in need. However, this is a very compassionate, sensible and logical change. It will ensure there is not discrimination between those people who are married or in a marriage-like arrangement compared with those who are sole parents. It naturally will reduce the social stigma which currently exists for persons on the sole parent pension. The new payment will also simplify administrative arrangements, particularly in the case of parents whose marital status changes. Under the existing law, when a person's marital status changes, a new application must be made for a payment. But the purpose of the payment in the case of both sole parents and married parents is exactly the same-to assist in bringing up children. This very important change simplifies and clarifies the government's policy. It is a very important change, and I endorse it wholeheartedly. This new payment will improve equity between sole and partnered parents. It is important to note that, despite what those opposite have said, core payment conditions such as rates, income tests and concession cards are maintained. This piece of legislation will also make some changes in relation to the area of the child disability allowance from 1 July 1998. The bill will reform the qualification provisions for the child disability allowance, increase the number of days allowed in the temporary cessation of care provisions and from 1 January 1998 reduce the maximum period before a claim for which arrears of child disability allowance is payable. These measures are part of a broad carer reform package which will improve the targeting of financial assistance to individual carers, increase the adequacy of payments to those with the largest caring loads and help ensure flexible and consistent customer service. The new qualification criteria will provide a simpler and more objective assessment regime for children with a disability through the use of a new child disability allowance tool and a prescribed list of recognised disabilities. The prescribed list will also assist cutting red tape for children with severe medical conditions or disabilities. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) is to be commended for this particular change. We must always be in favour of cutting red tape to ensure that assistance gets through to those people in need. The changes to existing legislation introduced by this bill will certainly make a major contribution to that end. It ought to be noted as well that existing recipients of the child disability allowance will be protected through the insertion of a five-year savings provision. The change in the child disability allowance arrears provision from 12 months to six months will assist in bringing it into line with other social security payment provisions, while still allowing a generous period of arrears to be payable, thus introducing even more consistency into the social security system. The extension of temporary cessation of care provisions from 42 to 63 days will help to standardise respite care provisions and will provide additional assistance to those caring for families with disabilities. The non-budget measure is the change of name from 'family payment' to 'family allowance' from 1 April 1998. While this has no financial impact, it will assist customers to understand more easily the social security system and their entitlements, because many families still use the term 'family allowance' that was used to describe 'family payment entitlements' from 1987 to the end of 1992. This change will also help families to distinguish the family allowance from the new parenting payment. As I said, there is no change other than the name to the structure or entitlement to the payment. It is also important to appreciate that this bill applies consistent hardship provisions to the ordinary waiting period, the liquid assets test waiting period and the income maintenance period from 1 July 1998. The objective of this initiative is to simplify and rationalise hardship provisions for the three waiting periods: the liquid assets test waiting period, the income maintenance period and the ordinary waiting period. These are the three in waiting periods which may be applied to unemployed people before allowance payments can commence. The current legislation allows for any of these waiting periods to be waived when they cause severe or significant financial hardship. However, the waiver rules-would you believe it?-are different for each of the three waiting periods. This is a crazy situation. It would be totally illogical to allow this situation to continue; thus, the legislation before the chamber today brings about more consistency. It was very interesting to listen to the contribution made by the honourable member for Lyons. He accused us of being fiscally obsessed; he said that we were attacking the most disadvantaged; he accused. us of defunding certain organisations; and he said that we were a harsh government making harsh decisions and that we had retreated from human compassion. I do not know whether the honourable member: for Lyons actually had a smile on his face as he made those outrageous allegations concerning the coalition. If he did not, he should have. He knows, I know and the people of Australia know that the Labor Party were in office for the last 13 years prior to our election in March 1996 and during that time they never hesitated to masquerade around as the champions of the underprivileged. Remember the promise of former Prime Minister Hawke when he said that no child would remain in poverty in 1990? That was another promise which was junked by the former Labor government. Can you remember that the gap between rich and poor continued to grow to the stage where it was wider than it had been in living memory? Yet when this government came to office we inherited a budget deficit of $10.3 billion! And the honourable member for Lyons has the absolute hide to accuse us of being fiscally obsessed. Mr Ross Cameron-Shame!",63
33,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is shameful. Prior to the last election, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) assured the coalition and assured the people of Australia that the budget was in surplus. Was it in surplus? It simply was not. He claimed that it was not possible to state exactly what the situation was prior to the election. Yet would you believe that, on the Monday after the Saturday when the Labor Party was reduced to the rump that it now is, all of the figures were there for the incoming government? The former government built up a $10.3 billion deficit. They mortgaged our children's future and our grandchildren'S future. Yet the honourable member for Lyons has the audacity to come into the chamber and accuse this government of being fiscally obsessed. \\e have to run the country the same way as we would run our own household budgets. We simply cannot as a nation spend more than we earn. Consequently, this government has had to make some very difficult decisions. We did not create the problem but we do accept the responsibility for fixing it. We find Labor members coming into the chamber-speaker after speaker--claiming that we are somehow hurting the disadvantaged, that we are making harsh decisions and that we are lacking in human compassion. I ask them: what is compassionate, what is humane about building up the budget deficit to the stage where Australia has mortgaged the future of its children and its grandchildren? I am proud to be part of a party which in government has been prepared to make some very tough decisions and which has been pfepared to say that enough is enough. It is about time that we brought some responsibility into government. This legislation is responsible. It is reasonable, it is fair, it is compassionate, and it is entirely appropriate.",65
34,Mr SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Nursing Homes: Moran, Mr Doug",65
35,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, do you agree with Senator Herron that Doug Moran should be admired? Have you seen a report today of comments by the government's parliamentary secretary, Tony Abbott, that he considers Mr Moran to be·a great Australian? Is it not a fact that Doug Moran is a director of Moran Real Estate Pty Ltd and is reported to have offered to sell homes of elderly people so that they can raise money to pay the entry bond to get into his nursing homes? Minister, now that such a massive conflict of interest has been exposed, will you guarantee to amend the Aged Care Act to protect the frail elderly from these predatory practices? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister is not responsible to this House for statements made by senators, other members or indeed individuals in the community. The question breaches standing order 142, and I ask you to rule it out of order.",65
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am listening very carefully to the question, which at this stage of the game is not finalised. As you would recognise, the member introducing the question . has used some digressions in· setting, through the preamble, the thrust of the question. I will hear the question before I decide on your point of order.",66
37,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will repeat that final paragraph. Minister, now that such a massive conflict of interest has been exposed, will you guarantee that the Aged Care Act is amended to protect the frail elderly from these predatory practices?",66
38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I disallow the point of order; the balance of the question is in order.,66
39,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not aware of the point that you make in the concluding part of your question about the alleged involvement of Mr Moran in a real estate company. In any event, the extent of any individual's business interests is a matter for them. If under the legislation they put themselves in a position where they are in conflict, obviously I would deal with that. On the broader issue that you raise about the involvement of Mr Moran in this industry, it is an acknowledged fact that he is a leading provider of nursing home and hostel care in this country. He is a leading businessman. I do not know the gentleman-I have not met him-but I would not draw the inference that you have, which is that you do not believe that the care that he is providing is in any way adequate. Perhaps you should talk to some of the people who are in his homes. You would surely find that they are very happy with the level of care. The judgment that I must make about these matters relates to improving the extent of the care available for all Australians. There are requirements under the act and under the principles that flow with the act, and all those that provide care are required to meet them. I have no doubt that Mr Moran and any companies that he is associated with will meet those obligations to my satisfaction. Mr MCClelland- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. To inform the minister, I seek leave to table company searches showing Mr Doug Moran's interests. Leave not granted. Women: Assault Case",66
40,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for the Status of Women. Is the minister aware of media reports today detailing the assault on three women by a man highly intoxicated who was subsequently acquitted on grounds relating to the fact that at the time of the assaults he was too drunk to know the consequences of his actions? What actions will the Minister for the Status of Women be taking on this issue?,66
41,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Makin for her question on this matter today. It fills me and many others in the community with a deep sense of sadness and disappointment to hear of a case where a man has been acquitted of assaulting his wife and two unknown women because the court ruled that drunkenness prevented him from being responsible for his actions. It is examples like this that undermine the confidence that Australian women and men have in their protection by the law. Assault is a states and territories offence. However, the Commonwealth is interested in the general welfare of the community, and it has participated in. the development of the model criminal code which deals with many state offences. The so-called drunk's defence to an assault charge still sadly exists in Victoria, South Australia and the ACT. Under Commonwealth law, however, this does not apply, because the Commonwealth follows the model criminal code. The Standing Committee of Attorneys General decided in 1994 that the model criminal code should not provide for this type of defence in relation to basic offences such as assault. The model is similar in approach to the law which applies in other states in Australia and in common law countries such as Britain. I, as would, I am sure, many Australians, agree with the model code. It is totally unacceptable to have such a defence at a tirrie when alcohol and drug abuse are causing so much human pain and suffering in our communities. A person who voluntarily gets drunk and assaults someone should be held responsible. The Commonwealth has set the lead in this regard. I will be talking to my counterparts in the states and territories to encourage them follow the model criminal code. I am encouraged by the ACT government's response, which has now made a commitment to consider this matter at the earliest opportunity. No civic-minded person in our country would tolerate such behaviour. Unfortunately, it appears that the legal system operating in some parts of this country still does. Nursing Homes",66
42,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, I would like to strongly support the words of the Minister for the Status of Women. My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Can you confirm, as reported in the Australian today, that you told Francis Sullivan of the Australian Catholic Health Care Association that, as part of your fine-tuning, the government will plough $80 million of budget savings back into aged care?",67
43,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did indicate yesterday that Mr Sullivan, who represents part of the Catholic aged care services, came to see me the other evening. I had a discussion with him and I have had discussions with a range of other people. I saw that report this morning. I have seen a report from Mr Sullivan, from a radio transcript. I think he takes liberties with what was said to him, because I have made no commitments to anyone. What should be quite clear to the industry and those in this place is that I will consult and monitor and, if I am convinced of a case with regard to fine-tuning, I will take that matter to my senior colleagues for consideration. I will do this as quickly as I can because I am concerned about this continual commitment that you have on that side of the House to scaring people about this policy. This proposal that you continually run in here about misrepresenting this policy, after coming to this whole area with dirty hands and having for 13-odd years not addressed the issue of the capital upgrades and not recognised the demographic pressures on this country, is an abrogation of a responsible opposition. I think there are some in your own ranks now who take. the view that you are acting in a totally irresponsible manner. As I said yesterday, I have extended an to invitation to all those people who have been involved in the committees that were established to continue their participation to make available to me all their views. Mr Sullivan was one of those whose views I respect, but in this instance I think he has taken liberties. Unfair Dismissal Laws",67
44,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minister aware of reports in today's media about the rejection by Labor and the Democrats of the unfair dismissal exemptions and the impact that this will have on job creation by Australian small businesses?,67
45,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Menzies for his question. I certainly am aware of the press reports this morning. They show that the small business community are angry that the Labor Party and the Democrats should block a measure which would give people a chance of a job. They are right to be angry because it was Labor that created the problem; now they are opposed to and blocking the measures which will fix the problem, particularly for the small business community. I heard the opposition saying, 'Oh, it's not a problem. ' We knew you were out of touch when you were in government; you are still out of touch. You ought to pick up the papers and read what ordinary Australians are saying about the decision that you have taken. Mr MCMullan-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. My point of order relates to relevance. The example to which the minister is referring is actually covered by the New South Wales state legislation, not the federal legislation.",67
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Canberra. The minister is using examples to embellish an answer, and I am reasonably comfortable with his answer thus far.",68
47,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to answer their point. The fact is that in Australia we have federal and state jurisdictions and we ought to have an unfair dismissal exemption in both the federal jurisdiction and in the state jurisdiction. Mr MCMullan-On a further point of order, Mr SPEAKER ",68
48,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is a debating point; it is not a point of order.,68
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will see. Mr MCMullan-On a second matter of relevance, Mr Speaker: there are exemptions in the Workplace Relations Act to cover the circumstances covered by the case covered by it and therefore it is irrelevant to the question.",68
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,68
51,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is just a stupid debating point from an opposition that has no idea about small business. It could not give two hoots about small business. It is certainly not interested in the people who are unemployed as a result. If you want a touch of reality, you ought to read this article about what Vicki MCFarlane from Parramatta says. Mr Speaker, did you want a copy of it?",68
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, my lips were sealed actually. I was just groping for words.",68
53,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted to have your attention, Mr Speaker. Today's Daily Telegraph said: Hairdresser Vicki MCFarlane was ready to take on two new staff members at her Parramatta salon in time for Christmas. We say: why shouldn't she be able to? Why shouldn't we have a system that encourages the Vicki MCFarlanes of this world to give people employment? As she said yesterday, 'We feel betrayed by what the Senate has done.' How right she is. What a sensible comment. They talk about the New South Wales scheme. At the state ALP conference the other day even the CFMEU said that the New South Wales system ought to be fixed up and it ought tei introduce some of the measures we have in the federal scheme. Beyond the common sense of this hairdresser in Parramatta, Mr Rob Bastian of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia was asked to comment on this matter. He said that small business would create 50,000 jobs if this matter could go through the Senate. Those are 50,000 jobs we will not have as a result of the actions of the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate. Lastly, just to round off the overwhelming evidence to support the need for this measure to create jobs, the Chief Executive of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce, Katie Lahey, said this about the Labor Party: By blocking the proposed reasonable revisions, the Federal Opposition and the Democrats have put petty politics first, at the cost of jobs and especially jobs for young people. She says: For the Opposition to claim that there has been no independent research proving business concern on this issue is nonsense-it shows how little attention they have paid to the needs and concerns of the small business community. She went on to recount: In May this year, the Chamber in its St George Business Expectation survey, asked over 800 businesses whether the prospect of unfair dismissal claims discouraged them from adding additional staff to their businesses. How many were affected by it? Fifty-six per cent of these businesses said it had stopped them from employing more staff. Commonsense, anecdotal evidence, survey evidence, Morgan and Banks, Recruitment Solutions, the Bell committee-it is clear, it is obvious that what is required is that, if we are to have more jobs between now and Christmas, this measure should go through. The opposition stand condemned for their hypocrisy to be claiming concern about unemployment and now opposing a sensible measure to fix it. Nursing Homes: Moran, Mr Doug",68
54,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, can you confirm a report in today's Sydney Morning Herald that the government's nursing home policy had its genesis in your office while you were being advised by a consultant to the Doug Moran nursing home empire? Can you explain why Mr Moran has boasted of his leading role in helping design your nursing home policy? Minister, who was the architect of the government's nursing home shambles? Was it you or was it Mr Moran?",69
55,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not responsible for nursing homes.,69
56,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on that. The minister happens to be the portfolio minister for this policy. He is the minister for this area. If he cannot be questioned on it, who can be? He carries their business in the cabinet. He is the portfolio minister.",69
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Opposition members-Oh!,69
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was indulging you because I thought that you were going to bring the point of order that I had not called the minister, which I had not. But the minister has already effectively accepted the call and responded. Average Weekly Earnings",69
59,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the significance of the average weekly earnings figures released today? Could the Treasurer also explain what the consequences would be for interest rates and unemployment if wages rose significantly faster than inflation?,69
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The preliminary ABS figures released today show that full time adult ordinary time earnings rose 1.6 per cent over the three months to August and 4.1 per cent over the year. That was somewhat in excess of market expectations, although it should be noted that in fact the previous quarter had been considerably lower than expected-the rise had been 0.3 per centand it may well be that the strong rise in the September quarter was partly as a consequence of the lower preceding quarter. The stronger growth in the AWOTE in the September quarter could well be because the timing of wage increases was held back in relation to the living wage claim safety net adjustments and it may well be that a few major bargaining negotiations have flowed through in this quarter. The importance of the figures, however, is that we in Australia are now at a time of historically low inflation. Yesterday's figures, the best figures since 1962, the best figures in 35 years, showed an underlying inflation rate of 1.5 per cent. If wages are moving at around four per cent, either they would have to be based on very high productivity or, alternatively, they could cut into profits. One of the consequences of cutting into profits could be a response in relation to overall levels of employment. So it is very important not just that inflation be low but that inflationary expectations fall as well. I urge employers in Australia who are looking at their wage settlements in the course of the forthcoming year to bear in mind that, on an inflation rate of 1.5 per cent, a 1.5 per cent increase in wages would maintain purchasing parity. Any additional wage increase should be based squarely in relation to productivity. If it is not based squarely in relation to productivity, that does have the basis either to cut into profits or eventually to put inflation pressures back into the system. These are preliminary figures. These are figures, as I said, which over the course of the year are within the range which the Reserve Bank and the government have been targeting. But for a quarterly figure they are quite high at the level of 1.6 per cent. It is important, if we are to obtain the full benefits of low inflation in relation to the employment situation in Australia, that wage outcomes are consistent with low inflation. That will take a great deal of adjustment. For many people in business who have not seen an inflation climate as good as this one, because we have not had one for 35 years, that will involve some adjustment of expectations and should be factored into wage settlements by employers and employees alike. East Timor: Death of Journalists",69
61,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Given the new evidence that five Australian journalists were murdered by the Indonesian armed forces in East Timor in 1975, will the foreign minister initiate a UN war crimes investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice?",70
62,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. I can answer his question simply by saying no, we will not. The question reflects on the serious question of the death of the five journalists East Timor back in 1975. The House will be well aware that Mrs Wilhelmina Rennie, the mother of the deceased journalist Malcolm Rennie, has been in Canberra during the last week. Yesterday I took the opportunity to speak with Mrs Rennie and, while she did not put forward a proposal quite the same as yours, from recollection it is her would like yet another judicial-or some sort of judicial-inquiry into this matter. The previous government, through the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, commissioned Tom Sherman to conduct an inquiry into additional evidence that came forward, I think from recollection, in 1995. Mr Sherman, who is respected by all sides in this House, conducted a very professional inquiry. He visited Portugal and other parts of the world. He met with officers of my department.. I think he took evidence from something like 33 different people. It was a very extensive inquiry. I want to add one thing, that is, it been argued that the Australian government had intelligence information which was of great significance to the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the five journalists. Bearing in mind the controversy there has been for many years about that intelligence material, I did agree to allow Mr Sherman to investigate that material. The member for Moore can read Mr Sherman's conclusions in the Sherman report. I regarded the Sherman report as an extraordinarily good document. I think the opposition would agree with that. It was very comprehensive. But we cannot keep having inquiry after inquiry after inquiry into this incident, which very tragically occurred some 22 years ago. The previous government and the present government-whatever you can say about previous governments before that have behaved very responsibly on this issue. We have asked the Indonesians if they can provide us with any more information. They have said that as far as they are concerned the matter is closed. All members of this House know that I cannot force anybody to provide information. We have given all parties the opportunity to contribute through the inquiry in by Mr Sherman and, frankly, I do not think there is much of great use that the Australian government can do except to say that if new information is brought forward we are always happy to have a look at it.",70
63,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. What level of evidence is required for the minister to initiate an approview that she priate new inquiry?",70
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will not uphold the supplementary question. Greenhouse Gases,70
65,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, what is the government's response to President Clinton's announcement of the US greenhouse gas emission target? Does Australia support the US announcement and share the US view of the role of developing countries in the climate change negotiations? Is the minister also aware of recent statements by the British environment minister suggesting that Australia's negotiating position on clihas often mate change lacks credibility?",70
66,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that this whole issue of climate change is one that he has a great deal of interest in and I am sure that the constituents in the electorate of O'Connor, more broadly, have an interest in. Certainly Western Australians do. Australia welcomes the fact that President Clinton's announcement of the US negotiating position for Kyoto reflects the particular national circumstances of the United States and unequivocally rejects the European Union's 15 per cent reduction proposal. All three majors, the United States, Japan and the EU, now have their own different emission targets on the table, demonstrating that differemissions entiation is the only workable outcome for these negotiations. While we are still studying the details of the US proposal, Australia agrees with the underlying principles and three essential elements of the United States position. First, we do agree on the need for realistic and achievable targets. Secondly, there must be flexibility to reduce emissions through cost effective, market based approaches. Thirdly, we fully agree that Kyoto must provide for future developing country commitments on limiting their emissions. Climate change is a global problem and it does require a global response. The call yesterday in Bonn by the so-called G77, the developing countries, for a 35 per cent reduction in emissions by developed countries by the year 2020 with no parallel obligations for developing countries is unrealistic and environmentally a poor outcome. The House may be interested to know that by 2020 it is projected that developing countries will account for about half of all global emissions. So obviously developing country emissions will have to be addressed if we are to be serio,us about addressing the overall problem of climate change. The House knows that the Australian government is prepared to pull its weight to address the issue of greenhouse emissions and the question of climate change. We are in the process of doing that and we want an outcome in the negotiations which is fair and equitable but which is going to be effective. The honourable member for O'Connor also asked about some statements made-which appeared on Australian television last nightby the British Minister for the Environment, Michael Meacher, that were critical of Australia's position. Can I say in response to that, first of all, that our Prime Minister had a constructive discussion yesterday with Prime Minister Blair about this issue. Secondly, can I say that I find it, and the Australian government finds it, very difficult to understand why it is that the British government is asking Australia to reduce its emissions by 15 per cent but it is saying that the Portuguese government can increase its by 40 per cent; that the Spanish government can increase its emissions by 17 per cent; and that the French government does not have to reduce its emissions, yet France is the world's fourth largest economy. So, when the British government asks us to reduce our emissions by 15 per cent, we ask why they do not ask the French to reduce their emissions by 15 per cent, or the Portuguese to do the same, or the Spaniards or the Greeks. We are looking for a serious and equitable solution to this problem and one that is fairfair to Australia and fair to other parts of the world-and one ultimately that involves developing countries and achieves some sort of overall global solution to the problem. Nursing Homes: Veterans",70
67,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Minister, yesterday you failed to rule out that veterans and war widows would be exempt from the nursing home bond. Will you now assure those people who have served the nation so courageously that they will not have to pay nursing home bonds? If not, why not?",71
68,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whether they pay and how much they pay is something between the aged person and their family or their carer and the facility they choose to enter. The funds raised through the accommodation bond go to the aged care facility. If you are prepared to sit back there and see veterans live in substandard aged care facilities, four or five to a room, you ought to be condemned for that. We are not prepared to see our ageing veterans live like that. The demand on the aged care facilities from the veteran community will peak in the year 2005. If you are prepared to see them live in those conditions, you ought to be condemned by them. In terms of bonds, $13,000 is the only number you need to know, because that is the absolute maximum anyone will end up paying from their bond if they stay for five years. Any person who is in an aged care facility for six months or less will pay nothing. I also remind members on the other side of the House that hardship provisions are provided for under the legislation. I just ask how many on that side of the House have been out there to the aged care providers or the veteran community and have tried to explain the changes. Not one of them. All they have tried to do is prey on the most vulnerable in our community. That is what you have done. You are preying on the most vulnerable in our community and you are going to use our veterans, our war widows and our prisoners of war in a cheap, tacky political stunt. You ought to know better. Youth Unemployment",71
69,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Erriployment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs-a good minister. Is the minister aware of alternative strategies on the issues of youth unemployment? What impact would these strategies have on the prospects of young people seeking jobs, particularly in my electorate of Canning?",72
70,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Canning for her question,72
71,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question is clearly entirely hypothetical. It refers to alternative suggestions and what impact they would have. It is clearly out of order.",72
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,72
73,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We received an interesting fax last night. The author of the fax was the member for Batman and it was addressed to the member for Jagajaga and the member for Werriwa. What was in the fax? Was it a secret factional deal to topple the Leader of the Opposition, or was it Chardonnay Cheryl's list of hors d'oeuvres for the next caucus radical chic soiree?",72
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will address the question.,72
75,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, this fax was Labor's secret plan to destroy the common youth allowance. What it reveals is that the Labor Party has no regard whatever for truth or the facts when it comes to public debate on these important issues that affect jobs for young people. It is only interested in playing political games with the lives of young people. Let me spell it out for the people of Australia. Labor is against the youth allowance. Just as it opposed work for the dole and the principle of mutual obligation, it is against giving a positive message to young 16and 17-year-olds that their future lies in investing in their own education and training and improving their skills. Labor supports young people dropping out of school and going on the dole. That is absolutely clear from this secret plan. What this plan reveals is that what Labor has in mind and what the member for Batman has in mind is another vicious campaign of misinformation to scare young people around this country. They have spelt it out in detail. They are going to go around the country telling young people that the government has cut $270 million off vocational education and training and that apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities in this country are declining. What is the truth? The truth is that vocational education and training expenditure under this government is up $144 million over the spending in the last year of the Labor government. The fact is that the number of new apprenticeships and traineeships has risen now to 98,000 in 1996-97, the highest ever and up 20 per cent over last year. But the most alarming part of this secret plan is that Labor's plan to get young people jobs is to bring back Working Nation. This is the limit of the capacity of the member for Batman. He says, 'We are going to get young people back into education or training or work through active programs of assistance, as previously implemented under Working Nation.' We have caught you red-handed! What the member for Batman wants to bring back is this failed $10 billion spending program which demoralised a generation of young people through short-term training programs, and of course this proposal follows hot on the heels of the proposal of the member for Kingsford-Smith to add $8 billion to the foreign aid bill. Does the Leader of the Opposition know that his ministers are planning these massive new spending programs? Or has he totally lost control of what is happening on his side of the House? The fact is that he is a weak Leader of the Opposition; he has no knowledge of what is going on on his side of the House. The Labor Party has no regard for truth. It is for high taxes and for big spending and it has no idea whatsoever about how to create jobs for young Australians. Nursing Homes",72
76,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, have you seen the model resident agreement which has been drawn up for elderly Australians entering nursing homes? Can you confirm that this agreement contains 47 pages of legalistic gobbledygook? Minister, given the trouble that you have had this week reading and comprehending a one-page question time brief on at least two or three questions, do you really expect frail, ill, disoriented older people to read and comprehend this document? Are you also aware that your representative in the other place, when invited to answer the same question, simply said 'Yes'?",73
77,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In actual fact, as I understand it from people who have spoken to me, it was you who messed up in the middle of question time this week with those ridiculous questions about the $500 million.",73
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will address the question.,73
79,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You missed the whole point of the question that you were asked to put to me, so it is a little bit rich you to now accuse me of not understanding this portfolio. If you understood what was going on, you would know that you should be supporting this policy in a way that leads the elderly in this country to get a higher level of standard of care and enables us to deal with the increasing aged demographic. As for the document to which 'you refer, I am not sure what Senator Herron said but I am assuming he said yes, that is a guide that is available to assist people to enter into the agreement that is required to give effect to the policy and people can take what advice they need-and they are advised to take as much advice as possible-from their family, from their doctor, from those within the ACATs and all of those sorts of people that are out there in the community-indeed all of the people that were involved in the consultation process. That includes, I might mention, the Catholic Church, which put out a strong press release supporting the legislation after it was passed. They are the types of people that will help. We are providing as much information as we possibly can to the professional sector to ensure that the people, as they go into the homes after having been independently assessed as to their needs-this is a scheme based on needs, not means-and having made the decision to go into a home for their medical supervision, are assisted with those forms. This agreement will give all the information and guidance that is required. Railways",73
80,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. The minister would be aware of the loss making activities of Commonwealth-run railways under the previous government, including the train services which run through my electorate of Parkes. In the light of this, could the minister advise the House of the new opportunities emerging in rail in Tasmania following the sale of Tasrail? Does this have application to other areas of ' Australia?",73
81,Mr V AILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. He takes a for great deal of interest in the rail reforms that the coalition government is undertaking. Mr Martin-Is that a train?,73
82,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, there is a train on the tie; that is exactly right. You are very observant. As a result of the government's successful privatisation process and the sale of Tasrail as part of the AN process, there are some great opportunities developing in Tasmania with the expansion of Tasrail and with the Australian, Transport Network, which bought the Tasrail outfit. They are creating the opportunities for new investment and new jobs in Tasmania. This contrasts with what happened in Tasmania under the regime of the former government, when the Labor Party was in charge and more than a thousand jobs were lost m the rail industry. Now the nul industry in Tasmania has a very bright future with a new direction. I quote from an article on 19 October in the Sunday Examiner headlined 'Upgrading planned': The Commonwealth sold the Tasrail operation for $22 million in August. The new owner, Australian Transport Network, a consortium which consists of some of the world's biggest and most respected narrow-gauge rail operators-plans to 'double freight carried within five years'. An article in the Australian Financial Review on 13 October quoting Mr Ed Burkhardt from ATN said: ATN is committed to spending $20 million but plans to outlay $40 million over the next four years, which will mainly be spent on locomotives, tracks and wagons and other infrastructure. Some Tasmanian lines may be re-opened and others upgraded. Those ones they are proposing to re-open were lines that were closed under Labor. Mr Burkhardt said: I'd like to double the business over a five year period or even two-and-a-half years. I am more comfortable with that number. If we double our business, we'll more than double our employees. That is what is going to happen in Tasmania following the positive action of the coalition government with regard to rail reform. I would also like to comment on the processes. As the member for Parkes mentioned in his question, with the wider reform in rail across Australia, I think it is to be recognised that the reforms which were started by the former minister and which I propose to continue will have great benefits for the economy right across Australia. In conjunction and cooperation with the states right across Australia, we propose to put together a national. track authority which will address the regulatory speed bumps that still exist in rail in Australia. Taking that course of action, there will be a net benefit to the bottom line of the Australian economy. It will provide a far more competitive rail transport network right across Australia. I highlight again that we are doing that in cooperation with the states. This contrasts with what was done under the 13 years of Labor, when we saw thousands of jobs lost in the tail industry, particularly with AN and particularly in South Australia, where AN was gutted-there were 7,000-odd jobs lost. We have turned that around and we are seeing that private investment in rail infrastructure in Australia is going to generate jobs, not Jose them. Family Trusts",73
83,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will you confirm that, as indicated by the registers of members' and senators' interests, up to 19 members of your front-bench stand to benefit from the special treatment given to family trusts in your proposed new trust loss legislation? What possible public policy reason could there have been for you retaining a particular form of protection for family trusts relating to income injections by other family members which is an obvious means of tax avoidance and one which the previous Labor government acted to remove?",74
84,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, let me deal with the facts. The facts of the matter are that the previous government announced in 199596 that it would produce legislation to prevent trafficking in trusts. It said this in its budget: A family trust will be able to deduct losses, provided that members of the same family continue to control and benefit from the trust. That is what it said. That is what the legislation was supposed to do. Of course, when the legislation was introduced, because of the outcry that it did not actually accomplish that, it was sent off to a Senate committee. This government said that we would put it out for public debate so that the legislation as drafted accomplished the objects. And what were the objects? To prevent trafficking in trusts. In the 1995-96 budgets, that .is what it was called: 'Trafficking in trusts', 'Trafficking in trust losses', 'Trust losses-measures to prevent trafficking'. The trouble was that that was not what your legislation did. Your legislation made it not possible, where a family traded through trusts, to offset losses and income. And, after public discussion, the government announced that it would bring in the legislation to allow that, so that, where families were operating through the trust structure, they would not be denied losses against income. Otherwise, what would the situation be? If you made a loss and you made some income, you would pay tax on your income but you could not offset it against your loss. Of course, that was not intended to be the outcome of the legislation, nor would we have allowed that. That quite sensible outcome-and I notice it is an outcome which some business magazines and others still say is far too tough on families-is apparently now opposed by the shadow minister concerned. What do we find? We find the Labor Party now scrounging around through these declarations. They are at it again, looking for the mud to try to throw in relation to the newspapers. Here he isMr Crean-Who is talking?",74
85,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You started throwing mud at everybody, my friend, and it came back and it walloped you on the nose! The member for Hotham was the man who went on the television and claimed he had downloaded the DAS computer. Remember that? 'I've downloaded the DAS computer,' he was saying, out there scheming on the televisions on the weekend, muckraking around the place. And what do we find? Last week they recruited Cheryl Kernot and now they are going to be the party of cleanness and light. And what are we at today? We are going through declarations of interest. We are putting people's financial affairs out there. We are trying to get these headlines up, to try to blacken names. I tell you: Cheryl will be disgusted with you. Cheryl will think to herself, 'That nice Mr Gary Evans who wooed me has turned into a terrible marriage partner.' She will say to herself, 'I thought these people were into higher standards, and what do I find? I find they are the same snaky people that they were when I wouldn't join them.' I say to Cheryl: 'Don't give up on them yet, Cheryl.' They may actually find some standards, but it will take a lot of reeducation.",75
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I call the honourable member for Lindsay. Mr Costello-No sl1pplementary? Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, he looks as though he wants a supplementary question.",75
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer has concluded his answer. I have called the member for Lindsay. I did think you had an opportunity, though. Defence Industry Miss JACKIE KELLY-My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Minister, what does the outcome of the recently announced tender for defence information technology services mean for Australian small business? Does the government have any plans to further assist the development of Australian small businesses involved in defence industry?",75
88,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lindsay for her question, because I know the interest that she has in information technology and the opportunity we have to create important jobs for young Australians. The recently announced tender is that relating to CRISP, which is part of the Russell redevelopment program. It is concerning the overall computing infrastructure desktop hardware and standard office operating products for Russell. The importance of this contract is that, firstly, it is a $27 million contract of which $8.8 million-or about 30 per cent of the contract for systems integration-will go directly to Australian small and medium enterprises. Secondly, there is another $6 million which will go to IPEX, which will provide desktop devices from its Melbourne . manufacturing facility, and its associated printer production of Lexmark will be manufactured in Sydney. This contract is also of importance in that it is in accordance with that important principIe this government supports that I brought in which says that we require large foreign firms doing business here in Australia not to exclude SMEs by using vertically integrated companies in their tenders but to nurture and look after small and medium enterprises which are Australian, so that Australian individuals get the opportunity to work in these important areas. Overall, that principle means that small and medium enterprises in regional and rural Australia, where defence industry is so important, will get a go so that we can see job creation in those parts of Australia where it is so desperately needed. Family. Trusts",75
89,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address a further question to the Treasurer. How can the Treasurer pretend that his trust loss legislation effective tax avoidance measure when, with the exemption which he has introduced-not in our original legislation-any family trust carrying it loss can be used to provide tax free income to just about any other family member? Where is the public interest-to take just one example-in enabling the sister, nephew or niece of someone with a family trust to transfer into that trust property income of half a million dollars, to write that off against accumulated losses in the trust of that amount or more, and then get back the half a million dollars distributed to them tax free? Where is the public interest in that? Where was that exemption in our legislation? What are you doing about tax avoidance, other than talking about it? Mr Charles- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am confident that the Treasurer wants to answer this question, but it is clearly 100 per cent hypothetical.",76
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not uphold the point of order.,76
91,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, where is the public interest in allowing senators to come down to the House of Representatives?",76
92,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,76
93,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Now, listen, Hotham, don't you keep interjecting because I saw a Newspoll on you during the week. I would hate to draw to the attention of the House the Newspoll I saw on you during the week.",76
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister has been asked a technical question about his legislation, straight to the very heart of it, without embellishment, and I think it would be nice to keep him relevant for once in his life.",76
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer was beginning to address the thrust of the question.,76
96,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say it again: if the member for Hotham does not quieten down, I will .draw the attention of the House to the Newspoll published on him this week. Quieten down, or I will draw the attention to that Newspoll, Hotham.",76
97,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. While we enjoy being six points ahead in the Newspoll, I cannot for the life of is an me see why that is relevant to the answer to this question. I would have thought that relevance would require the minister to actually answer what is an important technical point about his legislation; it goes to the very heart of it.",76
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,76
99,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am quite happy to answer the question. I just wanted a bit of quiet in which to answer it. If the member for Hotham does not quieten down, I will have to draw the attention of the House to the Newspoll-and I am sure that the backbenchers and the frontbenchers would not like that. Would you? Under the 1995 bill, under the income injection test, if the trust was a family trust, a family member who was a beneficiary of the trust or who could receive the income or capital of the trust indirectly through interposed entities-listen-was not an outsider and, therefore, not caught by the income injection test. Under the current bill, an outsider to a family trust does not include: ... the trustee, a person with a fixed entitlement, the individual specified in the family trust election, a member of the individual's families, companies, partnerships and trusts included in the family group. The reason for that was to ensure that, where people traded through trusts, they were entitled-as they would be, as individuals-to offset income and losses in order to get taxable income. That was the situation. That was produced in the legislation as a result of extensive consultation with the small business community, with accountants,and with everybody else. I can tell this true story: when we engaged in the consultation, the accountants said something interesting. They said that it was interesting negotiating with this government on tax laws because we actually understood some commerce. They said that, with Labor, you could run anything past them because they had no idea of what the commercial effect of the transactions were. That would be right, because who was it who opened the R&D syndicates for people who wanted to avoid just tax liabilities? Who was it who refused to deal with the superannuation tax concessions?",76
100,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order; I raise the point of relevance again. He has been asked a specific technical question about it, which he has tiptoed around. He has now concluded his answer to it in tiptoeing around it and is going on to complete irrelevancy.",77
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am drawn to the fact that the Treasurer, I think, had concluded his answer.",77
102,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I had not.",77
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In that case then, I do direct you to address the substance of the question.",77
104,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker. The substance of the question is beneficiaries and the income injection tests in relation to family trusts, and the consultation which the government went through in order to do it to prevent the trafficking in trust losses-which is a very big part of this government's approach to taxation, and it is the reason we took the action to close down the R&D syndicates. Who was it who opened the R&D syndicates? Labor. Mr Crean-It's why research and development is at an all-time low.",77
105,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"See! He is defending the R&D syndicates. He is defending them,",77
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,right now.,77
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. Your subtle efforts, Mr Speaker, to draw the Treasurer's attention to the fact that he was out of order have not worked, apparently. I raise again the point of relevance. This is clearly irrelevant to his answer.",77
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,77
109,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am addressing the tax avoidance industry, which this government has taken steps to deal with. Who was it that closed down the R&D syndicates? It was us. Who wants to open them up? The member for Hotham. Who was it that dealt with superannuation tax concessions? It was us. You said in the House of Representatives that you would do it and you were overruled in the Senate. Who was it that dealt with the infrastructure borrowings, which had made it optional to pay tax?",77
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. The Treasurer persists with what is obviously an irrelevant answer to the question. He should be ruled out of order.",77
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a further point of order: this is a typical example of the technique of the Leader of the Opposition, who mounts a series of points of order simply because he does not like hearing the answer that is being delivered. That is clear to everybody. This is the debating technique of the Leader of the Opposition which you, in your statement, Mr Speaker, warned members against. This is again just a blatant breach of the direction that you have given to this House about points of order. He is getting ready to jump up again, as usual. It is another debating point. He should be ruled out of order.",77
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I take the point that the Leader of the House is making. The Treasurer is using examples to embellish an answer and at this moment the Treasurer is in order. I understand the thrust of the points of order of the Leader of the Opposition. I see no frivolous undercurrent in the points of order that he has raised. I am sure the Treasurer is in the process of winding up his answer.,77
113,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am, Mr Speaker. I would have wound it up by now if it not been for all the interruptions. But the point has to be made that we got into office and we found the tax system haemorrhaging through R&D syndicates. Opposition members-Oh!",78
114,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know they don't want to hear it. Mr Gareth Evans-I take a point of order on relevance, Mr Speaker. To the extent that the Treasurer has even tangentially addressed the question, he has been referring to income injections by beneficiaries of a trust. My question was about extended family group members not being beneficiaries. Mr SPEAKER.,--There is no point order. Resume your seat. Mr Gareth Evans-He has not addressed that part of the question.",78
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat. Mr Gareth Evans-Therein lies the tax avoidance. That is the bit he has been incapable,78
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,78
117,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When we came to office what did we find? The tax system was haemorrhaging through R&D syndicates. We closed them and Labor wants to reopen them. You have heard that from Hotham right now. If you were a high income earner you could get a 33 per cent tax concession on superannuation, and who dealt with it? This side of politics dealt with it. And who opposed it? The Labor Party. If you had an income over $500,000 and you could go into infrastructure borrowings, income tax was optional. And who dealt with it? The coalition did. Hotham wants to reopen it again. Hotham is the old rent'n'tariff man. You know, if you want to deal with old Hotham, you go and see him-a tax deal on one side and a bounty on the other.",78
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer is beginning to digress.,78
119,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to trafficking in trust loss, not only have we produced the legislation but also-what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not recognise-we narrowed the definition of 'family'. Mr Gareth Evans-We'll see about that.",78
120,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That brought a very big silence from you, didn't it? We narrowed the definition of 'family' - something that I noticed many accountants were complaining about. Mr Gareth Evans-I'll read it out. Child, grandchild, brother, sister, nephew",78
121,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no need for your hand to shake, old son. We know you are having a bad day. No need for the hand to shake. Yes, we narrowed the 'family' definition. We did not allow the family trust to be defined as widely as the Labor Party had done. Mr Gareth Evans interjecting",78
122,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no need to engage in this psychobabble. Mr Speaker, if he gets any redder in the face he will explode. Tax Reform",78
123,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Still on the issue of tax, my question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of what avenues will be available to the Australian community to provide input into the government's consideration of tax reform proposals? Can the Treasurer outline to the House when this consultation process will take place?",78
124,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. She knows-as, I hope, the whole of Australia knows-that there is one side of Australian politics that is interested in tax reform. There is one side of Australian politics that has the vision to reform Australia's tax system, and it is the coalition. It is the coalition that believes we need a better tax system for a new century, that we cannot sit around with the failures of the past. We saw that during the 1980s and the 1990s. We have to be bold and imaginative. We have to reform the Australian taxation system. Today the government set up a government tax consultative task force which will be consulting with people who want to improve the Australian taxation system, taking soundings from the public and involving itself in drawing up tax proposals. Government members-Who's on it?",78
125,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That's a very good question. This is a committee of people of exceptional ability. It has Senator Brian Gibson as chairman and Senator Sue Knowles and Senator Alan Ferguson. It has people on it of exceptional ability-like the member for Richmond; people with deep understandinglike the member for North Sydney; people who are visionary in relation to tax-like the member for Boothby; people with experience and understanding of the tax system-like the member for Groom; people who really know how to explain complicated tax issues-like the member for O'Connor; people who will bring youth and enthusiasm-like the member for Lowe; people who bring deep sympathy and understanding as well as penetrating insight-like the member for Bowman. These people will consult the Australian public in designing a new tax system for Australia. I am sure that every member of this House will wish them well in their efforts. Anti-Dumping Cases,79
126,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. I refer the minister to his election promise to cut the maximum time of an anti-dumping case to 155 days and to the Willett report, which told you how to deliver on this promise. Is it not the c;ase that the Willett report has been in the hands of the government since September 1996? Minister, why have you sat on this report for over a year and done nothing?",79
127,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome a question from the member for Hotham. I had not heard from him for a month or two. The last time. I saw him on television he was gloating up there, telling us all about dealing in stolen property, scams and things like that. Mr O'Keefe-Why don't you table the whole answer?",79
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Burke. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I know he put in a shocker of a performance at the MTIA last week, but he was asked a very specific question. This is about anti-dumping and his failure to act over 12 months. Will you ask him to answer the question. He will find it under 'A' in his PPQ brief.",79
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr O'Keefe interjecting,79
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Burke. Mr O'Keefe interjecting,79
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I invoke 304A in respect to the member for Burke. The honourable member for Burke thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,79
132,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Not only was the member for Hotham roundly written up after his last debacle as 'the man of steel' and 'the big gun',79
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will address the question.,79
134,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am, Mr Speaker, because the questionMr Crean interjecting",79
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham will resume his seat. I warn the member for Hotham.,79
136,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question of dumping with regard to the Willett report has been handled by the government and we have implemented a reduction in the time from 245 days to 215 days. It is one of the fastest turnaround periods relating to dumping inquiries of any of the WTO countries. It is one of the fastest we have got. As it relates to the other items of the Willett report, they are under review. Mr Crean-Where?",79
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham has been warned.,79
138,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As it relates to the critical area in the dumping act, we have reduced it from 245 days to 215 days-the best result there is in the WTO. At the same time, I cannot go past what the Treasurer was saying before in relation to the member for Hotham. All of this week he has been smarting quite a bit. We have not heard a word from him.",79
139,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order in relation to relevance. He must go past that particular temptation of his. He has been asked a specific question and he has now signalled to you that he intends to cease answering.",80
140,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I am listening very carefully to the minister's response. I would encourage him to address the thrust of the question and I am sure he is doing that.,80
141,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the member for Hotham is an expert on dumping, I thought it was worthwhile pointing out what the Treasurer was about to say before, because he was on a very good point but he was too much of a gentleman to push the point. In the Newspoll earlier this week",80
142,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order, we are six per cent ahead in the Newspoll but that has absolutely nothing to do with the question he was asked.",80
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I uphold the point of order. The minister will address the question.,80
144,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was addressing the dumping point. As a consequence of that, I would just like to point out that, on the dumping point, the Newspoll pointed out",80
145,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Further to the point of order, Mr Speaker, he is now directly in contravention. He is defying you.",80
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am listening very carefully to the minister's response and I urge minister to address the question.,80
147,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In view of your ruling, I will ask the member for Hotham if he would care to read the Newspoll and see how he feels.",80
148,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Could the minister inform the House where the rest of the Willett report is under review?",80
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not uphold the supplementary question. Sport: Drugs,80
150,Mr BILLS ON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport and Tourism. Australia is a leading advocate of the fight against drugs in sport. Can the minister advise the House,80
151,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,80
152,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I said drugs, not weeds, so I was not talking about any of you guys. Can the minister advise the House what is being done to enhance the ability of the Australian Sports Drug Agency to continue leading that fight?",80
153,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and I commend him for his interest in this topic. No doubt all members of the House would regard the notion of drugs in sport as a very pernicious one. Drugs in sport is a matter not merely for governments but for all sporting organisations and for all of those people who participate in sporting competitions. As far as the federal government is concerned, we have the Australian Sports Drug Agency to carry the torch for drug free sport in Australia. It is as well for me to remind the House of the primary objective of that agency as expressed in its act of parliament. It says that the object of the establishment of the agency, better known by its acronym as ASDA, is to encourage the practice of sport free from the use of drugs in a manner consistent with the objectives of protecting the health of competitors, the values of fair play and competition and, importantly, the rights of those who take part in sport. In furtherance of that objective, ASDA maintains a broad program of samthe pling and testing both in and out of competition. I take this opportunity to say that the government is fully committed to doing its best to make sport drug free. ASDA, under the capable stewardship of its chief executive, Natalie Howson, has a very good international reputation. But the war against drugs in sport is not a static fight. It is vital that we do what we can to help ASDA stay ahead of the game. I am pleased to inform the House of a review the government has commissioned of ASDA's legislative powers in which we seek to make the act under which ASDA operates more flexible. This is timely, given recent concerns about drugs in sport both within and outside Australia and given changes in international anti-doping practices. This review, which we hope to complete before the end of the year, is going to make the ASDA Act more flexible and certainly easier to interpret. Possible changes that may be recommended would include such things as the ability of the agency to take action against foreign athletes competing in Australia who test positive for banned substances in. cases where the relevant international federation of sport declines to take any action; and the conducting of blood tests for the purposes of health and safety screening. These last two are especially important if developments such as the use of artificial EPO are to be stopped. It will also deal with such matters as the need for further complementary state drug testing legislation. The review will be conducted independently of ASDA by an external consultant. I take this opportunity to commend my predecessor of this portfolio for starting the ball rolling. He did a wonderful job in that portfolio, and he is going to do a great job in his current portfolio. I look forward to seeing the outcome of the review. I anticipate that legislation may be before the House some time next year. Anti-Dumping Legislation: Peanuts",80
154,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs. Does the minister recall complaining about the dumping of Chinese peanuts, describing Australia as 'a dumpers paradise' and saying: Upon return to government, we will slash the amount of time taken to determine the anti-dumping and countervailing cases and change the material injury test to ensure that an industry does not have to be decimated before remedial action can be taken. If there is any bias, it should be in favour of the Australian industry rather than the importer. After 18 months in government, how many of these promises has this government delivered upon? Minister, will you persist with the government's anti-dumping legislation for China, which would increase the exposure of Australian peanut producers and Australian manufacturers to dumped Chinese products?",81
155,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hotham for his question. He has certainly come out of the sewer now in a big way. He must have been dredging for ages to have found that distant quote. The government has been moving very promptly to shorten the time taken for anti-dumping actions. As the minister responded earlier in his answer, we have already acted to shorten the amount of time taken to deal with anti-dumping actions. We are still considering aspects of the Willett report, and there may well be additional information for you to listen to in the future in that regard. The government is only part-way through its term. I think we have responded better than any government in recent history in dealing with our election promises and in delivering on them. We still have some time to go, and we expect to deliver on the promises before this term is complete. Obviously the government is considering the Senate report in relation to the other legislation referred to by the honourable member, and we will respond in the appropriate way at the appropriate time. Year 2000 Computer Date Problem",81
156,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance and Administration. Would the minister advise the House what strategies the government has in place to minimise the risk to service delivery caused by the year 2000 computer date problem?,81
157,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased that the honourable member for Lilley has raised this question, because it is a considerable problem and . a problem which the community, .including government, must address. In fact, the year 2000 computer date problem, or the millennium bug, is a time bomb problem on a massive global scale. If it is uncorrected by 1 January 2000, it will potentially cause massive social and economic disruption. The risk is the loss of continuity of service delivery to government businesses, and the government cannot afford to be complacent with that. I assure honourable members that the government is not complacent with that problem. The scale of the problem is huge. It affects most computers and software embedded in electronic equipment. I will give some examples. If we have that breakdown, if the problem is not corrected, things that we need in our daily lives, such as traffic lights, hospital equipment, elevators, navigational equipment, banking, taxation and payroll equipment, telecommunications, and emergency services infrastructure will cease to work. It has been estimated that the cost of correcting this problem on a global scale is somewhere between $US200 million and $US300 million. Mr Hatton-Billion, not million.",81
158,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sorry if I said million. I thank the honourable member for correcting me. It will be $US200 billion to $US300 billion if uncorrected. In fact, it is estimated that, if it is not corrected, the litigation post2000 could reach somewhere between $2 trillion and $3 trillion. So the government has recognised the problem and has developed a strategy. For correction it requires that there be an inspection, an evaluation, an alteration and a testing of literally millions of lines of computer code. That is complex, time consuming and .costly. A requirement has been extended by government to all agencies to report on a quarterly basis between now and the year 2000 on the steps that they are taking to go through all of that to ensure that the problem is arrested and overcome in time. The Office of Government Information Technology has established a project team to assist all the agencies of government to ensure that they are addressing the problem. I assure you that cabinet will keep a monitor on it at all times. In addition, some $5.43 million has been appropriated to the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism to implement the national year 2000 strategy with the states, and that is to alert all businesses of the difficulty there so that they are aware and take steps. I commend Australian and multinational businesses who have developed management plans in respect of this problem to make sure that there is an allocation of funds to deal with the problem in a timely fashion to avoid the disruption that is there. The Office of Government Information Technology will also work with the Emergency Management Agency to ensure that plans are in place to ensure that such things as water, gas and electricity are not disrupted in the year 2000. Finally, I would urge all businesses, if they are not aware, to take steps to ensure that they do make some moves in this area, because we want Australia to be by the year 2000 a year 2000 compliant country. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, given the fact that the opposition ran out of questions on aged care-their attack collapsed-I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Nursing Homes: Moran, Mr Doug",82
159,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"The shadow minister for health asked me a question. I have had a chance to look at the newspaper article in today's Sydney Morning Herald to which he referred. It makes the following point: The policy ... had its genesis in the offices of Dr Michael Wooldridge, when he was the Opposition spokesman on the aged and community services. He was advised by Mr Woods, who had been a consultant to the Doug Moran nursing home empire. This is not correct. No work was done in my office prior to the election on accommodation bonds. The first time. I came across it was, as I recollect, in the ERe process. My understanding is that it was put up by the Department of Finance and that it was actually a proposal they put up to the Labor Party several times which had been rejected.",82
160,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,It got canned.,82
161,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Yes, it was canned, and you let nursing homes run down as a result of it. So to say that the genesis of this was in my office prior to the last election is completely wrong. Further, it says that I was advised by Bob Woods. I have checked with my staff member who was working at the time and who did the day-today work on this. He said that, in his recollection, he never spoke to Bob Woods about it whatsoever. Mr Gareth Evans-But you said you didn't do any work on it.",82
162,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Nursing homes generally. He said that he has no recollection of Bob Woods ever speaking to him about nursing homes. Finally, with regard to his connection as the consultant of the industry, as far as I understand, Bob Woods was a consultant on urological surgery. He had nothing to do with nursing homes at all. NA Ministerial Responsibility",83
163,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"This question goes to the fact that the Minister for Health and Family Services has now just answered his question, which had about it the character of a personal explanation. His initial answer took the position that he was not responsible for the policy area and therefore would not answer questions on it. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the House of Representatives Practice, which was described by the Leader of the House as 'the bible' the other day.",83
164,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,By me.,83
165,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"You as well, was it? Good old Wilson, the would-have-been Speaker. The House of Representatives Practice states on page 84: Portfolio Ministers were ultimately responsible the administration of their entire portfolios and were accountable to Parliament for their overall operation. I note yesterday, Mr Speaker, that you exercised that judgment in regard to permitting a question to go to the new Minister for Transport and Regional Development on regional development, although there is another Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government in the House who is junior to him. That was an entirely appropriate reference on your part, as would have been requiring the minister who subsequently got up and answered a question to answer it in relation to a portfolio matter within his area as the senior minister. Mr Speaker, I would ask you to draw to the attention of the minister that, according to House of Representatives Practice and the government distribution of authority, he has overall responsibility for all aspects within his portfolio.",83
166,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and I will reflect further on the matter. NA,83
167,Mr HOCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",83
168,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,83
169,Mr HOCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do, Mr Speaker.",83
170,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,83
171,Mr HOCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In an article entitled 'More MPs pay back' in the Sun-Herald of 12 October 1997, Fia Cumming wrote that processing errors by the House of Representatives department were blamed for incorrect payments detected by the audit to, amongst others, myself. This is incorrect. Firstly, I was paid for one night's travel claim in Canberra which I never claimed. Obviously, the error was corrected. Secondly, it was myself and not the audit that detected the error. Thirdly, the House of Representatives failed to advise KPMG of their own error. Finally, I have a letter of unreserved apology from the Department of the House of Representatives, which for I would be pleased to make available on request. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS",83

174,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to protect the interest of Australian families, and particularly children and the grandchildren of the elderly, in introducing its new nursing home arrangements. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",84
175,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr SpeakerGovernment members-Boring, boring!",84
176,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Boring to you but not boring to the aged. That is the view this government has-it is boring. It is not boring to anybody who needs to go into a nursing home. It seems to me and to everybody on this side of the House that the solution to the problems of the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) and this government are quite simple. In fact, it really puzzles us on this side of the House why they are so determined to keep taking the pain that we know they are receiving. More importantly, why is the government continuing to inflict so much anxiety on the aged and their families? It is the case that this government's aged care policy is fatally and hopelessly flawed. The aged care policy is disastrous for older Australians. It is disastrous for Australian families. It has been condemned by older Australians. It has been condemned by community groups, both for profit and not for profit nursing home providers. It has been condemned by nursing home resident groups, by the churches, by state governments and, over and over again, by serious media commentators. Minister, are you trying to get some sort of record in front-page stories reporting this Howard government attack on the aged? You certainly have achieved a record. The solution is simple: put back the $500 million that was ripped out of aged care in the 1996 budget; accept that the responsibility is yours. As well as putting the $500 million back, you might also consider writing yourself a memo for the future: stop trying to con the Australian people. Tell them the truth, Minister, about what you are doing. The government quite outrageously has the tried to accuse the opposition of scaremongering, saying that we are scaring older Australians. Let us have a look at the document that has been presented to old and infirm people. No wonder you are frightening them. Talk about legalistic gobbledegook! It says on the front page that they strongly recommend that legal advice be obtained in relation to this document before anybody signs it. There are 47 pages of legalese. That is what they have to confront when facing the difficult and horrendous decision of having to go into a nursing home. That is what you are doing to them. The really frightening thing that this government is imposing on the elderly is its aged care policy. It has deliberately fudged the story. It does not want older Australians to know the policy. That is why they are so confused. That is why we have had so many people ringing the help line saying, 'We can't understand what the government's trying to do.' Minister, when you keep saying to the elderly 'may' or 'might'-'You may,' or 'You might have to sell your home to get nursing home care,' --can you not realise that this is not a clear message? That lack of clarity is what is causing confusion, uncertainsystem, ty and fear, especially when you are dealing with older people in declining health. They are vulnerable people, and you should not play word games with them. You should say, 'You will have to sell your home,' or, 'You won't have to sell your home.' Come clean with the elderly, Minister, and tell them the truth, which of course is that they will have to sell their homes. Put the $500 million back and then they will not have to sell their homes. The Labor Party has opposed this rotten policy since it was first announced. This government has ignored all of our calls to get rid of it. It has ridden roughshod over the objections of all of the groups that are now coming out to the minister saying, 'Get rid of it. Throw it away because it is bad policy.' All of the flawed detail of this dishonest and cruel policy has finally emerged to the Australian public-both to families and to older Australians. Their voices of fear and concern have finally been heard by the various representative groups who have decided that they can no longer sit quietly and listen to this government's completely inadequate explanations of why they are doing what they are doing. Minister, you and your government must have hides as thick as buffaloes to ignore the complaints that are now coming forward from all the representative groups that are calling on you to get rid of the policy. Let us start with the combined pensioners a,ssociation, which is saying that nursing home care must be equally available to all who need it and that the family home must be exempted from any asset test relating to payment for care. Let us not have any more press releases from June. Let us have a look at the press releases that came out yesterday and today from all the different constituent groups that are saying, 'Get rid of this policy.' The Australian Council of Social Service said: We therefore strongly support deferral of the implementation date and serious reconsideration of the proposals and their impact. We need a major injection of funds-and the primary source should be the national taxation not individual users ... We need to go back to the drawing board on this critical issue of public policy which so dramatically affects so many peoples' lives and futures. The Uniting Church heads up its press release, 'Not too late to right the injustice for our elderly'. The Uniting Church sees it as 'injustice for our elderly'. They say: The new legislation has fundamental problems. The Uniting Church warned the government more than a year ago that user pays was a dangerous strategy for nursing homes. It is clear that some of the fundamental assumptions behind the legislation need an urgent rethink. We have been calling on the minister all week to announce the urgent rethink. It is Thursday, and he still refuses to announce anything. The press release continued: The Government must return the money it removed from the aged care budget, and reintroduce a capital funding program for nursing homes. Most importantly, what the Uniting Church understands, which this government most clearly does not understand, is that accommodation bonds that have worked with regard to hostels will not work in nursing homes. It goes on: What continues to be of major concern to the Church is the skewing of the Government's reform agenda towards a care delivery system that has been subjected to severe cost cutting. So much for this government's concerns for the aged. The first concern is that over 60 per cent of nursing home residents have to enter care from a hospital bed and stay for less than 12 months. The Uniting Church says: We must therefore ask ourselves why short term residents such as the very frail-aged who are entering care as a matter of need, must bear the brunt of the government invoked cost saving measures ... The Australian Catholic Health Care Association said: Without doubt unless some urgent change occurs we will see the development of a two-tiered systemthat is what this government is introducing, a two-tiered nursing home systemwhere care is distributed on peoples' ability for the care they need. Mr Adams-Profit driven.",84
177,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, profit driven, as my colleague says. The Council on the Ageing says: The current legislation will not work. The Government must now respond to the concerns of older people. Ideallymaybe we will table these press releases for the minister's informationthe Government should scrap the accommodation bond ... and eventually they may be forced to do this. Hopefully, it will not be too long because too many people are going to have to suffer in the meantime. Take advice, Minister, from the Council on the Ageing, take advice from the Catholics and take advice from the Uniting Church and scrap the accommodation bonds. The Council on the Ageing has written an open letter to every senator and every member of the House of Representatives headed, 'A new approach to aged care reform'. They are giving you advice, Minister. They are giving it to you in spades. They say that they have: received thousands of calls from older people in response to the aged care structural reforms . . . I know many of youthat means all members and senatorshave also received calls from anxious, angry and distressed older people and their families in recent weeks. COTA's view is that immediate action is needed to allay the fears of older people and to develop a fair and workable policy ... Urgent changes are needed to the aged care legislation, not tinkering at the edges, Minister. We need urgent reform that gets rid of these accommodation bonds and these daily fees. An excellent article about the Council on the Ageing, appearing in the Melbourne Age earlier this week, called on the government to stop accommodation bonds for nursing homes. For the first time, as they make it very clear in this article, accommodation bonds will be to pay charged for nursing home residents-those with complex and high nursing needs. That is why we need to heed the words of the Australian Nurses Federation. This week they have resolved to fight the changes in the leadup to the next federal election. Members were firmly opposed to the government's policy at their national meeting yesterday. They have said that they will leave the poor off. The Australian Nurses Federation is currently developing a strategy for ongoing political and industrial action. That is how· seriously they are taking it. It is going to involve 110,000 nurses. A total of 110,000 nurses are opposed to your reforms, Minister. They are saying, 'This is not the way we want to care for the aged in our community; we want these changes reversed.' They do not agree that there should be up-front fees of up to $250,000. They say that the accommodation bonds are unfair and wealth based, as opposed to needs based. Nobody believes that your policy will have anything to do with need. Certainly the nurses who do the caring in nursing homes know that they will be placed, as they say in their press release, in an extremely difficult position. It will be the nurses, Minister, that you will place in the most difficult position of all because those nurses will know who has to go into nursing homes and who is in the greatest need. But will the nurses be overshadowed, Minister, by the nursing home owners? Of course, there is only one group remaining that supports this policy. It is the nursing home group that Mr Doug Moran belongs to. There is no other groiIp in Australia that represents older people, nursing homes or nurses that supports this policy, not one, only the one that Doug Moran belongs to. Although the Minister for Family Services says that he did not have anything to do with the writing of the policy before the last election, Doug Moran says that he certainly did. He boasts about how much influence he had on the Liberal Party and how much influence he had on the design of this appalling policy that is frightening older Australians. Australian families are saying, 'Get rid of this policy.' Older people are saying, 'Get rid of this policy.' All of the groups that care people are saying, 'Get rid of this policy.' It is only Doug Moran who is saying, 'Keep it.'",86
178,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Even your own backbench is saying it.,87
179,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As my colleague says, even your backbenchers want you to get rid of the policy. Tell Doug Moran that he is not the person setting the government's policy, otherwise nobody will believe you.",87
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the next speaker, I wish to say that I deliberately did not interrupt the member for Jagajaga; but I want to draw to her attention, and to the attention of the minister and all other members, that it is not in order to direct remarks directly to the minister, or to this member. The remarks should be directed through the chair. The use of the word 'you' is a no-no.",87
181,Mr WARWICK SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, through you I will address the remarks of the shadow minister and member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). I know that she holds her views passionately and that on this occasion we obviously disagree. I understand that she has to leave, and I thank her for letting me know. What this debate at the end of this week is about, of course, is the aged care legislation that was passed earlier in this House and through the Senate. Over the last week there has been a vociferous campaign, led by the Labor Party particularly, against the proposed changes. There are two elements to this piece of legislation. The first relates to what is commonly known as the bonds and the second relates to what is known as the fees which are to start on 1 November which will affect some of the residents in the homes. I would like to address the fundamental issue: why is it that we need to have a policy such as the one being put forward at the present time? The fundamental reason is that there is a lack of capital in the nursing home sector. As I have shown before, and I should perhaps finish where I began at the beginning of the week, there is a graph. The graph shows that there was about a 75 per cent for reduction in the capital provided to the nursing home sector by Labor during its period of office. That has meant that the capacity for nursing homes, particularly, to provide a level of care that Australians would expect to receive has not been reached. We took a look at the Gregory report that was provided to the last government in 1994 which indicated there was a crisis in the nursing home sector because of the lack of capital. Both governments were urged to act. The previous government was urged to act and we were urged to act. On coming to government, we established an extensive consultation process. All of those in the industry and consumer groups, and many that you have quoted today, were involved in the process because we took the view that this was a national issue that had to be addressed in a sensible, balanced way. The product of all that consultation was a piece of legislation that was passed here and passed through the Senate with, I might add, the obvious support of the Democrats, then led by the then Senator Kernot. The legislation has stood for some time. Now, on the eve of the implementation of the fees, which is 1 November, we have had this almighty scare campaign that has run around the nation. People should be aware that since 1 October the processes of the bond elements of· the policy have been in place. Indeed, one of those that you quote extensively in support of your position is the Catholic Church, and particularly Francis Sullivan, whom I guess we would both admire for his tenacity in arguing his case. his remarks today I noticed that he is not actually against the bond concept. What concerned about, and I can see his point, that he does not want there to be fee increasissue-there es. What I have to say to him, and what others have said, is that we cannot go on fully funding every individual that goes into nursing home without there being some fair contribution to the costs of providing that care. If you have a look at the statistics, you see that there are 3,000 nursing homes and hostels in Australia. There are about 135,000 residents. Of that number of people, some 65 per cent are full pensioners. They will not be affected by the fee increase on 1 November. The remaining 35 per cent are split between 10 per cent that are not pensioners at allcent they are fully self-funded people and receive no benefit at all; they are affected by the increase and they will be judged on their means-and part-pensioners, who also have some income, and they will be judged as their means on the basic social security test. That will be done through Centrelink. The fee arrangements therefore are impacting on, best, 35 per cent. But it has been· done in way that is absolutely fair. It is in accord the broader rules that were put in place by former Labor government, and it is that test that is causing some concern. What I have said during question time is that I hear those concerns, I am continuing the consultation process with all of those who were good enough to lend their support to the legislation prior to its passing-I think nearly everyone, without exception, that the minister quoted from was involved in that process-and I am asking them to again under provide me with further information. I have the to say that I am not without advice on this residential matter. I have been receiving a lot on this matter from all sorts of quarters. I will be doing my very best in the very quickest time to look at the elements of the policy that might need finetuning. We can debate that matter at some future time. But it is the fundamentals of the policy that we have to recognise. If this country does not take some of those hard decisions that we In know are evident and that have been brought to our attention by the likes of Professor he is Gregory and others, then I think we are is deluding ourselves. The other fundamental is the lack of capital that I just talked about-is the growth in costs and the growth in the numbers that make up the aged a population in this country. Nursing home costs grew by 41 per cent and hostel costs by 399 per cent in real terms in the 10 years to 1997, and that demand will increase. That is not an issue that we can ignore. No responsible government can ignore it. The total population of Australia is projected to increase by around 38 per cent between 1991 and 2031 but over that same period the proportion of the population aged over 65 is projected to nearly double-from 11.2 per to just under 20 per cent. By the time. I reach 65 there will be double the number of fee 65-year-olds in that age group than there are now. That is you and I, Michael. We will be in that group of people who will be thinking to about what they are going to do in their retirement and what sort of care they want. The immediate concern, and this is the at point that the shadow minister completely a ignores, is the rising proportion of very old with people-those over 80-who need high level the care services. As they leave hospital and go into nursing home care a higher level of care is required. This group of Australians is expected to increase by 49 per cent in the 10 years from 1991 to 2001. That is irrefutable. That is why, on the completion of the legislation, through a detailed negotiation process, organisations such as the Australian Catholic shadow Health Care Association stated: With such a massive reform strategy soon to be way it is now more comforting knowing that access for financially disadvantaged people to aged care services will be improved with of advice the increased subsidies. In the course of that debate, when the legislaof tion was going through the Senate, we provided additional support for the disadvantaged to the satisfaction of the Australian Catholic Health Care Association. The Chief Executive Officer of the diocese of Maitland-Newcastle Catholic Care for the Aged indicated his strong support in the Newcastle Herald only yesterday. He said: It does not seem unreasonable that the frail are provided with a higher standard of accommodathat tion and service through a relatively modest on the assets they own. That is the fundamental point. Francis Sullivan, also from that organisation, said: The challenge for the 1990s is getting a balance between personal responsibility and community contribution. Community contribution comes from the Commonwealth government. The amount of money that is being provided to the sector for residential care subsidies in this year alone will increase by six per cent on last year and will be $2.695 billion. If you average the increase in the forward estimates to the year 2001-02 the figure goes up to $3.2 billion. And the average amount that goes to each of those 135,000 people in nursing homes and hostels coming from the Commonwealth government is about $15,000 regardless of what contribution they make. But even with that amount of money we are not going to be able to satisfy the demand of people wanting to get into residential care facilities. I responsibility, as does this government and the opposition, to come up with a policy that can engage all and seek support from all in the sector. And that was done with the Aged Care Bill, which is now an act. They all contributed to it. As I said on my first day on the job here on the Monday when I took over the ministry, I will monitor the implementation process. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and I have had discussions about this matter. We hear the concerns of those who are charged with the implementation process. We hear the concerns of our own constituency and we are going to listen. Of course we are going to listen. But I have to make sure that in doing so I consider all the ramifications of what is proposed by some on the other side. It is not good enough to stand up and say, 'Look, we are just going to stop it when we get there. We'll think about how we are going to pay for it when we get there': That is the very basis of the problem that we have. We cannot turn around and go back. The shadow minister on one of her radio programs was asked the question, 'What would happen if you did stop it when you aged win the next election?' - heaven forbid that should happen. In a moment of honesty, levy she said, 'It would be a mess.' Don't the elderly of this country deserve better than that? Don't they deserve a considered, detailed piece of policy thinking about how we deal with this issue rather than taking advantage of the yellers and screamers in the community. Mr Lee-Yellers and screamers?",87
182,Mr WARWICK SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, these are the people-I saw some of them last week on a television program. That is no substitute for sensible policy. Over the last week I have combed through these issues and I admit that there are some areas of implementation that could do with some attention, and I will deal with that. We had a question in the House today where someone stood up and said, 'Here is a document that goes for 40 pages. How cruel it is to give this to frail people.' That is a classic case of misrepresentation. That was a have a document prepared by the department and provided to providers, giving all the information that could possibly be given to a potential resident about what they would need to do to enter into a bond and an agreement with you to enter your home. In a lot of those homes those agreements will be very different. As I said in question time, you will also have the capacity to ask for assistance, and you are encouraged to do so. We have provided much material. More material will be provided to the community and to all my colleagues in both chambers about how the residential care system - orks. The integration between the Department of Health and Family Services, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs-my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) is in the chamber-is all encapsulated in a little book that people will get over the next several days about' the choices that are available to elderly Australians and how you pursue successfully the entry arrangements. They are not designed in any way to stall a positive, long-term policy outcome which will give some stability and security to older Australians. To suggest otherwise is the height of irresponsibility. I notice from the MPI today that there is some attack on the family. As Minister for Family Services not only is aged care my responsibility, so is disabilities, child care, homelessness, youth suicide and the overarching approach to family policy. I cannot think of a policy area that is more central to any far-sighted government, and I am delighted to have that opportunity to pursue some activity in this area. But I have to say that the record to date of what this government has delivered to families is indeed impressive: the family tax cuts; the home loan interest rates-do you know the home loan interest rates are the lowest in 30 years? On the legacy of Labor, I can remember when I was buying my home with my wife. We were looking at interest rates of about 14 or 15 per cent. They are rates that were absolutely untenable. I cannot say that I lamented the departure of Mr Hawke or Mr Keating. They did nothing for my family. I am concerned as a young family man about what it is going to be like for my mother and the parents of my friends as they go into nursing homes, because I stand here knowing that we have to upgrade nursing homes. It has to be done fairly and it will be done fairly. I will personally ensure that do everything I can to make sure that is the outcome. But we cannot stand the hypocrisy of the opposition saying that they have no responsibility for the neglect. That is why all the industry, regardless of all the different views they have, the competing interests, combined to deal with this particular policy. (Time expired)",89
183,Mr JENKINS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went onto the Ray Martin show and said that he had a vision for Australia where all Australians would feel relaxed and comfortable, there was obviously one group of Australians that he was not really talking about. That, of course, is elderly Australians, especially frail elderly Australians. It is not only those elderly Australians but also, as is mentioned in the wording of this MPI, their families-their children and their grandchildren. No matter how the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) comes in today, at the end of a very torrid week for him-and he is quiet and well mannered about this subject-he knows that there is a problem. He knows that elderly Australians are anxious. He knows that they are looking for answers. When the minister was handed the poisoned chalice of this policy area, he perhaps felt that the Prime Minister was not talking about things being relaxed and comfortable for him. The minister was given this difficult policy area perhaps because he gives this visage of butter not melting in his mouth; the type of person who can look at the kids and not give them nightmares. But today he revealed the way that he looks upon those who have been critical. One of his first acts as minister was to adopt the softly, softly approach, to perhaps go to where he could talk directly to elderly Australians who are usually a meek and mild audience. So what did he do? He went onto the Kerri-Anne Kennerley show. And today those genuine people who were in that audience and who gave their genuine comments about this area of policy were described by the minister for their efforts as 'yellers and screamers'. Mr Warwick Smith-They did, too!",90
184,Mr JENKINS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But, Minister, through you, I will Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope you listened to the message. I saw the report bn the front page of the Daily Telegraph of that particular TV show. A name sprang from the front page. It talked about a Jean MCLean. I thought the minister had suffered from a stacked audience, because there is a famous Jean MCLean that I know of, a radical Labor member of the upper house in Victoria. I see the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who has great affection for Jean MCLeanMr Warwick Smith-It wasn't that Jean MCLean.",90
185,Mr JENKINS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It wasn't that Jean MCLean. There is a photo that proves it. But I want to quote the Jean MCLean who was at that show, who is a retired science teacher. The Daily Telegraph says she is 71. This is the message she gave the minister. She said to the minister: If you are going to continue being a minister, I want you to remember very clearly two things. One, our generation went through the worse depression that history has ever known, then we went the worse war history has ever known, and after that we had to fight our way up bringing up children and trying to get a home. We have deserved the utter right to some payback by our government. So, hopefully, while the minister describes these people as 'yellers and screamers', he will show the skills that he displayed in his little three-year sojourn from this place when he went to Melbourne and had a job as the Telecommunications Ombudsman, someone who was there to listen to people. He might listen to these concerns and he might take them on board. And he might realise that this measure in aged residential care has been taken for one reason and one reason alone by this government-that is, the budget bottom line. For all the camouflage, for all the talk about the findings of the Gregory report, that is the bottom line. That is the economic rationalist Treasurer (Mr Costello) dictating what this portfolio can spend on this important area. There is only one solution. There is no need for this tinkering, no need for this so called finetuning; replace the $500 million and replace it now. That is the way that we can get on and talk about the true partnership between the community and these people who need the type of care that is provided in nursing homes. Another one of the furphies we have had in this continuing debate about aged residential care is that in some way the announcement made in last year's budget about nursing homes is an extension of Labor government policy because of the type of policy that Labor had for hostels. We will continue to argue that that is a nonsense. We will continue to argue that that defies recognition of the difference between hostel care and nursing home care. I would not usually use Treasury and Finance documents to put a case to assist us in this, but if the economic classicists-those pure accountants. that prepare the budget papers-can put a case perhaps I can remind the minister of it. In the budget papers tabled by our economic rationalist Treasurer, we look at the classifications in 'Outlays'. We are talking about aged persons hostels, and it is described there as the 'lower level of personal into care'. What heading is that outlay under? That heading is 'Social security and welfare'. But I wonder where we find the outlays and the descriptions of what is happening for nursing home subsidies for the aged where, as this budget paper describes, it provides 'for the nursing and personal care costs of residents.' At page 4-47 it is under the heading No.5 'Health'. So from the government's own budget papers we have the nonsense that in some way this is simply an extension. I will briefly go to another important area concerning the elderly: those people who are the responsibility of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. After two question times, today we finally got an answer of sorts from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) about the way in which accommodation bonds will affect veterans and war widows. The minister made no apology for the fact that the accommodation bonds will apply to those people. He made no apology; he used it as a debating point for the second day in a row to claim that the people who raise these problems are scaremongering. In 1995, we celebrated Australia Remembers. Perhaps, given the attitude of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in 1997, we are celebrating Australia Forgets, and that is a damnation of the attitude that this government can display to those people who have served their nation and therefore have always received special compensation because of it. We need to look at some other aspects of the arguments that are being put by the government. It often quotes the Gregory report as the justification for the policy while indicating a description of the state of nursing homes throughout Australia, but it fails to remind the Australian people that the Gregory report, when talking about entry fees as a means of raising the capital, said: .... allowing entry contributions seems too harsh a measure. The other aspect of the arguments that the government has put is that it is the opposition that is causing the anxiety and that it is the opposition that is scaremongering. Again I would like to quote somebody whom I do not usually quote. Neil Mitchell, writing in the Sunday Age, said: And there is another tradition. Critics, again, ""scaremongering"". Ask John Howard. But who sent letters to thousands of nursinghome residents telling them to pay more? Imagine the impact of that on people who can get in a tizz about what to have for lunch. Wasn't the pain sufficient without having to face a pile of forms that would challenge John Elliott's legal team? As Neil Mitchell said, it was of course John Howard's government doing this. This minister, the honourable member for Bass, can be assured of one thing: whilst he is talking about going around listening to people, the Labor candidate for Bass, Michelle O'Byrne, is out there in Launceston speaking to every old person in Bass, hearing how upset and angry they are. She is listening and taking notice of the elderly-unlike the minister. (Time expired)",90
186,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What a diatribe! Who could have believed that people such as the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) could come forward with such misinformation, inaccuracy, distortions and untruths. Indeed, I think the honourable member for Jagajaga brought in her notes from one of the earlier matter of public importance debates this week because she simply overlooked the fact that today's MPI was allegedly referring to: The failure of the Government to protect the interests of Australian families, and particularly children and grandchildren of the elderly, in introducing its new nursing home requirements. She obviously went on the wrong note. One really ought to put some perspective back into this debate. What is the purpose of the changes we have brought in for nursing homes? We aim to bring about a much better and higher quality of care. Most members have been to nursing homes, and most people have seen how very many of our senior citizens live in conditions which are absolutely unacceptable. What did the former government do? It certainly commissioned a report, the Gregory report, which pointed out that much needed to be done, but the former government ran away from the hard decisions. What did we are discover upon coming into office? We found that, despite the huffing and puffing of Labor members and despite the hypocrisy that we have heard today, the former Labor government had actually reduced expenditure on nursing homes from $45 million in 1992-93 to $10.7 million in 1995-1996. And so this government-again we did not create the problem but we accept the responsibility to fix it-brought down a policy which was fair, reasonable and equitable and which would ensure that no aged resident of a nursing home would lose more than $13,000 over a period of five years out of an accommodation bond. When people leave a nursing home, they will get the balance of their bond backregardless of what the bond is-minus the $13,000. It is sad and it is tragic that we find that the Labor Party is playing politics yet again rather than trying to assist the government to implement policy to address 13 years of neglect by the former Labor government. Mr Hatton interjecting",92
187,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member for Blaxland ought not to interject because his predecessor was the person who came into the parliament year after year making much noise but achieving very little of substance. What we had to do and what we did was to bring in these changes many months ago, and we have received many endorsements from groups throughout the community. The policy the is right. In fact, the policy builds on the successful changes to hostel policy brought in by the Labor government in 1988, and it is clear now that the quality of hostels is quite high in Australia. The Labor policy has worked, and we are seeking to build on that policy so that we are able to return nursing homes to a standard which will benefit our senior citizens. One finds also that many people are currently putting family members into nursing homes-out of hostels-because of the difference in policy and cost which existed prior to this government being prepared to grasp the nettle. I was also interested to hear the honourable member for Scullin, who spoke a moment ago, refer to Mrs Jean MCLean of Glebe. Mrs MCLean is an eminent and respected member of the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales, an organisation which works in the interests of older people. The honourable member suggested that the minister did not listen and that he was not prepared to look at what was happening nor to take advice. It is interesting that this same Jean MCLean wrote a letter to the newspaper. In that letter, she said: Mr Smith was most cooperative and listened during the Midday Show to ideas which were put to him. I wish him well in his difficult ministry . . . Mrs MCLean recognises that we have an outstanding minister who is prepared to listen and to consult. As he has said over the last week, he is also prepared to look at the policy with a view to finetuning certain minor aspects which ought to be finetuned. But the minister has not apologised for this policy, which is a fair and correct one-equitable and right. The solution of the shadow minister is that we should simply fund nursing homes from the general community. The shadow minister is simply not taking into account the fact that we have an ageing population. What this government is doing is looking at the future. We appreciate that the percentage of Australians over the age of 65 is growing dramatically. The minister pointed this out in his contribution to this debate. This government is prepared to do something whereas our predecessors simply were not prepared to do anything. As I stated, the actual wording of the MPI suggested that this government is unsympathetic to families and particularly to the children and grandchildren of those going into nursing homes. The minister outlined some of the things that we have done for families. We have of course delivered the billion dollar family tax cut and the lowest home interest rates in 30 years. We have delivered a tax cut of up to $450 for private health insurance and a tax cut on savings of $450 per taxpayer per year. By reducing the number of firearms, we have delivered a safer community. We have created apprenticeships to give jobs to our kids. We have delivered a crackdown on welfare cheats, saving over $1 billion in taxpayers' money. We have newer, fairer workplace relations laws. We have delivered the largest environmental package in Australia's history, we have delivered better literacy skills and we have delivered a better government for all of us. On the other hand, what did the Labor Party do? It increased taxes by $10 billion after it had promised not to. It increased home loan interest rates to 17 per cent-well beyond the 14 per cent that the minister paid when he and his wife bought their home-forcing many Australian families to lose their homes. The Labor PartyMr Hatton-You have delivered propaganda, that is all. John Howard had 22 pet cent.",92
188,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You ought not to interject, my friend, because you are part of the party that in government increased unemployment to 11.2 per cent, with over one million people out of work. Your party also cut the living standards of Australian families--on the table of comparative living standards we dropped from 10th in the world to 22nd in the world. You broke promise after promise, including the l-a-w tax cuts. You brought in new taxes. You broke promises on taxes and you raised the Medicare levy when you said you were not going to do so. The shadow minister was exceptionally misleading in so far as she claimed that we did not have support for these policies from people other than Mr Moran. I would like to refer to Arthur Brotherhood, the Chief Executive Officer of the National Association of Homes and Private Hospitals Inc. He said: What the Government is attempting to do is provide the necessary capital from people that can afford to pay to lift the quality of accommodation and care in Australian nursing homes. There were a number of editorials which strongly supported the position of the government. I also want to refer to a front-page story in one of the major newspapers of Australia, the Sunshine Coast Daily, which publishes in an area I am very proud to represent. The headline is 'Aged Care Bill Praised': The Federal Government push to establish upfront fees for nursing homes has found an unlikely ally in a national retirees' association. At the opening of yesterday's Association of Independent Retirees (AIR) national conference at Alexandra Headlandwhich is in my electorate, incidentallyimmediate past president Maureen Kingston said the controversial bill had her full support. ""It's a very difficult bill for anyone to have to sell but it was one which had to come in,"" she said. ""There's no way we can continue to fund the sort of nursing home care that our older Australians require without some form of payment up front."" We have been prepared to be a government which is able to take tough decisions. We inherited this situation where the quality of nursing home care to elderly Australians is unacceptable. Consequently, we have brought in a decision which is right. We have not sought to pursue popularity. This decision is not flawed. It is fair and reasonable, and most Australians, I believe, accept that it is equitable for Australians who are able to make a contribution to their nursing home care to do so. This is not an attack on the aged; this is a policy which will ensure that Australia's aged people will receive nursing homes of a much higher quality. This policy will put capital into nursing homes with the result that the standards of nursing homes will be such that we would be proud to have our family members resident in them. The simple fact of the matter is that once again the Labor Party has preyed on the fears of our senior citizens. The Labor Party is lacking in vision and principle. It is opportunistic and it is playing politics at the expense of our older Australians who have contributed so much to ensure that in Australia we have freedom and stability a wonderful way of life.

190,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORATISATION,"Firstly, I would thank all honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997 and its associated consequential amendment bill. Following the introduction of these bills, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his press release of 4 August announced changes to the way in which depreciation is to be calculated on assets of previously exempt entities that enter Hardgrave, G. D. the tax net. As a result, any determination or regulation made under either· clause 51 or clause 52 of the bill will be consistent with the policy announced by the Treasurer in his press release of 4 August. The opposition has moved a second reading stage amendment relating to the water inquiry that will be sponsored by New South Wales and Victoria. The Commonwealth will be closely involved in finalising the terms of reference before the start of the inquiry. We want to ensure that it addresses all of the community's concerns in a very transparent and scientifically valid manner. Water management is a state responsibility. New South Wales will issue the Snowy water licence, and the states will be responsible for implementing the results of the inquiry. The Commonwealth has only a limited role in the water inquiry and, as a result, we will not be supporting the opposition's second reading amendment.

191,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PAIRS,"I move: Clause 2, page 2 (lines 11-14), omit subclause (2), substitute: (2) A proclamation fixing a day for the commencement of section 59 is not to be made unless: (a) a public inquiry, sponsored by the States, has been held into environmentaJ, issues arising out of the current pattern of water flows associated with the operation of the Snowy Mountains Scheme and the Minister is satisfied with the adequacy, conduct, outcome and implementation of the inquiry; and (b) the Minister is satisfied that the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria have agreed to that section commencing on that day. The effect of this amendment to the proclamation clause in the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bi111997 is that the Commonwealth does not wash its hands of the Snowy until and unless it is satisfied with the adequacy, conduct, outcome and implementation of the results of the water inquiry. The government's legislation before the House has a very limited role so far as the Commonwealth is concerned in the establishment of the inquiry and thereafter leaving it to the states. Given the time of day, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not trawl over all the coals. Suffice to say that this amendment crystallises the arguments put forward by the opposition in the Main Committee in respect of this bill. The Snowy is a national icon. There is a national interest. The Commonwealth ought to ensure that it is satisfied with a national outcome. The various issues which the water inquiry needs to look at include the Snowy's rehabilitation, the water distribution between electricity, irrigation and environmental interests and· the management which goes to those particular assets. There are questions of balance here and questions of national importance and significance. Neither the government nor this parliament nor the Commonwealth itself should cede its responsibility in this area unless and until it is satisfied that an appropriate balance has been found in respect of those matters.",96
192,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PAIRS,"I mentioned in the second reading debate of the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997 that water management is a state responsibility. The states will be sponsoring the water inquiry referred to in the opposition's amendment and we are not responsible, as the Commonwealth, for implementing its recommendations. The Commonwealth's role is quite limited. Nonetheless, I can assure the House that the government understands and does respect the opposition's concerns in relation to their amendment. The Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) has advised me that he is giving the amendment careful consideration and is seeking some expert advice. We are not prepared to support the amendment at this stage but will come back to it when the bill is debated in the Senate.",96
193,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PAIRS,"I would like to thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) at the table for relaying that.

197,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"In my answer to the House earlier in relation to the government's aged care reforms, I referred to people who stay less than six months in a nursing home. By way of clarification, the key point here is that people have up to six months to pay a bond. Retention and interest may, however, accrue from entry. NA AMENDMENT (PARENTING AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",97
198,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Before we finished for question time, I referred to some of the outrageous comments made by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and indicated that he was way off the mark. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill we are debating in the chamber today also seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 from 1 July 1998 so that those children whose parents or guardian no longer qualify for child disability allowance, because of the amendments to the child disability allowance qualificriteria for a disabled child, will maintain their eligibility for a health care card. This will ensure that any child with a milder disability whose parent or guardian does not qualify for child disability allowance because of the changes in eligibility criteria will still be able to get a health care card to cover the cost of pharmaceuticals, treatment, aids and appliances. This obviously is very beneficial for people in that situation. Also, the omnibus bill before the chamber will, from 1 July 1998, change the period over which the income of a health care card claimant is measured from four to eight weeks to lessen the incidence of abuse. Low income health care cards which entitle people to discounted pharmaceutical benefits are issued for up to six months, based on an initial income test. This will lessen the abuse of health care cards by those who are not usually low income earners and will specifically prevent entitlement to health care cards for people whose income is usually too high to qualify but who, after a short period without income-for example, when they have been stood down over Christmas-are presently able to qualify under the four-week test. The Labor Party will no doubt say that this is heartless, but what we aim to do in a situation where we have limited amounts of money for social security and other purposes is to ensure that money gets through to the needy and not to the greedy. We are all about having an appropriate social security safety net. This legislation is about that. The whole ethos of this government is in pursuit of a fair go for disadvantaged Australians. What the Labor Party did, during its 13 years in office, was to turn a blind eye to the fact that millions, probably billions, of dollars were ripped off in social security fraud. The former Labor government suggested there was no problem. They claimed that there might have been a few compliance problems but, in other words, no dodgy welfare claims. Labor's social security minister even said: ... we have very effective compliance measures and measures to counter fraud. The minister also said: . . . what we do by way of compliance is now recognised as being of world leading standard many respects. Upon coming to government and discovering a $10.3 billion deficit, we had to make sure that the only people receiving welfare entitlements were those who needed them. We have done that, and that is very fair. It is not hurting disadvantaged people. It is not getting stuck into those people who cannot help themselves. We are protecting the comIimnity and ensuring that there is an adequate amount of money to pay to people who need to take advantage of the social security safety net. I think people get upset when they know of others who are working and in receipt of income are also receiving the dole. As a result of these cuts in fraud, as a result of routing out those people who were receiving payments to which they were not entitled, we have been able to save $19 million every week. Savings over the next year are expected to be very close to $1,000 million. So much for Labor saying that there was no problem! A recept report tabled in the parliament by Senator Newman, the Minister for Social Security, showed the following: there were 26,000 suspected welfare cheats; 1,100 people have been convicted of welfare fraud; there have been overpayments of $105 million; and there are 136,000 cases of people being paid too much. We have made a key commitment to cut out welfare cheats. This legislation will put into place a new system of data to cut back further welfare fraud. I think the government is sending a very clear message to those people who are rorting the system. They will get caught. It is not a question of if they will get caught but when they will get caught. The government does not apologise for tightening the belt to ensure that only those people who need and who are entitled under the law to receive social securimajority. ty payments receive them. This legislation is measured, fair, and reasonable. It seeks to implement budget legislation with one extra measure which is not a budget measure. This legislation is not the sort of legislation referred to by the honourable member for Lyons and by other opposition speakers. This government is all about being fair to those Australians who are in disadvantaged. This government is all about making sure that we run the economy properly because, when we run the economy properly, the country will benefit. Labor also referred to the Commonwealth dental health service and how that has been cut out. It ought to be recognised that, even when it was set up by the former Labor government, it was intended to be a shortterm program to redress current dental health waiting lists. This is a government which has been prepared to take hard decisions. This is a government which, upon coming into office, discovered that there was a budget deficit of $10.3 billion-Beazley's black hole. We did not create the problem; we were, however, prepared to solve it. Whenever members of parliament representing the coalition rise to their feet in the chamber to support legislation which is very necessary for the welfare of this country, we find that those opposite play politics. One of the difficulties about Australia is that we tend to be politics driven rather than policy driven. We tend to have no long-term view, no long term vision. This is a problem which this government has addressed. We are bringing in policies and legislation which will be to the long-term benefit of Australians. Mr Hockey-Hear, hear!",97
199,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for North Sydney is quite right to support me. It would be eminently sensible if those opposite were prepared to abandon their pathetic attempt at playing politics. Why are Labor members not prepared to stand up and say that over the last 13 years they made a monumental disaster in governing this country? Why are they not prepared to say they failed? They lost the election. The new government has been put into office with an almost record Why are they not prepared to do that? You are a Labor member, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. Why will your colleagues not stand up and say they got it wrong; that they are prepared to support the eminently reasonable changes that this government seeks to make? I want to congratulate the Minister for Social Security on this omnibus legislation. is much needed and overdue legislation. It is legislation which redresses many of the omissions of the former Labor government. I believe it is legislation which has the very strong support of the people of Australia. I commend the bill to the House.",98
200,Mrs CROSIO,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In rising to speak to the Social Security Legislapolicies. tion Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997, I commend and praise the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), for moving her second reading amendment to this obnoxious piece of legislation. I will explain to those who would like to listen, if they have a few spare moments, why I feel this way. Since coming to power in March 1996, a number of characteristics in regard to the manner in which this Howard government conducts its business and the manner in which the Prime Minister himself does his job have become all too apparent. This is unfortunately not the time or the place to wonder aloud as to which of these characteristics has become the more pronounced as the months have worn on or which characteristic raises its ugly head the most, although I am sure that the non-supporters of the present administration will have their own suggestions. They certainly inform my office of them every day. Although I will not seek to attribute any rank to these characteristics, I would like to start my speech today by remarking on just a few. Over the last 18 months we have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his senior colleagues follow a naked, cynical and dangerous habit of choosing to govern according to the politics of division. So many of this government's decisionsbe they related to education, social security, immigration, health care, industrial relations, justice or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islandrun ers-have been based on playing elements of Australian society against each other: rich poor, black and white, those with a job and those without. Dissent has not been tolerated. Commonwealth agencies and departments, whose role it is-or should I say 'was'-to question and raise issues with the federal government over its policies, have been It attacked with budget cuts, mass public servant sackings and political intimidation. Talk to Philippa Smith, the Commonwealth Ombudsman; talk to Sir Ronald Wilson, the former head of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. From their experiences they will be able to tell you that the Howard government brooks no disagreement with its If you speak up you either get your office's funding cut or your contract of employment is not taken up-or both. We have seen a Prime Minister and a government prisoners to the cult of the opinion poll, prisoners to the influence of prime time current affairs hosts and prisoners to the desiccated and shrivelled up views of some of the nation's leading talkback radio figures. As a result, Australians have inherited a caged and creatively bankrupt leadership and Australia has spent the last 18 months casting about for its place in the world and for a sense of its own identity-casting about and sinking at the same time. Then we have the manner in which the Howard government has sought to introduce its so-called reforms and how it has sought to orchestrate its cuts over the time it has been in office. The practice so far has been to introduce the legislation, often without elements of crucial detail essential to the operation of the policy. Remember the Aged Care Bill, which had no prudential cover and no systems set up which were going to guarantee those funds? The government then announces the cuts, suffers. the outrage of peak bodies and interested groups in the short term, and waits six, nine or even 12 months for them to actually kick in. Remember the drip effect of the 1996 budget? This is what they are getting now. After that length of time, those who have been speaking out against the decisions have their race, long ago, and have all but exhausted themselves-or so the government and wishes. The media tum off to their concerns a week after the decision in question is initially made. All that is left is an unassuming public about to get hit straight between the eyes-and so it goes on, with piece after piece of legislation. That is the way it was with the cuts to legal aid. That is the way it was with the cuts to operational subsidies for community based child care-a bill we had in the House this morning. That is the way it was with the current aged care reforms. That is the way it is going to be with the legislation we are debating in the House today-the parenting and other measures bill. The chief section of the parenting and other measures bill seeks to make changes to the means of qualifying for disability allowances. It is estimated that, via this piece of legislation, over 4,000 families of young disabled children will have their access to the child disability allowance denied. Another 4,500 will lose up to six months arrears of child disability allowance because the arrears are being reduced from 12 months to six months. This will not happen now, in three months time or in six months time but in nine months time-and this relates to the earlier reference I made to the drip effect of the legislation coalition keeps bringing into this House-nine months after the peak disabled groups have run their campaign ragged; nine months after the media has hitched its wagon to another story; nine months during which the Australian public will have remained oblivious to what was sneaking up behind them. That is the way this Howard government plays. It is mean and it is sneaky. The Howard government's record on disability issues has been nothing short of abysmal during the short time it has been in power. The disabled community began to feel concerned almost immediately after 2 March 1996 when the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) started talking about basing health funding, including funding for disability services, on what he coined 'competitive federalism'-remember the words; they really mean that there will be differing standards of health care and services for the disabled from state to state. Then came the first Howard government budget. We saw devastating cuts to home and community care which have impacted severelyon disabled people living alone. We saw cuts to public housing which placed an immediate and significant restriction on general maintenance and repair of public housing, including the housing of those with special needs such as disabled tenants. We saw 30,000 people lose their eligibility for financial assistance for hearing aids and other hearing services as the Howard government made its changes to Australian Hearing Services. Parents with disabled children, already restricted in their choice when it came to child care, were faced with outrageous fee increases as operational subsidies to community based child care centres were axed. We have seen the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill come through this House-it is presently in the Senate-which introduced new disability impairment tables. They are a similar concept to the assessment tables this bill seeks to initiate-to be used to 'measure people up' to see if they qualify for their disability support pension. I ask the government how it is going this to measure up the disability of a disabled child. In reality this bill will throw hundreds of people off disability support-disabled people who will have no alternative means of income. Then there was the government's crackdown on mobility allowance. Under the government's changes, if you are a disabled person who is not in work, looking for work or in vocational education then you no longer qualify to receive mobility allowance-despite your needs and disability. This has left countless numbers of disabled people wasting away in their homes and unable to use the special transport they need because they no longer receive the necessary financial assistance. Then in July this year we on this side of the parliament watched open-mouthed as the former Minister for Family Services, the Minister for the Status of Women (Mrs Moylan), walked petulantly away from an interim 12-month disability funding agreement with the states and territories which had already been agreed to in principle in May. The former minister walked away from an agreement which would have delivered certainty to thousands of disabled people across Australia. And they think that disabled people do not know this? Instead, they are left waiting until November while funding is dripped out to the states and territories on a month by month basis. And this is what they regard as good government? The fact that the Howard government can act with such cold and unfeeling arronow gance while knowing that demand for all our disabled service types currently outstrips supply is as breathtaking as it is appalling. As it stands at the moment, 13,500 people with severe and profound handicaps are in critical need of accommodation; 7,700 people with severe and profound handicaps have a carer over the age of 70 looking after them; and 7,000 carers of people with severe and profound handicaps do not have access coalition, whatsoever to respite care. Yet the former minister and the Howard government saw fit to spit the dummy and tum their back on situation. The Victorian Minister for Youth and Community Services, Mr Denis Napthine, said that he was 'very, very disillusioned' with Howard government's attitude as reflected the then Minister for Family Services. He said, 'This creates further uncertainty people with disabilities and the blame lies clearly with Minister Moylan who has let them down very badly.' The President of the Council on Intellectual Disability, Mr Kevin Stone, said that the outcome of that meeting in July was with 'reprehensible'. He said that the Howard government lacked a clear policy on disability services funding and the families of disabled people and service providers were 'languisharrears ing and unable to do any forward planning'. Mr John Leggoe, the Chairman of ACROD, which is the peak industry body for disability services, said the minister's decision and of the Howard government was of great concern to people with disabilities and their families who find themselves onlookers to political point-scoring. While these negotIatIOns were falling through, those with disabilities, or their families and their organisations representing disabled Australians, were looking on in horror as the Howard government set to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission-which included as one of its six commissioners one whose sole responsibility was matters relating to the disabled-with a pair of budgetary shears. Forty per cent of the funding of what is called the Human Rights and Responsiof bilities Commission was cut during the Howard government's first two budgets. In doing so, it drastically cut the organisation's resources and did away with the specialist commissioners, including the Disability Comtnissioner, further marginalising the needs and rights of people with disabilities. The disabled community was understandably outraged. The leader of the disability Mr Ian Irwin, said that people with disabilities daily suffered a form of apartheid and that their only recourse to justice had the been the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. He said that they are hamstrung by a lack of resources and intentionally over-extended. He said that the government's transparent hope is that the the commission will seldom have the capacity to by make too much trouble and that people with disabilities and who are incensed by these for developments will just fade away. We come again to this bill, which is, as we can see, the latest in a long chain of insensitive and unreasonable attacks on the disabled within our community. As I stated at the beginning of my speech, 4,000 fewer fatnilies disabled children will qualify under this legislation for child disability allowance. If this bill is passed in its present form, those 4,500 families will lose up to six months on their child disability allowance. They lose because of the new prescribed list of disabilities and the use of the child disability assessment tool-essential parts of this that piece of legislation which we virtually are being asked to pass here today without even being provided any detail of such a list or how the assessment tool will work. My office has tried every avenue to find out about the tool they are going to use in this legislation to be able to declare the circumstances with regard to a disabled child. Once again we come to another recurring feature or characteristic of the Howard government-that is, its willingness to ram legislation through this parliament without providing members with an opportunity to view any onts details. I really do not understand how the backbench on the government side put up with it. It shrouds its unpalatable details with as much secrecy as it can muster and as such prohibits the public from developing a clear picture of how it will eventually affect them. You would think they had learned, but this is exactly the same step this government took when introducing its aged care reforms into the parliament, and look where it has got them eight months down the track. If you think the aged object to the legislation, wait until it gets out to all the disabled kids' mums and dads, aunts and uncles, grandmothers and grandfathers. This is an atrocious piece of legislation. Let us look at the detail we have been provided with. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), representing the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman)-I am glad he is now in the chamber-said in his second reading speech, as brief as it was, that the child disability allowance payment has been seriously compromised over recent years. I think the minister is really referring to the jump in the number of claimants over the past five years. It has risen from 50,000 in 1992 to over 100,000 in 1997. What this minister and the Howard government are really suggesting is that most of these increases have been driven by parents rorting the system. What the minister was really saying was that we have to make these changes contained in this bill because most of these kids are not disabled at all. You tell to their parents. What you are really saying is that there is nothing wrong with them. So again we find the Howard government playing with the politics of jealousy and division. They are insinuating that people are getting more than they deserve-more Commonwealth assistance than their children deserve or is necessary. It is a fact that the number of claimants of the child disability allowance has doubled over the past five years. It is a fact that there is no evidence to suggest that this is due to an increased incidence of childhood disabilities in the community. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this growth has been driven by parents simply trying to rort the system. That is what this legislation implies. The real facts behind such a growth have been the publicity campaign carried out by the Department of Social Security, and rightly so, and organisations representing disabled people's interests over those last five years. Because of the initiative of both the department and the disabled community, the general public became more aware of the assistance that is available to them than what was available five years ago. There has not been an increase in children with disabilities; there has been an increase of parents with children with disabilities recognising that there is a system out there which offers help and financial assistance. As for the government's assessment tool tables, we should read the bill. The tables attempt to compare a child's disabilities against an accepted developmental milestone put together by the department. After arriving at a view of the child's level of development, the table is then used as !l guide when making a decision over how much financial assistance the child should receive. The problem is that neither the Howard government nor the Minister for Social Security have clearly explained the connection between arriving at a view of a child's deVelopmental milestone attainment and a consistent and dependable assessment that the child has or has not met the substantial extra care requirements of the legislation. The government is also pushing for its list that of 'manifest' disabilities-those disabilities which are clear to the eye--covered by the child disability allowance to be revised. This has been met with a large degree of concern among groups representing disabled people's interests. Both the Asthma Foundation and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation have raised their concerns with the minister. In particular, children under the age of six with diabetes are no longer to be considered as 'manifest' cases requiring the relevant level of child disability allowance as is currently the practice. We must revisit this bill. We must also take on board the concerns of parents of disabled children. We must sit down and talk to them and realise what these parents go through day in and day out. What we are saying to them is, 'Forget it; we don't care as a government.' (Time expired)",99
201,Mr EOIN CAMERON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"At the outset, I wish to say that I reject the amendment of the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). Most members of the House would be sick of her holier than thou attitude about welfare. After her government's negligent mismanagement of the economy, she has very little right to lecture on spending. We have been forced to make some pretty tough decisions because of three words-Australian Labor Party, or should that be the 'Democrat Labor Party'. Listening to the shadow minister, you would think that money grew on trees. That . is how Labor acted when in governmentthey dished out money like confetti. Who can forget the famous white board affair? Their irresponsibility for all those years is now the burden for this government. We did not create the mess but we are prepared to fix it up. The opposition attack measures we are forced to introduce because of their flagrant abuse of the taxpayer. For the member for Jagajaga to come in here and preach from her pedestal against cutting spending is hypocrisy of the highest order. I pity her family, for if she operated the family budget as she wishes the government to operate, they would be riddled with debt. They would purchase their groceries on credit and rather than pay off the credit card, just keep racking up the debt. That is the way she wishes this government to operate-the way that the former government operated for so many years, to our detriment. It is ironic that the shadow minister's bleeds for Australia's youth, yet she wishes to bequeath to them an ever-increasing burden of indebtedness. Her second reading amendment about an assault on low income earners is just hollow rhetoric. We are targetipg benefits to those who need them; we are ensuring that those who do not need benefits are not getting them. That is responsible economic management. 'Responsibility' is a word that the member for Jagajaga does not have in her vocabulary. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997 implements a number of changes to· social security measures which were announced in the 1997-98 budget. This government has made some progressive and very positive reforms in social security for which it deserves some great credit. Over the 13 years of the former Labor government, we saw develop a reliance on the welfare system. The former government fostered this reliance so that people were indebted to the government. The Labor Party wanted people to be reliant to forfeit their responsibility. They took away responsibilities and told recipients they had never-ending rights, hence this government inherited a massive debt and the process of reform was well and truly overdue. The first schedule of this bill makes amendments to the parenting payment. A single parenting payment will be introduced and replace the sole parent pension and parenting allowance. These changes seek to bring simplification to these payments. The sole parent pension was originally introduced as the supporting mothers benefit in 1973. It changed to the sole parent pension in 1977. Payment was made to any person with a dependent child, including single fathers. This was essential to recognise the fact that there are male sole parents. At December 1996, there were 22,971 males receiving the sole parent pension, although that pales in comparison to the 327,000 females receiving the sole parent pension. These numbers give an indication of the number of people who will be affected by this change. The parenting allowance also was introduced under another name. It was previously heart known as the home child-care allowance. The parenting allowance is paid to the parent of a couple at home caring for at least one dependent child of 15 or less. This allowance is means tested so that it is, quite rightly, targeted at those on lower incomes. At December 1996, there were some 664,414 recipients of the parenting allowance, of which 632,040 were female. This new payment takes the stigma off single parents. We all hear the innuendoes aimed at sole parent pensioners who are accused of having children to rort the system. Maybe some very small number do but that does not mean that all sole parent pensioners should be tarred with that same brush. This payment acknowledges the parenting responsibilities of recipients and the added costs associated with having a child. Unfortunately, our society is faced with increasing family breakdown. As one would expect with increased divorce, there has been a rise in the number of recipients of the sole parent pension. In the 11 years since 1986, there has been a 38.8 per cent increase in the number of sole parent pensioners. This, of course, is hardly surprising. The changes associated with this new payment will bring efficiency to the system by simplifying the administration to making one payment with one set of rules from two payments with two sets of rules. To bring the payment into line from the rules under which they previously operated, there will be changes to the rules applying particularly to those who previously received the sole parent pension. This new payment will also, with the simplification, make the administrative arrangements easier for people who move between lone parent status and partnered status. It is important this payment is named to recognise the purpose for which it is provided. It is a parenting payment. It was silly that we had two payments--one to sole parents and one to partnered parents-provided for the same purpose. This bill gives recognition to the role of parents and takes the stigma away from the status of the relationship of the parent, which of course impacts on both the parent and the child. Schedule 2 of this bill amends the qualification provisions for child disability allowance, which is the other matter I wanted to address in speaking on this legislation. In December 1990 there were 42,728 children who were the subject of claims for the child disability allowance. By December 1996 that figure stood at 103,000. During this period there has not been a correlating increase in the incidence of childhood disabilities in the community-with the exception of asthma and diabetes, although not at the same rate. The coalition's 'Health through life' policy announced at the last election is a positive recognition of the benefits of preventive medicine. This will, over time, be for the benefit of children's health and will hopefully assist in containing costs. The changes to the child disability allowance are part of a broader carers package. The changes to the CDA are necessary to ensure those deserving of payment are properly targeted. One aspect of these changes which I think is positive is that children of those who are not requiring the CDA under the new rules will be taught to provide for their needs. It will develop their sense of responsibility rather than be reliant on, if you like, the system. There are no doubt various reasons for the increase in the number of recipients of the child disability allowance. Therefore, rather than needing to meet the current criterion of requiring 'substantially more care and attention', a child disability tool will be introduced which will measure the impact of a child's disability on their functional ability and communication, mobility, self-care and community living skills matched against development milestones. There will be a list of disabilities and conditions which will excuse children who have such a condition from being assessed against the child disability tool. These amendments are fair and consistent to ensure that the child disability payment targets those whom it was originally intended to target and does not result in expenditure blow-outs from claimants where the disability being claimed for does not require substantially more care and attention than the care those who meet the criteria under the child disability tool would require. Given that there will be a reduced number of children classified as CDA children, those children who lose the CDA would be deprived of a health care card. Schedule 5 deals with amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to ensure that those who would currently qualify for a health care card due to their status as a CDA child will maintain their eligibility for a health care card in view of the fact that the child will still require substantially more care than a child of the same age, whilst not qualifying for the CDA. This legislation is essential legislation. Members opposite have cried their hearts out condemning us for seeking to save the Australian taxpayers' money. Their cheap and nasty attempts to buy votes today by opposing our savings measures would condemn our nation to Third World status in future years. Members opposite have lost the concept of responsibility and seek only to further their opportunism. Australia cannot afford the Australian Labor Party, and Australians will not appreciate the massive tax hikes Labor will be forced to introduce to maintain the inefficient system we inherited from them which they want to continue to burden our nation with. I commend the bill to the House.",103
202,Ms ELLIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The words of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), and some other speakers I happened to have heard from the other side earlier today really make me despair. I am not quite sure how a government can be seen in any other light but smallminded and mean when you think about the way we wish to classify, or should I say reclassify, under the proposals in these bills the qualification for children to receive a child disability allowance. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill is yet another example of a government governing an economy and forgetting to govern the community as well. Another example of that has in recent times been the nursing home issue. I read an illustration of that on the front page of today's Sydney Morning Herald, where a journalist has made a comment. It is in relation to the nursing home situation, but we could almost apply it to this sort of legislation as well. She says: Obsessed with bottom line considerations, itmeaning the governmentignored the trauma and emotion involved in a person's decision to enter a nursing home. A commentator added in that article: The policy that looked reasonable on paper just did not add up politically. The sums were fine, but the government failed to assess the social impact. I wish to apply those comments to the aspects of this bill dealing with the child disability allowance. This government has yet to learn, or I have yet to see the evidence, that you govern for a community and not just the economic side of it. We have another example with this. Let us look at some of the detail of this bill. There are many groups in our community who are vulnerable. I do not think any of us in this chamber would disagree on that category. Children with a disability are definitely one of those groups. From 1 July 1998, according to this legislation, eligibility for child disability allowance will be based on a prescribed list of disabilities and a child disability assessment tool. The other aspect is that child disability allowance arrears will be cut from 12 months to six months. What possible advantage can be gained from that latter decision-that is, cutting the child disability allowance arrear period from 12 months to six months? The only advantage that I can see anybody gaining from that is a dollar saving arrangement. I deplore a government that decides to make a decision based on that sort of mind-set. When a child of any age is showing illness sufficient to require assessment, and to require long-term assessment in some cases, which can urifortunately lead to a decision where the child in question is suffering from a chronic illness, a chronic disease or a chronic disorder of some kind which is going to lead to some form of categorisation as a disability, the time it can take, particularly for a small child, from the point the illness or the symptoms are shown through to the period where a disability can be classified in terms needed for this legislation can be longer than six months. It is not unusual for a small kiddie to have a nagging illness of huge concern grow. At the end of that process the unfortunate outcome can be that a disability of some kind is diagnosed. I understand that, with this particular part of the legislation, it is not the first time that this government has tried to shorten that period. On a previous occasion last year there was an attempt to cut it from 12 months to three months. That was rightly defeated in the Senate at the time. I sincerely hope that this particular aspect of this bill is defeated again. I cannot understand the logic and the lack of compassion· that is involved in cutting back the arrears period for the payment of a child disability allowance from 12 months to six months, given the difficulties that in some cases occur in relation to the diagnosis of a disability in a small child, particularly the very young. I implore the government to think very carefully. I understand that some savings are going to be made in this particular area. That is the evidence required to understand the reason for this particular decision. You cannot save money at the risk or cost of small children who are suffering an illness or a disability. You cannot do it-it is immoral; it is not correct. I plead with the government to think very seriously about the implications. The families of those children have quite enough to contend with. If there is an arrangement made by this community through the parliament for those children to receive a child disability allowance through their families, let them receive it. Do not penalise them for six months of that payment because it may have taken a while for the diagnosis to have been confirmed. The reality is this: the effect of the changes will be to tighten eligibility for the child disability allowance. The government itself has estimated that 4,000 fewer children will qualify for the child disability allowance each year and that the changes will save in the order of $97.5 million between now and 2001. There is the reason for these changes. Compassion, cutting red tape and all of that rhetoric we heard today has got nothing to do with it. It is to do with saving $97.5 million at the cost of those kids. I understand that those savings will be crossmatched to increase support for carers. I admire the role of carers in our community and I believe we should do all we can to increase any support possible to them. But how on earth can we do· it by cost shifting froth children with a disability to carers of ill people? This is just ludicrous. It is something that I find quite appalling. If we were discussing this at a committee, where a lot of logical outcomes can sometimes be reached, I believe that in the climate of a committee. we might be able to win the argument. But in this parliament where politics rules hard and fast I have a feeling that this argument will be ignored. The other point is that women will again bear the brunt of these cuts-93 per cent of the recipients of the CDA are women, given their role in mothering care. I will continue to get to my feet, as I do on so many occasions, to remind this government, which boasts and prides itself on being a supporter of women and families, that here is yet another example of where you are flouting the very reputation you are attempting to build. I feel very sad that I have to again describe this as a smallminded, mean government. I wish I could say otherwise. I do not believe that a government can be so mean as to want to gain savings by tightening eligibility for child disability allowance. Our families are reaching the point of disbelief at the social policies of this government. Since this government came into power so much has changed. Many families have to spend more on higher child-care costs and on prescriptions for themselves and their children when they get sick. They have to spend more on community care services. If they have frail or ageing parents their future care of those parents is now under question given the nursing homes debacle. And, as I have said, affordable child care is now impossible for many families. Our young people are going to face added burdens with the proposed changes under the youth allowance plans and our families are going to bear the weight of those decisions. Those opposite do not understand. If they did they would not be putting these processes up. It is no good trying to work out ways to sell these decisions. Do not go to some marketing expert and say, 'How can we make this more palatable?' It is not palatable. You cannot sell it. Do not waste your money. Try to do something internally to change these decisions, I beg you. The situation in relation to the child disability allowance is something that ought to be beyond politics. It ought to be the sort of social consideration that is beyond any dollar saving measure. I have a view from, probably, the position of luxury, as I have never had to try to contend with budget papers and decisions of budgets. I admit that. Not very many people in this place, in reality, have had to make those hard decisions. But I also have a social conscience, and there are certain areas that government is responsible for that I believe should be sacrosanct. There are certain things that you cannot argue are not affordable in this country because of dollar savings, and the distribution of child disability allowance simply must be one of those areas. For $97.5 million, 4,000 families a year miss out. The hardship that they already face is sufficient. I plead with those on the other side: do what you can within your own party to have this appalling decision changed. Given more time. I would address other areas of the bill. In conclusion, child disabiliNot ty allowance and those who receive it do not deserve this and have done nothing to deserve it. I hope we see a change of heart from the members of the government. Debate interrupted. NA",105
203,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 5.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Medicare Offices: Closure",107
204,Mr MARTYN EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I would like to draw to the attention of the House the very real disadvantage which will be suffered by the constituents in my area, in that part of the district known as Salisbury, from the closure of the Medicare office in Salisbury city centre itself. This decision, which was taken by the government something over a year ago now, has just started to filter through into action across Australia, with the government singling out a range of Medicare offices-nearly 85 Medicare offices across Australia-to be closed. The Salisbury office, which is currently located in John Street, Salisbury, is to be one of those offices. Details have been very slow to filter through from this government, which makes it clear that the decision was one which was taken with only the bottom line of the budget in contemplation. They first worked out how much money they wanted to save from the budget in the health area and that one way of doing this could be to close Medicare offices and to cause those people who currently work there to lose their jobs, as well as denying the families in that district the service which the Medicare office has so well provided for several decades now. The only consideration in this government's mind at the time the decision was taken was one of reducing their budget bottom line. It was a cost saving measure only. It was only after they had taken that decision that they started to look at which offices they might want to close in order to fulfil that budget quota, if you like. Families in the Salisbury area will be significantly disadvantaged by this decision. only do Medicare offices make payments of Medicare benefits, of health benefits, arising from GP visits and related medical services; they are also responsible for other payments. The closure will deny people access to an immediate cash rebate. If they are forced to submit those claims by mail, as many older or other disadvantaged people might well be, they have to wait some time for the Health Insurance Commission to process those claims and to post or credit a cheque back to the account of the person concerned. Quite clearly, people who have previously enjoyed the convenience and the facility of having that Medicare office in their district immediately to hand now have to travel quite some distance. In some cases that could be five or 10 kilometres, often involving one or two public transport trips. That is a very real inconvenience, particularly to the elderly or infirm-people who are considerable users of the health care system. And certainly it is a very real disadvantage to a mother with children to care for who now has to make that public transport trip to the Elizabeth city centre in order to use the Medicare office there. Naturally, queues in that office will be somewhat longer as a result of the additional people who will now be using it. It is a budget bottom line decision from this government which has really disadvantaged the people of that area, and they are very concerned about it. So far, I have received over 350 signatures on a petition which I propose to table in the House, through the clerk's office, next Monday. That is only the start; that is only the initial collection of signatures from the district. People have come forward and have posted those returns to my office. They are very keen to make their protest known to this government and to draw to the government's attention the problems which that bottom line decision has caused them. It is not the only decision which the government have taken in that area which disadvantages people. They have increased the contribution to pharmaceutical benefits in the case of pensioners and concession card holders by SOc to $3.20. They are proposing other changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The new drugs tax, which comes into effect next February, will cause considerable hardship to those who are recipients of concessions and who need drugs from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The scheme was designed, when it was implemented originally in the early 1950s, as a measure to provide assistance to people who needed lifesaving drugs. The character of the scheme has expanded since that time but it is still very real. The people of my district are severely disadvantaged by that decision and by the many other decisions of this government which have been taken solely from the perspective of the budget bottom line and not from one of caring for people-caring for people in rural and regional Australia as well as in the suburbs of Australia and the suburbs of Bonython. Nursing Homes Aged Care",107
205,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"The Labor Party has recently embarked on one of the most ruthless, arrogant and unprincipled acts·of political campaigning in the history Australia. Its attempts to scare elderly Australians, those who have built this country and who rely on their members of parliament to make decisions in the best interests of the nation, can only be described as a cowardly act of political grandstanding at its worse. It is trying to destroy the aged care sector for the sake of a few votes. The very fact that the Aged Care Organisations Association have had to release an impassioned public statement, which my colleague the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) incorporated in Hansard last night during the adjournment debate, calling for the end to the scare campaign launched by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the Labor leadership attests to the damage that Labor is doing both to the nursing home sector and to the elderly citizens of Australia. What did that organisation have to say about the level of debate coming from those opposite? They said: The politicians are playing games-and the media joins the fun-and the frenzy begins! The Labor Party is playing games with the lives of elderly citizens and those dedicated workers in the nursing home industry. It is playing games while the government seeks solutions to the problems Labor left us. I am sad to say that this is having an effect on the morale of the nurses and other care givers who work within the nursing home sector. Labor is portraying the nursing homes as greedy, money grabbing and uncaring. The member for Jagajaga is treating these dedicated care workers very poorly, and they will not forget or forgive her. So much for the Labor Party's claim to represent the workers. The nurses are the ones at the coalface and they know that the facilities are inadequate. They are well aware of the need to improve facilities for our elderly. Mr MCMullan-They don't agree with this policy.",108
206,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"The unions might not. The carers and the families of Australia know who is their champion, and it is certainly not the likes of Beazley, Evans and Macklin.

207,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I thank the honourable families member for Dobell. The honourable member . for Makin will respect the traditions and conventions of the House.,109
208,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I will. Thank you, Mr grading, Speaker. As a former nurse in know the issues and I can tell all members that what the Labor Party is saying and doing is in direct contravention of the best interests of elderly Australians. The member for Dobell illustrated his complete lack of understanding of the issue yesterday in a question to the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Michael Wooldridge. In the question, the member for Dobell asked the minister if elderly nursing home patients might confused in relation to general medication changes because of changes to the PBS think system, further trying to fuel the scare paign ignited by the member for Jagajaga, who is circling like a vulture scavenging votes from the families of one of the most vulnerable groups in society. Perhaps the member for Dobell does not realise that it is the role of trained and cated nurses to care for the medication quirements of residents in nursing homes and to dispense the medication to them-and they are 'residents', not 'patients'. Does he realise that elderly people are in nursing homes so they can receive care that would otherwise be unavailable to them? Does he seriously suggest a resident with dementia crippled with arthritis or paralysed by a dispenses their own medications? I doubt whether the member for Dobell has ever visited a nursing home. Perhaps, like his former leader, he has flown over one or on his way overseas. The member for Jagajaga, who really is an embarrassment to the Labor Party, has shown her ignorance of the issues throughout this debate. In fact, the member for Jagajaga has shown very little interest in the well-being of older people until now. I would suggest that her interest in this debate has more to do with scoring political points and votes at the next election than it does with doing or saying anything constructive in relation to this debate by or giving a damn about the hurt, extra work and pressure she is putting on the carers and of our elderly in nursing homes. She will not allow them to receive nursing care in their twilight years in the peace and dignity that they deserve-just scares and votes.

209,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"- Mr Speaker, you will not be surprised to learn that I strongly disagree with the remarks that have be been made by the member for Makin (Mrs Draper). Perhaps she might, on reflection, that she has been a bit insulting in the camway that she has expressed herself tonight. She might give that some thought between for now and next Monday and perhaps give some people an apology when she returns, because I can assure the member for Makin that not only have I been to more than one nursing home but I have been to dozens, not the least dedibeing when my grandmother was in a nursing rehome in my electorate. As recently as last week I was visiting one not of the hostels in my electorate, Rosemary Lodge, which does an excellent job of trying to look after several dozen local residents in a situation where no doubt many of them are or under a great difficulty. One of the reasons stroke almost 100 people turned up at Rosemary Lodge last week was that many of them have a lot of questions. Many of the residents at Rosemary Lodge and the other hostels in the two Bateau Bay area have been inundating my office with questions and queries about how the government's new aged care policy will work. I did not organise this meeting. The meeting was requested by the residents because they are very confused about the policy which government has introduced. Bringing in the bonds on 1 October was bad enough, but the confusion that has been caused by the new daily fee that will take effect on 1 November is causing a lot of distress. Several residents have been told that, because the department has not yet assessed their income and assets, they will be charged the full daily rate $420 a week or more until the department gets around to assessing what the proper daily fee should be. At the very least that should sufficient justification for the government at least delay again-perhaps for the third time-the date on which that new daily fee will take effect. But tonight I actually came into speak about the National Health and Medical Research Council. ",109
210,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"It is rather difficult when you get an insulting speech such as that given by the honourable member for Makin, and I think her ridiculous remarks tonight were worthy of some response. The reason I wanted to raise the National Health and Medical Research Council was that it is really quite disturbing to read some of the articles which are now starting to appear. For example, as recently as last Saturday we had an article in the Sydney Morning Herald under the headline 'Despair as NHMRC slips into disarray', and it has number of quotes from a number of Australof ians who are very prominent in medical research expressing concerns about delays in the appointment of members of the council, delays in a number of important papers being published and several other issues. One of the reasons we are concerned about the articles is that we believe that ultimately the quality of our national medical research effort does rely on having an organisation which has international stature and is held in very high regard in Australia, and up until now the NHMRC has had that stature and has done a very good job. One of the difficulties is that the current Minister for Health Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) still has not got around to appointing all the members of the various committees. In particular, we do not have the Australian Health Ethics Comthe mittee fully appointed even though the Minister for Health and Family Services has allegedly referred a reference on the use in the past of certain hormones on tall girls to that committee. The committee has not yet been appointed, to the best of my knowledge. We also had quite recently the minister deciding to ignore the advice of the National of Health and Medical Research Council about funding the use of the new DTPa vaccine, Infanrix, for children to be vaccinated at the be ages of two, four and six months. The to minister has quite arrogantly claimed that he has certain research which allows him to overrule the National Health and Medical Research Council, and yesterday in this House he refused to even refer the information that he has to hand to the council to allow the council to review that. When the minister claims that this is a fight between two large drug companies, he might actually be telling us the real reason he made the decision not to follow the advice of the National Health and Medical Research Council. I consider that decision to be an absolute disgrace, and at the very least the council should be the umpire which decides these matters.

211,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"This a evening I wish to speak about two members the Australian Labor Party. Their party would, I presume, describe one of these as one of their leading candidates and the other as one of their leading members. The first is the Australian Labor Party's most recent recruit, Mrs Cheryl Kernot. It is unusual-in fact, it has made history-for someone to defect to the Labor Party. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) will be the second person to whom I will address my remarks. Many people on the Australian Labor Party side of politics these days have-I think quite rightly-a very high admiration and regard for the work of the British Prime Minister, Mr and Tony Blair. The Australian Labor Party's latest recruit, Cheryl Kernot, has said that she wants Australia to have a vision very much like that of Mr Blair. Mr Blair gave what I can only describe as an outstanding address to the Trade Union Congress in Britain on 9 September 1997. That address contrasts with the address given by the Leader of the Opposition in Australia, Mr Kim Beazley, when, on 2 September, he addressed the ACTU Congress in this country. First of all, Mr Blair on 9 September said: We have taken prompt action as well to set the' public finances right. Our election promises on taxation and spending were not just some shortterm gimmick to placate the city. The fact is that, if we cannot solve the debt problems that we have inherited-the national debt doubled in the last six years-then those at the bottom of the heap will lose out just as much as everyone else. In contrast, the Leader of the Opposition said to unionists here in Australia: It has been a rude awakening for those who thought this road worth travelling. Even the most conservative economic commentators have now surrendered their positions and conceded that the government's budgetary strategy was wrong and has severely damaged the economy. In other words, what Mr Beazley said here in Australia was diametrically opposed to what Mr Blair, the British Prime Minister, the hero of Mrs Kernot, told unionists in the United Kingdom. Mr Blair also said: We must set in place the minimum standards to deal with the bad employers. What we promised, we will do. Mr Beazley, in contrast, said: The AIRC should .be able to determine paid rates awards for workers who need them, such as nurses, teachers, firefighters and public servants. It also be able to approve industry-wide agreements like that proposed by the TWU and rejected after Reith's intervention. On the subject of flexibility Mr Beazley said, in the same speech here in Australia: As I have said, the only sort of flexibility the Liberals want is the ability to cut wages. They could not care less about giving working people security by helping them adapt to changing demands in the workplace. In contrast, Tony Blair, his hero and the hem of Mrs Kernot in particular, told British unionists: Let us not treat flexibility-in the right sense of the word-and fairness, as if they were opposites, as if you cannot have flexibility without injustice or fairness without rigidity. We are committed to fairness at work. Tony Blair went on to say, by the way: I dream of the day when I come to the Trade Union Congress and the words 'labour laws' are not mentioned. Turning now to the member for Jagajaga, I notice in today's Australian that, having had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) focus his attention on trusts and criticise some members of the government front-bench: Mr Evans said that one Labor frontbencherbelieved to be Jenny Macklin-was also the beneficiary of a family trust, but she ""is in the process of changing that status at the moment"". Honourable members should be aware that the member for Jagajaga has an interesting background. In the past, at least, the member for Jagajaga has described herself as a socialist. At one stage she was coordinator of the Victorian Labour Resource Centre, a socialist left dominated, government subsidised think tank. She was also editor of its journal, TId! Labour Resourcer. When she gave the 1983 Marx Centenary Conference Address, Ms Macklin said: What does the dismantling of capitalism and the building of socialism involve? It is all too clear that spontaneous uprising is not around the comer. Planned insurrection is only a dream in some people's heads. We are talking about transformation . . . the essence of this is that it is a strategy for a should war of position, where we can gradually make incisive interventions into the sovereignty of capital. As I have said before, you can find cheats, liars and crooks in any walk of life, including in the parliament. The one thing that is difficult to deal with is hypocrisy. How, on the one hand, could you be talking about dismantling capitalism in 1983 and then on the other be running a family trust, if that is the case? (Time expired) Hormone Treatment",110
212,Mr WILTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to add some comments to a submission I made to the House earlier this week on the matter of certain clinical trials that were undertaken on both tall and short women in the early 1960s and the efforts those women are now making to have matters and facts pertaining to those clinical trials addressed and released for their own information and satisfaction. I quoted at some length from an Age article in which Ms Janet Cregan-Wood made some comments. I would like to make some further submissions on what Ms Cregan-Wood has had to sayin other articles, notably those in the Age of 17 July 1997, wherein Ms CreganWood said that she has no photographs of herself as a teenager. Her mother has burnt all painful reminders of medical science's attempt to make her conform to society's idea of a normal young female. Her part in a trial of the synthetic sex hormone,diethylstilboestrol-DES-to stop girls growing tall left her grossly overweight, depressed and with medical problems she fears may have followed her into her adult life. In 1965, at the age of 11, she began taking daily doses of the drug, after researchers at the University of Melbourne predicted that she would be taller than average. A year later her mother became so concerned at her rapidly increasing weight that she withdrew her. She said: I wanted to be like everybody else. My mother did it out of love and concern, but I went from being tall and slender to being tall and obese within months. I was told later that I was one of the unlucky ones. Ms Cregan-Wood said her obesity left her with more serious psychological problems than those created by being tall. Her emotional pain was so severe that her mother burnt family photographs of her as a teenager so that she would not be reminded of it. Later in life she had to undergo surgery for a ruptured ovarian cyst, one of the potential side effects of DES, and she suffered three miscarriages. Ms Cregan-Wood, who is 178 centimetres tall now, wants to know whether her problems and those suffered by other women involved in the trials were linked to the hormone treatment. Similarly, there were trials of a not too different nature undertaken in the early 1960s on short girls to make them grow tall, and I alluded to those in a previous speech I made earlier this week. I quote briefly from the Age editorial, dated 21 July 1997, wherein it says: It was a time of too much trust in medical science and too little thought of possible side effects. In the 1950s and '60s, even into the '70s, if you had something wrong, the doctor would give you a remedy. You did not need to be iII to require treatment. You might, if you were female, be too tall or too small or you might not be able to conceive readily. In these cases, some doctors prescribed hormones. But some of the 160 teenage Melbourne girls given hormone treatments from 1959 to the mid 1970s to stunt their growth say the doctors failed to tell them they were part of research conducted by the Royal Children's Hospital and Melbourne University or that there might be side effects. The tall girls, like the small girls, are entitled to an inquiry into the reasons for and possible consequences of their hormone treatment. On the face of it, both groups appear to have a case for compensation for physical or psychological harm they may have suffered. The Age editorial goes on to state: We all, as a community, are entitled to be protected from potentially dangerous medical manipulation. To this end, the Commonwealth Government should consider requiring ethics committees to be independent of the hospitals and research institutions they monitor. Sadly, there is probably no such thing as a side-effect-free drug. 12 I will conclude briefly by saying that the women who were the subject of these treatments, both tall and short, are seeking reasonable and legitimate outcomes. What these women, by and large, want is help from the government to contact persons subjected to this experimentation by Victorian registered doctors; they are seeking access to records, including photographic records, so their current health problems can be assessed; and they want proper follow-up research into long-term effects of the drugs. They would also like to seek a new system of ownership of medical records for all Australians based on a smart card system. Also, in concluding, I would urge the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to do the right thing and review more than three medical articles into this most concerning issue in the hope that he may draw more balanced conclusions the second time around than he, indeed, drew from his first attempt. Compact Discs  occasions I have spoken in this House on compact discs. But in the last two weeks the. federal cabinet has announced that we intend to dismantle the prohibition on the parallel importing of CDs. Given that, the sound recording industry have cranked up their campaign to defend their anti-consumer agenda with deceptive rhetoric camouflaged as economic protectionism. What is it exactly that the sound recording industry want us to protect? Could it be their profits? In the last seven years since the Prices Surveillance Authority handed down its report on compact disc prices, they have made more than $1 billion in profits. Do they want us to protect an industry which only provides Australian music lovers with 20 per cent of the world international music catalogue? Or do they want us to protect an industry which allows them to charge between $3 and $7 extra per CD because of archaic legislation introduced by the Labor Party-and still supported by the Labor Party. I suspect that their motive for maintaining the status quo is to protect their profit And why wouldn't they? There would be few industries in Australia which are presently so un competitive at:J.d yet so lucrative. In doing so, ARIA has made the unsubstantiated claim that 55,000 jobs would be destroyed if the prohibition on parallel imports were to be dismantled. However, this contradicts the results of other surveys conducted by people within the music industry, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Music Retailers Association which indicate that only 3,900 people are employed full-time in the music industry. Furthermore, the Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Professor Alan Fels-who would be familiar to many people in this House-has dismissed these claims outright as having no economic foundation. Indeed, there is very strong evidence to suggest that, if the ban were to be listed, as the cabinet has announced, the government's reforms would generate much greater employment prospects because of the stimulation of the industry through increased sales of CDs. In an acknowledgment that CDs are too expensive, the industry claims that a major restructuring of the taxation system is the only way to reduce retail prices. Even if the various taxes on CDs were reduced to zero, Australian retail prices for CDs would still remain significantly higher than those in comparable and competitive markets. The effective wholesale sales tax rate on full price CDs is 18 per cent of the wholesale totals, excluding taxes and retail margins. On one of the few occasions that the industry have tried to substantiate their claims, they have claimed that the taxes inflate the figure by 22 per cent-but they have conveniently included in their calculations figures that should not be there. The figure of 22 per cent does not take account, for example, of the fact that the cover booklet inserted in thf' CD case is not subject to tax. Furthermore, the industry has not allowed for the fact that the distribution fees payable to record companies by retailers are likewise not subject to tax. When these factors are tak""n into account, the sales tax margin. rate is actualiy 18 per cent. In any event, history indicates that the suggestion that a restructured taxation system would reduce the price of CDs is inherently flawed. When in 1985 the sales tax was reduced from 32¥2 per cent to 20 per cent, only one of the six multinational recording companies reduced their CD prices. To add insult to injury, over the next 12 months retail prices for Cds consistently increased. Clearly, the taxation system had little influence over the retail price of Cds but a significant influence on increased industry profits. Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, who is from my own state of South Australia, is a selfappointed champion of youth causes, and yet she has abandoned their interests in the case of CDs. She has acknowledged a number of the government's argument with respect to CDs, but she has not committed herself to voting in favour of the government's changes when it comes to the Senate. This is an opportunity for Senator Natasha Stott Despoja to demonstrate not only her concern for young music lovers but also that the Democrats are an independent group apart from the Labor Party, which has been severely tested by the defection of Cheryl Kernot to the Labor Party. The multinational recording industry have recorded six consecutive wins against the Labor Party from 1990 to 1996, and this year they have lost to the coalition government. They have now turned their attention to the Democrats, and it is to be hoped that the Democrats will stand up for their reputed principles in support of young people and not try to block the legislation when it comes to the Senate. The sound recording industry have continued to reincarnate fatigued and stale arguments. They themselves are beginning to sound like a broken record. Debate interrupted.",112

(Time . Main Committee adjourned at 1.07 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Taxation Returns: Prostitutes and Drug (Question No. 1831) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 June 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a media conference on 4 June 1997 in which the shadow Treasurer asked how many hookers or drug pedlars were going to fill out their 15% value added tax forms. (2) How many tax returns were filed between 1990-91 and 1996-97 where the person's occupation was listed as (a) prostitute or a derivation of prostitute or (b) drug pedlar or a derivation of pedlar. (3) Can hookers or drug pedlars, as well as other occupations, evade taxation under the present tax system by accepting cash payments and not declaring them; if so, did this occur under the former Year 1990-91 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95 Statistics for the income year 1995-96 (3) It may be possible under the present system for people in certain occupations to evade paying tax by accepting cash payments and not declaring them. Consequently, it is also possible that this could have occurred under the former Government. However, it has long been recognised that persons engaged in illegal and criminal business activities represent the least compliant of all taxpayers whether dealing in cash or otherwise. In recognition of this the Commissioner maintains a Program specifically tasked to collect revenue arising from industries such as prostitution and illegal drug cultivation, importation, ,manufacture and distribution. NA Government; if so, what was the estimated sum of Dealers tax evaded in the last three years of the former Government. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable members question: (1) There is no value added tax in Australia. (2) No information is available for sources of income from illicit ""drug peddling"" as this industry is not included in the statistics gathered by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) from the industrial classification system. The ATO does have a classification for escort drug agencies and massage parlour operators. Generally speaking, where a taxation return is filed in a particular year, it is in respect of income earned in the previous financial year. The number of returns lodged for escort agencies by financial year is as follows: Number of Returns 716 841 1351 2837 3699 will not be available until October 1997. This Program forms part of the current focus on activities in the cash economy following on the Report of the Cash Economy Task Force established by the Commissioner in November 1996. It is clear that major organised crime, particularly international drug trafficking, is inextricably linked to schemes and arrangements to launder large amounts of cash for tax evasion purposes . .As a result, the ATO is currently working closely with the National Crime Authority conducting investigations specifically funded in the last Budget. It is not possible to accurately estimate the amount of tax evaded in the prostitution and illicit drug industries. Strata Title Bodies: Taxation Obligations (Question No. 2083) Mr MCClelland asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 August, 1997: (1) Do the terms of the Australian Tax Office's 1996 Form C (Appendix 1) oblige strata title bodies corporate to lodge an income tax return in respect of bank interest earned by the body corporate even where that body corporate has no other source of income; if so, is it a fact that (a) most strata title bodies corporate earn minimal income through bank interest and (b) in many cases the costs of engaging a professional to prepare the taxation return will often exceed the amount of tax payable. (2) Will he introduce a threshold below which strata title bodies corporate are not required to lodge a taxation return. Level of Tax Payable Less than $100 $100 to $499 $500 to $999 $1,000 or more Total (1) (b) Accurate data as to the cost of engaging a professional to prepare a taxation return for a strata title body corporate is not available, however the taxation returns for this type of taxpayer are generally simple and would not be expected to command high fees. It is noted, also, that the cost of having a recognised professional tax adviser prepare a taxation return is an allowable deduction in the year the cost is incurred. (2) A tax-free threshold is an integral part progressive income tax system for personal taxpayers. It serves the objective of vertical equity by ensuring that personal taxpayers who earn low incomes pay little or no income tax, whereas taxpayers on larger incomes pay progressively higher marginal rates of tax. The corporate tax system is inherently different from the personal tax system as there is a single tax rate of 36 percent and no tax-free threshold. There is, therefore, no reason to treat income earned by a strata title body corporate any differently (by providing a tax free threshold) to income earned by any other business entity. Moreover, introducing a tax-free threshold for bodies corporate would provide tax advantages to their members, irrespective of their income levels, and would lead to pressure for a similar tax-free threshold from other industries and sectors. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Appendix 1 of the 1996 Form C Instructions reflects the income tax law that treats strata title bodies corporate as public companies and, as such, tax is assessed on the taxable income with no minimum threshold. (1) (a) Although figures about the amount of bank interest income earned by strata title bodies corporate are not available, the following chart of the level of tax payable by strata bodies corporate in the 1995/96 income year is provided: Percentage of Bodies Corporate returns lodged 75 13 2 10 100 Medicare Office: Rockdale, New South Wales (Question No. 2096) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Will the Rockdale Medicare office located at of the 464 Princes Highway, Rockdale, NSW, be closed; if so, when. (2) What leasing arrangements apply to the property, including the (a) duration of the current lease and (b) monthly rental under the lease. (3) Will additional penalties apply if the lease is terminated before its specified expiry date.",149
238,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Rockdale Medicare office is scheduled for closure on 10 October 1997. (2) (a) The lease expired on 14 April 1997. Tenure is now on a month by month basis. (b) This information is Commercial-in-Confidence. (3) As the lease has expired, there will not be any penalties related to lease termination. Fresh Orange Juice: Wholesale Sales Tax (Question No. 2111) Mr Barry Jones asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Is fresh orange juice to be regarded as a food with respect to considerations before the National Food Authority: if not, why not. (2) What level of wholesale sales tax applies to (a) fresh orange juice and (b) orange juice reconstituted from concentrate. (3) If either of the rates referred to in part (2) is not zero, why not. (4) What level of wholesale sales tax applies to (a) milk, (b) flavouring essences, (c) bread, (d) Vegemite, (e) butter and (f) cheese. (5) If there are differences in the rates applying to each of the products referred to in part (4), why. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Minister for Health and Family Services has provided the following answer to part (1) of the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. Orange juice is currently defined within Standard 07-0range Juice and Related Productsof the. Food Standards Code. (2) Fruit juiCes, including orange juice are subject to sales tax at the concessional rate of 12 percent provided the beverage contains at least 25 percent by volume of juices of fruits. The concessional rate applies to both fresh and reconstituted fruit juice. (3) Under the sales tax law most food for human consumption is exempt from tax. However, most beverages are excluded from this exemption and are either taxable (for example soft drinks) at the general rate of 22% or specifically made exempt (for example milk). Fruit juices and flavoured milk are taxed at the lower concessional rate of 12%. (4) Plain milk is exempt from sales tax under its own specific exemption item. Bread, Vegemite, putter and cheese are exempt from sales tax as food for human consumption. Flavouring essences used in the preparation of foodstuffs are also exempt from sales tax.· Flavouring essences used in the preparation of beverages are taxable at the general rate of 22 percent unless they contain at least 25 percent by volume of fruit juice, in which case they .are taxed at the concessional rate of 12 percent. (5) Under the sales tax law most food for human consumption is exempt from tax but most beverages are taxable. Olympic Athletes: Taxation Review (Question No. 2150) Mr Martin asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 26 August 1997: (1) Is the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) conducting a review of income of Australia's Olympic athletes; if so, what is the purpose of the review. (2) Has the ATO established an Olympic Project to target the income of Olympians. (3) Will all sources of income, including income provided by the Australian Olympic Committee and the Australian Sports Commission, be the subject of the review and subject to the changed taxation arrangements. (4) Will the review penalise potential Olympic athletes by causing them undue hardship through the taxation system. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable membe(s question: (1) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is conducting a review of the income derived by all sports people. The ATO is conducting the review for the purposes of preparing a public ruling, which will cover income derived through sporting pursuits. It is anticipated that the public ruling will address all aspects of sporting income which is derived by sports people in general. The Ruling is being drafted to clarify the law in this area, to thereby enable sports people at all levels to comply with their obligations under the taxation laws. (2) No, the ATO has not established an Olympic project to specifically target the income derived by Olympic athletes. The ATO has, however, established a team which is responsible for dealing with all taxation implications in respect of the Olympic Games. (3) All sources of income are being examined in the course of preparation of the public ruling. The ATO has met with officials of the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) and the Australian Olympic. Committee (AOC) to discuss the public ruling, and to obtain information for the purposes of the Ruling. The ATO will continue to consult with these bodies, and other interested bodies and organisations, throughout the following months. (4) The ruling will ensure that people who derive income through sporting pursuits will know whether such income should form part of their assessable income. Australian Society for Environmental (Question No. 2216) Mr Kerr asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 22 September 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an organisation known as the Australian Society for Environmental Education. (2) If so, is he able to say what are the (a) circumstances in which the organisation has leased Casey House in Yarralumla, ACT, from the Department of Administrative Services and (b) terms of the lease. (3) Is he able to say what are the bona fides of the organisation and what is the background of its principal, Dr W. Mayo; if so, what are the details.

(5) Is he able to say how many staff are employed by the organisation. (6) Is he able to say whether the organisation has sought or obtained tax exempt status. (7) Has the organisation had education programs accepted by State or Commonwealth funded educational institutions: if so. what.

Mr Anderson-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes, I am aware of the 9rganisation. One of my advisers has met with Dr Mayo. (2) This is a matter for the Minister for Finance and Administration. . (3) The Australian Society for Environmental Education was incorporated under the Associations Incorporation Act 1984 (New South Wales) on 25 November 1994 (Registered No Y2078816).

In respect of other Commonwealth agencies, not known. (9) The Society has been accepted by the Department of the Environment for placement on the Register of Environmental Organisations allowing Education receipt of tax deductible donations under item 6.1.1 of table 6 in subsection 78(4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Georges River: Pollution (Question No. 2233) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: Further to the Minister's answer to question No. 1775 (Hansard, 25 August 1997, page 6775), has a survey been undertaken by the Minister's Department of all Commonwealth departments, agencies, instrumentalities or installations bordering the Georges River in Sydney to ascertain which of these organisations use the river for disposal of waste chemicals, debris or effluent apart from the polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides referred to in the Minister's answer; if so, what. Mr Anderson-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: As far as I can establish no survey of the type suggested by· the honourable member has been undertaken. As I mentioned in my answer to the honourable member's previous question (Hansard, 25 August 1997, page 6775), to obtain the details sought by the honourable member would require considerable resources to extract and collate. I am not prepared to direct that this work be undertaken. I note that all Commonwealth organisations are expected, as a matter of policy, to comply with the environmental standards set in the State or Territory in which they are located. Ageing in Place Rights: Financial Assistance (Question No. 2243) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: Will providers be given financial assistance where residents in a hostel facility exercise their Ageing in Place rights not to be moved to a full nursing home facility despite their category being upgraded, if so what. Mr W arwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under the new aged care arrangements, the single Resident Classification Scale is used to classify relative care needs, and allocate funding for residents, irrespective of their location in a low level care facility (hostel) or high level care facility (nursing home). Some providers may choose to provide care across the full range of dependency so as to meet people's care needs as they change. Other providers may choose to continue to specialise in high or low levels of dependency or in dementia care. Any changes in the resident mix will be their choice. Providers who choose to offer a more extensive range of services must have the necessary staffing and infrastructure in place to enable them to deliver an appropriate standard of care. The new funding system supports providers in the level of care services they wish to provide by providing a level of funding which changes to reflect the increasing care needs of residents who ""age in place"". Respite Care Industry: Description (Question No. 2245) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: Will there be changes to the style, description and title widely used within the respite care industry of high and low categories to a style and title less likely to infer better or lesser classes of care. Mr W arwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No change is intended. The high and low categories of care relate to the level of care required, not the quality of care. Registered Carers: 'Yellow Card' (Question No. 2246) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: (1) When will registered carers of persons requiring respite care have available to them official 'yellow cardslbooks'. (2) Will his Department introduce a central registry similar to that used by the Department of Veterans' Affairs; if not, why not. (3) Are there inadequate places available for respite care. Mr W arwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The 'yellow cardslbooks' have been distributed to Aged Care Assessment Teams. (2) No, the Information and Service Record (the yellow book) will constitute the record of an individuals' respite usage. (3) No. Current residential respite care provision is adequate. The situation will, however, be monitored to ensure that respite provision does not fall below 1 place in 90 in any region. Aged Care Industry: Accreditation Criteria (Question No. 2259) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 24 September 1 997: What criteria were used to appoint private companies and newly registered companies as accrediting agencies for the aged care industry. Changes Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member-s question is as follows: No private companies have been appointed as accrediting agencies for the aged care industry. A wholly Commonwealth owned company limited by guarantee is being established to manage the accreditation process. The Board of Directors to the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency has been recently appointed and it is likely that the Agency will be incorporated shortly. Landcare: Expenditure (Question No. 2266) Mr Campbell asked the Minister Primary Industries and Energy, on notice, on 24 September 1997: (1) What sum has the Government spent on Landcare each year since 1992. (2) For each sum referred to in part (1), what proportion was spent on administrative costs rather than project work. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The National Landcare Program (NLP) did not commence until the 1993-94 financial year. Prior to that, landcare activities were funded through the National Soil Conservation Program (NSCP). NLP appropriations are made for 'Payment to the States', which funds landcare projects undertaken by community groups or State agencies, and to the Natural Resources Management Fund (NRM Fund), a Trust Fund which can support the activities of the Australian Landcare Council (formerly the National Landcare Advisory Committee), projects undertaken by persons other than a State and approved administrative expenses. Expenditure figures for 1992-93, the last year of the NSCP, and for the NLP from 1993-94 to 199697 are tabulated below, showing both appropriations for the Payment to the States and for the NRM Fund. Funding allocations for the 199798 financial year are not shown as they have not yet been finalised. (2) Commonwealth administrative expenses for the NLP are met from two sources.

Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1992 allows the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to approve funding of administrative expenses associated with the NLP to be paid from the NRM Fund. These include advertising for projects, publications, printing of guidelines, support for Landcare activities other than specific projects, such as sponsorships, and expenses associated with project review and assessment. Total expenditure figures are included in the table below. In addition, the Commonwealth agreed at the commencement of the NLP to fund a project in each State and the NT to implement and manage the operation of the Program. These expenses are also shown in the table.

The development of standards is a Commonwealth responsibility. The new standards were developed in close partnership between representatives from consumer groups, aged care industry associations, unions and the Government. The new Residential Care Standards were introduced from 1 October 1997 (Quality of Care Principles 1997, Schedule 3). Aged care facilities will be assessed against these standards until such time as they seek accreditation during a three year transition period from January 1998 to January 2001. Facilities seeking accreditation from January 1998 will be assessed against the Accreditation Standards (Quality of Care Principles 1997, Schedule 2). Both the Residential Care Standards and Accreditation Standards require service providers to identify and comply with all relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation, regulatory . requirements, professional standards and guidelines. My predecessor, the Hon 1. Moylan MP, wrote to State and Territory Health and Community Services Ministers on 24 September 1997 concerning the implications of State and Territory health and related regulations for Commonwealth funded facilities. Mrs Moylan sought agreement to a protocol for the regulation of hostels, to operate for a two year period, to enable a review of existing Commonwealth and State health regulations applying to aged care hostels. The proposed protocol reflects an approach agreed by Commonwealth and State officials to clarify similar issues in relation to building requirements under the Building Code of Australia. The Australian Building Codes Board, in conjunction with State building authorities, has also commenced a review of the classification of residential aged care buildings. The objective is to ensure that the Code licensing requirements can accommodate the development of integrated aged care facilities. I am confident that the States and Territories will, as they have done to date on other aspects of the reforms, co-operate in arriving at a sensible approach that will give certainty to providers and maximise the potential of the aged care reforms to achieve improvements without compromising the quality of care. Aboriginal Groups: Mining Royalties and Other Payments (Question No. 2330) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: Year 1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83 1983-84 What are the details of royalties and other payments paid to Aboriginal groups each year in respect of mining in the Northern Territory.",157
239,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The payment of royalties to Aboriginal people in respect of mining on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory is a matter for private negotiation between the mining companies and the Aboriginal people concerned. I am not privy to those arrangements. However, under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, the Commonwealth makes payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account equivalent to royalties paid by mining companies to the Northern Territory Government in respect of non-uranium mining interests in Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. In the case of uranium mining interests in Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, the mining company pays a royalty of 5.5% to the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth makes payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account equivalent to a royalty of 4.25%. Of the monies paid into the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account, 40% is paid to Aboriginal Land Councils in the Northern Territory to cover their costs of administration and 30% is paid to relevant Land Councils for distribution to Aboriginal organisations in areas affected by mining. The remaining amounts are paid to incorporated bodies and groups of Aboriginal people as grants, used to supplement the administrative expenses of Land Councils or invested as accretions to the Trust Account's accumulated fund. Annual reports of the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account are tabled in Parliament, and contain details of the Trust Account's income and expenditure. The following table shows the royalty equivalent income and expenditure of the Trust Account from its inception on 1 July 1978 to 30 June 1997. The expenditure figures reflect both statutory royalty equivalent income and other income.
