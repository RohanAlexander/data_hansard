4,Mr GREGORY,CANBERRA TRANSPORT,"Accordin g to the Tariff Board's report upon the iron and steel industry, amongst those who gave evidence in favour of higher duties was the chairman of the Victorian Iron and Steel Merchants' Association. In view of that fact, will the Minister for Trade and Customs lay upon the table the agreement alleged to have been made between the manufacturers and the trade, in order that honourable members may be able to judge whether there is any collusion to keep up prices?  ledge of any such agreement, but I shall peruse the evidence given before the board and if it includes nothing confidential I shall make the papers available to the honourable member in the Library. . Mr WATKINS - As the various items in the schedule are dealt with, will the Minister for Trade and Gustoms afford the committee an opportunity to vote upon the duties recommended by the board as against those proposed by the Government.  merely recommends to Cabinet through the Minister. The Government, having considered the board's recommendations, arrivedat certain conclusions which are embodied in the schedule of duties, submitted to the House. Mr E. RILET - The Minister for Trade and Customs has informed the House that the Tariff Board's reports contain recommendations to the Government, but that it is the tariff schedule wbicb bas been presented to this House us a Government measure. I ask bim whether it is not possible for this House to be given a free band in discussing tbese reports, without making tariff amendments a party matter. Cannot the whole House decide what shall bo done with the various items?  that the House does not now decide everything that is laid before it. should like further to say that the report of the Tariff Board contains recommendations showing what the board thinks should be done. In one case the recommendation had a tag on it in connection with an industrial problem, and an investigation was made by three of our highest departmental officers, wbo made the most detailed analysis of the whole position, with an exactness which I have never seen equalled before. The Government took these matters into consideration, a.r,d as a result the present proposals have been presented to the House.",13
5,Mr BLAKELEY,CANBERRA TRANSPORT,"In view of the very keen desire of the majority of .the members of the House, and the great anxiety on the part of the manufacturers of Australia, will the Minister for Trade and Customs give an assurance that the tariff will be finalized before we rise at the end of next week?  assurance the honourable member desires, but as far as the tariff is concerned I am hopeful it will go through before the Houses rises. That, however, depends on the state of Govermnent business. NA WATERFRONT. Mr E.

13,Mr BRUCE,INDUSTRIAL TROUBLE ON TH E,"The competition between beam wireless and the cable companies has created a serious and acute problem, which will be accentuated if the beam system sbould prove over a period of twelve months as effective as it has been for the few months it has been in operation.

A committee representing the governments concerned, namely, those of Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) is to be appointed to investigate the relationship between beam wireless and the cable system, and to submit' recommendations to the various governments. It is not finally determined that that committee shall be set up, but the matter has been practically decided, though no appointments have been made. Only experience can show what will be the effect of the competition of the beam system on our revenue from the Pacific Cable Company, in which we are the largest shareholder, our interest being 6-18ths, Canada's 5-18ths, Great Britain's 5-lSths, and New Zealand's 2-18ths.. for We have a very real interest in the beam system itself, as we are shareholders in the Amalgamated Wireless Company, which is conducting the service, on a reciprocal basis, by which it receives messages from Great Britain and despatches messages to Great Britain from Australia.

38,Mr MARR,AUSTEALIAN MATCH," I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-21, the following work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report, viz.:-Federa l Capital-Extensio n of the sewer from the northern main sewer on Garden-Circuit to Intcr-Raugc-avenue to serve the north-western portion of the city. The Public Works Committee has already investigated and reported to'Parliament concerning the general sewerage system of Canberra, which comprises a main outfall sewer and a main intercepting sewer, and otlier sectional sewers in the principal valleys of the city. have been duly reported upon, approved by Parliament, and constructed, and are now in operation. It is now necessary to consider a further extension of the main sewerage system to cater for existing and projected development in the north-western portion of the city, which contains the site for the University, the scientific area, the Australian Museum of National Zoology, as well as the projected minor industrial area to the west of Nortlibourne-avenucs. The present proposal is to construct an intercepting sewer lending from its junction with the northern intercepting sewer at Gardencircuit, northward to Inter-Eange-avenue. It is proposed that the sewer shall be laid in the for m of pre-cast concrete pipes in similar construction to that of other intercepting sewers recently laid after vestigation by the Public Works Committee, and approval by Parliament. A plan indicating the proposed route of the sewer and sections showing the construction are submitted herewith. The total estimated cost of the sewer, excluding in terest during construction and overhead charges, is approximately £57,000. It is not proposed to proceed immediately with the whole of the work, but in the first instance to carry it out in sections as required. It is proposed to proceed i m mediately with the first section of the work, wbicb is estimated to cost approximately £24,000, and should be carried out in from six to twelve months.

39,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Perth) [3.28] - T regret, that I cannot comply with the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that the debate on the general question sbould be curtailed as in - much as possible so as to enable members to deal with the individual items of the schedule. This is the only opportunity afforded to honourable members to discuss the policy that lies behind the resolution itself and the Government's proposals to increase the duties on various items. The time has passed when the discussion of this policy can airily be waved aside on the plea, so often beard, that protection is the settled policy of Australia. If any policy is found, after trial, to be inimical to the best interests of the country it sbould be capable of amendment. How does any policy become the immutable and unchangeable policy of a country? As a matter of fact there is no reason why protection should be regarded as the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not, because, for many years, the people wbo, in the long run, have to determine the policy of the country, have had little opportunity, in fact, no opportunity, of voting upon the continuance of this principle. Time after time, when elections have been pending, other important questions have been introduced to divert the attention of the people and to deprive them of the opportunity to consider and to vote upon the tariff policy. A noticeable change is today taking ""place in Australian public opinion. Many people are asking themselves bow long is this oppressive policy of protection to continue, and where is it leading us. They are snowing impatience and distrust because the tariff has failed to bring about the results that were claimed for it. It is time that this policy, which is fraught with such direful consequences to the whole community, was made a vital issue at an election, and discussed thoroughly before the people, so that they may bave an opportunity to express tlieir opinion on it. This policy of constantly raising our protective duties bas a much wider effect than that referred to in the speeches of the Opposition during this debate, and so I am compelled to crave the indulgence cf the committee to permit me to review the situation somewhat more thoroughly than has yet beeu done, because the tariff policy has become of great and pressing importance, not only in our domestic affairs, but also in our imperial and international relations. As regards our domestic affairs, I propose to make no plea for any local or class interests. J sbould be entirely justified in discussing this policy from the viewpoint of my own State, but I do not intend to do so. It would also be within my right to enlarge upon its application to certain sections of the community, noticeably the primary producer, but, to a' great extent, that has already been done by other members of the committee. Therefore,'I propose to discuss it in its relation, not to atiy particular territory of the Commonwealth, but to the federation, the effect upon farmer and worker, upon the great mass of people in the cities who are more or less on fixed salaries, and upon our national prosperity and development as a whole. The Government could not bave chosen a more inopportune time than the present for placing further tariff burdens upon the people. The position today is serious for a number of causes, the effects of which have been gradually accumulating. I do not wisb in any way to speak in a lugubrious tone, or to tell a. doleful story, but it is necessary that we should pay heed to the warnings and statements of authoritative men in this community wbo have for some time been telling us that we are proceeding along the wrong path of government. The particular directions in which they have found fault with us, are these-the y say that we bave been guilty of maintaining an artificially high standard of living, due to our fiscal policy, and its natural corollary, arbitration. I shall deal with the interaction of tbese two forces directly. They also point out that we bave adopted an attitude in defiance of the teachings of economists in relation to the post-war situation and international relations; that, because of the deliberate exclusion of competition, we are faced with a falling-off of productiveness, and a failure to develop to the utmost our resources of material wealth; that this policy bas caused interference with private enterprise, ingenuity, and individuality; and that we have failed to take our competitive place in the world's market, simply because the artificial maintenance of the high cost of production has crippled successful trade, which is the real life blood of national wealth and power. Por a long time the people have been realizing that the artificial standard of living that we have built up is getting more and more shaky every day. .Por the last two or three years we have beard authoritative men say that it only wants one setback, say, a drought in Australia, to bring to our senses, and make us realise the sity of the doctrines that we have supassociated ported. That drought has .come, and many of those prophecies to which I bave referred are being fulfilled. A further instalment of the protectionist policy included in this motion at a time when the policy is coming into grave disrepute among the people. During the past few months an important series of public statements have appeared in Australia, and I wish to refer to tbem as evidence that the opinions that I am expressing today are held by a large number of and responsible men in' the community, who would not say these things unless they really meant tbem. The first statehigher ment appeared a few months ago in reeverything gard to our great meat industry, which was showing signs of distress, and this the blame, after careful discussion the whole position, was attached to difficulties imposed upon the industry by the tariff. A little later we had a remarkable statement regarding the wool industry from Mr Niall, the chairtion man of directors of Goldsborougb, and Company. That statement has alpointed ready been referred to in this chamber, and therefore I shall not deal with it length; but the deductions in it were similar in effect to those contained the report on the meat industry. we bave bad scathing reports by the monwealth Auditor-General and Auditors-General of South Australia Victoria on public finance and its influence on public policy. deputation representing the Industries Preservation League also waited upon the Prime Minister concerning the tion of manufacturers who, notwithstandcountry ing the fact that their industries been fully protected were said to be im, extremis.  tation.",20
40,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Yes. Their representaever tions were an admission of the failure the policy that Parliament bas been vocating for so long, and under which have been imposing a burden upon the people of Australia. Then there is the remarkable publication known as the - Business Men's and Banlcers' Manidicted. festo, issued in the Old Country, which us points out how intimately the financial faland economic troubles of the world are with the necessity for greater freedom of trade between the nations. A little later there was the remarkable conference held at Geneva known as the is World's Economic Conference, which met in May of last year, and with which I shall deal later. I may also mention the Tariff Board's reports of 1926 and 1927, which are extraordinary documents, showing how protection is failing to fulfil the object which it was alleged it would bring about. The explanations able of the Tariff Board are rather remarkable, and in some cases somewhat amusing, because, in explaining the necessity for duties, they blame everybody and but themselves. They fail to see that the trouble has been brought for about largely by their own recommendaof tions regarding the needs of intbe dustry - There have also been comments by the judges of the Arbitration Courts which again show what an impossible position the policy of protecis bringing about. A few weeks ago Mort the South Australian Government apthree prominent business men in that State to report upon public finance, at and in their report we find ppints which I have enumerated, strongly emphasized. in The Government of South Australia was Then so impressed with the recommendations Comof' these men that the Premier (Mr. the Butler) is now convening a special and economic conference to study the cause and the best means of meeting the present A panicky economic depression. These utterances may seem to sugposigest that I am indicating that this is on the high road to ruin. I do bave not think that for a moment. I have wonderful confidence in its resources, and the vitality and energy of its people. I know Australia can be made one of the most glorious countries on God's earth The point I am trying to make is that what may have been the original intention of of a protective policy- I have no doubt adthat the men who introduced it seriously we and earnestly thought that they were right-it bas been clearly shown by a long trial that such a policy is not efficacious, and has not produced the result preI f the Commonwealth is to arise to a true conception of nationhood and responsibilities as a nation, we must have the courage to grapple with those problems which are retarding our progress, and exert sufficient strength of mind, foresight, and courage to amend our ways in the light of experience. In spite of the warnings contained in the statements I have enumerated the Government bas shown no inclination whatever to recognize the seriousness of the position. Experience bas proved that whenever a country is confronted with economic stringency every effort sbould be made to use the minimum of revenue consistent with the absolute necessities of government, and return any balance to the community by way of remissions of taxation. When a country is faced with financial stress the proper course is to enable private enterprise to become stronger and to adjust itself to the conditions which are apparent. I quoted in the House last week a speech of the president of the Bank of New South Wales upon this subject which I need not repeat. It is for the committee to realise that for four years the Government, in addition to budgeting on a no means niggardly scale, has spent over £.16,000,000 of surplus money. Although the Treasurer boasted of a reduction of over £S,000,000 in direct taxation, indirect taxation has been increased by £17,000,000. To put it in another way the indirect taxation per head in Australia in 1921-22 was £5 0s. 3$d., whereas in 1926-27 it had risen to £7 3s. 9^d. It has, therefore, overtaken altogether and outrun the growth of population. I have already pointed out on more than one occasion that indirect taxation imposes a burden upon the people equal least four times the amount of the actual revenue received into the Treasury. I do not intend to prove that, because it bas been affirmed by every student cf the subject. Therefore, if we take the indirect taxation at £7 3s. 9£d. per head, the real burden is four times that amount, or £28 15s. 2d. per head. The indirect taxation of a man, his wife, and tbrde children is, therefore, £143 15s. per annum, which is surely a burden grievous to be borne. That being so, we cannot wonder that the country is faced its with financial and economic distress. As a matter of fact, the more we study the subject the more readily must we recognize that, although there are many causes contributing to our present financial position, the starting point of the trouble is our fiscal policy. I wish to show how this is so. First of all, under a protective policy the cost'of living is increased. I know the Minister for Trade and Customs will say that that is not so, and that he has shown before that prices of protected commodities have fallen under our present system. Honourable members opposite bave also been very insistent upon the to fact that if protection is only carried far enough prices must be reduced. There are few such instances which could be quoted; and whenever one has been, the fact has been revealed that the drop in Australia bas been in consequence of an immense fall in prices in the markets of the world. Therefore, the effect of our protective policy is not only to raise prices directly, but also to prevent a lowering of the prices of commodities which, in the absence of such a policy, we should be able to obtain more cheaply from overseas. The cost of living figure today is, I believe, 170, compared with 100 in 1911. Therefore, we are still paying practically war rates, notwithstanding the fact that the war terminated nine years ago. Every other country has been labouring strenuously to reduce the cost of its living and production, realizing that it must revert to competitive conditions and face the facts. On the other"" hand, we in Australia bave been endeavouring to persuade ourselves that it is within our power to maintain the artificial conditions that were rendered possible only by the to at blockade that was enforced upon our trade during the war. Trade from every corner of the globe is knocking at our doors, but we foolishly shut it out, and decline to act in a way that would make our living cheaper, easier, and happier. The most extraordinary feature is the attitude of the Australian Labour party to the policy of protection. I have made a careful study of the matter, and bave obtained particulars respecting the view-point of the Labour party in every leading country. Without exception it is the opponent of bigb protection in those countries, because it realizes that the duties fall with particular severity upou the labouring man and the man of small means, to whom slight rises in the prices of commodities are a very serious matter. 1I have never been able to understand why the Labour party in Australia advocates a policy of high protection. I believe it is acting against the interests of its own people. The excuse, of course, is that under such a policy higher rates of wages can be obtained. That is one of the great fallacies of the system under which we live. A workman thinks that so loug as be can secure higher wages, his condition is being improved. He overlooks the truth of the saying, ""While wages climb the stairs prices take the elevator."" Although wages have continued to soar, their purchasing power has decreased. I followed closely the speech of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore), on Friday afternoon. said that the only criterion of effective protection was the exclusion of goods from Australia, and added, "" If it only raises prices it is a fallacy and sbould be abolished. If it is not effective the Government must take the responsibility."" The honourable member then proceeded to lay at the door of the present Minister  volume of imports; but he bad to admit that that gentleman has at his disposal a battery of legislation, tremendous power, and the sympathetic support of a majority of honourable members for almost any proposal that be cares to make in the way of increased protection. Surely if the system has failed it would be better for us to say, "" Let us get it,"" instead of Let us have more of it."" The honourable member for Dalley was obliged to admit that effectiveness could not be secured; therefore, the only conclusion to which one can come is that the tariff is responsible for the raising prices, and consequently, in the honourable member's view, is a failure and should be abolished. Instead arguing along those lines the honourable member suggested further duties, aud even went so far as to urge a tax on brains and knowledge, in the form of books. No more foolish tax could be imposed. The raising of prices has a reaction upon the Arbitration Court. Tbat court, as [ have said before, Mr Mann. has shown itself to be a logical absurdity, for the reason that no court can fix wages except on the basis of the cost of living, whereas they ought to be influenced by production. Mr G. FRANCIS - That is only one factor.",22
41,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"It is the principal factor. The Arbitration Court has avoided it because it could not adopt any basis otlier than the cost of living. I do not agree with the absurd recommendation which is sometimes made by the Tariff Board, that a duty should be imposed only on the understanding that the workmen should not ask for higher wages.",24
42,Mr SCULTJH,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,That is an absurd proposal.,24
43,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Of course it. is absurd. It is also illogical and outrageous. The He suggestion is that only one section of the community shall bear the burden of higher duties. When workmen see that r higher subsidy is being paid to manufacturers to enable them to carry on their industry, they do quite right to say, "" We are entitled to a certain share of that subsidy."" One is constrained to take the view that when they make that recommendation the members of the Tariff Board bave their tongue in their cheek. They must know that it is impossible to impose sucb a condition. As a matter of fact, the Government has brought forward proposals for the imposition of the duties recommended, and has entirely disregarded that advice. If the Board recommends the Government rid of to impose such a condition, and it is found impossible to do so, the Government ought not to propose the duty. As I have said previously, the workmen act quite rightly wben they claim a share of this public subsidy; but they are unable of to obtain it because the court fixes wages on the basis of the cost of living, which, afc a consequence, is further raised. Thus of we have the spectacle of these two factors racing each other up parallel step-ladders, and the result is absurdity. Every body sees it ; every body knows it ; but no party has the courage to stand up and say that it must stop. This Government is not merely perpetuating, but also accentuating, the evil, by the imposition of additional duties.",24
44,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,The honourable member's voice is as the voice of one crying in the wilderness.,25
45,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I scarcely expect the honourable member to agree with me. When the present Arbitration Court was appointed I remember distinctly the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) saying it was hoped that it would investigate in a more scientific manner than formerly, applications for higher wages, and would pay regard to economic conditions, so as to determine whether it was economically possible for industry to pay what was asked. The other day Chief Judge Dethridge felt obliged to make the following statementThis court is unable to find any economic basis upon which it can give its awards. We are, therefore, obliged to meddle and muddle through. That is due to the fact that we are continually interfering with the awards of the court, and introducing conditions which lead to their being upset. One of the principal factors of trouble is our customs law and administration. The policy of protection is responsible for one of our greatest evils: I refer to the over-population of the cities, and the i balanced distribution of the population throughout the country. B y stimulating industries, which are established chiefly in the cities, we encourage the population to go there. It is lured - to the cities by artificial conditions in relation to wages and employment, which cannot be extended to the outlying parts. The result is that the conditions of life in the cities are seriously at variance with those which obtain in the country districts. Such a condition of affairs acts as a hindrance to migration. Huge sums of money are being expended in an endeavour to induce settlers to fill what we call our empty spaces. In round figures it costs about £2,000 to settle a migrant upon the land.",25
46,Mr GUT,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,I-ETT - We are precious few.,25
47,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"We are; and the number will become fewer, because we ask these men to live in places and under conditions that are not attractive. Our policy for years past has been directed towards encouraging l if e in the cities, aud discouraging life upon the land. While that is going on what f o l ly it is to spend huge sums of money on all sorts of fancifu l immigration schemes whicn are opposed to the present political and fiscal policy. We are doing a cruelty tithe men whom we induce to come bere. Many of the new settlers on the land are merely taking the places of others who found the conditions so irksome that they got rid of their holdings and returned to the city. I beard of one district which boasted of having 71 new settlers, but later had to admit that exactly the same number of older settlers bad lef t the land and gone into the cities. What is the use of spending millions of pounds in tryin g settle people on the land when our economic policy has the effect of drawing them off? When carefully studied, this system has an ill effect upon our internal affairs. We frequently bear the statement that it niatters not how much commodities cost so long as the money expended on their purchase is kept in the country. This is a glib, but meaningless statement. Money in itself is nothing, but the Government's fiscal policy, by artificially raising costs and prices, is reducing the exchangeable l l - value of the labour of our people so that we cannot obtain sufficient surplus wealth for the development of our country and are obliged to borrow. The surpluses wbicb labour would otherwise p r o d u c and which could be accumulated for developmental puiposes are non-existent. If a pipe is corroded, water will not flow through it , because all the pressure is nullified by internal friction. Similarly, this policy of high protection, by creating internal friction, uses up the energy and resources of our people, which sbould be devoted to furthering the progress of the country. Importations also are increased, partly by' borrowing and partly by other causes. I do not propose to dwell at length upon the subject of borrowing, and its influence in creating an adverse trade balance. Sufficient has settling been said already to indicate that this factor is very imperfectly understood and has been greatly exaggerated. 'Nevertheless the policy of borrowing abroad is unfortunately developing our imports at a rate with which our export trade cannot keep pace. The high customs duties,"" ih conjunction with the awards of the Arbitration Court, cause unemployment. An extraordinary fallacy is current that if the hours of employment are reduced, more work will be provided for those not now fully engaged. The effect of that policy is to cause more unemployment, because it reduces the productivity of labour and depletes that wages fund, from which all labour must be remunerated. Nothing bas been more harmf ul to this country than the erroneous thinking on this subject. I bave never been an advocate of the excessive hours and low wages for which men had to work a few score years ago, but wben other countries are realizing the necessity f o v increasing their productivity, for us to reduce the hours of labour, thereby reducing output and raising costs, is to create further unemployment. Similarly, high customs duties, by increasing costs diminish production and the demand for labour. Both tbese factors operating together contribute seriously to the creation of unemployment. When honourable members prescribe higher duties as a cure for unemployment they are advising a form of treatment which will only aggravate the disease. Honourable members opposite have urged the Minister for Trade and Customs to have this schedule dealt with at once, so that many people now workless may look forward to a happier Christmas. God knows I would like the unemployed to have a happier Christmas than seems to be in prospect for them, but an increase in customs duties will not give it to them. Even the Leader of the Opposition admitted that the increase in duties last year merely relieved the unemployed problem for the time being. By this treatment a temporary stimulus was given to industry, but a reaction followed, and in the end the industry was weakened rather than strengthened. This policy is equivalent to feeding a person on tonics instead of solid food. Another reason for altering our fiscal policy is that it protects and encourages inefficiency. I agree with honourable members opposite that the blame for inefficiency in industry must not be laid entirely on the Australian workers. There is a good deal of inefficiency in the management, manifested either in out-of-date processes and machinery or in failure to grasp the economic factors Mr Mann. essential to success. I have repeatedly heard advocates of high protection say in this chamber that such and such a company has the most up-to-date machinery and appliances for the cheap and efficient conduct of its business. How bave they become qualified to express an opinion as to what is the most up-to-date machinery? They are merely repeating what they have been told by the managements. I have in mind one big plant that is supposed to be as efficient as any in the world, but an expert steel engineer told me that its equipment is laughable when compared with that in up-to-date establishments elsewhere. In another instance, the machinery and plant imported and erected in Australia had been acquired from a company in England which was glad to get rid of its obsolete plant in order to substitute something more efficient.",25
48,Mr WATKINS,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Tba t is absolutely incorrect. Mention the names of the establishments to which you are referring.,26
49,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"The honourable member may pose as an expert on machinery; I do not, but I am prepared to take the word of men whose knowledge and experience are sufficient guarantee that they know what they are talking about. """,26
50,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,To whose plaut does the honourable member refer?,26
51,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I know of at least; two. It is common for honourable members to say that industries starting in this country bave the latest plant and machinery, but often that is not so. I have seen some of the plants.",26
52,Mr WATKINS,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,The experts of the world say so.,26
53,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Wb o are the experts of the world? What means has the honourable member of getting their opinion ?,26
54,Mr WATKINS,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,I will tell the honourable member their names. That is more than he is prepared to do in comnvxioD with the statements he has mentioned.,26
55,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I am not going to mention names for the honourable member to bandy about as I know he would do. The fact is this: Protection in theory sounds well, and will bring about the results desired, if it is applied to one or two, or, at any rate, a very limited number of industries. The public, however, should thoroughly understand that it is going to cost them more; if they understand that, then the policy of protection is no imposition on them. The trouble is that, proceeding from the particular to the general, people arrive at the fallacious conclusion that what is good for one must be good for all. If protection is applied to the whole range of industry the benefits cancel each other. The finished product of one factory is the raw material of another, and the result of universal protection is to send up the price of goods all round the circle, at a cost to the community which it cannot bear. Tbis is the effect produced if protection is applied to more than a very limited number of industries. If one asks what industries it should be applied to the advocates of protection will reply that it sbould apply to our key industries. If it is applied to any industry at all, the last one it should apply to is a key industry, because that is an industry upon which many others are vitally dependent, and if the price of its products are raised, the prices of all the dependent products are raised also. Then, again, it is said that we sbould protect the industries necessary for defence in war time. That implies that we are to live in a condition of preparation for, and expectation of war, but I say that every nation should live in expectation of peace. Apart from that, however, what industries are necessary to us in wartime? Some say, the steel industry; but is that more important to us than the clothing industry, or is clothing more important than food? There are hardly any industries, except those dealing with luxuries, which however small, may not prove of vital importance to us in time of war. The range of protection cannot be limited in that way. Besides, in time of war, the country would be in a better position if we bad the nation's wealth untramelled and unrestricted, so that it might be invested in the things necessary for war, which bas always been the case in England. Her position enables ber to marshall her resource's in time of war and meet it when it comes; that is why, as a rule, England is not ready for war when it comes, but is always ready in time to win the last battle, and that is the most 1 important. Protection is a thoroughly discredited policy. The trials we have made, and the facts and figures coming to light every day, show that there is something wrong with it. It is daily demonstrating its failure. In view of its past history, every fresh application for increased duty is a fresh condemnation of it. It seems almost ludicrous to read that at the beginning applications were made for 5 to 10 per cent, duty on different articles. The applicants said that that duty was not a very high duty, and that when the industry was established it could be taken off. The imposition of those duties was followed by further impositions of 15 per cent, and 20 per cent., and then of others up to 30 per cent., 40 per cent., 50 per cent., and even 100 per cent., while in some cases the rate is as high as 200 per cent.; and this sort of thing is still going on. Still the industries complain ""not enough, not enough""; their cry is that of the daughters of the horse leech, "" give, give."" Where is it all going to stop? The Minister for Trade and Cus resented the implication contained in a letter written by the chairman of 6. ""A. Bond and Company in regard to the failure of that firm. The firm said that its failure was largely, though perbaps not entirely, due to its not getting increased protective duties. I do not wonder that the Minister became indignant. Increased duty! Already there is a duty of 60 per cent, on the class of goods produced by this firm, and that is not sufficient for them, while on top of that a bonus of £45,000 was paid in respect to manufactured goods during the year. A few months ago, when the company made application to the public for increased capital, it tried to show that its financial position was sound, and that it had made a profit of £55,000 in the year. When it wanted to get fresh capital from the public it could put up a pretty tale of successful trading, but when it wants increased duty, it makes the pitiful plaint that it is impossible to carry on. At last this firm is exposed, and its employees are threatened with loss of work. It is because of trouble of that sort t6 working people that I raise my voice now, because the working people are being gulled into a false sense of the position - IH which protection will place them. Now - this firm bas the audacity to say that, in spite of high duties, and in spite of ithe bounty wbicb a bountiful government - has paid to it, it is unable to carry on because the duties are not high enough. The same sort of thing is revealed by some of the Tariff Board reports. If honourable members will read those reports quietly and dispassionately, they will not fail to observe the absurdity of some of the recommendations made. The reports sketch the history of a firm, stating bow successful it has been, and emphasizing the profits it has made. In one case a report stated that a certain firm already has 86 per cent, of the Australian market, and yet the board proposes that it should have a further protective duty. What justification can there be for things like that? In addition to its failure as a practical policy-and I submit it has failed and is failing lamentably-pro tection 'has a bad effect on our public life. I want to quote two statements on this point. One is made by Professor Page, chairman of the Tariff Commission of the United States of America, in a book entitled Making the Tariff in the United States of America. In this book be describes the method by wbicb bigb tariffs are attained through the board. He saysThey are attained by liberal campaign contributions, by expensive and misleading paganda, by costly and expert lobbying, by astute distortion of evidence. It would be easy to quote instances of all those things in this country, and these tilings are not making for purity in our public life, but are a degrading influence. For some months past, on many of our railway stations, there has been an elaborate system of advertising indulged in by a certain firm. Posters are displayed which depict two anxious parents bending over their son, who is studying a book. The poster bears this caption, "" Where will your son get a job? Every boy cannot be a farmer."" It extols the excellency of secondary manufactures, and shows how they ought to be encouraged. This firm, which is so anxious about the future of the boy, and Air. Al a wn. which points out that everybody cannot be a farmer, has shown its interest in this matter by discharging the whole of its night staff comprising 112 men, and retaining the girls. It is propaganda of this sort which is corrupting and degrading public life, aud which the protectionist system encourages and permits. I wish now to read a statement made by Mr T. F. Bayard, formerly the ambassador of the United States of America to Britain, when speaking at the Philosophical Institute in Edinburgh. He said In my own country I have witnessed the insatiable growth of that form of State Socialism, styled protection, which, I believe, has done more than any other causeTo foster class legislation and create inequality of fortune; To corrupt public life; To banish men of independent mind and character from the public councils; To lower the tone of national representation ; Blunt public conscience: Create false standards in the popular mind; To familiarize it with reliance upon Stateaid and guardianship in private affairs; Divorce ethics from politics, and - place politics upon the low level of a mercenary scramble. Tbat is a withering condemnation by a representative of one of the greatest protectionist countries in the world of the policy which we are trying to carry out and extend in this country. This policy is also becoming one of increased importance in connection with our relations with other countries, and with other parts of the Empire. This pro- very schedule embraces proposals for inaud creasing' British preference. This question of Imperial preference is one which ought to be given careful consideration by honourable members. In July, 1923, I spoke in this House at length on British preference, and again on the Government's proposals to increase the proportion of British labour or materials from 25 per cent, to 75 per cent., entitling such goods to preference. On both ' occasions I said that the system was illusory in its benefits and entirely insincere in its methods. I doubt if what I am saying is likely to make the"" slightest impression upon certain honourable members; but that is a matter of indifference to me. I intend to state my views on this important issue, irrespective of any other consideration, because I am now speaking to a much larger and much more influential audience than that statedwithin these walls. The people of Australia expect the position to be placed frankly before tbem. Tbey should not cently, be able to plead ignorance as to the con-sequences of this tariff, of be led astray by it. I have already said that imperial preference is illusory in its benefits, and insincere hi its methods. Tbis is now being recognized in Great Britain. I am afraid that I shall bave to trespass upon the patience of honourable members while I read a number of extracts on this subject from journals published recently in England. In the trade and engineering supplement of the London Times, of the 6th August last, there appeared the following paragraphsIn an interview published in The Times last  Trade and Customs, made some surprising statements. It will come as a shock to many  their attitude to that of Oliver Twist, who had the temerity to ask for more. Possibly Mr. Pratten overlooked the fact that Oliver had hail an insufficient ration and, therefore, had an extremely good case, but most English people are under the impression that of late Australin has been showing a disposition to reduce the generous allowance formerly made to British trade, and that the present position is th-is the wool and other industries would be only too glad to go back to the conditions ruling  Tariff.  the bounty of nature in showering raw materials on Australia put that Continent in a position to develop practically every essential industry, and that Australians were determined to develop them as quickly as possible, ""using the t a r if f "" as the method of stimulating tlieir growth. He insisted, however, that Australians were enthusiastic loyalists and expressed his own belief, that, in the preferential treatment given to products of the Mother Country through the tariff, it was possible that further development might take place in the direction of Imperial trade cartels. He added that, p ovided her national development was not arrested, he believed Australia would do everything possible to protect Imperial tracks against foreign aggression, and suggested that the thought was well worth pursuing in the interests of the Empire. It is not quite clear  cartels, as he went on to say that it must be realized that "" our first duty is to Australin and not to the British trader, whose only m terest in us concerns his profits on the goods which he sells.'' a On the 20th August the same journal Coming after the rather narrow views of  the speech at Newcastle-on-Tyne by Sir George Pearce, Vice-President of the Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Australia, is very welcome. He had, he said, been impressed with thu growth of Empire consciousness in Great Britain I wonder when Great Britain was ever unconscious of the Empire? and went so far as to declare . that is Australia they 'would have to adopt more vigorous measures if the}' were to keep pace with the people here. He expressed his appreciation and gratitude for the steps taken by the United Kingdom to assist the marketing of certain Australian products, but he frankly admitted that in Australia duties have been imposed on imports with the object of shutting them out and giving the Australian market to the Australian manufacturer. I u addition, practically ail British-manufactured goods imported, whether such articli-sare manufactured in Australia or not, receive a preference of from 10 per cent, to 20 per cent, over the products of foreign competitors. Sir George Pearce characterized as foolish the idea that it is not only possible, but advisable to build a wall of exclusion around Australia and to shut out peqple and goods. Equally foolish is the idea that migration means u n : employment, but he insisted that these views were not shared by the majority of Australians, and declared that nothing was moru likely to prevent the spread of such pernicious? doctrines, and to encourage good will towards a more determined migration policy, than the realization in Australia of the determination of the people here to assist Australian development by helping to market and sell Australian goods. We hope Sir George will , in duo course, give his fellow-citizens the reverse of the story. He should point out to them that nothing is more likely to discount the efforts made to popularize Empire produce here than lack of sympathy towards British exports, whether expressed in tariff legislation or quickest and best public speeches. Mr Walter Runciman, speaking of tbese mythical gifts from Australia to Great Britain, saidIf we are to be told, as we are very often, that the preference given is a g if t to this country, let us see how it is measured. I think Mr Bruce estimates that it is a g if t of eight million pounds, and in his valedictory speech before he came here lie once more made remarks about this g if t of eight million pounds That eight million is calculated on a rather curious basis. You take first of all the tariff imposed on foreign goods, and then you taKe the . tariff imposed under the preferential duties on British goods; and the difference between the two comes to eight millions. Therefore, says Mr Bruce, that is a g if t to Grout Britain of eight million pounds. Let us f see what would happen if the tariff on foreign goods were doubled and the tariff on British goods remained somewhat where it is. You can easily see that the g if t might be represented, not as eight millions, but as eighty millions. The fact is that it is impossible to measure what is inaccurately called the "" g if t . "" The main object of the tariff is to overcome the competition of all other countries in the world, British as well as foreign; and if the burden put upon the British manufacturer is less than that on the foreigner, that is not a g if t made to Great Britain , it is only an advantage given to certain British exporters and manufacturers which is not given to others. These are individual privileges given to individuals. There is a selection of individuals;. There is no g if t to the nation. (Cheers.) The less Australian representatives talk about gifts the better. Let me. if I may, through the means of this audience, refer to the subject of the greatest g if t from the Government of Great Britain , and that is the g if t of Imperial defence. In Imperial defence it is still this country which bears the lion's share. In consequence of duties w l i i c h were i m posed by the last schedule, the Australian and N e w Zealand section of the L o n d o n Chamber of Commerce, w r o t e to the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, respecti n g the effect of the Australian t a r if f on B r it is h trade. T be m e m o r and u m , w b i c h was endorsed by the Council of the C h a m ber, stated"" The campaign which has been inaugurated by the Empire Marketing Board to induce the housewife in this country to buy Empire produce, even if she has to pay rather more for it , is meeting with a considerable amount of success."" The momorandum proceeded :- "" It is, therefore, all the more dis' appointing to those of us who are pushing this campaign in Great Britain that it should reeeive a severe check from time to time through the action of the dominions themselves. It is useless to ask English workpeople to buy I m perially, regardless of other considerations, if they are to be put out of work by having the products which they themselves manufacture excluded from Empire inarkets."" were given of the average prices of various English textile manufactures, the Australian duties on them, and the consequent resulting prices in Australia. The Secretary of the London Chamber of Commerce has now received a letter from Mr. J. N . Bell, secretary of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, dated 7th September, stating that the memorandum was referred to a subcommittee of the Chamber, and that the following reply was adopted by the Council of the Chamber:"" While we appreciate the action of our Federal and State' Governments in inaugurating an Empire marketing scheme, for the purpose of inducing consumers in the United Kingdom to use more extensively products, we also realise that Australia has Mr Mann. imposed unduly high duties on many imports The fact should not be overlooked that almost all British goods imported from the United Kingdom enjoy preference in the - tariff rates; even so, the duties on most British manufactures still run unreasonably high. We cannot, however, disregard the fact that the volume of imports of manufactured goods into Australia has increased notwithstanding these high duties. So long as Australia continues borrowing money heavily from Great Britain and America and exports its surplus products mainly to Europe, it must accept from these countries imports on a correspondingly high scale-re gardless of cost. An increasing number of Australians is realizing that the abnormal duties have created an artificial and uneconomic position. The illustration in the London Chamber's report is one of many which could be given. Whether the present duties shall bo maintained or altered is a political question. As Australian people are beginning to see that high duties are largely responsible for the excessive cost of living, also for the abnormally high costs of locally-manufactured goods, the tariff is becoming a live question within the Commonwealth. In many directions throughout Australia strenuous efforts are being made to induce our Federal Parliament to reduce the t a r if fespecially for imports of machinery and other articles used by primary producers. It has been shown that these producers are, because of the tariff, heavily handicapped as compared with similar producers in other countries which compete with Australia in oversea markets. We will bring under the notice of our Prime Minister the memorandum of the Australian and New Zealand section of the London Chamber, hoping that it will induce him and party to view this question in the same light as you do."" It is added that the Council of the Sydney Chamber has approved of a copy of the reply being forwarded to the Bight Hon. S. M . Bruce, the Prime Minister, for his favourable consideration. Examples The M e l b o u r n e A r g u s of the 2 5 t h No vember, commented o n the present schedule in the following terms advantage that he is offering the British manufacturer in the shape of additional preference. Here, again, his policy of taking away with one hand what he gives - vith the other is repeated. Of this there are many notable examples. Leather cloth was, for instance, dutiable at 5 per cent. British preference, and at 10 per cent..and 15 per cent, against the foreigner. The new duties are 20 per cent., 25 per cent., and 35 per cent. No  welcomed by the British manufacturers, whose goods will be subjected to a duty of 20 per Australian cent, instead of 5 per eent. His compensation is a trifle higher preference against the foreigner. Many other "" concessions "" could be quoted. Examination of the whole of the alterations leads to one conclusion only. It is difficult, if not impossible, to run with  professes to have framed duties which will encourage the Australian manufacturer, and will at the same time enable the British manufacturer to extend his trade relations with the Commonwealth. He increased the duties on a variety of British goods, but at the same time his preferences are slightly increased. No one will be pleased. The entire schedule reveals an utter lack of thought for the consumer. Speaking in the House of Representatives on 11th August, 1920, he said-""Britis h industry was suffering severely owing to importations into Groat Britain of European steel manufactures. The quantity of iron and steel imported into Great Britain last year amounted to approximately 1,500,000 tons, valued at nearly £8,000,000. The same invasion that was crippling British steel interests also menaced Australia. The Ministry felt that it must do something to meet the competition of the gigantic German steel trust which had been formed to develop the export trade of that country. Members would appreciate the condition of the iron and steel industry in Great Britain owing to German competition and to the disastrous coal strike. Even if the strike was settled soon, it would be some time before the British industry would have recovered from the blow. Tn those circumstances the Ministry felt that there was no real urgency to deal with the British preference schedules, and that consideration could be postponed until next year. Tie gave a definite promise on behalf of the Ministry that members would have the opportunity of considering British preference rates which should be provided to safeguard the industry  waited until Great Britain has shown signs of recovering from' the blow of the general strike, and lie thinks that the time has now come to give her another kick. The pity of it is that he should attempt to - excuse his action by hypocritical professions of an earnest desire to foster the trade of the Motherland. One more extract, and I shall have - finished. The Sydney E v e n in g New s statedAs to the gesture of increased preference to  declared that the preference to British manufacturers of steel rails is increased. This is gratifying, but how? By increasing the duty against those British rails by 15s. a ton, while the general tariff is increased by 25s. a ton.  rails, so as to keep them out of Australia, and then declares that he has given them a preferonce by making the duty against rails from other countries still higher. If British rails are kept out, what comfort is it to the British manufacturer that other rails are also kept out? Is that preference? The principle of Imperial preference must embrace the the. whole Empire, but the tariff schedule before us contains specific duties levied admittedly against New Zealand, while the whole history of tariff relations with South Africa, New Zealand, and Canada, as an example of imperial sentiment, is not particularly edifying. One of the most extraordinary statements concerning the Government's policy that has come to my hands recently is contained in an official report concerning foreign affairs. These reports are regularly issued by the Prime Minister's Department, and there is a file of them in the Parliamentary Library. This particular report is on that file. It is headed "" Geneva Economic Conference,"" and was issued on 9th November, 1927. As I shall show, the attitude of the Government towards the Economic Conference has been one of contemptuous disregard. This report circulates among the press, schools, and universities throughout the Commonwealth. The introduction to it rather minimizes the importance of the Geneva Conference so far as Australia is concerned, but it goes on to say, ""Australia's economic policy is based on (1) Self-development, and (2) interimperial free trade and reciprocity."" ""With freetradej there would surely be no need for reciprocity, but still we bave the declaration that the Australian policy is inter-imperial free trade. I do not know where the policy was framed, or when - approved. I am beginning to wonder how policies are framed, how they get their birth, and how they spring to adult life. I certainly should have no objection to inter-imperial free trade, as part of general free trade, but how can a government be sincere when it issues a statement like this, broadcasts it throughout Australia, and then introduces a tariff schedule increasing the duties against British goods? That is a glaring example of the insincerity and unreality of this alleged imperial preference. I should like to know whether the schedule is the outward and visible sign of the inward and spiritual grace of imperial loyalty. If so, it is certainly manifested in a curious way. The Government, by preaching with one voice high protection and with another imperial free trade is making a hopeless attempt to reconcile two mutually destructive policies. What an extraordinarily ungenerous spirit these increased duties indicate. We have taken advantage, of the generosity of the Imperial Government by establishing an Empire Marketing Board, whose object is to carry out a campaign to induce English people to buy Australian goods. A large amount of money has been expended on that project. Over and over again I bave received letters from Englishmen stating that the people of Great Britain are getting thoroughly disgusted because, while meetings are being held there at the instigation of the Australian Government to improve Empire marketing, it is imposing at this end duties against British trade. I bave already referred to the loans issued to us by the Imperial Government to further immigration - We are asking for and getting every assistance to develop this country, yet our response is a stab at Britisb trade whenever we get the chance. Mr G. FRANCIS - Sboul d we not build up a trade of our own?",26
56,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I see a grave danger in the proposal to build up an imperial self-contained trade, but I shall deal with that later. If I were the Minister I sbould not consent to one increase of duty against Britisb goods; The Mother Country is having a difficult time. Wc owe much to her, and we are doing little credit to ourselves by adopting this hostile policy against British trade and industry.",32
57,Mr BELL,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Our policy is anything but hostile. Mr MANN . ^ I cannot understand the honourable member's views, because the tariff policy is distinctly hostile to Great Britain. One has only to refer to the statement by the Minister himself concerning the iron and steel duties that we are just as much concerned in preventing British manufacturers as in preventing foreign manufacturers from doing business with Australia. We are piling the duties to a height which we think will be effective against Britisb trade. That is the first consideration.",32
58,Mr BELL,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,It has not 'been the effect in the past.,32
59,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I am speaking of the intention and not of the effect of the tariff. Hostility is rife in this schedule, because its intention is to stop English trade, and it is today stopping it to a ' great extent. When that end ha* been achieved then"" the higher duties ar^ scheduled against foreign trade. This slogan of imperial preference is like the Trojan horse, fair seeming and friendly in appearance, but containing in its bowels the very elements of hostility and bate. Hostility if. founded on hate, and there is in this country on the part of a large number of people hatred of the success pf British industry and jealousy of her enterprise.",32
60,Mr BELL,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,There is no hatred of Britisb industry.,32
61,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I cannot interpret the Government's policy in any other way. We bave only to read the speeches of public men. If we put our interests first Ave shall be taking very good care not to help the Britisb Empire. Our whole attitude is bypocritical and insincere. That bas been evident in the past, and there is no change today. What is the use of such farces as that which, according to the press, took place at the Manision House a day or so ago, where public men mixed the King's pudding made of Empire products, as part of the propaganda to increase the sale of Empire goods in Great Britain, while we, at this end, are piling up - duties to prevent, the expansion of Britisb trade? Mr G. FRANCIS - Is not our first duty to develop the trade of Australia?",32
62,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"We owe an immense obligation to Great Britain, and we depend upon ber for our very existence. As Mr Runciman has said, the great burden of imperial defence is almost wholly borne by Great Britain, and from a sense of loyalty we have no rigbt to repudiate our family obligations by hindering Britisb trade in the way that We are doing. The evil or immorality 'if the protective-system is that it must prevent the entry into this country of 'goods of other countries, and we therefore cannot escape the fact that'we are trying to prevent the entry of Britisb goods. The most important aspect of the policy of .protection is its effect npOn onr international relations, and in'this respect I refer honourable members to the great Economic Conference which took place at Geneva in May last. For a long time the efforts of the League of Nations towards effecting international disarmament have admittedly been a disappointment to those who are deeply interested in that project. At' most of these conferences there has been much talk, but little result. Those in the Leagrto itself who have studied this subject bave been gradually forced to the conclusion that before physical disarmament can be brought about mental or moral dii-armament, including, of course, commercial disarmament, must first be attained. In consequence increasing efforts have during the last two or three years been made by the League to bring about international agreement on economi; questions, and last year a preparatory committee was appointed by the Assembly of the League to prepare the way for a great world Economic Conference. It will be remembered that, the agerda for that conference, as suggested by the preparatory committee,, was the subie-ct of discussion in this Parliament over twelve months ago. The committee ob-. tamed a most remarkable collection of d'oomrientary evidence from experts and 1 financiers thronghont the world, supported by the international chambers: of commerce, and the co-operative sureties - cii Europe, representing about 50,000,000 members in Europe alone. It would be no exaggeration to say that this conference was probably the most important that the world has: ever seen. It was sujjposed to be a gatheringnot of politicians, but of economists and experts, wliq were to give judicial consideration to the questions submitted t'o them. Fifty nations, represented' by 194 accredited delegates, who were accompanied' by T57 experts, and advisers, attended the , conference, which has described as the largest ' conference ever held. Two hundred representatives of the world's press also attended',, and. at a subsequent conference at Geneva Lord; Burnham urged upon th&se present! t»be necessity of the pr.ess givingmore attention, publicity,, and support to. the recommendations, of the Geneva, GonfeEence than it had hitherto done: The. conference, which sat for about a, month,, arrived at some very important conclusions and presented a wonderful report. As I have said, it was purely an advisory conference of experts, and it was understood that the subjects were to be discussed without political bias or any view to political advantage. The conference submitted a number of conclusions, two or three of which are most important. One readsAlso, that the attempt to attain self-sufficiency is an unattainable ideal for most uations, that it is a mistake to suppose that it is always more advantageous for a nation to diminish its imports than to increase its exports, and that "" excessive protection, which reduces national production and purchasing power, in the end defeats its own object."" The report refers, also, to the false ideal of basing revenue upon high duties, which, it says, has placed some countries in a precarious position, and continues The attempts after the war to seek prosperity by a policy of economic isolation, have, lifter an experience of nearly nine years, proved a failure. The opinion of the world is beginning to understand that prosperity is not something which can be enjoyed in smaU compartments.",32
63,Mr HTTOHES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Fro m what document is the honourable member quoting? Mr MANN"" - I am quoting extracts fi-om the report of the Geneva Economic Conference.",33
64,Mr HUGHES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Has that report been tabled ?1,33
65,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"It has been tabled and printed,, together with the report of the Australian delegates. I have a-ls©' a copy of the official report issued by the conference, which I small bepleased' tohand to the right honourable member if be de L si-res to read it.

Mr G. FRANCIS.:-HO W many free trade nations were represented in the 50 mentioned"" by the-honourable member? Mr MANN! - About three or four- ",33
66,Mr JACKSON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"America, which imposes higher customs, duties than any other country in. thp world,, should set an example to other nations.",33
67,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Australia , and not America, imposes the highest duties. The conference submitted important decisions upon the three main questions with which it ' dealt, namely, commerce, industry, and agriculture. It carefully considered the conditions in every country, and concluded that the world is over-industrialized. In effect, too much attention is being given to the establishment of secondary industries, which are being encouraged to the detriment of other industries. This results in much economic waste.",34
68,Mr JACKSON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,The representatives industrial nations say that because they do not want further competition.,34
69,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"-That is not so. This section of the report is particularly well ence. He saidworth reading, as it shows that agriculture, which is in a depressed state all.over the world, is neglected. The report ato protectionist statesAgriculture is the occupation of the majority of workers throughout the world; various products represent in value the greater part of human labour, and the exchange of its products against ducts forms, indeed, the basis of world trade. If honourable members will read the report on the subject they will realise how the agricultural industry is suffering. It shows how agriculturists are compelled to submit to a lower standard of wages and conditions than those engaged in other industries, owing to the pressure to which they are subjected and the manner in which they are neglected. As the report is one of the most important issued I wish to discuss the Government's attitude towards the decisions reached, and to the subsequent development of questions arising out of the conference. The conference was supposed to be non-political, and to consist of economic experts.",34
70,Mr STEWAET,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,And was it not?,34
71,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"In the main it was. Unfortunately ,our principal delegate was not permitted to act as a non-political representative. Although the Government was entitled to send five delegates it sent only three, and of that number only one was selected and instructed^ before he left Australia. The other'two were apparently obtained under a method which is becoming rather common, bysecuring the services of two Australians visiting the continent. In his speech, the principal Australian delegate expressed the views of the States.",34
72,Mr RODGERS,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Was that Sir David Gordon ?,34
73,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Yes ; and I quote from his speech accompanying the report of the Australian delegation which is attached to the papers laid upon the table. Mr M . CAMERON - Si r David Gordon was an able representative.,34
74,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I am not questioning that, but the attitude of the Government. I feel convinced that Sir David Gordon of would hardly bave given utterance to the opinions he expressed bad he not received instructions to preserve the political independence of Australia at the conferSeveral declarations of fiscal faith have been made, and it becomes necessary for me point out that Australia is committed to tariff on at least two grounds - the building up of essential industries in a commercially young country, and for revenue its purposes. Whatever may be the necessities of Europe, the requirements of Australia and the policy of that country must be left tb Ausindustrial protralians themselves. Tbat utterance embraces one of the inconsistencies commented upon in some of the speeches subsequently made. It was not a political gathering, but was supposed to consist of independent experts considering economic questions. It was an advisory expert committee, and its findings were to be forwarded to the different governments for an expression of opinion. It is wrong for the representatives of the government attending such a conference to be instructed in such a way that they could not have an open mind. Notwithstanding the statement. I have quoted, the findings of the conference were unanimous. Every nation signed the report. When such an attitude was adopted, how could ourdelegate sign a report which said that we ought to review the tariff? But be did sign the report. The important aspect of this matter is that whilst the report of the conference has received ""world-wide attention, it bas received very little consideration in Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce), who, apart from the brief reference in the press to the document, to the effect that the conditions in Europe do not affect Australia, has not made a public . statement concerning an important iuteniational finding. It is true that we have been supplied with mimeographed circulars from the Prime Minister's office concerning this conference with other members of the League. quently, at a conference on customs prohibitions following the Geneva Conference, the Australian representatives again said that it did not matter what decisions were reached, Australia intended to adhere to its own opinions. report of the speech of General Ryrie, as published in the Melbourne Herald of Priday, the 21st October, was in words similar to those used by Sir David Gordon. An announcement has since appeared in the press to the effect that Australia's attitude towards the second conference is to be one of indifference. Since then a conference consisting of S00 delegates of the Chambers of Commerce of the world, met at Stockholm, and has unanimously approved the recommendations of the Geneva Conference and submitted a detailed report. Notwithstanding this, the Commonwealth Government has not taken any action to carry out or even show respect to the decisions of sucb an important conference established under the auspices of the League of Nations. B y the proposals now before the committee, it is exhibiting an utter disregard of the decisions reached at that conference. Mr G. FBANCIS - How many nations have taken action?",34
75,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I was just about to inform the honourable member. The conference was held i u May, and immediately it concluded its deliberations the German Government took the report into consideris protection. ation and passed the following resolution, which has been publishedTho Federal Government approves the whole report of the World Economic Confertent ence, and agrees with its resolutions. It is duce protection into Great Britain . prepared to co-operate energetically towards the realizations of the recommendations and initiatives of the World Economic Conference. . . . . It considers it urgently desirable that the labours of the League of Nations this conference. necessary for the realization of the conference's resolutions should be speedily taken in and carried through. The German Government instructed the sense in trying to get r i d of it . Economic Council of the Reichstag to immediately prepare a new tariff to give effect to the findings of the conference. Mr SCUXI.IN - Has it done so?",35
76,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"It is doing so at present. At the meeting of the Council of Subse- the League of Nations on the 16th June, Dr Stresemann reported the above decisions of his government. He emphasized the finding of the conference that "" The time has come to put an end to an increase in tariffs, and to move in the The opposite direction."" He urged that the League of Nations Council which had convened the conferencelies under a strong inoral engagement to do everything in its power to see that these recommendations are embodied in the actual economic and commercial policies of the governments of the world, and particularly of those which each of us directly represents 011 this council. Seven of the other nations on the Council of the League gave their assent to those recommendations; Great B r it a in was the only nation which appeared to boggle at them. Doubtless, Great Britain's representative was influenced in his decision by two considerations; first, the attitude of the dominions; and secondly, the fact that the present Minist r y in Great B r it a in is tryin g hard to introduce a considerable measure of the pernicious system of protection, in opposition to the findings of this very conference, the prejudices of its own people, and the promises it made to the electors. It appears as though the other nations of the world realise the value of these decisions and are endeavouring to give effect to them.",35
77,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Grea t B r it a in is still practically free trade, whilst their policy",35
78,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I am a f r a id that the honourable member is not aware of the exto which it is being sought to introI agree that there is room for a considerable reduction in the tariff of almost every country which adopts the report of It is clear, however, that those countries which have hand protection are beginning to realise its disadvantages, and are exhibiting good This matter affects in an important way our relations with other countries in the League of Nations. The conference brought forward certain recommendations, and the Economic Committee of the League is endeavouring to carry them out. Many of the nations are prepared to co-operate, and it seems that only the British Empire stands in the way of the realization of those ideals. That is'a sorry spectacle. If it is largely on account of the attitude of Australia or the other dominions, we must seriously - consider whither we are tending.",35
79,Mr JACKSON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Wliic h nation is carrying the world's burden today?,36
80,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I do not see the relevancy of that question; but I ask the honourable member what part are we playing in world politics, and how are we influencing the Empire? What is our - conception of our relations towards other - countries in the League? We make vague references to our having entered the League as a new nation, untrammelled by old intrigues and inherited hostilities. We speak as though we carry with us into the counsels of the League an atmosphere free from the heritages of the past and are endowed with qualities that fit us to teach the older nations how to conduct their business. We propose to teach them new and better ways than those which they now employ. Mr BELT, - I cannot remember having heard an Australian boast that we were going to do that. Mr M.ANN - I have beard frequently in this chamber speeches to that effect, especially in connection with disarmament. Yet when this important proposal, which would be more effective than any conference in bringing about disarmament, is placed before us, we stand ailoof, disown the moral principle that we have been so eager to inculcate, and wash our hands of all responsibility. We are acting foolishly, because a likely development is that the trade dominance of Europe will be given entirely into the hands of Germany. Germany is today governed by a man of considerable foresight. I do not care what opinions other honourable members have of him, I believe that today, Dr Stresemann is one of the greatest statesmen in Europe, and is doing wonderful work tc bring about peace and a good understanding among the nations, and to retrieve the folly which his country committed in the Great War. Mr G. FRANCIS - What person is in a position to determine who are the great financial or economic experts in the world today ?",36
81,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I sliould say those who themselves have an extensive knowledge of finance, and enjoy a world-wide reputation on that account. When great economists like Sir GeorgePaish, Sir Josiah Stamp, and others who are recognized all over the world as authorities, are chosen, one may be sure that they are the best judges of economics. Mr G. FKANOTS - I asked the honourable member that question merely because he asked the honourable member for Newcastle a similar one.",36
82,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"-They received the assistance of the co-operative associations of Europe, which are large business institutions, and know the men with whom they are dealing. The chairman was Mr Layton, the editor of the London Economist, and a world-wide authority on economics. There were many others of the same stamp. The mental and moral disarmament, which we all desire is a necessary preliminary to physical disarmament. 1 maintain that the attitude we are at present adopting with respect to commercial matters will eventually, though not immediately, sow the seeds of discord. We are not playing the game with other countries, and we shall have them arrayed opposite to us. We are not recognizing obligations that must be mutually observed'. Wn are sowing the seeds of national hostility and national hatred. Only the other day, I received a very remarkable letter from n. gentleman in Japan, the head of a large manufacturers' association in Osaka, whom I do not know, and of whom I had not previously beard. He happened to read one of my speeches. The subject, of his letter, which is written in somewhat quaint langauge, is trade relations between Australia and Japan. He saysAustralia is literally the neighbouring State of Japan beyond the sea, and we must do our best to improve the facilities of mutual intercourse and communication. In the midst of the European war, when Australia despatched her troops to Europe, Japan placed tliem under the escort of her fleet. It is that fact which explains our friendship and mutual aid by giving an example. But now Australia has broken up our friendliness. His reference is to tariff decisions that have been given against Japanese goods, lie continuesUnder such ci reunistanccs, we earnestly want to leave this to the thoughtful men of your Commonwealth to judge what result might 'be produced. Mr G. FRANCIS - Is not Japan a highly protective country?",36
83,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"In some respects it is; but not nearly to the same extent, as Australia. The policy of protection is bad wherever it is enforced; but its effects are becoming more apparent in Australia because it is here being carried to its logical conclusion. Another result of the adoption of this policy by Australia, and of the operation of the alleged Britisb preference towards Australia, is this:-It is being suggested that the world should be divided into regional tracts, that zollverekis should be formed, one comprising the European area-whic h would be very powerfulanother the continent of America, and a third the British Empire. I ask honourable members to consider the implications. Under sucb a scheme the world would be - divided into three camps that from the outset would be commercially hostile, and that, before very long, would almost certainly become hostile in another sense. The last war was essentially a trade war; it was brought about by trade rivalry. Trade wars have been the cause of most of the trouble which the world has experienced. When the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) referred to free trade as an antediluvian policy, he showed that be lacked not only historical knowledge but a sense of historical proportion. Protection is the bad old system, and an inheritance from, the past. It bas been in existence for over 4,000 years,; but free trade was devised as a definite. system little more than .100 years ago.",37
84,Mr JACKSON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Freetrad e is not historical, but hysterical.",37
85,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Then it ought to commend itself very highly to the honourable member. Free trade is the . new. the modern thought; .and it is the best - thought in the world, ""because it is devoted to 'the preservation of international peace. Under it, goodwill and underAmerica? standing are promoted among the Protection, on the other hand, promotes hostility. ""When, in the early 'days, the Phoenicians sailed the coast of Europe as traders, they had tolls levied upon them by the rulers of the nations, out of a protective instinct. Mr JACKSON;-It was not a protective - but a money-making instinct, which is a vastly different thing.",37
86,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"The honourable member sees nothing but good in protection. I see in it nothing but a sordid, money-making system. Clothed in pseudo-patriotism, and - exploiting all the best instincts of the people, ""protection is, nevertheless, nothing but a greedy, money-making system for the benefit of the few.

Reciprocal trade will help towards the realization of that grand ideal, for it establishes an international relationship that can be of advantage to both parties to it. The idea of some honourable members, that by trading with other people we do ourselves an injuiry, is ridiculous. Trade brings benefits to us, and if we shut: off our trade with the rest of the world we shall do harm to ourselves. The very state of mind wbicb inhibits any policy that would be of benefit to other countries shows that our system of protection i« based upon hostility to the rest of the world.",37

90,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"The honourable member would be quite within his rights in doing so; but he should not condemn another person who thinks he can get better value for his money by buying the product of some other country. I do not say that he would get better value; but he is entitled to follow his own judgment in that matter. I have no sympathy the proposals for foisting British commodities of an inferior character upon this country. The evils of the protective system, in its reactions upon our own community, its effects upon our imperial relations, and its implications concerning other netions, are intensified by the methods of administration. I regret to have to criticize the Minister. He may think that be is doing right, and if I criticize his administration I do not question his integrity. But I doubt his capacity judge what is the best for this country. about that. Some time ago I aroused considerable feeling in the House by referring to the sponsible. Customs Department as an Augean stable. An endeavour was made to conbility. strue that statement into a reflection upon a lot of worthy officers. It was nothing the sort. I was referring to the chaotic state existing in the department, the multitudinous rules, regulations and interpretations with which the departto ment is encumbered and traders are handepartment dicapped.",38

There are more orders and interweeks pretations, and the Minister's discretionment ary power is exercised in extraordinary ways never intended by Parliament, and uot justifiable. I have before me two instances in which the Minister has interpretation or decree, entirely altered the form of the items and the rates of duties pres'cribed by Parliament. I referred a few days ago to chemical manures, and particularly diammon phos. To those representations I have received no reply. Since then another instance bas come to my notice.

Although I was promised a reply within a fortnight} it bas not yet reached me. by Some people desire to import timberworking machines of the latest design. They were told that these articles could not be imported under the concession item because a local manufacturer made something similar. The firm desiring to import obtained particulars from the local manufacturer, and ascertained that he had no stock, and could not supply within less than sixteen weeks. The machines could be imported from abroad in about a month. Although it was shown conclusively that the local machines were vastly inferior, and much more expensive than the imported ones, and that delivery would be delayed, the department refused to permit importation at the concession rate of duty. I represented that it was necessary for the development of a local industry that it sbould be allowed to import the most up-to-date and efficient machines. The reply was that it did not matter whether the local article was as good as the other; if the person desiring the machine could manage to use the Australian one at all, he must do so.  will understand that all applications for concessions go before the Tariff Board.

107,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"That is no concern of the honourable member. Another injustice is that some people can get concessions from the department that are refused to others. A friend of mine recently applied to the department for the admission of certain machinery under the concession item. His request was refused. Coming out of the department he met an officer of the Industries Protection League, who asked bim what he wanted in the department.

I say that tbese things are done in the department in order to comply with the Minister's instructions; but is not right. the Minister thinks they are consistent with the protectionist policy, it is a poor reflection upon that policy. The attitude of the department in matters of this kind is to take the word of the manufacturers against the word, of the importers. That is not fair. Mr G. FRANCIS - Tb e honourable member thinks, perbaps, that the department should take the word of the importer against that of the manufacturer?",40
116,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"We know from the Minister's own words his attitude toward? the importers. He is always talking about them, as if they are foreign thieves, o The Minister wants a proof 'Of that, perhaps. If so, I will supply an instance. In the Melbourne Herald of the Sth October, there appears an article by bim headed "" My Busman's Holiday in England,"" in the course of which he saysJ,n tliu course of my busman's holiday in Great Britain, undertaken par.tly for health reasons, and partly, though at my own expense, that 1 should be 'the better .able to my .obligations to this .country as .one Ministers, 1 tried to find a line of tion with regard to Empire affairs and tariffs.

118,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"No , I have not seen the list. Tbat article by the Minister is intended to be a reflection on English traders. Mr G.

120,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Yes ; but apparently they are not traders.,40

123,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I do not think there is anything about them here. There is something about the British manufacturers. I suggest, ,and I think I am justified in suggesting, that this is a reflection on the men who develop international trade. The Minister implied that those who develop international trade are dishonest. He says of them that it does not matter how they make their discharge money; "" The stream might run as of its muddily as might be, so long as it did not demarcaslacken. These men know no country, no These remarks lhaud, I are in accord with statements made frequently by the Minister in this the money House when introducing new tariff He always speaksof the international trader as a despicable being, almost a dishonest being. I do not tbink that he, of all men, should make a statement like that. To view international trade in this way is & great mistake, and is putting this country in a false position in regard to - other countries. Sucb statements are indicative of the spirit in which the of the Customs Department are ordinarily administered, and of the kind of reception given to those who try to promote trade with other countries. Their profits are scrutinized and their rights questioned, as if they had no rigbt to exist at all; while the statements of manu facturers are always taken as true. Those who ask for increased duties are certainly making application for a personal advantage to themselves, even though what they ask may also advantage the country; it. is to increase their proiits or, rate, to prevent their profits from diminishing. On the other hand, international trade is a matter of mutual - benefit. That constitutes the difference between the two. Mr G. FKANCIS - Do not those advantages apply also to local trade?",40
124,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"We are endeavouring AJSO to give a good deal of additional tection by means of what I bave reason - to stigmatize as illegal preferences. There is an act on the statute book in New South Wales- I believe it is still in existence-by which in all government contracts Australian goods are to be given a specific 10 per cent, preference. I do not know for ct-rtain whether a similar law operates in - other States; but I know that in - some States instructions have been issued by the Government to local authorities that they are to give similar additional preference in regard to the purchase of goods, and suchi preference"" is also being given by the Commonwealth Government. I notice that - in some Commonwealth departments pre-f'irence is to be given to Australian tenderers over any others. Tbis Parliament determines, through the customs tariff, what advantage an Australian industry is to bave over outside - competitors. Tbis Parliament alone has the right to do this, and when action :is taken by other Governments, or by local bodies, in a similar direction, they are usurping the rights of this Parliament. When the South Australian Government imposed a tax on petrol the Commonwealth Government took action against it for doing something unconstitutional. Yet it allows the same government to do a similar thing by imposing affairs an extra tax on the people in this form. These are extra taxes imposed by authorities in Australia who have not the right to impose them. This Government, however, never thinks to take any action in this regard. As a matter of fact, it commits the same offence itself. If the Government allows preference to be given in this way, it is increasing the effect of the duties. Another step has now been taken. I was recently informed in Perth that certain trades unions have imposed a special at any penal rate of pay on work wben other than Australian materials is used.",41
125,Mr JACKSON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,That is over the fence.,41
126,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"The honourable member says that such action is over the fence, yet he defends the other form of additional preference to which I referred.",41
127,Mr JACKSON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,A person can choose to pay a higher rate and take an article propro- duced outside the Empirein preference to one produced inside. The same thing does not apply in the case the honourable member bas just quoted.,41
128,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,The enforcement of a penal rate is being widely practised in Australia.,41
129,Mr HUGHES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Where is it being done ? Mr MANN' - I understand that it is being done by the Boilermakers' Union in the Government workshops at Perth, and in other workshops in Western Australia ; and I 'am informed also that it is the recognized custom in most of the workshops in the eastern States. The extra rate is simply imposed by the unions, and if it is not paid there is trouble.",41
130,Mr HUGHES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Oh , well, you cannot blame them for that.",41
131,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,It is imposing an award over and above the Arbitration Court award.,41
132,Mr HUGHES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"After all, they are Australians. I agree that it is wrong; - still, everybody is doing it.",41
133,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I cannot help repeating what has recently been said by a writer on this subject-- There is no more alarming symptom ot modern politics than the tendency of leaders to bid against one another in the distribution of public favours and the use of public funds for distribution of benefits favours to sectional interests. That is what is being done today under this tariff. It is most regrettable. is the cause of much trouble in our public life, and the people are getting tired this system.",42
134,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Would the honourable member advocate absolute free trade for Australia?,42
135,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I would myself. have been asked over and over again "" What is your remedy ?"" I am glad of this opportunity to state my views on particular issue, because so often they have been misrepresented by my critics in this chamber. The application of the remedy calls for the display of a certain amount of courage. In this connection am reminded of the answer given to a under university professor wbo put a particutection, larly difficult question to a number students in physics. He put to them this question: "" If you found yourself in midst of a frictionless surface, how would you get off it ?"" One student who did know the correct answer nevertheless tained full marks by replying: versing the process by which I got there."" Now that is just the position which we find ourselves in regard to policy of protection. We can only get out of our present difficulties by reversing duties. the process that was responsible for landand ing us in our troubles. Mr G. FBANCIS - Did the honourable member tell that story because, like the student in physics, he did*not know the answer ?",42
136,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"No . I have some reimports. medial suggestions to offer. If we look at the history of the fiscal movement in a duty on tea. Great Britain, we find that protection was gradually built up and then was finally abolished.",42
137,Mr WATKINS,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Is it not a fact that further customs duties bave been imposed in Great Britain?,42
138,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Custom s duties have been imposed there, but they are going be abolished in two years' time. unashamedly, a free trader, and I say definitely that a tariff based on free trade principles can raise more revenue, and raise it more easily, than is possible by party means of a protectionist tariff.",42
139,Mr WATKINS,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,But the poorer sections and of the community would have to bear the burden.,42
140,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"The burden on the It poorer classes would not be nearly so heavy under a tariff framed on the lines of I suggest. Make no mistake about that. At present, the burdens are extraordinarily heavy.",42
141,Mr HUGHES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Othe r students of economics do not share the honourable member's view that under protection the I poor man carries the burden.,42
142,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I think the honourable this member for Henty (Mr Gullett) showed that he did. The truth of this basic principle was recognized at the last Geneva Economic Conference. In the discussion at that gathering it was generally I acknowledged that it was impossible, an artificial fiscal system like proto give the people relief from the of burdens of indirect taxation. The only remedy is a gradual reversal of the prothe cess that has got us where we are. The established objective of free trade is cusnot toms revenue on revenue items. I differ obfrom the honourable member for Henty "" By reand others who urge the elimination of the revenue producing items in of the tariff in favour of protective the duties. My remedy for our present troubles is to get rid of the protective England raised more revenue, raised it more easily, when she had only six items in her tariff schedule than when she had 2,000. The honourable the Minister bas urged that be 1 cannot dispense with the revenue duties because of their effect upon the revenue.  Mr E. RILEY - Grea t Britain imposes",42
143,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"A small duty on tea would be nothing to the working man compared with the burden be has to bear through the indirect taxation on his clothing and other commodities. Revenue duties on tea, sugar, tobacco and spirits fall much more lightly on the community to and on the poorersections of it than I am, high protective duties. Mr E. RILET - The duty on tea i Great Britain is about 9d. per lb.",42
144,Mr MANTST,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"It may be as high as that, but I very much doubt it. In any case such a duty would not press so heavily on the poorer sections of the people as protective duties in the schedule which we are now considering. The trouble is that under a system of indirect or taxation the taxpayer does not know how great is the burden that is laid upon him. The Government has no reason to fear a loss of revenue through the of revenue duties. On the contrary it will thus raise more, and raise it more easily,/ I urge Ministers, therefore, to remove logically stated. the essentially protective duties. freely admit that if we are to avoid cataclysm and suffering, as well as organization of trade, the process must be gradual. I have a firm conviction, however, that if we reduce these duties gradually we shall be able to give muchby needed relief to industry. It is of no railing against the Arbitration Court and complaining of its awards. It is no use saying that the Arbitration Court is the cause of all our troubles. You cannot get rid of the Arbitration Court without first altering the tariff fault lies with our customs tariff. I we can reduce the duties gradually it may be possible to afford relief without too great a dislocation of industry. We must allow industries time to re-adjust themselves. In any case dislocation industry due to a reduction of customs duties would be nothing compared with the trouble that may come upon us i we continue along our present fiscal path. I am. speaking with the greatest sinfiscal cerity, and in the ful l belief that what I desires. am saying is true. One firm has already gone. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has lately put off 2,500 Bonds, another big concern, has dispensed with the""*"" services of 2,000 employees. These two industries between them' are languishing, and 4,500 employees have been thrown out of work. Mr C. FBANCIS - Does the honourable member suggest that they are suffering because of the high customs tariff ? Mr MA1DT - They are suffering because of the faults in the economic system which I have been describing. our fiscal policy. I need not recount them all. We have n to choose the less of two evils. I am speaking, as I said, in all sincerity. I impress on those honourable members who. disagree with me that a great and solemn duty is laid upon this committee. The the responsibility is on us to make a great decision in the near future. If I have presented my case wrongly or unfairly, if I have stated my views imperfectly, I ask them to overlook my shortcomings and weigh the issue in the full light of the knowledge which they themselves have imposition of the present position.",43
145,Mr RODGERS,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Fro m the honourable member's point of view the case bas been I Mr MAIOT - It is the point of view a of very many people in this country. I disfeel sure that I am representing the opinion of the people of my State. Unfortunately this Parliament considers that two years ago it was commissioned the electors to continue these high use duties. I say that the fiscal issue was not discussed then. As a matter of fact, of it was not mentioned except in my own State, where most of the supporters of the Ministry were returned on the distinct understanding that relief would be given. . The The Government, with its unbroken f forces, and the personal prestige of its leader, never before had a chance like this to bring about a change in policy, especially since one-half of its members - the Country party-were once opposed of to this policy, though they may have foresworn themselves since. The time was never more opportune for the Governf ment or Parliament to do the courageous thing and bring about a change in our policy that every one so earnestly I now ask that this issue be made a vital issue at the next election, so that it will be settled by the people and men. we shall know where we are.",43

148,Unknown,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,43
149,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Yarra). [8.0] - The committee listened this afternoon to a very able and carefully prepared speech by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) from the free trade point of view. It was also a lengthy speech. During the 165 minutes which the honourable member occupied in delivering it, I found myself in agreement with bim for five minutes. Throughout the history of the world many men bave suffered, because of being ahead of their time, and while the honourable member was propounding his theories of free trade, the thought struck me, that the free traders in this country are suffering, because they are balf a century behind the time. The speech of the honourable member would bave made some impression 50 years ago, but it makes none today. He made some remarkable comments on the tariff schedule, which, he said, was framed on a policy of hatred of Great Britain. It was an ordinary statement, because my complaint against the tariff schedule is that it disregards Australian industries to give preference to Great Britain. If the honourable member for Perth had been as eloquent in support of Australian industries as he was in advocating trade for Great Britain, he would bave rendered a very much greater service to this country, an important part of which he is representing in this Parliament. After having spent considerable time on a diatribe against the Government for its policy of hatred of Great Britain, the honourable member then criticised British statesmenship and eulogized that of Germany, simply because a Ger-' man statesman bad advocated a reduction of tariff, while the statesmen of Great Britain, according to what the honourable member told us, were not carrying out the decisions made at Geneva. He also told us that protection was a sordid money-making system, and he took the Minister for Trade and Customs, whom I have no doubt can capably defend himself, severely to task, because he had made derogatory statements about certain British traders. * If the honourable member in reading the report had quoted about two paragraphs more, he would bave been a little fairer to the Minister. The Minister said that wben in Great Britain, he was entitled to dra*\ a line of demarcation, and he found it distinctly drawn, there being on the one side selfish interests, and on the other a predominance of men with Empire vision; so that his remarks about the minority who were selfish and out for profits, I think, were quite true. If it is wrong for the Minister to return from Great Britain and to criticize some of the British capitalists and their methods, bow much more wrong is it for the hororable member for Perth to say that men, who are building up industries iiAustralia, are operating under a system of sordid money making ? I ask the honourable member what of the importers. Are they all patriots? Are they pure souled philanthropists that we should give them free opportunity to import goods from anywhere? Are not the importers out for profits too? I admit that we have money-making,, and sordid moneyextramaking interests to satisfy in this country. I admit that under our protectionist policy, some manufacturers in Australia have taken toll of the people, but prior to that the importers took toll of the Australian people without giving any service in return. It is our duty to see that when we impose duties to protect the industries of this country and to develop it as a nation, we so hedge tbem around that no one, whether importer or manufacturer, can take toll of our people. Failing that, if we bave to choose between being exploited by importers or by Australian manufacturers, then I prefer to be exploited by our own people. Had the community suflicient wisdom to grant to our Australian Parliament the powers that it should bave under the Constitution, and if effect could be given to what is known in politics as new protection in order to safeguard the ^interests of Australian consumers, then we should have a really genuine, sound and scientific system of protection. The honourable member's remedy is not a remedy at all, and if given effect would produce nothing buj chaos. He said that the protectionist policy has brought about centralization and stimulated industry in the cities. I thank him^nfor admitting that it bas stimulated u Australian industries. It is better < 'for tbem to be .stimulated in the cities of Australia than in the cities of other countries, and while I regret our policy of centralization, I prefer to see people working under reasonable conditions in the cities of Australia than under the sweated conditions of manufacture in the cities of the old world. The honourable member then told us that in Australia it takes £2,000 to settle a migrant upon the land. Is the protectionist policy responsible for that? I suggest to him that he show the connection between the protectionist policy of this country and the cost of settling immigrants upon the land.",44
150,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I spoke of that aspect as showing how foolish it is to expect, under our protectionist policy, to settle migrants on the land.",45
151,Mr GREGORY,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,High tariffs must necessarily increase the cost of settlement.,45
152,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,The cost of settling an immigrant on the land is primaril y the cost of the land.,45
153,Mr STEWART,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,No .,45
154,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"It is. The protectionist policy has not increased the cost of land in Australia. The honourable member for Perth, also told us that high duties brought about unemployment. He lives in a world of his own. He is away up in the skies with his free trade theories. I ask bim to come to earth to look round the cities of Australia and in the provincial centres, and see what is the prime cause of unemployment today. If he does he w i find that it is the imports that year after year flow into this country and eventually close down Australian industry. To say that h i g h' protection is the cause of unemployment is to misrepresent the position. The tariff schedule that has been placed upon the table by the M in ister is from my point of view as a protectionist, a most attenuated document. It has been prepared, as I bave said before, more with an eye to Britisb preference than for the protection of Australian industries. While I bave no objection to reciprocal trade with Great B r it a in and-other countries, I say that it must not be at the expense of Australian industries. I should really like to know what is the Government's policy on the fiscal question, because I am at a loss to understand it . The honourable member for Perth quite surprised me today wben he read from a circular"" issued - by the Prime Minister's Department. I confess that I had not seen it . In that circular is the declaration that the economic policy of Australia is (1) self development, with which I agree; and (2) inter-Imperial free trade and reciprocity. First of all inter-Imperial free trade is a distinct contradiction of reciprocity. When in the name of fortune has this country ever declared for inter-Imperial free trade ? I see the stamp of inter-Imperial free trade throughout this tariff schedule. Its weakness, and also that of the previous schedule, is the weakness of I m perialism-to o much regard for Britisb preference and too little regard for Australian industry. To give some idea of the Prime Minister's outlook on the fiscal question, let me quote from his remarks on the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) to the Budget. He saidAn additional tariff, barrier would certainly be a means of encouraging inefficiency and of maintaining conditions under which men can demand hours and wages that are not economically sound. In view of that statement, and that of the honourable member for Wimmera, (Mr . Stewart), respecting the action of the Leader of the Government in the Senate in entering into a semi-free trade pact in Western Australia prior to the ll last election, it is very difficult to obtain an effective protectionist policy from the Ministry. The view of the other leader in . the team is interesting. Last August the Treasurer told the settlers and farmers of New South Wales that lower wages and lower tariffs would prove more protective to Australian workers and industries. The honourable member for Perth said, during the course of his speech, that he feared that he was making no impression upon the Minister. I sincerely hope that his fear was well founded. I believe that the Minister is a protectionist, but too much impression bas already been made upon him. He is after all only a member of the Government team, and what a team it is on the fiscal question! Half of it is in the shafts pulling well, hut the other half is yoked to the back of the wagon pulling in the opposite direction. The result is that the wagon is creaking and nearly broken, and the team is afflicted with spavin, windgall and stringhalt, so far as the tariff is cerned. We cannot expect any progress in the protectionist policy, especially when the Treasurer, co-partner with the Prime Minister in the Government of this country, says that we should get more protection for our workers and industries by having lower wages and lower tariffs, which be believes would reduce cost of production and enable us to compete successfully with the world. It sounds well in theory to those who theorize and ignore realities. If we were starting among the nations from scratch, our onlyconcern would be to see that wages and conditions were such as to enable the' workers to enjoy the comforts of life. The theory of deflation, if applied today"", would immediately bring us up against realities. What are the realities? They are that *we have a burden of Commonwealth and State debts on which a fixed interest of £50,000,000 a year has to be paid. In addition there are private borrowings on which, roughly, another £100,000,000 a year has to be paid. . Tbese interest rates are fixed for long periods, and if what is called the policy of deflation is introduced we shall be playing into the hands of persons receiving a fixed, unalterable rate of interest on their bonds and other securities during the term of the loans. By halving the cost of commodities and reducing the wages to the same extent we would double the value of their interest. Those loudest in demand for deflation are the persons responsible for inflation. I refer tc the profiteers, who during the war inflated the cost of everything. Prices having been built up, wages bad to try to follow. As the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Mann) said, wages went up the stairs and prices went up the elevator. Tbese people inflated prices and made huge profits by profiteering methods and scandalous lack of patriotism during the nation's agony. Tbey invested their ill-gotten gains while men were suffering in the trenches. They 3tr. Scullin. waved the flag whilst they made their profits, which they invested in long-dated loans at fixed rates of interest. Now they wish to bring down prices and wages so that the purchasing power of their returns in the form of interest may be increased. con- The suggestion has been made that, when customs duties are increased, the workers should not ask for higher wages, irrespective of Avhether they have a just claim or not. Tbat suggestion is made in portions of the Tariff Board's report. Let me say, in reply, that Avages are fixed and determined by tribunals in Australia, based, presumably, first of all as a basic Avage, upon the cost of living, to which an addition is made for skill. At any rate, Avages are determined by a tribunal. I should like to ask those gentlemen Avho say that the Avorkers have no right to submit their claims to a tribunal, what they would think of a tribunal to fix the prices the Avorkers have to pay. Are they, like the Avorkers, prepared to go 'before a tribunal which shall determine a fair price or profit? Of course, they are not. It is fallacious to say that the Avhole of our customs duties are a charge upon the people. They are to some extent, but not to the full extent. We receive, roughly, £30,000,000 a year in customs duties. This, some say, is the price Ave pay for protection. That is incorrect, because in the first place a large percentage bf that amount is not paid at all by the consumers of Australia, but by the importers and manufacturers of foreign goods. There is evidence- I am not going to quote it as the Minister bas placed it on record, but I and others have seen it recorded in many instances-that the imposition of customs duties has in their many cases brought about a reduction in prices charged in Australia. I Avill not claim that that is true in every instance; but it justifies a reduction from the £30,000,000. Then, again, approximately £13,000,000 of the £30,000,000 is frankly admitted to consist of revenue duties - quite apart from excise duties which reduces the amount of protective duties to £15,000,000, of which a fair percentage is not a charge at all upon the Australian consumer. Another percentage is Avhat Ave are paying fpr the right to get work in our own country, for developing oui own industries and keeping our own people employed. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that this is not an occasion for a general debate on the tariff - The fiscal issue has been thoroughly threshed out, and irrespective of what any one says to the contrary, protection has become the settled policy of Australia. It is necessary, however, to examine the schedule closely and to particularize in some instances, because there is. a great need a revision of many of the items and an urgent need for immediate application of such revision. There should not be any delays or adjournments, but we sbould as quickly as possible proceed to discuss the items. I propose not to speak at length at this juncture, but to examine some of the items in the hope that some impression may be made upon the Minister, and that wben the items nre reached some amendments will be made in the interests of Australian industries. Let me give some illustrations. I do not intend to cover in detail the ground which the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) will traverse; but I should like to refer to the iron steel industry, which has been exhaustively inquired into by the Tariff Board. Probably no more exhaustive inquiry has been made into any industry for a longer period. Attention bas been called to it again and again in a forceful manner by honourable members, and particularly by the honourable member for Newcastle, who represent a very important part of Australia in which this important industry is situated. It was my good fortune to visit the works quite recently. I do not claim to be an expert, but as an ordinary interested observer I consider that the plant at Newcastle is one of the best and most complex we bave in this land of ours. There cannot be anything much better in any part of the world. It is an industry which we should strain every effort to keep going. It is in competition with a huge European combine. The war had no sooner terminated than overtures were made by the great iron and steel masters of Germany, Prance and Belgium for co-operation? tb exploit the world's markets. Tbey have succeeded today in exploiting the British market. They have their agents in Britain, and foreign manufactured goods are sent to Britain to be finished off, and then exported to Australia as British articles entitled to come in under a preferential duty. That is what the Australia iron and steel industry is competing with at present. I was given to understand that the Government or the Minister had followed very closely the recommendations of the Tariff Board, but in turning to this big key for industry of Australia, one of our foundation industries, I find that the Government has not followed the board's recommendations. Take, for example, item 130 (a) relating to pig iron. The Tariff Board's recommendations were 30s. British preference, 40s. intermediate and 45s. general. The schedule shows that no alteration has been made. The old rates remain: 20s. British preference, 30s. intermediate, and 40s. general. Take item 136 b, ingots, blooms, &c. The Tariff Board's recommendation was 52s., British preference, 72s. intermediate and 140s. general. There has been no alteration, and the old rates of 32s. British preference, 52s. intermediate and and 65s. general remain. In respect of item 136 c, bar, rod, red, angle and tee iron, the recommendation of the board was 75s. British preference, 95s. intermediate and 150s. general. The rates in this schedule are 70s. British preference, 100s. intermediate, and 120s. general. In respect of item 152 a iron and steel tubes or pipes, the board recommended that "" on and after 30th June, 1926, the duties should be 50 per cent. Britisb preference, 60 per cent, intermediate and 75 per cent, general."" The schedule shows that the date has been altered U» "" on and after 1st January, 1929."" Surely after careful investigation the board knew what it was recommending. Surely it realized the menace of a deferred duty in such a case.  industry is yet to be established.",45
155,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"This report is dated 11th June, 1926, and if I remember aright was tabled only last week.",47
156,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,On Priday last.,47
157,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"The board recommended that the increased duty should come into operation on the 30th June, 1926. The Government proposes that the increase shall take effect as from the 1st January; 1929^ and that instead of the duties being 50 per cent. British preference, 60 per cent, intermediate, and 75 per cent, general, they shall be 40 per cent., 55 ppr cent, and 60 per cent, respectively. Take item 154 a relating to rails, 50 lb. to the yard and over. The board recommended a duty of 60s. Britisb preference, 85s. intermediate and 150s. general per ton, but the schedule shows duties of 50s., 85s., and 100s. respectively. Under item 154 b rails less than 50 lb., the board recommended 70s. British preference, 95s. intermediate and 160s. general, whilst the schedule provides for 45s., 100s. and 125s. respectively. In regard to item 154c, fish plates, tie plates and rods, the board recommended duties of 75s. British preference, 85s. intermediate and 180s. general, whereas the duties set down in the schedule are 48s., 100s. and 125s. spectively. In the case of rails of 50 lb. or over, the recommendation is for a British preferential duty of 60s. a ton, whereas schedule provides only 50s. For rails less than 50 lb. the board recommended a preference duty of 70s. and the schedule vides for only 45s. In the case of fish plates, tie plates and rods the recommendation of the board is a preference duty of 75s. whereas the schedule provides for a preference duty of only 4bs. The same disparity exists practically through the whole schedule.",47
158,Mr COLEMAN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,What is the use of the Tariff Board?,48
159,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I am not going to argue that the Government should slavishly accept the recommendations of the board. That would be an absurd position to take up, I suggest, however, that when a Minister introduces a tariff schedule, which differs to such an extent from the Tariff Board's recommendations as this one does, be should at least explain to the committee the reason for the disparity. After all, the board recommends to this Parliament, and the Government sbould pay some regard to its recommendations otherwise it should disband the board. If the board recommends certain duties to this Parliament and the Government in its wisdom or otherwise or for reasons of political expendiency does not follow the recommendations of the board, the Minister should explain the reason. I expect him to do so in regard to a number of the items. ",48
160,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I now turn to item 105 aa, which covers knitted goods. Last year Parliament imposed a very substantial duty upon tbese. goods and rendered what it thought a very good service ta the trade. To a large extent our action appeared effective as the manufactures of knitted goods were for a time progressing. When we are dealing with foreign manufacturers and importers, however, we are dealing with very shrewd people. These people found an important loophole in the tariff of 1926, through which they brought in piece goods knitted in tubular form, which only had to be cut into lengths, a few stitches inreserted and the finished garment was produced. It is now proposed to remove this loophole, because it has been shown that importations have been coming in the through it from Britain and Japan. In 1924-25 the importations of cotton piece goods in tubular form, pro- were valued at £6,0*00 in 1925-26 at £72,000; and in 1926-27 at £175,000. By sending the goods out in that form, the oversea manufacturers defeated the intention of this Parliament, as expressed in the 1926 tariff. From July to September of. the present year the value of the imports of these goods wasSilk piece goods in tubular form .. £4,000 Artificial silk piece goods in tubular form .. 44,000 Cotton piece goods in tubular form 95,000 That rising tide of imports furnishes a cause of our industries going to the wall. The duties proposed in the schedule represent about one-half of what the industry asked for. I repeat that the Government is not bound to give all that is sought; but it must be conceded that some explanation ought to be forthcoming as to wby it has been cut in half. The fatal feature of the item, however, is that the duty is to be deferred until July, 1928. Those who are interested in the trade say that since the inquiry was., ^conducted in March last the importers have . stacked up their warehouses with supplies sufficient to last for twelve or eighteen months, and, in some cases, for two years, simply because there was a firm belief that the duty on these goods would be increased. In the face of that, what explanation does the Minister offer of the proposal to defer the operation of the new duty for a further seven months? I admit that he cannot prevent shrewd men, who keep themselves apprised of the trend of events, from anticipating what goods are likely to be protected and what are not. Even if they make a few mistakes by importing goods upon which the duty is not increased, they lose only the interest for the time being on the amount they have invested; but, on the other hand, when they correctly gauge the position they are enabled to increase their profits as the result of the increased duty.  ber criticized the Government because it did not follow the report of the Tariff Board in respect to iron and steel. In fairness to the Government, it should be mentioned that the proposal to which he now takes exception was recommended by the Tariff Board.",48
161,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,The Minister will admit my having said that I did not expect the Government to follow slavishly the reports of the Tariff Board; but when it declines to do so it should give the reason. I should have refused to adopt the report of the Tariff Board to defer this duty; and I could give sound reasons for my refusal to any Parliament that wished to protect an Australian industry. There is an aspect of this matter which has been overlooked. Before the mills put anything on the looms they seek orders. In January of each year they take orders for articles that will be required for the ensuing summer trade. Next January they will seek orders for the 1928 summer trade. What hope will they have of obtaining any orders when there is a deferred duty on these goods that will not come into operation until July next? Mr E. EILEY - It will give the Japanese au opportunity to send their goods here.,49
162,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Thos e who import goods from Japan will be able to fill their warehouses with those ""goods. «If this is a duty that ought properly to be imposed, the Ministry should allow it to operate from the moment it was tabled. Wben the Australian millers seek orders next January for the followingsummer's trade they will find every warebouse filled with imported goods from the cellar to the garret. It will be two years at least before the Australian industry will derive any benefit from this duty, and in the meantime it will probably go to the wall. The biggest hosiery and underwear spinners and weavers in Australia-Georg e Bond and Co. Limited, of Sydney-hav e gone into voluntary liquidation. Tbat may not be due entirely to importations, but I believe I shall be safe in asserting that they are largely responsible for the difficulties in which that firm finds itself. The flood of imports bas affected that industry just as it has affected many others. One of the stated reasons for the liquidation is that the banks will not advance further moneys."" If that firm could turn into cash the goods it has produced the banks would not be asked to advance further moneys. Mr SEABROOK: - Did it not make a profit of over £50,000 net during each of two recent years?",49
163,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,It did.,49
164,Mr WATKINS,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,That was largely expended on its works.,49
165,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"The honourable mem: ber for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) probably knows that a firm may go into liquidation and yet be able to pay a great deal more than 20s. in the £ 1 / It may show a handsome profit wben its goods are being sold, and ytt be unable to finance the business in the event of failure to sell. It is of no advantage to a firm to have hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of stock in its mills if it is not able to * dispose of it. George Bond and Company may be worth not less than 30s. in the £1. I believe the firm made a profit of over £60,000 in one year, and £50,000 in another, and I have no doubt that if it could now sell its goods it could make a profit of £50,000 this year. We are passing through a period of financial stringency, and if the banks will not advance the money necessary to enable it to carry on until it can sell its goods, there is no other course open to it than to go into voluntary liquidation. The interjection of the honourable member strengthens the argument for a protective duty that will keep out imports and allow the Australian article to be sold on the local market. I bave read in the press the report of a statement that has been made by . Mr A. C. Wilkinson, managing director of the Globe Worsted Mills, Marrickville, who returned last October from a visit to Great Britain and the United States of America. He points out that balf of the machinery in the textile industry in Great Britain is idle, and says that the depression is due to the importation of cheap worsted and other articles from Belgium and Germany. I have not' the slightestdoubt that Australia is importing large quantities of those cheap commodities from Belgium and Germany, under the British preferential tariff, and with the label "" British goods "" attached. Whatever action was taken it would not prevent that sort of thing. With a high duty under the general tariff, and a low one under the British, there is the temptation to cheat, and foreign manufacturers will always take advantage of it. I wish also to direct the attention of the Minister to the item "" Timber,"" and I believe that in this I shall bave the support of the honourable member for Eranklin. The difference between honourable members who sit on this side and some honourable members opposite is that we are protectionists with respect to all Australian industries, not alone for thost that are in our own electorates or onr own States. There are no forests in my electorate; there are a few old red gums on the river flats, and that is all; but I, nevertheless, wish to see our timber industry encouraged. I bave a passing knowledge of Australian, certainly of Victorian forests: There * is no important part of our Victorian forests in which I have not been. I lived my young life in the bush, and took an interest in our timbers'. One of my saddest contemplations, looking back over a period of 25 or 30 years, is the sinful waste that bas taken place of our beautiful Australian hardwoods. Little encouragement is given to the utilization of our barwoods, but on the other hand, we import every year millions of feet of timber that in most cases is not the equal of, and in the balance of cases, is certainly not superior to, our own. The hardwood industry is an important one. There are over 100 mills, Mr Scullin. about 75 of which are operating at the present time, employing probably 1,600 men. If they were doing normal business, they would be employing a number approaching to 3,000. The saw-milling industry bas to contend. against very keen competition. In this schedule an attempt is made to protect it, and in so far as it relates to oregon, it meets with my approval. That is one of the bright spots in the schedule; so far as the timber industry is concerned, it is the only bright spot. But if it is desired to protect Australian timbers, why not place an effective duty on all imported timbers, and not confine it to oregon? Japanese oak is a serious competitor of our Australian woods; so, also, is Pacific maple and Borneo cedar. Why not include those in the schedule? Japanese oak competes with Tasmanian oak and Australian blackwoods. . The importations of that timber in 1921 amounted to 4,300,000 super feet, and in 1926 to 6,600,000 super feet, an increase of 2,300,000 super feet. It is remarkable, however, that the value dropped from £175,000 in 192.1 to £135,000 in 1926, a decrease of £40,000; showing that the cheap labour of Japan has become cheaper, whilst our standard of labour has remained at relatively the same level, since 1921. There is no hope of an Australian industry competing on those terms. The old duty on all timbers was 3s. British preferential, 3s. intermediate, and 4s. general. The new proposal, which applies to Oregon only, is 8s. in each case. Tbat would be all right if it were not confined to Oregon. It will be found that hemlock, spruce, and other timbers will take the place of oregon as a competitor of our timbers, with the result that the local industry will again be , without protection. I would like to hear what explanation can be offered of what, appears to me an inexplicable anomaly. Item 291 (H ) reads: "" Timber, undressed, in sizes less than 7 inches by 2$ inches-(1 ) Oregon,"" British preferential tariff lis., intermediate lis., general l is . In the existing tariff Item 291 (L ) , "" Timber, dressed, n.e.i.,"" bearing duties of 6s., 7s. 6d., and 8s. 6d., is unaltered. The effect of that is that undressed oregon in sizes less than 7 inches' by 2^ inches will have to bear a duty of l is . ; but if it comes in dressed it admitted at duties varying from 6s. to Ss. 6d. One would imagine that when more labour bad been added to the article it wouia"" bear a higher duty.",49
166,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,So it should in any properly arranged schedule.,51
167,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I agree with the honourable member that this is not a properly arranged schedule. The anomaly is so glaring that I can only attribute it to an oversight, which I hope will be rectified. Some people may say that the prices being charged for Australian hardwood are so high that imported timbers will be able to compete with them. I find, however, that whereas the price of Australian hardwood has increased only Is. per 100 super, feet since 1921-fro m 28s. to 29s. - tb e price of Oregon has fallen from 40s. to 29s.; so that whilst the Australian timber had a natural protection of 12s. in 1921, today there is no margin in its favour. Mr A. Nichol, secretary of the North-western Millers Association, said in the course of a published statementIt had heen agreed that if the tariff creased on Baltic pine and foreign hardwoods, there would be no increase in prices. He also said that the proposal to increase the duty on Oregon only had created consternation amongst those engaged in the industry, and I can quite believe that it did. I turn 'now to the smaller but, nevertheless, very important industry of smallware weaving. Three companies are operating in this industry, the capital employed is £100,000, the annual bill for wages and salaries is £131,000, and about 200 persons are employed. The largest of tbese is the Australian Weaving Company at Collingwood, Victoria, which in 1910 pioneered this industry. I would like honourable members to pay a visit to that mill. They would spend a most interesting couple of hours, and would appreciate the enterprise of 'its founders. Prior to 1910 all the articles now manufactured in that and the two other Australian mills, were imported. while the local industry did very well; but a slump came after the war, when the manufacturers abroad did everything possible to recover their trade. They were prepared to, and did, sell articles' much below the cost price in the country of [95] will be origin. Notwithstanding the assistance given by the Industries' Preservation Act, or the anti-dumping duties, that process continues, the prices quoted in Australia being lower than those, in the United Kingdom. The products of this iudustry are covered in the existing tariff by item 107A, "" Woven materials, badges, hat and cap fronts, medal ribbons, loopings for boots and shoes, labels and bangers, &c."" The old duties were 35 per cent. Britisb preferential, 40 per cent, intermediate, and 50 per cent, general. In this schedule the British preferential tariff is unaltered, the intermediate tariff bas been increased to 45 per cent., and the general tariff to 60 per cent. The serious flaw in.this re-arrangement is the failure to increase the British preferential duty, although the principal competition comes from the United Kingdom. Large quantities of imports from Germany, Switzerland, Czecho-Slovakia and Holland are re-boxed in England by agents of the foreign manufacturers, and sent to Australia. The result is that many looms in the Australian mills are idle was into-day. The local companies asked for duties of 45 per cent. British preferential, 55 per cent, intermediate, and 65 per cent, general. The request put beforethe Tariff Board referred to ""-woven and embroidered materials,"" but in this schedule the word, ""embroidered "" is omitted. That means that embroidered materials will come under item 106B, and will be subject to duties of 15 per cent. Britisb preferential, and 25 per cent, general. "" Slipper, shoe, and blazer bindings"" bave been taken from Item 404, and bave not been included elsewhere in the schedule. The trade suggests that those bindings also should be included in item 107A. I am informed that one firm in England, the name of which I can furnish to the Minister, is quoting these articles at half the price at which it was selling them in Great Britain. A short time ago it was reconstructed after going bankrupt- a fate that is not surprising if it is dumpFor a ing goods in Australia at half the price at which it can sell on the home market. The local industry should be protected against this unfair competition. I draw the attention of the Minist tr to Item 384, panchromatic dry plates. The old duties on these were 25 per t ent. Britisli preferential, 30 per' cent, intermediate, and 35 per cent, general. Under the new schedule this photographic material will be admitted free from the United Kingdom, and will bear duties of 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, under the intermediate and general tariffs respectively. The Kodak Company Proprietary, of Collingwood, bas asked that the old duty be restored, or that the item be omitted from this schedule. It is suggested that the new duties are based upon a misconception. Eighteen months ago inquiries were made by the department to ascertain if the Kodak Company was manufacturing panchromatic plates, and the answer was that experiments with tbem were being conducted, but they were not then being produced for sale. Since that time the firm has succeeded in producing large quantities of these plates, which are giving satisfaction to their customers. In the interval no further inquiry has been made by the department, and the company, not anticipating that this item would be altered, made no representations to the Tariff Board. All that it is asking now is that the old duty be continued. I am informed that panchromatic plates can be substituted for the dry plates ordinarily used for photography. If they were admitted free, they would compete with ordinary dry plates, and there would be a reduced output by a department that now employs 500 hands. The Kodak Company now manufactures 90 per cent, of all sensitive materials used by photographers in Australia, and a serious blow will be struck at this industry if panchromatic plates from the United Kingdom are placed oil the free list. The last item to wbicb I wisb to refer at this stage is 204 "" aluminium cooking utensils,"" the British preferential tariff on which has been increased from 25 per oent. to 35 per cent., ancl the general tariff from 35 per ' cent. to 60 per cent. Those in the trade are satisfied with the duty in the general tariff, but I am informed that some branches of the looal industry will be compelled to close if not. given greater protection against Great Britain, from which the principal competition comes. As the general tariff is being increased by 25 per cent., I sugMr Scullin. gest that the British preferential tariff be increased by 20 per cent., and so enable a struggling industry to carry on. Prom his utterances, the Minister appears to be by conviction a protectionist; but this schedule is not soundly protectionist. I realise that the honourable gentleman experiences difficulties owing to the coalition in the ministerial party of free traders, protectionists and revenue tariffists. For instance, the honourable member for Perth announced himself, a free trader, and then said that more revenue would be raised by a free trade tariff than by a protectionist one. The free traders and semi-free traders in the Ministry and on the Government benches are never tired of condemning Australian industries, and slandering Australian workers. Foreign goods seem to be tlieir delight, and they have a passion for cheapness. I asked the honourable member for Perth if he advocated absolute free trade, and he replied in the affirmative. Asked how he would bring it about, be said that he would reverse our present policy; in other words, be would step backwards. Do the advocates of free trade ever contemplate what would be the effect of introducing their policy into Australia ? It would mean the scrapping of the machinery in our factories, because they could not possibly carry on, and their buildings would be utilized as storehouses for foreign goods that would come from all parts of the world. The cheapest and nastiest labour one could imagine would be producing those goods, and we would be using tbem whilst our own people were turned into hewers of wood and drawers of water.",51
168,Mr JACKSON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,What would happen to the primary industries?,52
169,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"How would the dried fruits industry fare under a free trade policy? What would happen to the fine town of Mildura if the products of the district surrounding it bad to compete with those of cheap-labour Mediterranean countries? The dried fruits industry, sugar-growing, and other primary industries have been fostered and maintained by protective duties. But the honourable member for Perth advises us that the discarded and discredited policy of free trade, which no State in the Commonwealth would revert to, is a new and a better system. I am reminded of the linesFaith, fanatic faith , once wedded fast To some dear falsehood, hugs it to the Traders of the old world are struggling to recover from the effects of the war; their industries bave been reconstructed, and they have progressed sufficiently to be serious competitors with each other. While engaged in the war, B r it a in lost much of her trade; but her industries are becoming restored, and competition is in progress between ber and the continent, ancl between the various continental countries. The struggle is keen ancl brutal, ancl Australia will be made a dumping ground for the exportable surpluses of Europe if we do not adequately protect onr industries. Our imports last year, as honourable members heard many times during the budget debate, exceeded our imports, and the arrivals in the country also exceeded the departures by 40,000. Therefore, we are in the position of im porting more goods than we export, and importing workers to do work bere while sending work abroad. If that policy is persisted in , serious depression must come, bringing with it dislocation in trade and disaster to the people.",52
170,Mr HUGHES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"North Sydney) [9.1]. - The * committee sbould consider caref u l l y the proposed alterations of the tariff submitted by the Minister, and ought not to complain when honourable members take advantage of the opportunity now afforded for reviewing the economic and financial position of the country. It may be fair l y contended that economic problems dominate our national life, and determine the means by which we carry on the various operations essential to the welfare and progress of the community. The honourable member for Perth this afternoon dealt at some length with the position in which Australia finds herself today. W it h much that he said I can agree; from some of his statements, - and particularly from his diagnosis and conclusions, I dissent very strongly. When he said that this country was taxed too highly, l do not think that any man would deny that he was right. If we took a referendum of the people on that question, it would be decided in the affirmative with loud acclamation. It is the only subject on which the people are likely to have an undivided opinion. Unhappily, it is true, as the honourable last. member pointed out, that our indirect taxation has jumped fro m £13,000,000, in 1918-19, to £44,000,000, in 1926-27, and has doubled since 1919-20. It was then £22,000,000, and is now £44,000,000. It is a melancholy reflection upon the vanity of human wishes, and the limitations wbicb the Deity imposes on human ambitions, that this sbould have occurred during the regime of the Government of which the present Treasurer is a distinguished member. He assumed office to reduce taxation, and that is the result! The honourable member for Perth has pointed to the consequences of excessive taxation upon industry. I , myself, had the honour of drawing the attention of the Treasurer to that a week or so ago. I quoted the Treasurer's own words to the effect that inevitably industry must be hampered when called upon to pay excessive taxation, because in such circumstances, the f r u c t if y in g stream of capital without which industry cannot bear f r u it abundantly, was diverted from its proper channels. Our present standard of livin g cannot be continued without an abundance of capital. This is true, not only of this country, but of the civilized world, and particularly of that part of it which was engaged in the Great War, and has to bear the heavy burdens wbicb it imposed. We bave evolved a high standard of living, and in order that we shall produce .sufficient, an abundance of capital is necessary. Therefore, anything which diverts capital, the bandmaiden of industry, from its proper uses is inimical to the welfare of the country. So much for that. Now we come to the diagnosis of the honourable member for Perth. He says that the cause of the existing depression, and of the ominous rumblings which fill us with misgivings of failure in industry, is the country's policy of protection. He instanced two or three firms that have closed, or are on the point of closing, dismissing their employees, and sending thousands of men and women; shortly before the festive season of Christmas, to j o in the ranks of the unemployed. It is a bleak outlook for tliose people. But is protection the cause of their misfortunes? According to the honourable member protection is a parasitical growth, and the only proper occupation for us is what be calls primary industry. I do not agree with that. I pointed out my objections at some length last year, so that it is only necessary now to say that the honourable gentleman ignores fundamental facts. His view, which professed to be all-embracing, was confined to one narrow portion of the stage of human - activity. He forgot the age in which he lives. His mind is riveted to the past. There was a time when people believed that the sun went round the earth, and there are some who, so far as their economic opinions are concerned, still maintain a like doctrine. Notwithstanding all proofs to the contrary, some still believe that the world is flat. So the honourable member considers that what is wrong economically is that the world is too highty industrialized, and that the way to political salvation is to follow the ""back to the land"" cry of some new Peter the Hermit. Those who are loudest in their denunciation of the present fiscal system, and eternally urging men to go on the land, almost invariably do it while enjoying the snug comfort of a great city. It is with the utmost reluctance that they bring themselves even so far into the country as Canberra. There was a time when the bulk of the world's population was settled on the land. Will any one say that it was a better time to live in than now? When all were settled on the land, it was because there was no other way in which they could live. The methods of production were so primitive that only by consistent toil, from early morn to dewy eve, could a livelihood be won. That was the agricultural age, the elysium which the honourable member regrets, and to which be bids us return. What he does not recognize is that now we are living in the machine age; that man has wrested from nature her most cherished secrets; that be is now able to produce in one day as much as once took weeks. The bulk of mankind was then' compelled to grow food. But those days have passed and a few can now produce all the food Mr Hughes. that the many require. If most of our people were now to direct their attention to the production of food, as nine-tenths of them were doing even as little as 100 years ago, we should have a glut of primary products, which would prove beyond doubt that farming did not pay. The gamut of men's requirements and demands is limited by their circumstances; it is now immensely extended beyond the limits of a century ago, and is being further extended every day. We now require a thousand things unknown to our ancestors-pianos , motor cars, radios and picture films-and men released from the necessity of producing food are engaged in making them. The honourable member fails to understand that the world as we know it today differs very greatly from the world as it was. He does not understand that society today is a wonderful and complex thing; that wealth is being poured out so lavishly that the life of a poor man is more richly endowed today than was that of a nobleman in the 12th century. It is literally true that - the workers of this country are better off than many in the middle classes in England of today. I am not saying that this is rigbt or that it is wrong. Tbis is not a* court of ethics; we are here to deal with facts. Now it is a fact that the tendency of humanity to congregate in great cities is world-wide. It is not a feature of life in protectionist countries alone, but is more noticeable in the highly civilized countries than in those at a less advanced stage. England is a free trade country. It was once an agricultural country, but it is now dependent for three-fourths of its food requirements on overseas supplies. America has protection. By reason of its circumstances and its vast extent, there is naturally a bigger proportion of its population settled on the land. But that country, in which an ever diminishing proportion of the people is engaged in rural industries, has made itself a force in world politics by means of its great cities and the wealth that has been built up by the very system which the honourable member has denounced. Let us consider also the position of Eussiaan agricultural country. Tliere the people for all practical purposes are where they were 50 or 100 years ago, and probably' where they will be in 100 years to come. It cannot' for one moment be said that their condition is due solely to the new fangled phase of government known as the Soviet system. It was the same under the Czars. The bulk of the population of Russia is settled on the land. The standard of living there is low; the standard of culture, of education, is low. The condition of the people in agricultural Russia and in free trade England will not bear comparison with that of the people of this country. It is clear that protection is not the prime cause of the troubles that exist in Australia. These are. general; they prevail everywhere; even in free trade England, where agriculture is neglected, and in Russia where it is the principal industry. I shall not pretend that protection is a panacea for all industrial ills, or that it is more than a means to an end. But it certainly does afford an energetic, versatile and industrial people an opportunity to express themselves. It affords them a wider sphere for ambition. It gives them an opportunity to exercise that skill that is characteristic of our race. If I were asked what was the immediate cause of our present troubles I should say-apar t from our own sins-the sins of the Government-that it was the effect of the war. In our case, this bas been accentuated by excessive taxation, by the unfavorable balance of trade which has been responsible for pouring into Australia £19,000,000 worth of imports in excess of exports and so depressed the local markets and thrown large numbers of people out of employment. We must add to these excessive borrowing and Government extravagance, both of which have exceeded all previous records-and the violation of the principle which should govern all administration, that those who raise the money should spend it, perhaps the most effective check upon extravagance. Jf one government raises money_ and another spends it, Parliament is helpless. It cannot criticize expenditure, or if it does answer is made that the money has been handed over to another government for purposes that are entirely proper, and that is the end of it. But apart from these things for which we are responsible, the effects of the war overshadow all. It has impoverished the world; we have felt its repercussion in this distant land. Australia suffers because the world is very poor. The honourable member for Perth spoke as though Eng-. land were a paradise. It is not. As thougb low wages were a cure for all economic ends; as if the workers ef this country were indulging in a senseless scramble for high wages without regard to circumstances; and as if , by some hocus pocus or reversal of the natural order of things, the position could be made different if wages were drastically cut down. It is clear be does not understand the position. What is the trouble in England? Last year a long drawn out industrial dispute there, culminated in the greatest industrial crisis in the history of the world. For a few days the industrial and commercial life of Great Britain was brought to a stand-still. What was the cause of that trouble ? The coal-miners, as we know, were asked to work for less than what they thought a fair and reasonable wage. Consequently they went on strike. Protection was not responsible for that. The honourable member for Perth also denounced the Arbitration Court. I remind him that the Arbitration Court bad nothing to do with the industrial upheaval in Great Britain. I am not blaming any one for what happened in the Mother Country. I am merely stating the indisputable fact that it is impossible for the coal mining industry to prosper unless coal can be placed on the surface at a cost below the selling price, whether the policy of the country be protection or free trade. The honourable member does not appreciate the fact that arbitration is not primarily responsible for the industrial unrest that is troubling Australia today. Arbitration deals with effects of industrial unrest; over the basic causes it has no control. America has not set up a system of arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes. Strikes, wben they occur there, the are settled by other methods. In England also there are no industrial courts, but industrial turmoil occurs there from time to time. Arbitration is merely a means of dealing with disputes; if there are no arbitration courts there is no alternative but strikes. I do not pretend that the tariff is without flaw. I question if the Minister would say that it is; every human institution bas its defects; but the duty of this Parliament is to decide what is the best policy for this country. The honourable member for Perth railed against indirect taxation. His remarks in that connection were most disappointing to me. By a process of reasoning entirely his own he showed that it would be possible to get more money for governmentalpurposes from a revenue tariff than from customs duties.",53
171,Mr MANN,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,And the burden on the people would not be so great.,56
172,Mr HUGHES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"All I can say is that, if the high cost of living is due to customs taxation, then the greater the customs revenue the higher must be the cost of living. I do not champion indirect taxation, but think it perbaps a. necessary evil. If the tariff is really effective in protecting our industries it will not bring in . much revenue. The high cost of living in Australia is due to the high standard of living enjoyed by our people. What is remedy? A lower standard of living? What is the matter with the world? Is it too rich, or too poor? Is it not a fact that, if the people of Europe were better off than they are, that is to say, if they now enjoyed the prosperity which was theirs before the war, it would be a very good thing for Australia ? The honourable member for Perth speaks about production. Let me say this to him.: It is a condition precedent to production, that there must be an effective demand. People do not produce merely, for the sake of producing. They produce in order to sell at a profit; if they are to achieve their purpose, there must be buyers. cannot be an effective demand for any commodity unless the people have the means wherewith to purchase it, in the form of money or its equivalent. It follows, therefore, that the greater the effective demand the greater the impetus to production. Australia, with its 6,000,000 people, enjoying a high standard of living, creates a more effective demand for goods than do any other 6,000,000 people in the world, not even excepting the people of America. Certainly the demand they create is greater than any 6,000,000 of people in England or Russia which, according to the argument of the honourable member for Perth, sbould be a paradise, because there practically everybody is on the land-at all events, all but those who have not been put under it by the Soviet Government. To reduce wages is to weaken the mainspring of industry. I fail to see how, by reducing the standard of living we are going to stimulate industry. If it were possible to raise the people of all countries to our own - standard of living, that, perhaps, would be a great step towords the peace of the world, and certainly towards the happiness and prosperity . of mankind. The most effective way to stimulate production is to create the demand. Production does spring, ab initio, out of nothing. It starts in response to a demand. Taking industry by and large, we can lay it down as a sound axiom that an effective demand is a condition precedent to production and an effective demand amongst the great the mass of the people is measured by their wages, and what those wages will buy. I say emphatically that, no matter what, may be the cost of living in Australia, the wages of the working man here are higher and his conditions are better than in any other country, not even excepting America. The honourable member cannot, on a quiet review of the position, convince members of this Parliament, or any one else, that there is any practical alternative to our present fiscal policy. If the 6,000,000 of people in Australia turn their .backs on what has rightly come to be regarded as the national policy of this country, what would be the position? It is customary for some people to speak of There Australia as if it were under a ban, and avoided by other countries as thougb smitten with a plague. Yet no other country bas advanced in population and wealth so rapidly during the last 25 years. And it has achieved its present remarkable position under a policy of protection. I do not deny that there are defects in our fiscaTsystem. All I say is that it is impossible to attain perfection under any system. It is easy, of course, to criticize the tariff, and say that here and there there are faults in it. I do not deny that instances of this can be cited. All I say is that taken by and large it is the best policy for this country. Tliere is no sucb thing as a perfect policy. But I point out to the honourable member for Perth that he has not been able to show us one progressive country that has not the policy of protection. It is perfectly true that England adopted free trade, and that it served her well for a time, but that many industries would not do better under protection is now the conviction of many of ber leading men. ""We all admire the splendid character of the British. ""We realise that Great Britain is staggering under a colossal burden, and we wish most devoutly that her' conditions wer': better than they are. In the position of England, unhappily there is not much to give satisfaction. The honourable membe' 1 for Perth said nothing at all about the dole. Is that a mark of free trade? Is that one of the blessings of the free trade policy? At least we have not that in Australia. As regards the tariff alterations posed by the Minister. I shall at this content, myself with mentioning three great industries which seem to be in a serious, if not a parlous state. One these is the great iron and steel industry - the basic industry of all. It depends war. no doubt upon coal, but coal, iron, and steel, grouped together, may fairly be regarded as symbolic of the machine age. The Tariff Board in its admirable report has dealt with this industry length and a perusal of that report should satisfy anybody in this country that whatever may bave been said about inefficiency, such a charge cannot be at the door of the great industry instiworks. tuted by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, Hoskins', and other firms enI gaged in the manufacture of iron and a steel. It is very necessary that this should be emphasized. The Tariff Board in its report saysThat the company can fairly claim to faithfully laid the foundation stone of mighty industry, that the organization is good and the expenditure of capital has only made after careful consideration of the expressed opinion of.highly trained experts, and that wherever possible labour saving devices have been installed, giving a maximum output with a minimum of effect, and that it is the equal of any amongst its overseas competitors. The industry generally in all its ramifications directly employs close on 12,000 persons. If we are to accept the Tariff Board's opinion, we must realise, however, that it is in a most unsatisfactory position. The report says, "" The prospect is soniewbat ominious to Australia, and calls for very serious consideration."" It must not be thought that because I bave singled out the basic operations of the iron and steel industry that I think the efforts of the committee should be directed entirely to the raw material out of which machinery and other iron and steel goods are made. But this is a basic industry, in which an enormous amount of capital has been sunk. Those engaged in it bave by their efforts done, and are doing, everything to ensure efficiency. The enterprise is enormously important to the country. It is impossible that Australia can come into its own unless upon the basis of an up-to-date and comprehensive iron and steel industry, which shall serve proour purposes in peace and war. No stage community can call itself a nation unless it has, at its disposal and under very its control, the means of carrying on of operations to serve its purposes in time of peace and to defend itself in time of I come now to the textile industry, which is typically Australian. Its relation to primary industries is direct and obvious; but, unfortunately, it is now in at a most unsatisfactory state. We read a fortnight ago that the works at Marrickville bad put off one shift, and last week that Messrs. Bond and Company laid bad been compelled to close down their Whether that firm will be able to carry on in some reconstructed form cannot say. At any rate, it has reached crisis. If any enterprises are entitled to point consideration, surely it is those that minister directly to.the primary industries of Australia. They go hand in hand with each other. Wool-growing is our greatest hare staple industry, and the textile industry a is a natural development of wool producbeen tion. Then there is cotton. We have done muck to encourage the growth of cotton, and there is no reason at all why Australia should not become a great cotton-producing country. These industries ought to flourish; but they are in a depressed state. I am not suggesting for one moment that there may not be causes other than the lack of more adequate tariff protection for the failure of Messrs. Bond and Company. I know nothing at all about the circumstances of this firm, but I say that it has done thing that an enterprising firm can do to build up the textile industry. It is in a bad way. Two thousand five hundred of its employees have been dismissed. Whether they will be re-employed I do not know. There remains the timber industry. This is also a typical Australian industry. It came to my knowledge the other day that oregon can be bought today in Sydney at a price nearly one half of that which ruled a year or so ago, and other soft timbers are being dumped upon our market at prices which make competition impossible. Tbis has demoralized the timber industry of Australia. This is one of our native industries, and sbould be encouraged. If we 'ever wake up sufficiently to the enormous importance of re-afforestation and the vast potentialities of timber-growing as a crop, I venture to say that the industry will become one of the greatest in Australia.' It is now so seriously menaced that, unless something is done, thousands of men will be thrown out of employment. The tariff schedule proposes to deal with those three industries, and, of course, many others, by raising duties and in other ways. We can discuss each item on its merits wben it comes before us; but as a general principle I take exception altogether to the Minister's method of dealing with the reports of the Tariff Board. Tbat board was established for a definite purpose, to deal with certain conditions about which there had been considerable complaint. This Parliament is necessarily not the best fitted institution to make inquiries into the circumstances of industry. We, who believe in protection and are not ashamed to advocate it whole-heartedly, are, nevertheless, reluctant to see assistance given where it is not deserved, and the Tariff Mr Bughes. Board was established in order to make diligent inquiries in no partisan spirit, and to make recommendations for the guidance of Parliament. The board has no interests at stake, no axe to grind. It is not affected by political bias. That was the reason for the introduction of the measure under which it was appointed. In my opinion, it was never intended, wben that bill was introduced, that the every- Minister should alter the recommendations of the board before they were introduced into this Parliament. This committee was to be the final tribunal. If we thought that the board had not dealt adequately with any industry it was for us to express our opinion and do what we thought was necessary. . And in this committee the Minister for Trade and Customs could ask us to fix the rates of duties higher than were recommended by the board if , in his opinion, they were not high enough. In my opinion, the proper course to pursue is for the Minister to bring down a schedule as recommended by the Tariff Board. If he thinks that the duties ought to be higher, he can move to increase them. It is then competent for honourable members, if they agree with the Minister, to raise the duties; but once the Minister has submitted a schedule of duties, honourable members are not in a position to increase any item in it. As it is now, if the Minister bas reduced the rates recommended by the Tariff Board, it is impossible for us to move to raise tbem. That is not fair to the committee. In one set of items in the schedule before us, the Minister has reduced the duties below the rates recommended by the Tariff Board. In another case the rates in the schedule are higher than those recommended by the board. We do not want that. We want the recommendations of the board, and then we can bear what the Minister has to say, and come to a decision. I am nol criticizing the Minister in any adverse spirit, but, in my opinion, he ought not to bave acted in this way. Those who believe in a protective policy are always willing to listen to anything that can be said from any quarter, especially from the Minister, wbo must be in a position to give us information. But as things are now, what are Ave to do when we are considering, say, a duty of 25s. and the Tariff Board has recommended 30s.? We are not allowed to move to increase the rate, and, therefore, can do nothing hut indulge in arid discussion. Of course, we can move to reduce rates; but that is nothing new; we have always had the right to do this. The intention of Parliament in creating a Tariff Board was that the board should supply it with a basis upon which it could actrecommendations arrived at after the most careful inquiries Avithout bias and unaffected by any political consideration. The board's reports which I have perused SIIOAV abundant evidence of the most careful inquiry. I do not agree with all the board has recommended, but no one can 1 say that it is not carrying out its Avork in an admirable Avay. It Would be far better if the Minister Would give us an opportunity to discuss the tariff on the basis of the Tariff Board's recommendations; if he did not agree Will those recommendations Ave' could bear his opinions and choose between them and the recommendations of the board. I am pleased that this amended schedule has been submitted and I shall give the Minister general support. I shall not commit myself in any Avay to support eAery item. It is our duty to exercise the most diligent and careful scrutiny over the industries that are protected, so that we may get full value for our money. Those industries that are not efficient-ther e are some of them-inflic t a grieAous r wrong on Australia and on other industries that would be a credit to any country in the Avorld. For that reason Ave ought not to support by our votes and our influence industries which the Tariff Board has pointed out are not efficient. The Minister knoAVs very Avell that one industry Avas distinctly referred to as not being efficient. We ought to be told what that industry is. The Minister has no business to withhold that information from the committee. It was given by the board for a definite purpose.  me.",56
173,Mr HUGHES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"I hope the Minister Avill agree that if the information was given to him, as I am led to believe it has been, it is his duty to divulge it to Parliament. Does the Minister agree Will that?  ditions under which the information was giA^en.  A-ieAv of the report of the Tariff Board, the existing unemployment, the country's adverse trade balance and the general admission that the tariff has failed, I feel like confining my remarks on this debate to one sentence, "" I told you so,"" and to the simple question, "" What are you going to do about it?"" The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) has given a constructive and intelligent address on the present situation, but the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) has simply floundered from ' pillar to post making references to Russia and other countries, and not offering one constructive suggestion to remedy our present economic position. One Avas entitled to expect from a gentleman of his experience some constructive suggestion; but although he endeavoured to make the committee feel that Avhat he was saying Avas of constructive value, he failed to put forward any practical suggestion. He has advised us to consider the facts. Let us have a glance at r the facts. I was in this Parliament wben the Massey Greene tariff was introduced. We were assured that it Would decrease importations and build up a market for the primary producers of Australia; that it would not affect primary production; and that as the result of it there Would be no unemployed in Australia. Of course, I did not believe that sucb results Would folloAV the imposition of that, which was then the highest tariff that bad been tabled in the Commonwealth Parliament, and I claim today that the results, have been exactly the opposite of those which were predicted by the then Minister. We. have had an increase in importations. The real effect of the tariff has been to decrease our exportations, increase our unemployment, and bring about an adverse trade balance. If that tariff had done for Australia Avhat its supporters claimed it would do, there would have been little or no importation of goods and consequently little customs revenue. We are advised that because other countries have their tariffs, we, too, must have one. It is not sumcient to tell any thinking man that in the United States of America there is operating a high tariff without pointing to the other - conditions which exist in America. The 'two countries, America and Australia, - are not alike. For instance, wages in America are based on results, whereas in Australia our wages are based on the cost of living. We have an Arbitration Court which merely assesses the cost of living in order tofixrates of wages. It is not an arbitration court; it is simply an assessing court. A proper arbitration court would take into consideration the special circumstances of an industry. It would ask, "" If the industry pays so much wages, what will be left to the manufacturer? How can he sell his goods to the community?"" All tbese things ought to be taken into consideration. When we claim that Australia must show a white country's efficiency in order to maintain its White Australia policy, we are told that we are advocates of black labour. As a matter of fact, honourable members must know that it is not black countries but the white countries that are our competitors. Honourable members who are great protectionists are also great believers in the Tariff Board. Tbey have in the past stated their willingness to accept every recommendation made by it ; but I want to know whether they are willing to abide by one strong recommendation made by the board which calls for attention. Perhaps in their perusal of the annual report of the board they have taken to heart the following paragraph:It is the profound desire of the hoard that this aspect of Australian industry should be considered without imparting into the inatter political consideration and charging the board with any particular bias. The situation is too critical to waste time on such trumpedup charges and calls for the serious consideration of all parties, classes, and individuals in the Commonwealth, otherwise as the board has previously said, it can see nothing but disaster ahead.",59
174,Mr FENTON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"To what is the board referring?  member seems to be ignorant of the contents of the board's report, I shall road the whole of the paragraph. It statesTHE ABUSE OF PROTECTION. Industrial Unions. Th* boiird regrets being compelled to place on record its conclusions, arrived at after the most intimate touch with all phases of industry within the Commonwealth, that there is a prevailing tendency which is calculated to abuse the protective system, and by forcing the pace 'under disadvantageous conditions to actually endanger the efficacy of the system. This tendency is not confined to one section alone, but is .common tn the industrial unions, the secondary producers and the primary producers of the Commonwealth. It is proposed to deal later with each group separately and to justify this far-reaching assertion. The board is profoundly convinced that if Australian industry is to lie maintained and safeguarded, it is absolutely essential that the leaders of industrial unions should recognize this serious menace of rising costs of production which the board has indicated. The board wishes it to be understood that it is not desirous of taking any side in the industrial disputes within the Couunonwealth, but it cannot be blind to the fact that simultaneously with the board being asked to consider large increases in duties on such important industries as timber, engineering, iron and steel, = brushware, copper (bonus), butter and cheese, glassware, clothing,. textiles, with the object of enabling such industries to exist, applications had been lodged and Arbitration Courts - Federal and State-ha d been, and. were; being asked to grant not only increased wages but further improved' conditions and shorter hours, and State Governments were introducing legislation at the time which further added to the already high cost of production. It must be borne in mind that evidence ar. the public inquiries revealed the fact that all tliese and otlier industries were in jeopardy, that some of those engaged as proprietors were threatened with ruin, and that unemployment was Serious. Then follows the portion I have already quoted. Perhaps that is clear to the honourable member for Maribyrnong. On several occasions I bave pointed out that there are two great combines-the manufacturers and the unions which represent the employees-shelterin g behind the tariff walls built up by this Parliament. As the Tariff Board distinctly states, these two bodies have at the expense of the consumer, and the primary producers, abused the protection afforded to tbem. Tbat is the phase of the question we should study if the Government's tariff's proposals are to be properly considered. The right honourable member for North Sydney spoke of our standard of living. A man who has much capital and chooses to live on it, can have a lively time for a short while; but this nation is living on its capital, ancl a nation or an individual that is living on his capital has not much to boast about. Nations, like the average' individual, sbould live on earnings, not on capital. information of the committee I wish to read the following extract from Circular Read Chronicle of Tasmania, in which there is a good deal of common senseHas Australia for tlic last 27 years been engaged in a great fight between her right hand and the left ? Tho Minister for Trade and  has some warrant for his opinion. inception at the beginning of the century, now more than a quarter gone, the Australian Parliament has devoted more time to the tariff than to anything else. We have been passing real tariffs ever since, and each time the same tiling has happened. Imports instead of decreasing, have increased.  duce a real tariff, and we gave him a free hand, just let him do as he liked without any discussion in Parliament or anything of the kind, though there is a sort of understanding that there is to be one some day. And yet Mr. I'ratten is faced with the same old astounding result; imports are increasing faster since his new tariff than over they did before, which is  As u result of the scratching he has come to the conclusion that our borrowing habit is to blame. The only thing to which the Commonwealth Parliament has devoted more energy than passing tariffs is borrowing money. Now  three forms in which the money we borrow can come to Australia; gold, securities, and goods. Cold and securities we export, so they can be left out of the calculation. So, by u good deal of head scratching a really clever man can see that when we borrow money from England we must take it in goods (bar what stays in England to pay interest on what we have borrowed before).  indignantly what is the earthly use of his passing tariffs to keep goods out of Australia, when his colleague, Dr Earle Page, the Treasurer, (Ioats loans at a still greater rate to force them to come in? Dr Earle Page will no doubt ask-the free trade newspapers are already asking it for him-wha t is the earthly use of his borrowing money to develop Aus crease the cost of goods which Dr Earle Page is introducing to develop her with? Wc may take it that Dr Earle Page is Aus and that they are engaged in a great battle.  plaintively, "" when the riglit hand, who is stronger than I , keeps hitting back? There is no sense in it . "" Neither he nor Dr Earle Page nor anybody else seems to think that the only sensible thing for Australia to do would be to give up fighting herself-that is to say, give up borrowing money and increasing tariffsand sot to work producing wealth with both hands instead. That is good advice. The Australian workmen would be entitled to the wages For the they are now receiving if their production leaves a margin sufficiently large to enable industry to be properly carried on. The American manufacturers pay wages as high as, and in many cases higher than the wages we pay, and yet we bave to set up against tbem items in our tariff ranging from 20 per cent, to 60 per cent. Their goods Since its are produced, not by black, but by efficient white labour, ancl with the use of up-todate machinery. I have shown honourable members that the American manufacturer buys in the same market that we do his raw material for the manufacture of rubber tyres, and can sell a small Ford tire f.o.b. New York for £1 5s. 6d., while we require a duty of £1 10s. 7d. on it entering Australia. That is tantamount to a declaration of our inefficiency. Does Australia benefit from the manufacture of tires in Melbourne or Sydney? No. The transport of this country has to pay for it. Our production is handicapped because of the costliness of everything that runs on wheels. Instances similar to this could be multiplied. No person objects to Australians being paid good wages so long as they earn them, but until we adopt the basis of fixing wages according to the principle of productive value, we shall not be on firm ground. On the basis of the cost of living it would be possible to put Australia in an insular position. ""As the article which I have read points out, a greater amount of time has been spent by this Parliament in considering revisions of the tariff than on any other subject. What does it all mean ^ Australia? We have had a drought, and our exports will decline still further than they have already declined, and our adverse balance is estimated this year to be betweei. £40,000,000 and £50,000,000. What can be done by our secondary industries to meet the situation with which we shall be faced? Will they be responsible for the introduction of any more wealth ? Not a penny. During this year it will be made apparent that they - have so far been carried on the back of primary productions. It is not to be' wondered at that there has been a slackening in our exports. Honourable members cannot dispute that fact. A list of Australia's exports for* the year 1926-27, which has been compiled from Commonwealth official statistics and issued by the Town and Country Union of New South Wales, shows that the value of the exports of primary production was £144,775,511, and that that of all exports, apart from primary production, was only £10,168,293. Who provides the money which makes it possible for emplyoment to the found for those who produce that £10,168,293 worth of goods? The primary producer. The State of Western Australia has been struggling under a great hardship in that she bas bad to buy in the clearest market, and sell her produce in open competition with every other nation. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) on more than one occasion bas declared his commercial faith in the following terms: "" We want to buy in the cheapest and sell in the dearest market."" He said once that we ought to pray for a rise in the prices of the goods that we bad to sell, and for cheapness in those that we needed to buy. The day of reckoning is close at hand. Last year Western Australia purchased from the eastern States goods to the value of £9,000,000, while those States bought from her to the value of only £1,500,000. The adverse balance against her was, therefore, £7,500,000. Out of that £9,000,000, if allowed to buy in the cheapest market, she would bave saved at least £2,500,000 for developmental purposes. Personally, I do not wish to see the establishment of factories in Western Australia under the conditions in which they are maintained in the eastern States. They are an incubus on the country. Western Australia was prevented from having factories by the eastern States manufacturers. It proved to be one of the best blessings that could possibly bave beeu bestowed, although it was not the result any good intention on the part of the eastern States-because it forced ber people on to the land to produce real wealth that would maintain and feed her people, and export her surplus, bringing new capital into the State. If that and every other State had failed to have a yield this year, who would have paid for Australia's costly manufactures; and whence would have  come the money necessary to meet our interest bill and other obligations?. Factories would have closed down rigbt and left. The right honourable member for North Sydney said that England lives almost entirely on her manufactures. Quite so. Mauritius lives almost entirely on ber production of sugar, aud F i j i formerly occupied a similar position in relation to ber banana industry. Can Australia expect to live on her manufactures? She cannot produce for ber own needs without hobbling and handicapping her own people. Primary production could be made Australia's emancipation. The world will not take our manufactured goods because the cost of production is too great. But we could treble the output of our primary products, which we can sell, if they were not handicapped in order to foster secondary industries.",60
175,Mr FENTON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"If there were no local secondary industries we should not be able to purchase our goods as cheaply as we do now. The importer would raise the prices of those goods just as he did previously.  saddled with these exotic industries; or, as the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Mann) bas said, if we bad only a few-, sucb as munitions supply and others that are necessary to the defence of Australia, our potential wealth is sucb that there would not be any rise in the cost of living. A revenue tariff, of course, is necessary. A vicious circle has been created. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) has advised those primary producers wbo are not already there to get into that vicious circle so as to make it complete. What would happen if they did?",62
176,Mr FENTON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"The primary producer is in it to a big extent.  into it by the burdens which have been of placed upon bim. Common justice demands the policy which the Treasurer suggested, but statemansbip repudiates it. The primary producer has as much right to receive bounties and tariff protection as has any other section.",62
177,Mr YATES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"He does get them when he wants them.  ary, industries are in no sense comparable with the non-exporting secondary or primary industries. You cannot protect export industries, but they must bear the cost of the protection of other industries. Honourable members, however, will continue this' blind orgy of meddle and muddle, disregarding the warnings of even their precious Tariff Board, and ignoring economic facts, until Australia is compelled to walk a much harder road than that on which it is travelling now. This country's resources will enable it to stand up to a great deal, but unless we are prepared to base payments upon results, we shall be unable to meet our obligations. The right honourable member for North Sydney spoke of the high standards of do? living enjoyed by almost every individual in the community. Burdensome tariff duties have been in operation mostly since the war, and during that period Australia enjoyed an apparent prosperity. Our people bave been spending easy money that came to them in various ways-the high prices of our wool and wheat during the war, the subsequent distribution of the accumulated profits of the wool and wheat pools, the back pay drawn by the soldiers, the war gratuity, and heavy expenditure upon war service homes. All these extraordinary disbursements bave created an evanescent prosperity; we have been "" kidding"" ourselves that we have been making money and spending income. No Parliament bas power to maintain the prices of wool and wheat, the two commodities from which the income of the nation is mainly derived. The primary producers are obliged to accept the world's market price for their produce, and upon the proceeds from this source our credit abroad is based. The burden that the export industries can carry is limited. It would not matter if only a few industries were being protected; but when every factory has to be bolstered up with high duties, it is impossible for the primary producers, wbo bave to sell their surplus in the markets of the world, to carry the burden ancl pay interest on £1,000,000,000 of debt. I appeal to members of the committee to put aside their shibboleths and do some serious thinking on this problem. It is idle to answer me by saying that I want to see a black Australia. I want Australia to remain white, and if the workmen were advised differently this country could become a paradise for the white worker. Let a minimum wage be prescribed if necessary, but pay every many according to results so that each may, according to his physical and men. tal powers, earn as much as he can. Every man's labour should show a profit, and the country should get something from his services.",62
178,Mr YATES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"And what would the great honourable member do with the old men? After they had made a profit, would the honourable member send them to the graveyard as the Americans are said to  efficiency has been often referred to during this debate. The American community puts this argument to the working manTlie more you produce per man the more there is to divide per family-that is our philosophy. Wages, dividends, and profits are up, and costs are down. The increase in the use of machinery has not meant unemployment. When a magnetic crane handled by two men began doing the work done the day previously by 128 men, it did not mean that 12G men were discharged. That view is the reverse of that which is taken in Australia. Our working man thinks that if the hours of labour are reduced there will be more work available and less unemployment. No greater fallacy was ever conceived by thinking men. The greater the production, the greater the employment. I bave said before that if we want to go forward, we must first step backward, as it is often necessary to pull down in order to build up. If the incomes of all of us, whether from wages or profits, were reduced by 33$ per cent., there would be no unemployment in this country, we would be able to sell our manufactured goods abroadand develop our primary industries. The 66$ per cent, would buy as much as the 100 per cent, buys today, because the purchasing power of money would be greater. Of course, I am asked where this policy of reduction is to commence. My answer is that if our heads do not prompt us to make a start, our stomachs will'later on. It is all very well to boast of our standard of living, but of what advantage is it to us, if our secondary industries cannot compete with those of other countries, i are able to maintain only a limited population, and cannot settle more migrants on the land? The Australian people must abandon some of their impracticable and uneconomic ideals and face the facts. have never advocated that this country sbould dispense with its secondary industries; they should flourish equally with the primary industries, but the latter maintain our people; they get no protection and bear the load of protection given to other industries. Our secondary industries have, in their distance from the old world, a natural protection that ought to be sufficient. The water freight ought to be a distinct protection to Australian manufacturers.",63
179,Mr YATES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"Is that not overcome by mass production in the other parts of the world? The honourable member knows it is?  what the honourable member says. ""We have a lot of tiddly-winking little factories doing work here that could be better done by a less number of large ones. 'We should also practice mass production.",64
180,Mr YATES,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"'The honourable member sbould not talk about restricting the number of factories. That would restrict the distribution, of profits.  ber's attitude is un-Australian. What is protection to secondary industries is a burden on primary industry. He must carry his products to the market further than other competitors. Why should the secondary manufacturer be given protection at the expense of the man wbo goes on the land, and. endures the labour of clearing, burning off, ploughing and growing crops? This excessive protection is the cause of the present centralization in the big cities, and that is bad. We find that the worker in the city, who after all is being paid from the products of the land, votes for the continuance of protection because it is the immediate means of providing him with his wages. He approaches the Arbitration Court and asks for higher wages. He proves that the cost of living has gone up, and so be receives his increase. When wages go up the manufacf we turer goes to his faithful friend, the Minister for Customs; and obtains just as much extra protection as he needs to meet the increased wages. Who pays for this, if not the primary producer? The farmer is not only saddled with the duty I on machinery, which appears striking because it is most obvious, but protection also imposes many other extra charges upon him. He bas to pay a higher railway freight because the railway workers demand higher wages, and he has to pay more to his employee because the latter has to buy dearer clothes. Thus it has gone on until we have an adverse balance this year of £19,000,000. The farmer has not been, able to keep up the volume of exports because tbese burdens bave been against bim, and secondary industries bave not been able to make good this loss. I ask honourable members to consider in what lies the real interest of Australia-tli e fostering and developing of these exotic industries that are penalizing a young country like this, or the development of those industries the products of which we are able to sell overseas ? The subjects of immigration and population are very important, and 1 say as a man who was born and bred on (he land, who has always been interested in it, and wbo knows what it is to make a liviug on it, that it is futile to expect people to come from the Old Country and eke out a living on the land under the conditions which we have set up in Australia. The high standard of living that has been spoken of is forcing up the cost of production to such a level that we cannot find a market for our products. It is unreasonable to take up, as we have done, the attitude that we should set up a high wall of protection against anything we would buy from other countries and then expect those other countries to give us a free port for our products. We are running the risk of incurring reprisals. I am in sympathy with all reductions in the tariff, and I am going to vote against any increases in it, but there is one item I would like the Minister to examine very closely before it is brought intoeffect, and that is the duty on coffee. A great deal of coffee comes to Australia from the Dutch East Indies. The imposition of a duty on this article will be a further heavy blow to Western Australia. The Dutch East Indies constitute an important natural market for the products of Western Australia. The people there are buying our flour, wheat, fruit, and potatoes; they are helping our immigrants to live on the land, and they are giving us a free port for our products. The Dutch people are giving consideration to the adoption of reprisals by way of duties on our goods. A similar thing happened when we put the embargo on the importation of bananas from F i j i . We lost the trade with those islands, and it has now gone to New Zealand or somewhere else. It is unreasonable to think that a country will continue to give us free ports for our goods, while we practically close our ports against them. If we are going to consult our best interests, we should be very care ful before we close our ports. The people of other countries are not asleep, and when Ave take action against them, Ave can expect them to take action against us.  people do not forget that their tea and to create others. kapok is coming in free.  that, but I Would like honourable to give some thought to the subject of trade relations. The Dutch people Avere terribly incensed Avhen Ave imposed of Ss. i d . a central on bananas for the of protecting a feAv bunchy-top bananas grown in the North. We in Western tralia were glad to make some reciprocal arrangement Will the people in the Dutch East Indies, but the CommonAvealth vernment by its action is taking that portunity away from us. This schedule, if agreed to, Avill give another blow trade in Western Australia, and I hope the House Avill give much consideration the matter before offence is given to these people Avho are good customers. It is sufficient that I and a feAv other memmantle bers in this House are able to at rates say, "" I told you so."" This scheme high protection bas utterly failed, unless AVC retrace our .steps, the country will be plunged into further difficulties. Mr D. CAMERON .(Brisbane) [10.40]. - I should like to refer briefly to anomaly in the customs laAV which Avas brought forcibly home to those affected when the amended schedule Avas laid on the table on the 24th November. On that day two OAerseas vessels, the Oronsay and T the Anchises, had discharged the Avhole ol their cargo, Will the exception of that consigned to the port of Brisbane, at the old rates; but the cargo consigned to Brisbane Avas dutiable at the new rates of duty. Thus the importers of Queensland alone Avere called upon to pay at the amended rates. This is an old story- a long-standing complaint-bu t I make no apology for bringing it before the committee again. Becently I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs Avhether a decision had been arrived at Will reference to the strong recommendations that bad been made for uniformity, by an amendment of the Customs Act, to enable imports to be made dutiable at the rate existing on the day of the A'essel's arrival at the first port of call in Australia. The. Minister stated that the representations made bad received careful and sympathetic consideration; that the matter had several complications and that the action desired would remoA'e one set of anomalies only",64
181,Mr JACKSON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,Did the Minister menmembers tion any of those anomalies?,65
182,Mr CAMEBON,AUSTEALIAN MATCH,"He mentioned some of them. It Would, he added, cause a duty the utmost confusion to all consake cerned at the time of tariff revision and be extremely difficult from the administraAustive point of vieAv. Goods in bond at the time of tariff alterations could be cleared at any future time at the old Gorates. If goods in bond Avere excluded opit Would mean differential treatment between bonded and other goods. Similar to goods would be landing at a port at the same time and paying different rates of to duty. . I understood the Minister to refer to the possibility under the proposed not amendment of a vessel arriving at. Frewith cargo dutiable for all ports existing on the date of its arrival of and reaching Melbourne on the same day and as a vessel making Melbourne its first port of. call. BetAveen the departure of the first vessel from Fremantle and its arrival at Melbourne a new tariff schedule an bad been introduced. Obviously the same cargo on these two vessels ""would be subduty ject to different rates of duty. At moment sucb an anomaly exists in connection with the same cargo on one 1901-1925 vessel. In the case of tariff reductions, vided everything then in Australian waters would bave to pay the higher duty in was spite of the reduction in the tariff. This objection, I would point out, does not on command serious consideration, as reducbe tions in tariff do not come into force until passed by Parliament. at any time a by-law was made which at reduced the duty, and such by-laws were frequent, nothing already in Australian waters at the time could obtain the benefit of the by-law. Personally, If a i entirely to understand this particular tention of the Minister. The Chambers Commerce of Australia, said the MinisThe ter, were not unanimous as to the advisbrought ability of the proposed change, and it had been suggested by one important chamber that the matter needed further deliberation. Under all these circumstances it was not proposed to take any action at present in the direction mentioned. This question has been raised from discussed time to time since the introduction of the first federal tariff. Those who urged the amendment maintain that they are seeking for adherence to various tions of the Constitution: Section 88 propressed videsUniform duties of customs shall be imposed within two years after the establishment the Commonwealth. Section 92 statesOn the imposition of uniform duties customs, trade, commerce and intercourse among the States . . . . shall be absolutely free. Section 99 provides that The Commonwealth shall not . . . . give preference to one State or any part of over another State . . . . At the 22nd annual conference of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, held in 1926,. the following resolution was passed:Tliat it be a recommendation to the Commonwealth Parliament that the Customs Act be amended to provide that as soon as an overseas vessel has arrived and reported to the customs at its first plaee of call, the rate Mr Cameron. enforced on that date shall be the legal rate for the whole of the ship's cargo, and that the the Customs Aet be amended as follows:Amend section 132 of the Customs Act to read- "" Except as otherwise proin this act all import duties shall be paid at the rate in force when the ship, boat, or aircraft by which the goods were imported reported at the ship's, boat's, or aircraft's first place of call in Australia on the voyage which the goods were brought to Australia."" ""As to goods imported by post, duty shall paid at the rate in force on the date the ship, boat or aircraft carrying the mail in When which the goods were contained was reported the ship's, boat's, or aircraft's first place of call in Australia."" Tbis resolution was carried unanimously. The Prime Minister, before proceeding l to Britain to attend the last Imperial conconference in 1926, visited Queensland and of addressed the Chamber of Commerce. question of uniform duties was ' up'. The Prime Minister expressed sympathy, and advised the members of the Brisbane Chamber to seek an amendment of the Customs Act, as only by so doing could they secure the relief desired. On the 12th January of this year I in troduced a deputation from the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce to the Minister  Brisbane. This matter was again at great length. Disappointment was expressed that the Gohave vernment had apparently ignored the representations of the Associated Chamsecbers of Commerce of Australia as exi n the resolution passed at the annual conference held in Sydney in 1926. The Minister, in replying to the deputaof tion, referred to the question of uniform duties as an old sore. So old, in fact, that, to use his own words, it had grown whiskers. He reminded the of deputation, also, that there were two, points involved-the constitutional aspect and the question of departmental administration. He expressed the opinion that the associated Chambers should get some interpretation of the legal position therewith regard to uniformit y of duties, and gave an assurance that he would, upon his return to Melbourne, refer the whole matter to the Crown law authorities. At the 23rd annual conference of the Associated Chamber of Commerce of Australia held at Perth last March, the f o l lowing resolution was carried:1. (o) In the opinion of this conference the of customs regulations resulting in varying charges for duty against the same cargo in the same vessels operate harshly as between State unci State. (6) it is desirable that counsel's opinion be taken as to the wisdom and practicability' of nuiking alterations in the Customs Act to enable the same incidence of duties on all ourgo discharged at all Australian ports ex the same vessel. The opinion of Mr .T. S. O'Halloran KC, was obtainod. He concluded that there was nothing in the constitution to prevent an alteration of section 132 of the Customs Act in such a way as to give eifect to the desire of the Associated Chambers of Commerce. The opinion of counsel was referred to the Chambers of Commerce in the capital cities. The Sydney chamber considers that there is full justification for pressing.the Commonwealth Government to bave the necessary alteration made in the Customs Act. The Melbourne chamber is of the opinion that many difficulties are in the way of carrying out the resolution, and suggests that as the matter iB of such importance, it will be better to defer taking action with the Government until after the next conference. This would give - the various chambers an opportunity to consider it fully, and delegates to the conference would be able to discuss it with full knowledge of the views of their respective chambers. The Brisbane chamber presumes the matter will be proceeded with by submitting the resolution and copy of counsel's opinion to the Minister, and, if the opinion of the Crown Law officers coincides with it, an alteration to the Customs Act in the direction desired would relieve the State of a very great disadvantage under which it has been suffering. The Adelaide chamber considers that the present is not an opportune time to approach the Federal Government with a request to amend section 132 of the Customs Act. Perth chamber reconfirms its support of the resolution, while the Hobart chamber holds that the Minister should be asked to reconsider the position in the light of counsel's opinion, and consult with the Federal Attorney-Goneral. The position now is that the Attorney-General agrees with Mr O'Halloran's view that there .is no constitutional objection to the making of the change desired by the associated chambers. The constitutional objection which has been raised so often' is wiped away. To my mind, the existing practice with regard to the incidence of the tariff taxation is unconstitutional. The Miuister maintains, however, that new anomalies would arise and the administrative difficulties of the department would, be greatly increased if the proposed amendment to section 132 of the Customs Act were made. No doubt 'the matter will be reintroduced at the next conference of the Associated Chambers to be held at Hobart earl) next year. I sbould like to have the Minister's assurance that the fullest consideration will be given to the resolutions passed at both the twenty-second and twenty-third annual meetings of the Associated Chambers in conjunction with the opinion given by Mr O'Halloran and confirmed by the Attorney-General, and that the Minister will communicate with the President of the Associated Chambers of Australia without delay. I would also ask that details be given of the administrative difficulties and fresh anomalies which the Minister affirms would arise if the suggested amendment were made in the Customs Act. This will enable the conference to arrive at a definite and final conclusion. I feel sure that the Government realizes that full and sympathetic consideration should be given to the requests of the conference, representative as it will be, of the commercial life of the nation. I do not intend to refer in detail to the tariff schedule, but I should like to read oue letter that I have received from the chairman of directors of a firm of structural steel contractors, engineers and iron-founders, of Brisbane. It is dated 1st December, 1927, and readsWe have taken the personal opportunity of wiring you as follow:Extra tariff steel not justified; will dol ay building progress in Queensland. You know already delays automatic exchange. The above wire, as you will understand, is in relation to the increase from 48a. to 70s. per ton on steel structural sections, which is in our own, and the ironmasters' opinion, a severe set back to Australia, and Queensland in particular. We would be the last to turn down Australian muaufactiied goods, - but in this vase we appeal for a fair deal for Queensland employers and employees, which appeal is indeed applicable to the whole of Australia, from the writer's own personal 'knowledge, having just returned from a visit to - Sydney and Melbourne. The Broken Hill Proprietary cannot supply the demand for structural steel, and it is, 'therefore, tmfair to (five further protection, at least until they give - evidence of becoming more efficient. As an instance, we would state, that it took tliem some eight months to supply us with S00 tons of steel for a contract, which we could have obtained from GTeat Britain in three months in one ship. That they cannot supply the demand, is also proved by the - stocks which they hold on hand, and which a fortnight ago, did not equal by half the amount - of our own stock, and we arc only a small firm. We have tried for Australian rolled sections on every occasion before placing any orders, and in the majority of cases, the delivery has been double what could be obtained elsewhere, and in one cose we were notified that uo orders for Queensland could be accepted. The present situation is such, that the extra tariff will make the importation of steel prohibitive, and as the demand cannot be supplied in Australia, we would ask, what are we to do with our employees? We have laid ourselves out for the specialization of structural steel work, and consider that our appeal should have somo consideration, otherwise we say emphatically thut this trade is doomed, and as the particular class of machinery used cannot be adapted for any other purpose, we must go out of existence. We earnestly appeal to you to usi> every endeavour tn right matters, when we can look forward with confidence to the future. I particularly wish the Minister to deal with the points raised in that letter, and to give a reply later in the debate. If there is one industry that sbould be protected under the tariff, it is the great key iron and steel industry, but the statements contained in the letter I have just received give mc considerable concern. Any other remarks that I wish to make regarding the schedule I shall defer until the - individual items are under discussion. Progress reported. HOU R OF MEETING . Motion (by Mr Bruce) agreed toThat the Houso at its rising adjourn until II o'clock a.m. tomorrow. House adjourned at 11 p.m.",65
