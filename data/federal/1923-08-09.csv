2,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"I asked the Treasurer a question the other day concerning the making available to the State Bank of South Australia of money necessary to proceed with the erection of War Service Homes in that State. I was informed, in answer to my question, that certain amounts were being made available each month. I ask the Treasurer now if he can give me an assurance that that is so. The gentleman with whom I am in touch on the matter has directly questioned the State Bank authorities on the honourable gentleman's reply to my question.",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"R t. Hon. W . A. W at - The honourable member is in danger of making a speech. '- Mr MAKIN - I have no desire to make a speech. May I just road the information supplied to me, as it may assist the Treasurer in answering my question 1",13
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,-I . think the honourable member had better put his question.,13
5,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,The authorities of the State Bank of South Australia are holding up and refusing applications for War Service Homes because money is not made available to them. How does the Treasurer reconcile that fact with the answer he gave to my previous question on the subject?,13
6,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,I understood that'..the position in South Australia was that the State Bank authorities had already received more than their allotment on the per capita basis of enlistment. I shall look into the matter again. INCREASE OF OLD - A GE AND INVALID PENSIONS. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.,13
7,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown,"HUGHES - I desire to make a personal explanation. In the Argus newspaper of today reference is made in an article headed, "" The Vice of Charity,"" to a speech I made in this Chamber yesterday. The portion of the article to which I wish to refer is as f o l lows:For this year £6,490,000 is set aside for old age pensions, and £690,000 for the maternity bonus, or a total of £7,180,000. That is an t ) annual charge which, if capitalized at 5 per cent., represents £144,000,000, or more than of the total public debt of the Commonwealth. The point made by Mr DunoanHughes was that it Mould be more advantageous to IhK community, including the pensioners, if this liuge sani were devoted to developing Australia. That seems to me to imply, no doubt in advertently, that i u my speech I advocated the abolition of old-age and invalid pensions. I did not advocate anything of the sort. What I suggested was that it would be better to devote the amount involved in the proposed increase to national reproductive works. That is made clear in the Hansard report of my speech.

In Committee of Sup-ply: Consideration resumed from 8th August (vide page 2353), on motion by Dr E , UILEPAGE That the first item in the Estimates under Division 1-The Parliament-namely , "" The President, £1,100,"" be. agreed to.",17
35,Mr BLAKELEY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Darling ) [2.45] When the debate was adjourned last night I was dealing with the extraordinary indifference of the pfesent Government, and past Governments, to a class .Gd. of diseases which have a very high mortality in Australia. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), who is a doctor, recently said in my hearing that if overeating and venereal diseases were eliminated from society, sickness and mortality would be very materially reduced. Venereal diseases are responsible for the highest degree of mortality, though because of the psychology of the people, it is extremely difficult to trace and determine their prevalence. Unfortunately, owing to feelings of delicacy and a policy of "" hush,"" the statisticians and the medical f r at e r n it y nowadays provide statistics and give death certificates which are not nearly indicative of the position. The percentage of infection is variously estimated, in the case of syphilis, at from 10 per cent, to 14 per cent. of the population. That we may take as a conservative estimate, inasmuch as the British Medical Association is of opinion that the 1,746,798 lbs. infection is from 10 to 12 per cent., and such an organization would not name a figure without very careful consideration. To ascertain the prevalence of gonorrhoea, the system adopted is to multiply the known syphilitica by four. This means that if the syphilitics are 10 per cent, of the 8,982,219 lbs. community, the infection of the other disease is four times higher. Syphilogists PAPERS. consider that it would not be too much to multipy the syphilitic cases by five or six, or even six or seven, for this and other countries. The fact remains that we have amongst us in Australia unfortunate people thus affected, many of whom are not even aware of their condition. Last night I pointed to the menace to society presented in the fact that over 3,000 people, who have been treated by the authorities in Victoria, are at large, free to disseminate these diseases without check and without prosecution. One can visualize the effect. I have had, I shall not say the privilege, but the honour of visiting a hospital in company with two eminent Australian syphilologists. In that hospital there were ten unfortunate children, all in the last stages of the disease, some with tongues and cheeks eaten away, and, in the words of one of the medical men, with "" absolutely no hope."" The Commonwealth Parliament, more than any other, owes the duty to the community to try to prevent the spread of this disease. The Western Australian Venereal Diseases Act is framed on practically the same lines as the Victorian measure, but it is taken more seriously by the people of the State, and is administered much better. Tasmania, Queensland, and New South Wales also have laws providing for compulsory notification by number, free clinical treatment, and free hospitals, and in some cases salvarsan and other curative medicines are available free at the hospitals. I shall not quote in detail the results of treatment in each State, but I shall take the figures for Victoria as a fair indication of the marvellous results that have been achieved by grappling with this problem, notwithstanding the laxity of administration. All of those States which have passed venereal disease laws in conformity with the desires of the Commonwealth Government are entitled to a subsidy, provided they follow the general principles laid down by the Federal authorities. By the way, I notice that only £15,000 is provided on the Estimates this year for subsidies to the States. 9,363 jjersons treated at the Lonsdale clinic more than half were not of the prostitute class. That is very significant aud serious. Of 649 females treated, 481 were, in medical parlance, "" amateurs."" This shows that the majority who contaminate society are not from the streets, but are from the ordinary respectable classes. The evil actually permeates our family life, and the statistics show what a tragedy it causes. Of 9,363 cases at Lonsdale-street, 1,885 were married men, and considerably more than half of the patients were average members of society, and could not be classified as belonging - to a low type. Ten per cent, of the women admitted to the Women's Hospital Melbourne, are contaminated. been estimated that from 70 to 80 per"" cent., and even 85 per cent., of the operations performed in women's hospitals' are due to syphilis. In connection with the Eighth Medical Congress held in Melbourne some time ago, a special meeting was held to deal with syphilis. Dr Bennie, who is an eminent authority on the disease, reported that full y 25 per cent, of the sick children in Melbourne are tainted with syphilis, and that about 10 per cent, of the total number of children in the city are syphilized. Similar proportions are found in all our cities. Nearly half the children who die are in fected with the disease. That is a most disturbing thought. Dr Bennie, continuing, said at the Conference-' ' In many cases of tuberculosis and meningitis 60 per cent, were syphilitics. Of 300 families attending regularly 14 per cent, are in fected."" In regard to the effect upon the birth rate, let me mention that one patient at Langwarrin Camp, only thirty-three years of age, who was married fourteen years ago, suffered from syphilis twelve months before his marriage. He is the father of eight children, five of whom were still-bora, the other three being syphilitic. In 150 families showing evidence of syphilis, out of 1,001 conceptions there were 122 miscarriages or still births, 229 infants were born dead, 390 were born alive but diseased, 210 were born alive, and are so far well. Professor Allan reported having made post-mortem examinations of 200 cases in the hospitals. Of these, 66 cases showed clear and unmistakable proof of infection from syphilis, and in Of 4.0 cases the symptoms were doubtful. It has been estimated that up to 60 per cent, of the inmates of lunatic asylums- I accept the more conservative estimate of 25 per cent - and 22 per cent, of the inmates of blind institutions, owe their affliction to venereal disease. Dr Sir James Barrett, of Melbourne, to whom I paid a tribute yesterday, carried out an extremely interesting investigation some years ago at the Eye and Ear Hospital. Of 500 consecutive cases he found that 14 per cent, were syphilitic. According to Bulletin 8 issued by the Surgeon-General of the American Army, investigatirrs and reports lead him to estimate that 75 per cent, of sterility, and 80 per cent, of % blindness in the new-born are due to veneI t has real disease. I am informed that it is a common practice to treat infants mediately after birth in order to prevent blindness and other diseases from developing. The available statistics to which I have already referred are incomplete inasmuch as the Year-Book of 1921 gives the following figures:-Deaths from gonnorrhoca, 10; syphillis, 130; general paralysis, 151; and locomotor ataxia, 76. The three latter diseases are caused purely by syphilis, as are many other diseases which are shown under different in the Australian Year-Book. stance, 33 per cent, of the mortality both apoplexy and softening of the brain is due to syphilis. Taking the 1921 figures, the deaths from those diseases would be 1,818.per annum. without specified cause shows 33 per cent., and simple meningitis 9 per cent, of mortality through this disease. from organic heart disease are shown as 33 per cent., and, if applied to the figure 5,166, of 1921, 1,720 deaths from, organic heart diseases can he attributed syphilis. Then 75 per cent, of the deaths from disease of the arteries, and atheroma, is due to syphilis. Bright's disease, quite a common disease, it is 19 per cent., showing 1,400 deaths per annum. From congenital debility mortality due to syphilis is 100 per cent. In 1921 there were 3,758 deaths from that disease. I have taken the percentages of a few of the outstanding diseases, but by following the system adopted by a Royal Commission which was appointed by this Parliament in 1914-15, or 1916, and applying it to the figures of the 7 ear-Book, it proves that there were over 7,000 deaths per annum from venereal disease alone, which is an astounding figure. I would indeed be reluctant to use these figures if I were not satisfied they were a correct summing the situation. If the as laid down by Warbusse, an eminent syphilologist of Paris, were applied to the mortality of Australia it would be found that over 7,000 deaths per annum were due to syphilis. In New South the Venereal Diseases Act operated splendidly. Notification was compulsory, and excellent results were being The suspension of the compulsory notification sections of the Act practically emasculated it, inasmuch as doctors are not compelled to report the discontinuance of treatment of patients before cures are Mr Blakeley. im- effected. But, under the Victorian, Western Australian, Tasmanian, and Queensland Acts, the doctors are compelled to notify, first of all by number, and thenif the patient discontinues treatment without cure-by supplying the corresponding name and address. If possible, the patient is traced. Out of 5,000 cases of venereal disease i u Victoria, five led to prosecution. In New South Wales, unfortunately, because of the influence of headings a deputation which waited upon the M in For in- ister of Health some eighteen or twenty from months ago, pointing out the hardship of compulsory notification and treatment, the compulsory notification sections of the Act were suspended. The clinics of Sydney are doing splendid work, but they Paralysis are hampered and restricted because a patient suffering from syphilis is not compelled to report to th© medical authoriDeaths ties. This is a depressing subject, but unless some one is prepared to take the load by frankly and freely discussing this menace to ' society, the system of to hush will be continued to the very great detriment of society. It is not a disease aneurism, which comes from the lower classes. It In permeates society, and no class is immune from it . Ten per cent, of the members of society are known to have the worse the form of venereal disease, which inevitably will injure the body of the patient, and may lead to blindness, lunacy, or early death. No matter what legislation is passed for the betterment of the conditions of society generally, unless it is a healthy society, able to appreciate what is done for it , the disease will not be properly attacked and dealt with. Vast sums of money have been expended on public hospitals and on invalid pensions. We have charitable institutions that are a burden on those that who are able to produce and to work. up of The Commonwealth Government, of all percentages Governments, should separate the Department of Health. I am making no reflection upon the Minister for Trade and Customs, as I recognise that the Customs Department is very important. But, Wales seeing that the promotion of the public health is the most important feature of our governmental activities, it should obtained. be exclusively under the control of one Department. I realise that there are State rights. Despite the restricted amount which the Commonwealth have granted for health by subsidizing the States, we have laid the foundation for bigger things. Although this Government granted £15,000 per annum to subsidize the States, only £13,000 odd was during the past few years claimed by them. Why should the Commonwealth Government allow the States to continue their laxity? Efforts should be made to compel them to attempt to cope with these diseases. People all over Australia are vitally concerned in this matter. The Commonwealth Government should establish the Health Department upon a substantial basis under a special Minister, and it should continue its efforts to coordinate, all State activities which have to do with the public health. Certain officers of the Health Department have endeavoured on many occasions to reach the ideal which the Department has set before it , but success cannot be attained until the Commonwealth Government takes the Department seriously. Of the £121,000 to be set apart this year for the Health Department, 95 per cent, will be used in quarantine administration. The cost of the Tropical Institute of Medicine and of the laboratories is not included in that £121,000. The Commonwealth Government should provide drugs for all the public hospitals in Australia which are willing to treat venereal disease cases.",17
36,Dr EARLE PAGE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,It is partly a question of special medical skill.,20
37,Mr BLAKELEY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"No doubt special skill is required, but many medical officers in Australia have the experience necessary to administer the drugs. who need treatment could be required to attend, say, ten or twelve of the main hospitals in New South Wales, where qualified doctors could provide the special treatment. The same policy could be adopted in the other States.",20
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Doctor s with necessary skill could be found in all the large country towns.,20
39,Mr BLAKELEY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,That is so. I plore the fact that the Commonwealth Government and its doctor-Treasurer do not appear to appreciate the serious position we are in .,20
40,Dr EARLE PAGE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,It is almost impossible to do anything effective u n t i l the duplication in the different States is abolished.,20
41,Mr BLAKELEY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Then the Treasurer should take the initiative to abolish the duplication. It will be a long time before it is abolished if the Commonwealth Government continues its present indifferent attitude. Action has been taken in respect of duplicatiou in our electoral rolls, and in the last twelve months we have had numerous newspaper articles on the desirableness of abolishing duplication in income tax matters. We had a Premiers' Conference sitting in this very chamber deliberating on that subject. Questions which affect the electoral rolls and income tax duplication sink into insignificance when compared with the serious public health situation in which we find ourselves. Doubtless good work is being done in some of the States, but health is a national matter, and it must ultimately come within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Government. A sufficient measure of co-ordination could be obtained to greatly reduce the number of deaths which occur annually from cancer, tuberculosis, and venereal disease. ""Until the Government realizes the necessity for dealing with the situation by placing a much larger sum than £121,000 on the Estimates for the Public Health Department, our present high mortality in consequence of these diseases will continue.",20
42,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Echuca) [3.17] - Question s affecting immigration, soldier settlement, closer settlement, irrigation, aud similar problems are of the utmost importance from the national view-point, and should be seriously considered by members of all political parties. The class of immigrant that is being brought to Australia is not Patients by any means the best that we can get. We need farm workers, agricultural labourers, men who have a little money of their own, which would enable them to take up farm holdings, and also skilled artisans. We have room for a good many men of the artisan class. We are altothe gether too short of some classes of tradesmen. Unfortunately, the type of man now being brought here does not meet the de- requirements of the country. Immigrants who have been trained as doctors, dentists,, and clerks, and who have been following various other professions, are coming here. They are sent to our country districts to do far m work. W it h in a few weeks they tire of their employment. They find that they are utterly unsuited for the positions which they occupy, and, in consequence of all-round dissatisfaction, they d r if t into the cities, and swell the ranks of the unemployed. Recently I met some immigrants who had been in my own district for two or three months. They had no complaints about their labour conditions, their remuneration, or their accommodation, but they had discovered that they were quite unsuited for farm work. The farmers also were dissatisfied. Men of this class very quickly return to city l if e . All the men who are brought here should be required to sign an agreement to remain in the country for twelve months or two years. We do not want people from Great Britai n brought into our already overcrowded cities.",20
43,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Would not the honourable member allow them to come here as free> men 1,21
44,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"We want men who are willing to undertake agricultural duties, and not men who will d r if t into our cities to receive unemployment doles.",21
45,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Why do these people return to the city ?,21
46,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Because of the good conditions, the higher wages, the shorter hours, the frequent race days, the numerous picture shows, and other circumstances of city life which are not obtainable in the country. We cannot afford those attractions in the country; but under the system that has grown up in this city, the people living here can afford them.",21
47,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"What they do in the country is to pay men 15s. a week, and work them fourteen hours out of the twenty-four.",21
48,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"We are prepared in the country to pay a good man quite as much as he could earn in the city, if his board and lodging, as well as his wages, are taken into consideration.",21
49,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Does the honourable member think that 15s. a week is a fair wage?,21
50,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I do not say that 15s., £ 1 , or even £ 2 per week, would be a fair wage to pay a good man, but there are any number of men being brought out from the Old Country at the present time, who, as country workers, could not earn such wages. They are not to blame, because they are entirely, unsuitable for country work. If a man who has been educated to be a doctor or a dentist is given the work of grubbing trees, he cannot earn 15s. a week. Such men are absolutely unsuitable immigrants for this country.",21
51,Mr OKEEFE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Ye t the honourable member is supporting a policy for the expenditure of £5,000,000 on immigration.",21
52,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I do not agree with the spending of £5,000,00 0 on bringing immigrants to this country at the present time if they are to be settled on f r u it areas or areas for intense cultivation. I propose to deal at some length with the driedf r u it and soft-fruit industries, and to point out that, in my opinion, it is useless to settle returned soldiers, immigrants, or our own people on small areas for intensive cultivation under the conditions existing today. The Government of Victoria has spent between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000 on water conservation and the construction of reticulation channels for irrigation, stock, and domestic purposes. We have here one of the finest irrigation schemes in the world. New South Wales has constructed Burrunjuck, and irrigation channels on the Murrumbidgee and other areas in that State. I suppose that before the Murray Waters Scheme is completed anything up to £10,000,000 will have been expended upon it . What is it all leading to? It simply means that in the Murray Valley, the Goulburn Valley, and on the Murrumbidgee small areas of land are being used principally for fruit-growing. On the Murrumbidgee alone there are no fewer than 873 returned soldiers who are being repatriated on f r u it farms. The same thing applies to Victoria. At Merbein there are 1,000 returned soldiers, and a very large number of Victorian settlers on other small areas. It is the same at Redcliffs, Nyah, Tintinda, and in the Goulburn and Murray Valleys. The result is that we are faced today with an overproduction of soft fruits, dried fruits, and citrus fruits, for which there is no market. The Government need to consider very seriously, not only the position today, which is desperate, but what the position will be in a few years' time if the same policy is continued. The present desperate position will become more acute, and if the Government have no better means of settling immigrants, it would be better not to bring them here at all. To continue to settle men on the land in this way will mean disaster to the immigrants and to the country also. We might settle some men on dry areas. There are huge areas of Crown lands in every State in the Commonwealth, and I would suggest that instead of settling men to go in for fruit-growing we should endeavour to settle them on dry areas, although for some considerable time it is very likely that even dry farming will be found to be unprofitable.",21
53,Mr SEABROOK,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The settlers will settle themselves if they grow f r u it .,22
54,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"M a n y of the men on the closer settlement areas growing f r u it today are well and truly settled. We talk of the unemployed in Melbourne, but if this policy is continued, the present position will be so accentuated that the men will leave their small holdings, because they will have nothing to look forward to. They will come down to Melbourne, and will cost the Government more i u unemployment doles than it would cost to tide the people on these small areas over the present crisis. The State and Federal Governments should see that no further moneys are provided for the settlement of returned soldiers, or any other class of settlers on small holdings to grow f r u it . If private persons, in spite of what they know of the position, choose to take up these holdings they will know what awaits them, but the Government should not go into this business further with its eyes wide open. have recently been closely intouch with the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Austin Chapman) with a view to seeing what can be done to help the soft-fruit growers out of their present difficulties. They do not know where they are. received a letter, only a few moments ago, from a man settled in the Goulburn Valley, and this is an extract from it I saw the announcement of Mr Austin Chapman re f r u it in today's Age. He pledges the Cabinet to help of some sort or another, but no Pool. I trust that you will urge for a speedy and definite answer as to what help will be given. As tilings stand at present there exists such a delightful doubt about the future which the bunks are making full use of, whilst all the fruit-growers are in their debt. Ask for their scheme at once. I have been pressing the Minister for a definite pronouncement. We urge that he should give the growers a Pool or financial assistance of some form. know that the honourable gentleman is absolutely sympathetic. He is aware that the fruit-growers are up against it , and anything he can do to help them. I feel sure will be done. But I suggest that he should make his pronouncement on the subject at the earliest possible time, because the fruit-growers are in the clutches of the banks, and the bulk of them do not know where to get the money necessary to carry on from week to week. I do not wish to stress the returned soldier business, because it is always thrown up against a man if he argues that the returned soldier is being unduly pressed and is in straitened circumstances. But we have to face things as* they are, and I have said that there are 873 returned men on the Murrumbidgee; there are over .1,000 at Merbein, and there are hundreds in the Goulburn Valley, at Bedcliffs, Nyah, Tintinda, and other places. These men are asking for an immediate announcement of the intentions of the Government, not only with regard to soft fruits, but with regard also to dried fruits. . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - We are prepared to give a substantial bounty.",22
55,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I appreciate what the Government are prepared to do, but at the moment I am unable to say whether the assistance given should be by means of a pool or of a bounty. I understand that negotiations are now proceeding with a view to seeing what can be done to help I the fruit-growers. Honourable members on both sides should realise that f r u it growing is one of our primary industries in which thousands of men are engaged, and on which in providing irrigatio n millions of pounds have already been I spent. Every man who represents country interests should take this matter seriously to heart. I feel assured that honourable members on both sides will see that something is done to help in this really national work. I know that we are invited to ""eat more f r u it . "" Some time ago I went to the Spencer-street station on my way home, and, noticing Mr Olapp's invitation outside the station to "" Eat more f r u it , "" I proceeded to purchase some peaches at a stall on the r a i lway station. The young lady in attendance asked 8d. per lb. for green peaches that I would not feed to ray pigs, and I told her that she could keep them. This I is the way in which Mr Clapp helps us to respond to his invitation. On a Victorian railway station he permits people to charge 8d. per lb. for inferior f r u it whilst in the country we cannot get I d . per lb. for good f r u it . One of these small fruiterers in Melbourne makes more money than is made by a dozen growers in a small way in the country. I may be told that the fruiterers bave to pay high rents. Every one is conversant with the fact that recently there has been a considerable increase in rents in Melbourne. It is frequently the cause of high rents is that are slowing down, are working hours, lay fewer bricks a day, and so on. There may be some truth in this, but I can refer honourable members to an experience I had recently. An tion with which I am connected three floors of an old building, for which it has been paying £1,200 a year in rent. It received an intimation that the owners of the building proposed to charge £1,600 a year for the three floors. The organization then said that it would one of the floors, and the owners' reply was, "" If you use two floors the rent will be £1,400 a year,"" or £200 a year more for two floors than the organization was originally paying for three floors. As a result, this organization has more convenient offices in a new building at less than half that ""When I went to my barber other day he told me that he was leaving the place ho was in and going to a place in Little Collins-street. I asked what his trouble told me that for the place he occupied, which was a comparatively small room about 18 ft. by 12 ft., he was originally asked to pay 25s. per week rent. Later he was charged £2 10s. per week, and he had just been informed that in future his rent would be £6 per week. He said that he could not pay that rent, and was going out of the place. point I wish to make is that these buildings were not erected recently by expensive labour. They were built years ago, and long before the war. It is high time a Fair Rents Court was created. To-day rents in Melbourne are so high that primary producers are feeling the effects. It might appear at first sight as if the primary producer was not interested, but if the rent of his agent is £6, instead of £3, he must pay a share of the excess. While the present abnormal conditions obtain, it should be possible for people to buy soft or perishable fruits at any time up to 9 o'clock at night. I received a letter Mr Hill. fruit- from a large grower in the Goulburn Valley, who. saysI would suggest that, to get at the solution of the difficulty, we must first look for the cause, and after finding the cause, cither remove same or prevent the cause from getting worse and nurse the industry hack to normal said that conditions. workmen The fruit industry requires and receives a shorter protective duty to enable it to sell on the Australian market in competition with other countries, so that being so, it must be evident that, to compete outside Australia at a profit to the industry must be impossible unless there is some organiza- preference received from Kngluud anil the rest of the Empire. leases We do not, however, receive any preference, so must face the positioJi as it is today, and realise that the only market we have for our products is within Australia. Australia being the only market on which we can hope to sell our goods at a price that will return us cost of production, it is imperative vacate that our production must not exceed the requirements of this market. This brings us to the cause of the present difficulty of our industry, viz.. over-production. About eleven years ago, the New South Wales and Victorian State Governments started their immigration and closer settlement policies, and. noticing that the fruit industry seemed prosecured fitable, and also that this industry gave the greatest amount of employment per acre, and amount. also in many other indirect ways gave employ the ment, they started to encourage the planting of trees with the promise of finding markets for the increased production. No inquiry, so far as I know, was made as to the prospects of com""When peting on the oversea markets with the surplus production, nor, so far as I know, was there was he any effort made to collect the statistics of the varieties of fruit already planted by private enterprise. The fruit industry would"" have arrived at the present position in about the year 1910, but. owing to the war contracts for jams and canned fruits, the surplus production was absorbed. Since the end of the war, the State Governments have been pursuing a vigorous policy of settling returned soldiers on new areas, and financing them to plant further areas under fruit, the The money being .found by the Federal Government. The Government ought to cry a halt, for no good can come of further aggravating many the position. So long as the Federal Government finds the money, so long will the State Governments spend it , and the Federal Government will be left "" carrying the baby "" of the F r u it Pools. To-day, growers, realizing that there is overproduction, are being forced to cut down large areas of trees while Government-financed growers are planting the same varieties of trees that are known by experienced growers to be in excess of requirements. - The cost of production and manufacture must either come down so that our industry can compete on the world's markets, or else the prorecently duction must be reduced to come within the requirements of the Australian demands. The present policy of the Government, however, is to fix the wages of the employees in the fruit industry by Arbitration Courts, and also all the requirements of the industry are produced under the same policy, together with"" a very high Tariff, which also increases the cost of materials and machinery plant, &c, used by the industry; therefore, we cannot reduce the costs under the present policy. This means .that the only remedy is to increase the consumption of our .products as far as possible within Australia, and, at the same time, discontinue the planting of new areas. I have placed various suggestions before the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Chapman) with the object of getting r i d of the present huge stocks of soft fruits. In America, five cans of soft f r u it per head of the population are consumed, whereas in Australia the figure is no higher than one and one-eighth per head. This shows that something is wrong. I suggested to - the Minister that by vigorous propaganda-by means of a "" f r u it week "" or something of the sort - the virtues of our fruit s might b© displayed to the public more prominently than ever before. Mr M . CAMERON - Reduc e the price and all the f r u it will b© sold.",22
56,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"It ought to be known throughout the Commonwealth that f r u it is offered at 2s. 6d. a dozen below cost. The endeavour should he to dispose of most of the f r u it for home consumption. If threeand three-eighths cans per head of population were disposed of, the trouble would be at an end. I have received some suggestions from another grower, who statesThe machinery of distribution as at present used by the Pool is too slow and cumbersome to suit the present situation. The Pool is working along the recognised lines of distributionit has always been its aim to use the regular business channels for its purpose.

The Government, it is said, desires to get "" out of business,"" and cannot see its way to finance a Pool. I propose to wait and se© what the Government proposes to the fruit-growers. I know that the Government is anxious to help, and prepared to spend a large amount to that end; and I wish to se© that the money is spent effectively, not only in helping the grower this year, but in stabilizing th© market for th© future. 9 1923-24. 2403",24
57,Mr GABB,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Has the Government not definitely decided against a Pool this year 1,24
58,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I understand so, but, of course, we do' not know how matters will work out. The suggestion is made that the canners should take the whole of the f r u it and process it . I do not know how much the earners ' would pay for the f r u it , or whether, indeed, they would pay anything. I am told, however, that the Shepparton and Kyabram canneries, in th© past year, have processed 50 per cent, of th© canned goods produced in Victoria. The Shepparton cannery alone processed 295,000 dozen last year, when, in the season, they were turning out each day sufficient canned f r u it togiv© one can per day to ©very household in Melbourne and suburbs. There are cooperative factories in the country which have no capital on which to work. The Shepparton cannery is largely financed by th© State Government, the proprietors net seeing their way to carry on without such aid. In fact, the whole position is such that special efforts are being made by those interested to arrive at a solution satisfactory to all. As to dried fruits, I hope the Prime Minister, when he goes to London, will endeavour to obtain some Empire preference for Australia. We give Great Britain an enormous preference here, and surely we may ask for some in return, particularly in the case of dried and canned fruits. We have the New Zealand, the Canadian, and the British markets. New Zealand is prepared to give us a preference of 2d. per lb., or £ 1 8 13s. 4d. per ton, in return for a certain preference from us. I do not know whether the primary producers increase here are prepared to give New Zealand the preference asked. My idea is thatNew Zealand ought to ask for a preferin Vic- ence from the secondary industries, and not place the whole burden on the piling primary producers."" Canada offers a preference of l ^ d . per l b . , or £ 1 4 per ton, but I understand that the Dominion imposes almost impossible conditions. I do not know what these conditions are, but I surmise that Canada asks for a remission of the duty on agricultural implements. That, of course, would suit Australian primary producers "" down to the ground,"" for then they would get their machinery, if not duty free, at any rate at a much smaller duty than at present.",24
59,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"If the man in the city cannot earn money, what is the use of the primary producers growing fruit ?",25
60,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"If the primary producers do not grow fruit of all sorts, wheat, oats, barley, wool, meat, and so on, it is certain no wages will be paid; that is the sum and substance of the position. I should now like to give some indication of the quantities of fruits processed and handled in the Commonwealth. Th-s information I have has been supplied by the Australian Dried Eruits Association. The estimated output of currants for the present year is 8,000 tons, of which the Commonwealth consumes 3,000, and 5,000 tons are exported. This means that 62^ per cent, of the total crop is exported. There was a time when the Australian consumption of dried fruits was about 80 per cent, of the crop, only 20 per cent, being exported. To-day we export 62$ per cent., and we consume locally only 37-J per cent. The position is rapidly becoming worse. It is estimated that i u 1927 we shall be exporting 80 per cent, of our dried fruits, and consuming locally only 20 per cent - hence the urgent necessity for providing an increased outlet for these products. Dr EA.T?XE PAGE - What proportion of our canned fruits is consumed in Australia?",25
61,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Of about 900,000 cases of canned fruits packed, 300,000 cases, or one-third, are consumed locally; but it is estimated that if sales were pushed the Australian consumer would probably take the whole of the pack. The following table sets out the details of the pack by the Australian Dried Eruits Association in 1923:- PncH. wealth AM.V.A. rae* !923. Currants 8,000 3.000 Sultanas Loxlas Apricota 630 Foars (light crop) .. 40 40 Nectarines (light SO crop) Peaches 400 Muscatels 100 Prunes ISO - The carry-over from previous season amounts to a total of 1,359 tons. I ask honourable members to bear those figures in mind for the purpose of comin parison with some I shall give later regarding the enormous quantity of dried! fruits packed in America and sold in 'markets which should belong to the Commonwealth growers. The Australian carry-over from the previous season amounted to 1,359 tons, and although the final packing-shed returns have not yet been received, the figures quoted are practically correct. In addition, the following production will probably be marketed by people outside the Dried Eruits Association, but it is difficult to get information in support of these figures:Currants, 1,200 tons; sultanas, 300 tons; apricots, 200 tons; peaches, 100 tons; prunes, 150 tons-o r a total of 1,950 tons, making a total production, including the figures of the Dried Fruits Association, of 28,500 tons. Honourable members will realise that, with the increased production, unless profitable export markets are secured, it will be impossible for the driedfruit industry to make headway, and, in view of the fact that the Commonwealth and State Governments have spent millions of pounds on the repatriation of soldiers in the Murray Valley, it is essential that everything possible should be done to find markets. Owing to big expansion in the planted areas, mainly through the activities of the various Governments in settling returned soldiers on irrigated blocks, it is impossible at the present time to give anything like reliable figures. But it is fairly safe to reckon that each acre of vine fruits in bearing will yield an average of 1 ton per acre, and it is estimated that the 1924 production in Australia will reach 33,000 tons, which should represent 33,000 acres, gradually increasing until by 1927 the production of vine fruits will exceed 50,000 tons. Where Estimated Common- Export are we to find markets for these fruits? Percentage. Sales. I shall quote from the New York Comtons. tons. tons. mercial, of 9th April, 1923, to indicate 02i - 5,000 to honourable members what the American 12,800 4,700 i,37a 1,175 05 75 8,125 3,525 growers have been able to do:221 65 - 409 30 The American raisin .is making a new record in its invasion of the world's markets. The 240 40 - 160 100 total exports in the fiscal year 1923, which 150 ends ninety days hence, will exceed 100,000,000 20,650 9,331 17,219 lbs. against 50.000„000 in the fiscal year of -1,950 1022, and 75,000,000 in 1016. The value of 28,500 (-> the year's exports will approximate $15,000,000, and will also exceed that of any earlier year. This high record in the quantity and value of our raisin exports, - says the National City Bank of New York, is especially interesting view of the fact that the other great raisim field of the world, the Levant, has recently lesumed its contributions to the world market. Prior to the war, the area fronting on the eastern end of the Mediterranean was a large contributor to the world raisin markets, especially those of Europe. With the reduction in agricultural activities in that area during the war, production was greatly minimized,, and raisins from the United States wore largely imported by Europe, and, in some cases, supplied to their troops in the field, and the world thus came to know the value of the American, raisin. The growth in world popularity of our raisins is evidenced by tthc fact that the exports advanced from 16,000,000 lbs. in 1013, to 56,000,000 in 1918, the closing year of the war, and 110,000.000 in 1919. With return of the Levant to raisin production and exportation* however, our exports fell to 53,000,000 libs, in 1920, and 33,000,000 in our short-crop year 1921. W it h ithe high record of production of 1922, however, which is materially in excess of any earlier year, our exports for the current fiscal year seem likely to equal the high record of 110,000,000 lbs. in the calendar year 1919, in which the Levant had not yet re-entered the world markets. New IBspport Factor. The raisin is a comparatively new factor in our export trade. It was only in 189S that the quantity exported was of sufficient importance to obtain a place - in the export records of the Government, and the total exports of that year amounted ito only 3,000,000 lbs., advancing to 5,500,000 in 190S, 56,000,000 in 1918, and 110,000,000 in 1919. It is due, .however, to .the growth in home demand that the raisin industry of California, our chief raisin producer, has so rapidly developed. Tho total (production of raisins in California was in 191.3, 130,000,000 lbs; in 1919, 360,000,000; and in 1922, 450,000,000. and we are now producing more than one-half of the raisins of the world. Albout four-fifths of this hig .production is consumed in the United States. Of the 3,000,000,000 lbs. produced in the .past decade, 17 per cent, was exported, and the remaining S7 per cent, consumed at home. Even this big consumption from our own fields, docs noifc full y cover the requirements of our people. Great Britain is the largest single buyer of American raisins, our total exports to that country in 1922 having been 44,000,000 lbs. against only 5,000,000 in 1921. The sales to Great Britain in 1922 totalled over 19,000 tons, as compared with the exportable surplus of all classes of Australian dried fruits, namely, 17,219 tonsCanada ranks next to Great Britain in the taking of American raisins of 1922, her total for that year being £29,000,000. That is equal to nearly 13,000 tons, and more than Australia's total pack of raisins; yet, although Canada is a fellowpartner in the British Empire, Australia gets no preference from herJapan has suddenly developed a taste for American raisins, exports to that country in 1922 totalling something over £4,000,000 as against £2,000.000 in the preceding year. All the world seems to have developed a taste for American raisins, the number of countries to which they were' supplied in 1921, the latest year for which details were available, was seventy-five, aud represented every grand division of the world. This enormous trade is not duo to the fact that the American product is better than the Australian. Our soft fruits, especially those of Shepparton and Kyabrarn, are equal to the best Californian pack, and the products marketed by the Australian Dried Eruits Association are as good as the best produced in any part of the world. There is no fault to he found with the quality of our goods. The industry is handicapped solely by our inability to find markets. I quote now from a pamphlet issued by the National City Bank of New York in April of this year, entitled, Economic Conditions, Governmental Finance, United States Securities:The Go-operative Raisin Growers. The raisin growers of California have furnished an example of successful co-operative - business. They control a large proportion of the raisin production of California, and Jiavn been successful in bringing order out of chaos in the industry, and making the industry profitable. - When the "" Sun Maid Baisin Growers "" was formed in 1912, there apparently existed a state of over-production in ithe industry, for prices of grape growers were unromuncrative, the growers were in debt, and the outlook unpromising. Under the operations of the association the demand for raisins has enormously (increased, prices have advanced to a remunerative .basis, and production has increased several itiimes over.

The tonnage of the early years was disproportionately small,i inasmuch as the association wan buildingup 'its membership, and did not handle the share of the crop which it has loiter. Mr Seymour, its general manager, has stated that the average of the total tonnage ifor the fivo years prior , to 1012 was about 70,000 tons. Tho organization now handles about 00 .per cent, of ibhc raisin production. The raisin growers ihave been very prosperous in recent years, as may be judged by Ihc figures for .prices and values. Their lands have advanced to high selling values. $1,000 per acre or thereabouts, they have had money to spend or invest, and the cities in the raisin territory have all reflected ithe improved conditions. It .might appear to the casual observer that all this had iboon brought about simply by raising .the price through concentrated control over selling, but the - management knows bettor than that. The fundamental factor in the improved conditions has been '.the increased consumption. Before the association began operations raisins were a drug on the market, with a heavy carry-over from year to year, depressing the price, but a demand was developed which cleared up the crop year after year at advancing - prices. Developing the Demand. Probably ibhc raisin growers took a loaf from the experience of other fruit-growers on the Pacific Coast, who hod learned to standardize their (product, guarantee quality, and (market it in an attractive manner. Ait any rate, ithcy offered raisins in appetizing array, and then they launched upon an advertising campaign which has involved a steadily increasing expenditure, until, for 1923, the appropriation is said :to the $1,200,000. The advance in. price has ibeen an incident to the increased demand and - would not have been possible without Lt. The raisin .producers, within the Sun Maid Association, however, - have no monopoly. It is favourable to the formation of such an association that the bulk of the raisin grapes are grown within a comparatively small territory, instead of over a great territory at home and abroad, as in the case of the farm staples, but it lis not difficuKf) to increase the production of raisin grapes in California, as appears from the above figures. As the .iprice goes up, naturally the acreage in grapes has 'been expanding, and Mr Seymour is responsible for the 'Statement that the plantings to date indicate that, within five years, the production of raisins will bo above 400,000 tons per year. The price is behind the production, but behind the iprice must the consumption. The To-is in crop each year must disappear in consumption to make way for the next. Price fixing that would merely provide for buying and storing the crop would accomplish nothing. That is the trouble in Australia. have some of the finest"" irrigation in the world, which is served by huge reservoirs. The Murray Valley of hundreds of thousands of acres, which Mr Hill. can be successfully used for the growing of any class of f r u it . Unfortunately, we have not the markets. I appeal to the Government to make every endeavour to dispose of the soft fruits pack which is at present unsold. I urge the Prime Minister when he"" is attending the I m perial and Economic Conferences to do his utmost to bring about reciprocal arrangements between the Commonwealth and Great Britain and Canada. The success of the people on the land depends upon access to oversea markets, which are at present exploited by America. Prewar prices must eventually obtain throughout the world. The price for wheat is rapidly falling, and next year I would not be surprised if it were down to the pre-war level. Even in that event it is doubtful whether the consumer will get any relief. Recently when the price of a 4-lb. loaf in a certain suburb was 10d., (lour was selling at £1 2 15s. per ton. The price of flour fell to £ 1 1 per ton, but that of bread remained as previously. Subsequently flour rose to £ 1 1 15s. per ton, and immediately the price of the 4-lb. loaf was raised to l i d . The efforts of the primary prodiicer to meet the consumer are rendered f u t i l e b j the bakers' 7 refusal to give any concession in price. Taking the 4-lb. loaf at l i d . today, the baker is getting 6 i . the miller I d . , and v the farmer 3 i d . Flour is practically the cheapest article of foodstuff in the Commonwealth, and can be bought over the counter at 2 i d . per l b . , while a pumpkin is 3d., oatmeal 3-Jd., and meat anything from lOd. to Is. 3d. per l b . High prices cannot long continue. The scarcity of fat stock accounts for the present exorbitant prices. As a farmer, I have been unable for many months to k ill a single sheep for home use, and I do not expect to do so for some time to come. Some four or five months ago, before the drought set in , beef at the Newmarket yards could be bought oh the hoof at under 3d. per lb., and it was then very nearly as dear retail as it is today. The same thing applies to mutton. . A friend of mine sent 250 bags of good English malting barley to Melbourne, which returned him £50, each bag averaging 4s. This is what the farmer is up against. PracWe tically everything he is growing today is country sold at pre-war prices. Undue profits are being made in many of the consists secondary industries. I admit that very high wages are paid in those industries. I am a staunch unionist, and I believe that any industry should pay the highest wage possible. I do not stand for low wages. As a farmer I much prefer to see even better conditions and higher wages than those which obtained during the last eight years. If pre-war conditions are soon to be experienced the farmers must take action. I do not suggest that wages should be lowered. The. working man, whilst commodities remain so high, finds it, difficult to make both ends meet on a wage of from £ 3 15s. to £ 5 , and a rental of 30s. per week. Still, there is something wrong, and I do not know how it can be rectified. Assistance must come from the other side.  Labour party act, not being in power?",25
62,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The primary producers are prepared to assist the working class. I have a suggestion which can be applied to large cities, but not to small country towns. We produce everything that is required in the way of food-suc h as wheat, meat, butter, eggs, cheese, milk, &c. Co-operative distributing companies must be formed to supply the consumer direct. The working classes, say, of Northcote, Clifton Hill , Collingwood, Brunswick, and Eichmond should contribute £1 or £5 per head to the establishment of a co-operative distributing association, which would purchase the goods direct from the primary producers and distribute them to the workers. Instead of having eight or ten carts delivering milk to a few people in one street, one cart would supply all the residents of several streets. If the Labour party .will consider this suggestion, I am prepared to arrange for persons to speak at the various town halls in the thicklypopulated districts of the metropolitan area to inform the working classes of the benefit of such an organization. primary producers have their own cooperative companies, and they are prepared to co-operate with any organization which is formed by the labouring class for the distribution of necessary commodities.",28
63,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"East Sydney) [4.20] I compliment the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) on his elucidation of the problem of distributing Australia's production. I agree that effective work may be done by co-operation. Unfortu nately, the honourable member is in the wrong company. The party which he is supporting is opposed to co-operation, or to any measure of Socialism such as he has suggested. It says that we should rely upon the mad principle of private enterprise. We have only to look at the buildings of Goldsbrough, Mort and Company, Dalgety and Company Limited , and similar firms in all our capital cities to realise how they have profited through the work of the primary producers. The result of their robbery is that when the sons of the farmers grow up and want to establish homes for themselves, they have to come to the city to earn the money necessaiy; and when the farmers' daughters wish to settle down they have to come to the city to find husbands who the can afford to keep them. Australia is capable of producing everything that our people need. I travelled round the world a good deal in my younger days, and as far as I was able to judge, no countiy is so capable as this continent of making itself self-contained. Our people do not yet realise that the great ideal of the Labour party is that we should become self-contained and self-supporting. Our party has built upon a groundwork of humanitarian ideals. Some day people will fully realise this. We wish Australia to become a land in which every citizen can make a decent living. Our hearts are specially sympathetic with all who go into the interior of Australia, and open up the country so that it may become populated. God has given us this land to cultivate and develop. Some of our early pioneers, however, determined to get the country into their grip. They did it , and now their descendants, who still hold the land in their grip, say, in effect, to the ordinary people, "" You can be damned, so long as we have the land and the f r u it from the The land."" We are reaping the miserable results of the early policy adopted to settle this country. I feel very strongly on this matter. I am' disappointed with the Budget. It does not give this Committee sufficient in formation. We could expect only a conglomeration of figures because the Treasurer had to prepare the Budget hastily to enable the Prime Minister to make an early departure from Australia to meet his Imperialistic friends in London whom he has not seen for some years. We have no Auditor-General's report, and the Budget is an illustration of how figures may be manipulated. It gives the people of Australia a false idea of their financial position. It bas been said that figures do not lie. In my opinion, those who handle figures are the biggest liars on the face of the earth. I am anxious about the future of our Australian note issue. note issue was organized by the progressive Labour party, when it was in power, with a view to using the profits to open up unsettled areas in the Commonwealth which would never be'opened up if we had to wait until we could afford to borrow money for the purpose. It was never contemplated that the profits from the note issue would be placed to the credit of the revenue account. Mr Andrew and other gentlemen associated him in authorizing the note issue, realized the sity for building railways, and carrying out other great public unsettled parts of Australia, such as the Northern Territory. The Labour believed that a substantial profit could fairly be made through the note issue. We discovered in those days that Australian gold coin was being sent to the Eastern countries, and that a considerable wastage was occasioned by the use of gold coin in ordinary commercial activities. Persons belonging to the Oriental races wore earning money in Australia, obtaining payment in gokl coin, and sending the coin to the East. were receiving 21 s. and 21s. Sd. each for sovereigns. Our party believed that our gold coin should be kept in our own country. Some years ago I asked Sir Joseph Cook, who was then for some information about this He told me he did not claim to have acknowledge of it. That was an honest admission, though I do not know whether he thought he was ""pulling my leg."" Subsequently I saw that certain men who were closely associated with the big financial institutions of were to be appointed members Note Issue Board. When I read the names of those gentlemen I thought something was about to be done with the note issue which was not in keeping with the purposes of its originators. lieve that we have an evidence of the spirit of such gentlemen in the proposal now before us to place the profit the note issue into the general account, instead of using it for the conMr West. struction of large and necessary public works. To use a race-course phrase, "" thimble-rigging"" is going on. The profits from the note issue should not be allowed to swell the general revenue account. That was the last thing that was The intended when the note issue was established. One redeeming feature about such an action is that it may reduce taxation, but the Labour party does not believe that taxation should be reduced by such means. Last year the Treasurer announced a reduction in income taxation. Nobody asked for the reduction. I do not like to be hard on the right honourable gentleman who was then TreaFisher, surer, but I believe that that move with was intended to be a sop to the Australian people on the eve of an election. neces- I know that the Postmaster-General looks after telegrams, letters, and telephones, and so on, but the expenditure of the works in Department is largely controlled by the Treasurer. The Post and Telegraph Departy partment shows a profit upon its operations. I have tried to reason the thing out, and I begin to think there must be something wrong with my brain, because I am quite unable to understand why a Department which has earned a profit of £1,500,000 should borrow money to enable it to increase its services, instead of using the money it has earned to afford further facilities, and to increase the wretched payment at present made to They those in charge of country offices.",28
64,Mr GIBSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"It has so used its profits, and £2,500,000 in addition.",29
65,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The honourable gentleman Treasurer, should wait a minute u n t il I have done, matter. when he will be sorry that he spoke. In stead of spending the profits made by the Department in the way I suggest, the Government propose to borrow money for it. When the Labour party came into power in 1910, the Government was faced gentle- with the fact that for seven years previously the Post and Telegraph DepartAustralia ment had been starved. It decided upon of the a vote of £3,000,000 for the Department, and that £1,000,000 should be spent upon that it each year. But the Government did not borrow the money. They took the £3,000,000 from revenue, and devoted the I be- surplus of revenue over expenditure for three years to improvements in post and telegraph services. To-day the present from Government propose to borrow money to revenue the extent of £9,000,000 for this Department.

In my opinion the Government is pandering to those from whom it thinks some support may be obtained. Certainly it has some reason for this concession. I am not opposed to immigration, but I am utterly opposed to the immigration policy and administration of the Government. ""When a Labour Government was in power the social aud industrial conditions of Australia were so much improved as to be the envy of the civilized world. There was then no need toborrow millions to spend on immigration. One year we increased the population by 89,000 without borrowing. Savings Bank deposits were heaping up, and the merchant, the butcher, the baker, the tailor all shared in the general prosperity. Every man and woman who then came to this country knew there would be every opportunity and facility to achieve success. The Labour party ever since has been trying to maintain the high standard of living then set. U n fortunately for Australia, this humanitarian party is now sitting in Opposition. The legislation of the Labour Government was of a truly national character. There was nothing low, local or puny about it , there were no proposals to vote 10s. a head to wealthy cattle-owners, or anything of that kind. Latterly, however, attempts have been, and, indeed, are being made, to make employment scarce. In this the Broken Hill Proprietary Company at Newcastle has taken a prominent part. Owing to the action of that company in closing their works, with the object I have indicated, £25,000 worth of rails had to be imported into Western Australia. Other works at Granville and. elsewhere have been closed.  member ought to give his authority for such statements.",30
68,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I am giving nothing but facts, and what I have spoken of has been going on for some time. These great employing companies are trying to defeat the objects of the Arbitration Court, and 4 the coal barons of Newcastle are assisting in the work. To-day the whole Newcastle district is in the hands of three men- a coal man, a shipping maii, and a merchant. Do honourable members fancy that men strike for the sake of striking. Could anybody be so stupid, to or lost to reason, as to strike without cause? The real truth is that the men are fighting against encroachments on their liberty, and they would not be of the same flesh and blood as myself if they did not do so. The State Government of New South Wales has done much harm by closing the State Saw-mills. This has left the trade in the hands of a Combine, and the price of timber has been raised 12 per cent, or 15 per cent. The same conditions are to be found in the roofing tile trade, and the price of tiles has been raised from £ 8 to £ 1 8 a thousand. Our immigration management is a disgrace to both State and Federal Governments. ImmiThe grants are brought here and landed on the wharfs, with no one there to guide them. If they wish to go to the country, married men are offered 25s. a week, and when they accept they are left to find their own way. Conditions were very different in New Zealand when I landed there in 1874. I may say that I was not an immigrant, and I cannot claim to have reached the Antipodes with the proverbial sixpence in my pocket. Those who had been brought out on assisted passages had their luggage looked after, were found shelter while awaiting employment, and were conducted to their destinations in the country. Not long ago, as a member of the Public Works Committee, I visited a timber area, and there the president of the shire, who required two carpenters, was utterly astounded when I asked him where the houses were in which these men, with their wives, would have to live. The only shelter there was for them was a lean-to by the publichouse. They were amazed when I suggested that they should provide habitations so that any tradesmen who came to the district might bring their wives and families and live a normal married life. Until the people in country districts appreciate the necessity for providing homes for workers and their wives they will continue to experience difficulty in getting labour. When I called at Cairns a few years ago on my return t r ip from Papua, a strike was in progress, and I heard many people complain that the seasonal workers from other States came to Cairns to cut the sugar crop, earned big cheques, "" painted the town r e d "" for a while, and then went away. My inquiries elicited the fact that nothing was done to induce those men to settle in the district, and I advised th© townspeople that u n t i l they provided habitations and other in ducements to men to take up their residence there they must expect a continuance of the practices of which they were complaining. It seemed to me that some of the labourers were treated worse thau prisoners. I consider it my duty to condemn the Treasurer for the manner in which he has handled the recent loan flotation. Prior to the last election, knowing that about £38,723,590 of Commonwealth debt would fall due this year, I asked thei. then Treasurer (Mr Bruce) what arrangement the Government was making for the redemption of the loan. The right honourable gentleman answered that at the proper time the Government would take the usual course. Subsequently a change of Government took place, and on 11th June last I urged the Government to take steps to convert the loan into consols; but a few days later the Government announced the issue of a conversion loan carrying interest at £ 5 Is. 5d. per cent., or Is. 5d. more than was paid during the war period, and having a currency of twenty-five years. I warned the Government at the time that the loan would not be a success, because long-dated issues are not suitable to the commercial requirements of Australia. My prediction has been verified. The interest paid on the £38,723,590 up to the date of maturity was £7,695.780, and the expenses in connection with flotation amounted to £72,000, making a total of £7,767,780. Had the new flotation been successful, the taxpayers of the Commonwealth would have paid, in twenty-five years, interest to the amount of £49,619,845 , so that by 1948 they would have paid a total of £57,387,625 for the use of £38,723,590, and would still owe the whole of the principal. The Treasurer is now endeavouring to float a loan of £21,000,000 at, £ 9 8 , with a currency of five years. That means that the new issue will cost the taxpayer £ 5 9s. 3d. per cent. general community does not understand the seriousness of those figures. Had such a proposal been made by a Labour Government the press throughout the country would have hounded it out of office. If it so mismanaged the finances and fleeced the people as the present Government are doing by their maladministration of the loans it could not continue in office for a week, so great would be the outcry. In 1918, when the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , the then Treasurer of the Commonwealth, was in England- I refer to the occasion when he was posing in England as Prime Minister, and was reminded by cablegram by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes) that there was only one Prime Minister of Australia, in consequence of which rebuke he resigned his office-h e submitted to the Imperial Government, with the sanction of the Commonwealth Government, a scheme for handling the war debts of the British Empire. His memorandum commencedThe Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, with the approval of the Government, has the honour to submit for the consideration of the Governments of the United Kingdom, and or the various British Dominions, a scheme for the administration of the war debts of the Empire, itheir conversion from time to time, and their ultimate extinction. The right honourable member proposed to place all the war debts of the B ritish Empire under the control of a commission which would have power to convert the loans into Consols, redeemable at any time, and to grant premiums to any purchaser of loan stock. The commission was to have power to raise money in any part of the world, which would have meant that Australia would have been paying interest to Japanese and Ameri cans, and others, and this Parliament would have lost control over the note issue and Australian securities. Although I was in favour of the conversion of the loans into Consols, I proposed that the Commonwealth should f o l low the example of Great B r it a in after the seven-years' war. The British national debt was then converted into Consols bearing a sliding rate of interest which diminished from year to year until it reached the minimum of 2 \ per cent. Consols, being repurchasable at any period, could be redeemed by the Government whenever there was surplus money The in the Treasury. That policy had been adopted by Walpole, Gladstone, Goschen, and other eminent British statesmen, so I was not in bad company. The proposal of the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) was circulated in printed form., but ho must bave received a tip to suppress it , for no more was heard of it . However, it did reveal the honourable member's belief that the loan stock should be converted into Consols. When the first Commonwealth war loan was floated at 5 per cent, the Government of the day was told that the interest was too high, and must be made the maximum, but with in six months banks, in surance companies, and building societies advanced their rate of interest by 1 por cent. Until this Parliament takes steps to remove from the market gilt edged Government securities, the proceeds of which are free of taxation, the community will never get r i d of high interest, high rents, and heavy taxation. Those costs go to the very root of the trouble regarding the disposal of f r u it and other primary products, of which the honourable member for Echuca (Mr . Hill ) complained. As much as £25 per week is paid for the rent of a shop at Circular Quay, Sydney, for the sale of confectionery and f r u it .",31
69,Mr JAOKSOX,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,That is a strong argument against the creation of big cities.,33
70,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Eve n though Sydney is the wealthiest city of Australia, that rental is too high. In Melbourne, a few days ago, £2,227 per foot was paid for land at the corner of Bourke and Elizabeth streets, with a £12,000 building upon it , which is used as a clothing shop. How can we expect to get. cheap collars, ties, shirts, and pants when such an enormous price is paid for a business site? This Government's method of converting the recent loan was one of the most disgraceful episodes that have ever happened in the administration of any Government in Australia. They issued a loan for twonty-five years at £ 5 Is. 5d., and to rectify the blunder they issued another loan for five years at £ 5 9s. 3d. They are everywhere displaying conspicuous posters, enticing the people to participate in the loan. They are offering attractive rates of interest which no commercial institution could possibly afford. If a builder contracts to build a house, he usually obtains an overdraft from a bank at 7 or 8 per cent. The other day a friend of mine settled his son on a farm, and in order to purchase a threshing machine for £200 a certain banker was approached for a loan. The banker agreed to lend the money, and paid the firm supplying the machine. When the young man met the debt, to his surprise he had to pay £23 interest for one year. No one can be expected to settle on the land under those conditions. Very few people can purchase a dwelling without mortgaging the property. When I bought a house in which to live, I was able to pay as a deposit only half of the money, and I suppose there are hundreds and thousands of people in the same position. The Prime Minister submitted to the Conference of Ministers a proposal for the collection of income tax by one authority, but, unfortunately for Australia, the State Premiers, being State Righters and inveterate opponents of Federation, refused to adopt it . The Taxation Commission, after an investigation covering a period of two years, recommended that there should be one collecting authority, viz., the Federal Government. I completely fail to understand why there should be seven collecting authorities, when one would be sufficient. No member of the Committee knows exactly what are the proposals. Within the last few days I have read in the newspapers the statements of Sir A r t h u r Cocks, of New South Wales; Sir Will i a m MCPherson, of Victoria; and Sir Henry Barwell, of South Australia, and not two of them agree. A great monetary saving would result from the unification of taxation within the States. In New South Wales the exemption is £250, with an allowance of £ 5 0 for each child. A person with four children would have an exemption of £ 4 5 0 . Under the present proposal, the Federal Government is to collect the tax on incomes of over £2,000. The Government of New South Wales will then need to adopt the Federal exemption of £156, and £30 allowance for each child, or else increase the tax on in comes from £250 to £2,000. This will affect persons who derive their incomes from professional services and from personal exertion. The Treasurer of New South Wales knows that if he in creases, the taxation on incomes he will be defeated at the next election, because the people of that State are very anxious to expel the Fuller Government. The Commonwealth Government are in an absolute muddle, and no, one knows what will result. The Tre&surer informs us that the taxation arrangement with the States will he for a few years; but why alter the machinery of taxation unless there is in view some specific and workable scheme? States are anxious that a certain section of the community paying a heavy Federal income tax shall not be similarly treated in the future. I commend to honourable members the report of the Taxation Commission, as it is worthy of their close attention. W it h in the next five years, the Commonwealth Government have loans of £250,000,000 fallin g due which must be converted. The national debt of Australia is £850,000,000, and possibly, owing to the Government's desperate effort to obtain money, it will soon £1,000,000,000, to be spread over a population of nearly 6,000,000. The Government's inability to properly administer the affairs of this country, as shown by the recent loan conversion and taxation proposals, should be advertised broadcast. The example of Great B r it a in should be followed. The Manchester Guardian is above party politics, and at all times writes in the interests of the people unbiased reports of public matters. Unless the Government mend their ways, drastic steps will be taken, such as imposition of a wealth tax, compulsory loans, or repudiation. We are piling up debts to be a burden on future generations who will curse us for our ""stupidity. The B ritish Government are determined to meet war conditions. They had a surplus of £101,000,000, and instead of reducing the income tax they have reduced the national debt. For every million of money used in this way there is £50,000 a year less to raise by taxation. I have submitted a similar proposal to the Government, and I ask them to bring down a Bill to test the feeling of this House. I am in earnest in these remarks, and I think no good will come to Australia if we allow the present loose financial situation to continue.",33
71,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Fremantle) [5.35] - I have sat silent for long enough in this Chamber, but I must apologize to honourable members because my opening remarks are to be on such an uninspiring subject as myself. I want to explain how I got here, and what attitude I intend to sidopt now I am here. I was elected as an Independent. I was perfectly f r a n k to the people who elected me. I told them that I had no party prejudices, preferences, or leanings. Some people think it is impossible for such a man to be a The politician. They say, "" Every man must have party leanings."" Well, I have none. No act or vote of mine will carry any party significance. I told the electors that I believed that parties were being developed along wrong lines. I said that on the platform, and I repeat it in this Chamber. For that reason I cannot subscribe to any party. Parties are splitting this country into two factions, and are dividing the people into two camps seriously affecting our social system. I shall go further into this subbe ject on a futur e occasion when I have found my parliamentary feet. Some of my friends have been writin g letters to the newspapers about me. I knew nothing about those letters u n t i l they were brought under my notice. Some of the letters have been derogatory to my character and to my position as a politician. Possibly I cannot take exception to the remarks respecting my character. They may be true. The remarks on my politics I care nothing about, because I am not anxious to be regarded as a great politician. Other letters, however, have been most eulogistic, and extremely embarrassing to me. A few days ago such a letter was brought under my notice by a friend, who said to me, "" L o o k at the nice things people are saying about you."" I had not seen that letter u n t i l my friend showed it to rae. I did not inspire it , and I said to my friend, "" I wish they had not written in such a way, because I shall have to crawl into my place in Parliament House feeling like a man who has been offered a cigar on the way to the scaffold."" I wish people would not write such articles concerning me. I have been sailing this old craft for fifty-nine years. I do not know that anybody is justified in saying very much good about it . The only things that may be considered good about it are that it has a certain stubbornness in a gale, aud a tendency to scud before the wind in fair weather. I do not take credit for that. So far as I know only two people in the world have much good to say about me. One of them is my mother and the other is my - wife. Even they do not always express themselves in a way that I would like. One of these letters said, in effect, '""'This man is so rigid in his independence, that he will not associate with hi3 pals in the party rooms, but keeps to himself, determined to work out his own destiny."" I wish to disabuse the minds of honourable members on that score. I can say safely that I am a conformable man, though i do not know that I am a very companionable one. There is not the slightest egotism in me. I do not consider that I am cut out to guide the destinies of Australia. help Australia. If , remaining independent of party, I am able' to do anything to justify the confidence of the people who trusted me, and sent me hero, I shall be very glad. Since I entered this House, I have been trying to get things into focus, and to find out how political worth is appraised. heard some wonderful oratory here, and I have said to myself, usefulness of honourable members is to be tested by their powers of oratory, I am gone."" I have heard some remarkably eloquent speeches, and I have said to myself : "" If honourable members are to bo tested by their eloquence, then, I must be counted out on that score."" I have thought that criticism is desired, but I dislike destructive criticism. do not want to be like Mrs Fagan's goat, which was only useful cause it was a nuisance. If that is the only way in which I can be useful I do not intend to remain in this Parliament. If I cannot serve Australia by assisting to realise some of her great ideals, I shall not stay in this Chamber, much as I like honourable members. Possibly I should explain exactly what I mean by Mrs. Pagan's goat. Mrs Fagan lived in my native town. She .had a goat. could see anything good in that old goat. It was ugly, useless, and vicious, and it had other bad qualities too numerous to mention. Wo could not understand why Mrs Fagan would not get rid of it. So far from attempting to do that, she cared for it like a mother would care for her bairns. One day one of the neighbours asked Mrs Fagan. "" Why do you keep that old goat? It is an awful thing to have around the place."" Mrs Fagan replied, "" Och, I would not sell it for love nor money. It keeps peace in the 31 r. Watson. home."" She was asked how it kept the peace. She replied, "" It keeps Mr. Fagan so busy settling quarrels with the neighbours that he has no time to get drunk or do other worse things."" I can promise honourable members that I do not intend to be like Mrs Fagan's goat. If the only way in which I can do something useful is by being a nuisance I shall soon be missing. I do not intend to become an obstructionist, or to indulge in recrimination. I shall not impute improper motives to honI wish to orable members. If I find fault at all it will be because I believe that what I say is true. I have come here as an Independent, and I intend to remain so. I am here to help Australia. If honourable members can show me how I can best help, I shall be delighted to accept their advice. If they cannot show me, or if I cannot find the way myself, I have no I have desire to remain here. I regret that I have had to spend so much time on mak"" If the ing an explanation to the Committee, but my ambiguous position seemed to demand it. I assure honourable members that I shall not become a party man until party tactics change. I would rather go right out of politics than become a strong party man under present conditions. I had some remarkable experiences during my election campaign which proved to me I how biased people can become when they are obsessed with party ideas. One be- night I must have delivered what was an exceptionally good speech for me, because - after the meeting a gentleman who was in the audience came to me and said, "" I badly want to support you, but 1 cannot."" I was rather surprised to hear him say that he wanted to support me and yet he could not. I asked him why he could not. He replied, "" Because I am a NationalNobody ist."" As he said that he puffed his chest out like a pouter pigeon. I do nob mean that remark to be derogatory to the Nationalist party. I am simply stating what happened. He also remarked, '-' You see you have said that you have no party preferences at all, and you might even follow the Labour party."" The idea shocked him. I replied, "" I shall vote for measures which I believe to be in the best interests of the country. I shall not care from whence they come."" He asked me, "" Supposing the Labour party introduced some measure which you thought would be wholly and solely in the interests of Australia, would you support it?"" I replied, "" I would catch hold of it with both hands, and do my level best to put it through the Parliament."" He said, "" There you are !. You would play right into the hands of the Labour party."" I replied, "" No , no, no! I would be playing right into the hands of Australia."" That is just my position. I believe the bias of party is a dangerous thing to this country, and that it is luring lis in the wrong direction. to support all measures which I believe to be in the interests of Australia, even if they should come from my honourable friend the member for East Sydney (Mr . West), notwithstanding that he has been drumming his ideas into my ears to such a degree that I can hardly stand up.",34
72,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Y o u are a man after my own heart!,36
73,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I ask honourable members to believe that I make these remarks in all seriousness. I shall now proceed to discuss the few points which I have been considering. I am glad that the right honourable the Prime Minister attend the Imperial Conference. I have studied Imperial relationships. Perhaps I am a little more studious than some honourable members may imagine. I believe that it will be for the immediate, and also for the ultimate, benefit of this country for our Prime Minister to attend this Conference. He is the right man to discharge that duty. I do not think any honourable member in this Committee will deny that.",36
74,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Oh yes, we do.",36
75,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I do not say it Because he is a Nationalist, nor even because he is our Prime Miuister. given some consideration to the Prime Minister's antecedents. Personally, I am a Democrat, and a bit of a Socialist. I have always had great sympathy with people who have had to struggle. But I think that the Prime Minister is the right man to go to the Imperial Conference for the following Tho two most important questions with which he will have to deal concern trade and defence. I should say that his in herited eo?nmercial instincts and business training should enable him to render Australia very valuable assistance in connection with, one of these questions, and his war experience should represent an asset to Australia in his handling of the other. Those are reasons why I think the Prime Minister is the righ t man for the job. I have been discussing with various members, whom I have learned to respect very much, the matter of the closing of Parliament whilst the Prime Minister is away. I may say that I have learned to respect every member with whom I have come into contact so far, and I have been greatly surprised I intend at the earnest desire, as far as I can judge, which animates honourable members generally to do their best for Australia. I did not expect that when I came here first. I have been told that all politicians are time-servers, and I find that they are not. I am satisfied that many honourable members, even though they have not a free leg, are a fine type of men, and Australia should derive great benefit from their services. Their division into parties is bad, because it influences them at times to support proposals in which they do not altogether believe, and to say things about the members of r i v a l parties which they will would not say but for their desire to push their own party's interests. I think this is a great pity . I do not see how anything else is possible under the party system, and I cannot blame honourable members i i i the circumstances. I cannot for the life of me see why this Parliament should be closed because the Prime Minister is going to the Old Country. I have been trying to get light on the matter. I have discussed it with the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Maxwell) and with several of the brainy men in my corner. They have many reasons to urge why the Parliament should be closed, and they I have may be right and I , a new chum to Parliament, may be wrong. I have reasoned the matter in this way: I cannot see how we caii be an important body of men if our services can be done without for forty weeks out of the fifty-two.",36
76,Mr OKEEFE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The people will think reasons: in that way, too.",36
77,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I never consider what the people think about me. I never have done so, and I never will . So far as I am personally concerned, it would be better for me to be at home than to be here. I have nothing to gaiu by being here, unless it is to learn something and pick up a few good ideas from brainier men than myself. I was going down the street the other day and saw two men mending the road. One said to the other, "" I say, Bill , the ' shop' at the top of the h ill is closing down again for about six months."" "" Oh ! "" said the other, "" T a l k about the go-slow policy, they can give us points."" The first man said, "" I see that some member of the House has been advocating the system of paying members according to the number of hours they sit. ""Would you recommend it ? "" and the second replied, "" I don't think I would, because they would all go broody."" Mr BI^AKELEY - And hatch nothing.",36
78,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I might mention i u this connection a little incideut that happened to myself. I thought I was a very important man in my own little way. I have a business which I built up myself, and which is part of my being. I really thought I was indispensable to it . I contested the Fremantle seat because of a pledge I had given, since I have no great ambition to be a politician, and I suppose I can never be a statesman, though now I am here I 'will have a cut at it . When I won the seat I was very much concerned about my business affairs. My eldest sons, who would have been left in charge of the business, had they come back from the war, are dead. I had to leave it in charge of a son of about twenty years of age, a great tal l fellow 6 f t . 2 in . in height. I have a number of old employees. They are old friends and "" cobbers"" of mine, and when I was coming away they asked me to meet them at a certain hour to say good-bye. I did so, and they presented me with a token of respect which I shall cherish to the last breath I draw. They appointed one of their number to give an address, and he gave a much better address than I could give. In that he said, "" We have had the idea that you will be very much concerned about your business affairs during your absence. We have had a meeting, and have pledged ourselves individually and collectively to do better work during your absence, so that you need have no worries concerning your own affairs whilst you are battling for your country's interests."" I am not saying this to give the impression that I am a great man, but merely as an illustration j and events have shown, as far as my business is concerned, that I might have been elected to Parliament long ago. I wish to tell the Prime Minister that if he trusts the members of this Parliament, on his return he will find them a homogeneous body who have cut out all the party humbug, and are working together in the interests of the country. If there is a member of the Committee, I do not care to what party he belongs, who would make political trouble while the Prime Minister is trying to watch Australia's interests abroad under difficult conditions, I say he is not fit to be here. I can tell the right honourable gentleman that while he is away I shall be prepared to fight to keep things going in order, and I should not care how much I had to sacrifice to do that. The right honourable gentleman will carry with him my very best wishes. I hope he will come back crowned with success for this country and satisfaction to himself, and I can wish him no more.",37
79,Mr MAHONY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Does the honourable member think that the Prime Minister will come back?,37
80,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I should like him to come back, and as Stanley Melbourne Bruce. I do not care for remote people. I think that very often a man who has ability and patriotism, and using it in the interests of his country, is spoiled by a title. I hope, therefore, that the Prime Minister will come back as Stanley Melbourne Bruce, and that we shall then get round him and help to pull Australia out of the mud.",37
81,Mr BKENNAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The honourable member is putting ideas into the Prime Minister's head that he never had before.,37
82,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"No , I am not. One of the most difficult matters with which the right honourable gentleman will have to deal is trade. I have said that his commercial 'instincts and business training should be of value to him at the Conference in dealing with trade matters. I have myself had a little to do with trade, and I say there is no sentiment in trade and business. It would, perhaps, be better if there were, and better also if there were more sentiment in politics. If we are going to pay our interest bill and make provision for paying off our national debt we must find markets, and mighty big markets, too. The Prime Minister knows that, and Australia's interests in that regard will be safe in his hands. It is necessary to be very careful in arranging trade matters. Down through, history trade has been a f r u it f u l source of difficulties and wars. I am an Empire man, absolutely loyal to the back-bone. I think we all are. But I say that whilst preferential trade within the Empire sounds all right, and may be a very good thing in many ways, we should not lose sight of the fact that no country can live altogether to itself.",37
83,Mr GBEGOKY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Driv e that in .,38
84,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Oh , no! This is not Free Trade, sir.",38
85,Mr CHAKLTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,A well-merited buke.,38
86,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I did not intend it as a rebuke, but as a statement of fact. I should he very pleased if the Empire could be entirely self-contained; but if we tried to live to ourselves altogether other nations might wish to have a say in the matter. I do not wish to refer to this matter further. It is safe in the hands of the Prime Minister. I come next to the question of defence, and I want to say here, and now, that I hate and abominate war. There are not many men in the community who have a greater reason than I have to hate war. I w i ll go still further, and say, I think, without being egotistical, that I would make as big sacrifices to prevent war as any other man. But I have not the sublime faith in human nature that some people seem to have. I wish I could have it . I wish I could believe that we need not trouble about defence, that we could devote all our energies and money to the development of this country. I fear we shall not find human nature quite so conciliatory. I once discussed this question with the best-informed man I ever associated with-unles s there is somebody here whom I do not personally know. I was a little laddie at the time, and I remember saying, "" There will be no more brutal wars; civilization has reached a point at which war is impossible."" He said, "" Get that out of your mind. Civilization is a veneer, and only a veneer, and beneath it is brutal man."" I replied, "" Well, if there ever is a war it will be fought on humane lines; human nature is loo refined now to descend to the brutal methods of the past."" To that he answered, "" The next war will be just as brutal as the old wars, just as brutal as human ingenuity can make it ; and pray God that it may never come in your time."" L it t l e did I dream that I would live to see the most atrocious, awful , fiendish war, and that my family would take such a tragic part in it . I am no warmonger or scaremonger, but I say that it is just as well to be ready. I would not for a moment agree to anything in the nature of aggression, but we should do our level best to be prepared to defend this glorious country which is our heritage. I remember once, years before the war, discussing the question with a German with whom I re- had large business relations. True, when the war broke out and my sons went away to take part in it , that German and I separated mighty quick. I can say, however, that he was a very fine fellow, and I have nothing but good recollections of the man. He was well-informed, and used to bring forward argument after argument in support of the view that war was impossible between Germany and England. He declared that England was only wasting money on her Navy. But may not that Navy again be wanted ? I believe we here should prepare, so that if danger should come, though we hope it will not, we shall be ready. Whether submarines or aeroplanes for m the best defence, I cannot say; that is a matter for the few experts among us. Now I come to the question of foreign relations. I . assure honourable members that I have enjoyed myself listening to their speeches on this subect. As I listened I thought that if I could only know as much as did th© speakers what a well-informed man I would be. Foreign relations are a most remarkable business. Apparently, the Prime Minister is expected to arrange that we shall be consulted on every little detail. That, of course, is impossible; but I think we should be consulted quickly and openly, if at any time foreign relations are likely to seriously affect Australia. Long before there is any possibility of our being dragged into war, we, and the people generally, should know all the facts-everythin g should be done in the open. But while we worry so much about external relations, would it not be well if we directed our attention a littl e more to internal matters? A f t e r all . a nation is but a conglomerate of in d i viduals- a number of homes. We have to get down to homely similes in talking on a subject like this. My experience teaches me that a man who does not make his home his first consideration and affecgrants. tion will not have a very good one; a woman who is always chasing about telling other women what they ought do, o r - I am sorry to say it-doin little backbiting, leaves her own home go to pieces. Similarly, foreign relations are very much affected by internal tions. If Ave could cut out a lot of discord",38
87,Mr BRENNAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,M in d our own busiI ness !,39
88,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Yes , mind our owii jolly business. If we could do this, our foreign relations would be so much better. Everybody respects the homeimmigrants. loving man, the home-loving woman, and the hoine-Ioving family. If we all had that home love, and had less internal disfind them. cord and conflict, we should be respected and honoured by others, and have a better chance of reciprocity in foreign relations. And the first thing to cut is party politics. As to immigration, we all agree that we should, as soon as possible, secure large, a white, and a virile population. The trouble seems to be that we are ready to receive immigrants. the election campaign I said that asking immigrants to come here at the present time was very much like asking a man home to dinner when one was get unsuitable immigrants. going to have a row with his wife. Here in Australia there is so much quarrelling and bickering, and so much division, that, apparently, we have time to make any provision for immiChinamen grants. No matter how fine your dinner, your house, and your lawns may be, i there is a domestic tiff, your visitor be sorry he came..

We are all waiting for unearned increment, rack-renting one another, and combining against one another. ",39
89,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"And honourable bers opposite are not altogether faultless. We have room in Australia for many millions of immigrants.

Since I to have been a member of this House I g a have heard-and I expect it is true; at to any rate, as true as most statements-that £ 5 commission is paid on each immigrant. relaWhether this commission is paid to the our shipping companies or to agents, or why or how it is paid, I do not know. What do know is that if this be the practice it ought to be stopped. We do not wish to buy immigrants; if we cannot make this country sufficiently attractive without paythe ing such commissions, we do not want If it is known that £5 per head is paid for immigrants, numbers of men will be found ready and willin g to These agents may be honest up to a point; excuses are easily found if £5 is "" hanging to it .

That seems to me to be about the position, and the possibilities are that under such conditions we shall Let me, in this connection, tell honourable members a story of my early days, when there was no gaol in Castlemaine-m y home townno the nearest being in Melbourne. Three were convicted for gold stealing. There were few policemen in f those days; whenever any trouble arose, will a blue jumper and cap were clapped on a man and he became a policeman the time being. When the We trouble was over, he became an ordiTwo men were commissioned to convey the Chinamen to the Melbourne, and were to be paid so much a head for the work. At the first wayside inn-at Kyneton-the three Chinamen were left outside while their custodians went in for a drink. When they memcame out again the Chinamen were gone. This, however, did not daunt the temporary policemen, for they arrested the first three Chinamen they could lay their of hands on, and brought them on to Melbourne. This may sound humorous, but there was a little of the tragic about it also. No doubt these custodians salved their consciences by saying that all Chinamen were foreigners and rogues, and ought to be in gaol anyhow. It seems to me that something of the same spirit might creep into this commission arrangement in regard to immigrants. Honourable members seem amused, but I can assure them that I am not in the slightest trying to be funny. I am telling exactly what happened. Possibly the shipping companies divide the commission with the agents; and I hope that the Prime Minister, when he goes to England, will stop the practice. If this be not the practice I am sorry to have said what I have, but as so many have spoken of it , it must exist, and it is a' disgrace to Australia. I have been the means of obtaining positions for a good many immigrants and of placing many on the land. Some appeared to me from the first to promise absolute failure. knew one man, who though he could hardly be called an immigrant, had £300 when he arrived. He acquired a farm at Bruce Rock, and there took in a partner- a foolish thing to do. He did not know much about far m in g ; he had been a music hall artist and could sing, not very well, hut, perhaps, a little better than I can, which is not saying much. H is partner also knew very little about farming, but a good deal about the public-house, and, as he had no money, the two of them were soon stranded. I am relating this story to illustrate how a man can "" b o g "" through all sorts of difficulties, and ultimately make good in Australia. The story is absolutely true, and the lesson it teaches may be useful to others - The far m plant was seized, but the ex-music hall artist was not evicted, because he had nowhere to go. Later lie reached Perth by some means; probably he stowed away in the train. He was a very fine-looking young chap, hut very delicate. In Perth he commenced to sing in the streets, and on the first night collected 15s - no t because he was a wonderful singer, but because there was a certain amount of pathos in his appearance and earnestness in his begging, and, perhaps, the people did not care to listen to him for long. ""With that los. he bought groceries and sent them immediately to his wife and kiddies. He was content to sleep in the park. A f t e r a few weeks the singing business became a bit dull, but he continued it as long as he could, u n t i l he had practically lost his voice, and then his income stopped. He next turned up at a blacksmith's shop, where he borrowed a set of small truck wheels and an axle. From my shop in Perth he begged a bacon box, and with this aud the wheels he produced a truck. In ""Western Australia there is a shrub known as the grass tree, or blackboy, the resinous butt of which, when dry, makes a very good kindling material, and is sold for Is. per bag. There was no blackboy to be got within 4 miles of the city, but this fellow pushed his truck out into the country and drugged it back over that distance. Ho was to be seen early every morning coming into the city with a load, and the proceeds from his sales he applied to the maintenance of his wife and family. Then somebody gave him a brumby. Brumbies are very plentiful in Western Australia; I honourable members will probably judge that from the class of representatives that the electors of the State send to this Parliament. He obtained a b it of harness, which with wire, rope, and string, he made more or less serviceable. He then transferred the wheels and axle to a bigger box. About the management of horses he knew nothing-hardl y on which end of the animal to put the collar. I have a paddock about 5 miles from Fremantle, and one day this fellow walked into my establishment and asked me if I would sell him the blackboy in it . I asked him who he was and what he was doing, and having heard his history, I told him he could have the blackboy for nothing and that the land would be well r i d of it . From that time onwards I followed his career closely, and later I employed him. He continued to fight through difficulty after difficulty, notwithstanding that he had to support a wife and six delicate children. One of them. I personally carried into hospital, when she was supposed to' be dying; but she is a fine healthy girl today. In the midst of his other worries he developed lung trouble. At that time he was in my employ, and the doctor who attends to my employees said, "" His lungs are touched; send him to a sanitorium and he will get better."" He was in the sanitorium for nine months, and on being discharged did not return to my employ. He said that an uncle at Home had died and left him "" a fortune. "" I naturally concluded that it amounted to a few thousand pounds at least, but I subsequently found out that "" the fortune "" was a mere £ 8 0 . W it h that money he bought a horse and dray and a little block of land in the district in which I live. On that he erected a house, which was as awkward a structure as one could ever wish to see, for he knew even less about building than he knew about farming or managing horses. But through all his troubles he battled on, and today he owns two blocks of land, a small house, and a fine horse and cart. One daughter is a school teacher-and a fine girl she is, too-and a fifteen-year-old son is doing well and bringing money into the home. Altogether this man is a fine citizen and a credit to Australia. The moral of this little story is that we should not condemn the new arrival too readily. I have observed a number of immigrants who, I am certain, will not face, difficulties legally righ t and morally wrong. as this man did ; but we must not condemn any of them until they have been given a chance. Ninety-nine persons out of 100 would have condemned the music hall artist as an impossible immigrant, and he would not have had a chance. But he had grit and won through, and there is not a finer citizen in Australia today. Sitting susjiendcd from 6.SO to S p.m.",39
90,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"During the recent election campaign I was asked to give my views on the Government's taxation proposals. I stated that I was not an expert on finance, aud could not give an opinion which was worthy of consideration. But I told my interrogators that one taxing authority would be an excellent innovation. We are all agreed upon that. It is not so bad to have one man putting his hand into your pocket as to have two, as afc present in connection with directtaxation. There is a very good principle that those who have the spending of money should have the onus placed upon them of collecting it , and I go further and say that if possible it would be a great deal better if every one who had the spending of money had to earn it .",41
91,Mr CHARLTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,There is common souse in that statement.,41
92,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The sooner we realise that, the more quickly shall we arrive at economy and effective spending. The overlapping of Arbitration Court awards is bad. At present two Arbitration Courts may make awards for the same industry, with disastrous results. I shall give an illustration. Last year some members of the Engineers Society in Western Australia applied to the Federal Arbitration Court for anew award. Other members did not desire to do so. The Federal Arbitration award gave the men less money and longer hours, with which principle I do not agree. Under the State award the men were getting more money and fewer hours. At the State Implement Works, two men working side by side would be employed under separate conditions-on e under the Federal award and the other under the State award. Of course, trouble arose. The men asked to be allowed to continue under the State award, which would expire in about six months from that time. The employers took an injudicious stand; they were They said, "" No, you asked for this award, and you will have to abide by it . ' ' The result was that these men would not work, and for six months a number of engineers in the West were out of employment, and, of course, their homes were destitute. There is too much of the "" get back at you "" spirit shown by both the employers and the employees; but the former can afford to show tolerance, although frequently they do not. The employers of labour and wealthy people generally should realise that they are the custodians of the public weal, and should therefore show tolerance to those working under them. I used not to do it , but my opinion changed as I grew older. Like wine, we improve. As I get older I get a truer perspective, and am able to focus my mind on the other man's, view. 1 can best illustrate my meaning with a story. Back in my native place a man named Pat Egan obtained a contract to cart blue metal. One day I met him stuck on the road with a big load of metal. He had a leader and a shafter, and he was akimbo across the stones, with reins in one hand and whip in the other. He was calling the horses "" spalpeens "" and using language not within my vocabulary. I was young, green, and unsophisticated. I said, "" Look here, Mr Egan, don't you think that you had better get down and give a lift at the wheel ?"" Being in a bad humour, he replied, "" Will you repeat that."" I said, "" If you get down and give a lift at one wheel and I give one at the other, we may be of some use; the trouble is that the horses plunge forward and then back, and the wheels are sinking farther into the bog."" He replied, ""Can't you see that while the beasts, are beneath me they have a just appreciation of their inferiority, and while I am above them. I assert my superiority; if I get down beside them they will take me for an equal, and divil a b it will they p u l l . "" Ultimately, he had to. get down, and I helped him to unload the blue metal. If we do not realise our responsibilities to one another and to our country, there will come a time when the State carriage will be stuck in the social bog. Now is the time to get down and give a lift at the wheel. I have now a very unpleasant duty to perform. From what I heard last session I was under the impression that the sugar position was serious. I was told by some people that the sugar-growers received too much for their produce, and that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company were profiteering, and others denied it. During the recess, I took the opportunity to visit Queensland. I thought the best thing to do was to follow the advice which was given to me when a lad by an old man, which was something to this effect: ' ' As you get older, laddie, you will find that it will not be wise to believe anything that hear, and you must accept only half of that which you see."" I went to Brisbane, and came into contact with fairly large users of sugar. They knew me, but did not know my purpose. I admit that I was a sort of private detective. I found the human element in Brisbane similar to that of Melbourne and Perth. In general conversation, I said, "" What do you think of the sugar agreement?"" They were up in arms at once, and stated that it was all wrong, that the sugar-growers were profiteering, that the workers were getting three times too much, and as for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, they were exploiting the people. To shareholders of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company I casually said, "" You are having a fairly good time."" They replied, "" No . "" said, "" Your shares have appreciated in value from £ 2 3 15s. to £ 4 5 . "" The reply was, "" It is not too bad, but it might have been better."" I met one man [92] who had retired on the money he had received for sugar lands. I am giving honourable members my experience. I am just as anxious as any of them that the Queensland industry should be maintained, and that white labour should be employed. I am not in favour of killing or injuring any industry. I wish to tell the truth for the sake of Australia. I said to this retired grower, "" What about the sugar-growers?"" He said, "" Theirs is a doubtful job, and there is nothing in it . "" He informed me that I had no conception of the difficulties associated with the work; but I said that as he had retired he must have done very well out of the land. He thereupon informed me that the Government had no right to fix the price, that they should have prohibited importations, and that if the growers had fixed the price he would have a lot more money than he then had. Later I left for the sugar districts, where I interviewed a land agent, whom I told I was from the south, and was making inquiries concerning the price of sugar land. When I asked him if he had any for sale he replied, "" Not much."" A f t e r discussing the question with him, he told me that land was available at £ 3 5 per acre, but if I required anything like a good block for sugar-growing it would cost from £ 8 0 to £ 1 2 0 per acre. I told him that I could not make sugar-growing pay at that price, and, probably because you he was an agent and anxious to sell, he said that there would be no difficulty in that respect. When I told him that the Government were not going to renew the sugar agreement I expected him to say that sugar land would be available at £ 8 to £ 1 0 an acre ; but he said that there was no occasion to worry, even if the agreement were not renewed, because there was plenty of money in sugar, and that 1 there were more motor cars per head of the population in the sugar districts than in any other part of. Australia. Feeling that it was my duty to consider the matter, I strolled along th© road, where I met a man stone-breaking, with whom I had a somewhat lengthy conversation. When I discussed with him the price he was receiving for his labour, I asked him whether it would not pay him better to I grow sugar; but he said there was littl e likelihood of that, as the land was too dear. I then asked him if he co\ild not engage in cane-cutting, because I had been told in Brisbane that men were earning £30 a week at that work. told me that he was unequal to such laborious work, but that he had two strong, virile sons, who earned on average £1 per day during the cutting season, which lasts about four months. There are occasions, I know, when cane-cutters do better, but, taking season right through, the rate I quoted is a fair average. He had been the district for thirty years, and during that time the price of sugar land had increased to a remarkable extent. I had detained him for quite an hour aftd a - half, I asked him if he accept some payment, to which he replied, "" No; I do not want anything."" I could not refrain from telling him I earned money in a much easier than he did. He looked wistfully at me paid and said, "" Are you a politician?"" I replied in the affirmative, and asked he did nob wish he were also one. answer was, "" No, I do not think I I am going home at 5 o'clock. I have brought up a large family, all of whom are good citizens, and after the evening meal the old lady and I sit before the and ruminate. To us life is very happy. I have a conscience, and I always feel that I earn what I receive."" I am not suggesting that politicians do not. I anxious that the sugar industry shall be a success, and if I found that land had depreciated in value I would say so. found, however, that quite a number workers were purchasing land at £100 acre with borrowed money, for which they were paying 15 per cent, interest. is to become of these unfortunate indiget viduals when the inevitable deflation values sets in? It is totally against best interests of the industry to capitalize land beyond its productive capacity. withstanding the information I have ceived, from what I regarded as reliable sources, I visited the bank with which have transacted business for thirty-five years, and informed the manager that I was interested in the sugar business I was anxious to ascertain the actual posicase tion. I asked him to wire to the bank's office in Batavia to ascertain the average price of the best Java sugar over a period of five years. I received a reply, but did not regard it as final. As I knew young man going to Java to represent a business firm, I requested him to go very carefully into the matter, and advise me concerning the true position. Mr Watson. He - The statement has frequently been made that had it not been for the Australian grown article our consumers would have an been compelled to pay much more for sugar during the last five years. I have done my best to ascertain what the posithe tion would have been, and from Java I the have received the average price for have superior head sugar for these years. in Superior head sugar is not equal to our 1A sugar. It is good and dry, but is not so granular as is 1A sugar. For four After years, viz., 1918-19 to 1921-22, the average price of this sugar, landed in would Australian warehouse, duty paid at £9 6s. 8d. per ton, would have been £27"" that per ton; but for the year 1920 it way would have been £57 per ton, duty Australia would have paid in the year 1920 approximately 7d. per him if lb. retail for Java sugar and 3&d. His per lb. in the other four years. do. For the years 1921 and 1922 the Australian people paid, approximately, £4,000,000 more for sugar than the imported sugar would have cost, or about fire 14s. per head of the population per annum. The experience gained during my trip, has convinced me that a grave mistake has been made, and while I do not am accuse those concerned, in the Agreement of being actuated by personal or political motives I am satisfied that many indusI tries, particularly fruit-growing, have of been unnecessarily penalized, and the per people of Australia overcharged. I say that straight out, and I believe there is What no one who can deny it, but that will not us out of the difficulty sugar-growers in are faced with in Northern Queensland, the because of the high price of sugar land. The net result has been to create an unNotwholesome and dangerous land boom, and reto unduly increase the value of the Colonial Sugar Refining shares, which I will prove, in the final result, to be not in the best interests even of the industry. as Many people are buying these lands and securities at exorbitant prices, and, in the of the land often paying abnormal interest, and when the inevitable drop in prices comes these people will suffer severely, and the industry itself will reI ceive a setback. I am satisfied that while a the cost of production may be slightly increased by white labour, it is not into creased to anything like the extent those interested in the business would have us believe. Owing to the greater efficiency of white labour it is questionable whether the increased cost for refined sugar would he more than £3 or £4 per ton, and possibly not even that. I am convinced that while the Australian people are quite prepared to pay a price for sugar that will enable the growers and refiners to employ white labour at a liberal wage, and still leave the producers a reasonable margin, based on a reasonable price for land, they are not prepared to be exploited to provide big profits for speculators and land boomers. I have dealt in generalities, and have made what might be called an academic speech. I do not pretend to be a financier, or a man with a subtle brain, but when it is a question of commerce or business I am possibly able to hold my own with some here who have had no business experience. I have tried to tell honourable members what I am, and what they can expect from me. If they think that I can give them a hand to be of service to the country I shall be glad to do so. In connection with the sugar business, I thought it my duty to give clearly the impressions I have formed, and I believe that the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) will agree that I have been right in what I have said on this subject.",41
93,Mr CORSER,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,I should like the honourable member to say whether the laud to which he referred as for sale at a high price had a crop on it that was almost ready for harvesting?,44
94,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I understand that there was some crop on the land, but it was not ready for harvesting. Mr J. FRANCIS - Was there a sugar mill on it?",44
95,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Not at all; there was uo sugar mill on it.,44
96,Mr CORSER,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,What price was Commonwealth Government paying for Java sugar when the honourable member said it was worth £57 per ton?,44
97,Mr WATSON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I gave the average price for the twelve months. I believe that the Commonwealth Government paid more than £57 per ton for Java sugar at the time referred to, but that only proves that the buyers did not know their job. I should not expect many members of the Committee to be able to buy sugar. I suppose there are not more than half-a-dozen of them who know anything about commerce. They may be great' on high finance, but when it comes down to "" tin tacks "" and the pur* chase of an article, I do not suppose they could buy a suit of clothes to advantage. I wish now to refer to the matter of preference to returned soldiers. The soldier question is a very dear one to me. There is much talk about preference to returned soldiers. I have had quite a lot to do with soldiers, and more than I hope I shall ever have to do with soldiering again. My experience has been that the true soldier, the real "" Digger,"" has not asked for undue preference at all, but for a fair deal. What he says, in effect, is: "" I have been away making the world safe for Democracy, fighting and winning a war to end all wars. I have been away for three or four years, and have come back clean out of touch with affairs here, more or less incapacitated, and with nerves disturbed, and alf I ask is that Australia shall give me a chance to get back to civil life again."" Is selling him a little house for £800 or £900, the intrinsic value of which is perhaps from £250 to £300, preference to soldiers? Is it preference to the soldier to go round the country paying landlords prices which'. have enabled them to retire, though the land had been left to them by their parents, and they could not make a living on it? Is it preference to the soldier to charge him £20 to £40 per acre for such land? No; that is not preference to soldiers, and the sooner Australia realizes that many millions must be written off the value of land upon which returned soldiers have been settled the better. An honourable member said the other night that there is no glory in war. Who knows it better than I do ? War is fiendish; it is hell! There is no glory in war, but I want to say that there is glory in sacrifice. I have have had experience which has taught me the to readjust my ideas with regard to loyalty. I do not call myself a Nationalist today, because where we expected to find Nationalism we found corruption. I am not referring now to the National party, but to people who prated of patriotism and loyalty, and, when it came to the pinch, were neither patriotic nor loyal. I know of a family in my little district who were put down as anti-British. I was president of a Relatives' Association, 1,400 strong, who got together to comfort one another should serious trouble come to any °of tliem. It was the duty of members to visit others who had lost boys at the Front. One day we got word that Mrs So-and-so had lost a son. I crawled up to her home, and when the poor old body came to the door I said, "" I have come to tell you how sorry we are, and to ask if there is any service we can render you."" She asked me to come inside, and, when we went into the room, showed me, hanging on the wall, her honour board, the photographs of four sons, all she had in the world, who had gone to the war. The father had understated his age to secure enlistment, and had gone to the Front. His photograph was in the centre between those of the four sons. The photograph of the youngest son was ou the right-hand side, and as the old mother fixed her eyes on her boy, every maternal instinct in her was shaken. I said, "" My God, I wish I could help you in your trouble, but I cannot."" She straightened up her old back and, fixing her eyes on her boy's picture, she went over every incident of his life, the first words he lisped, the first steps he took, his growth, from the puny infant in her arms to the rosy-cheeked lad, and so up to the strong young man who put his hand on her shoulder aud said, "" Mother, I have enlisted."" Then she said, "" I do not want your help, Mr Watson. He died for his country. He could not do more, and I am satisfied."" I will finish with that. There is a glory in such conduct as that. I do not care whether a war is just or unjust, I say that the man who has anything to do with promulgating war is a devil. But that does not detract in the least from the glory of sacrifice.",44
98,Mr MAKIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Hindmarsh) [8.42] We have listened with great interest to the admirable speech and entertaining wit contributed to the debate by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. Watson). I wish to refer to certain responsibilities born of the war that Australia has to shoulder, and involves our international relationships. At the Versailles Peace Conference the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. W. M . Hughes) pressed for, and accepted, on behalf of Australia, responsibility for a Mandate to govern certain islands in the Pacific. We do not fully realise the obligations the Mandate imposes upon us. I feel that it is not altogether a matter for congratulation that Australia has been given this Mandate, because all our energies and resources are required for the development of our own continent. It would have been more to the advantage of Australia if the right honourable member for North Sydney had accepted the view of President Woodrow Wilson when he proposed the internationalization of these islands, and that responsibility for their administration should be imposed upon a group of nations rather than upon one. The right honourable member was prepared to sacrifice Australia to some extent in order that he might be able to bring back some prize in the form of a practical annexation, which may yet involve us in international difficulties, because the Mandate for a ""group of islands a little north of the equator has been given to another nation to satisfy and equalize concessions in the Pacific. This has brought a nation concerning whom certain fears have been expressed, at least 2,000 miles nearer. I think that a greater measure of security would have' been afforded to Australia if the right honourable member, as the Prime Minister and representative of the Commonwealth, had been prepared to accept the proposal for the internationalization of these Mandated Territories.",45
99,Mr LATHAM,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,And have the same results as have occurred in the New Hebrides ?,45
100,Mr MAKIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"However , we have the responsibilities, and we must honourably face the situation. The determination of the Government to make the revenue of the Mandated Territory suffice for the expenditure ou administration and developmental work is ridiculous and unworkable. I was there twelve months ago and I saw the difficulties under which the Administration labours. In the last year prior to the war, Germany contributed from the Imperial Exchequer, £120,000 as a subsidy; and yet in a period of transition, when there is great difficulty in marketing copra, which is the chief product, we expect the revenue to meet all expenditure. In the case of Papua, a subsidy is provided, in order to finance developmental undertakings and afford protection to native life, thus enhancing the credit and reputation of Australia. During my visit, in May aud Juue last year, the Administration ""was negotiating for a loan from the Commonwealth Government, but it was only in the early part of this year, or some eight months later, that officials from the Territory were able, I understand, to finalize an arrangement for accommodation. Such facts as these do not add to the good name or reputation of Australia, but only prove that we are not realizing to the full the responsibilities we accepted under the Mandate. seems to me that the Mandate will prove more of a millstone than a blessing to us, for if we ai e to administer it satisfactorily we must be prepared to expend money that at present we can ill afford. The local Administration suffers from disadvantages other than financial. The housing accommodation, in Rabaul in particular, is by no means satisfactory. Owing to - this, the officials sent there were obliged to leave their wives and families in Australia, and were thus called upon to bear the expense of keeping up two homes. This is a matter which gives the Public Service of the Territory much concern, and they are most anxious that the Government shall make better provision for them. Then there are the European children to consider. Certain Ordinances regarding provision for their education have been issued since my visit, but I doubt whether a full measure of justice has been done in this respect. There are just twice as many Asiatics as people of European origin in the Territory. The Asiatic children have their own schools in Chinatown, and the natives are able, to some extent, to receive education at the various mission stations. But for European children, however, there were no educational facilities at all. There is a very genuine complaint as to the unsatisfactory character of the shipping services. Burns, Philp and Company have a complete monopoly of the trade of the islands, and the natives have named the firm the "" pirates of the Pacific."" Burns, Philp and Company, in the matter of contracts, seem able to turn the Government in any way most suitable to the firm's own ends, much to the inconvenience and dissatisfaction of the island community. More frequent mail and passenger services are required, and, under the circumstances, the Government ought to seriously consider the advisability of utilizing some of the idle Commonwealth ships. Complaint was also made about delays, in the gazetting of mining and land' Ordinances.. Delays and difficulties have the effect of bringing the administration, absolutely to a stand-still. If this iscontinued, it can only bring discredit oa the Comiuonweailth 'Government, and severely damage Australian prestige: Matters relating to native labour condiIt tions, also expropriated properties, will because of absolute need for brevity require to be left until another occasion. I regret that the present Government has not seen its way to follow the example of ' the previous Government, aud appoint a Minister or Under-Secretary to be absolutely responsible for the administration. The work is quite onerous and important enough to call for the services of a man able to devote to it the whole of his time and oversight. The previous Government set aside a Minister",45
101,Mr BRENNAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"He was "" set aside"" all right!",46
102,Mr MAKIN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"He was; but not in the manner I desire. When the previous Government made that appointment, the people of the islands were very much encouraged, for it gave them some hope for the future. However, the present Government evidently are not seized of their duty to these people in such distant parts. There is occasion for great concern; and I hope that the Government, before it is too late, will revert to the former arrangement, I welcome the suggestion that members of this Parliament may be afforded every opportunity during the recess to visit and make themselves familiar with these new possessions under the custody of Australia by a mandate from the League of Nations. It is the duty of every member to personally investigate and survey the vast Territory under their care. I should like to say a word or two of the administration as it affects the native j>opulation. A visitor to the Territory must regard the native,* and his position in life, from a different angle from that taken in Australia. Here, the attitude towards the natives of the Pacific is not altogether sympathetic. We are committed to the admirable policy of a White Australia and we realise that the in t r u sion of Pacific natives into the Commonwealth would be most undesirable - Upon this we insist and will not compromise. A visitor to the black man in his own country must look at the black man from his stand-point; we have to adopt an attitude of greater interest in his well-being and protection in his own country. Of all the white man's enterprises in the Pacific Islands, none has proved more worthy, or reflected greater credit on the white race, than that of Christian missions. But there is some unfairness associated with the affairs of the missions and the natives of which we should take notice. I shall relate the circumstances of one case which was brought to my attention. A native girl , stated by the missionaries recorded in the baptismal register, and, I am informed, supported by Dr Brent, to be eighteen years of age., and by the Administration to be under sixteen years of age, was working at a mission station, and receiving education. In accordance with native custom, she had been sold by her parents to a rative, whose wife 6he therefore became. When a native desires to marry a girl, he bargains with the parents for her, and if an understanding is arrived at, she passes into his possession after certain payments have been made. The girl's wishes in many instances are not consulted at all. This girl had by her association with the mission acquired a higher standard of civilization than prevailed in her native village, and when her husband, or purchaser, claimed her, she was not prepared to go with him. All this time, so the mission authorities intimate, the gir l was given every freedom to take the course she desired, and she sought the protection of the Mission. The native thereupon complained to the district officer at Kaewieng, who wrote to the mission, and demanded that the g i r l be handed over to her native husband. He set out the following reasons why the gir l should be required to go back to the primitive village life, and forego all opportunity of furthering her interest in the Mission, and. progressing towards a civilized and Christian l if e I have carefully investigated the above case, and find as follows:1. The Mary is apparently well under sixteen, and therefore cannot be held at your Mission without the consent of her parents. Mr Makin. (Such consent should have been obtained in .the first place, vide N.L.O., section 62 (1), and (1) (a) Amendment, 1921.) 2. The Mary admits her parents wish the marriage to take place. . 3. She has heen bought and paid for according to native custom by her prospective husband. 4. The fact as to whether she is willing OT not is immaterial. 5. Although under sixteen, she has reached the age of puberty, and is fit for marriage according to native custom. . 6. The fact as to what religious marriage ceremony takes place (if any) does not affect the matter, my duty being to take cognizance of native marriage only, the religious portion (if any) not being material. I take particular exception to paragraph 4. Although the officer stated that the g i r l was still under the control of her parents, he still considered her the property of the husband who had bought her, and demanded that she be handed over. Upon the matter being referred to the Administrator, in Rabaul, he upheld the district officer's decision. However, to overcome the difficulties in this case, he said, in the course of a letter to the missionaries, on the 28th December, 1921In the case of Mananok, I have decided that, ailthough she does not come under oategory No. 2, she will be handed over to the district officer, who Swill act as her guardian for three months, at the end of .which period the case will be again referred to me. Category No. 2 included "" the native who had reached a certain stage towards habits of life and education similar to an Asiatic or European."" A series of three groups that the Administrator admitted in his correspondence should govern marriage among natives. Notwithstanding that he had undertaken that the girl would be handed over to the district officer for three months, at the end of which the case would again come up for review,, the Administrator wrote to the Mission on the 18th January, 1922Since writing my reply of the 28th ultimo, I have received a further radio from the district officer Kaewieng, advising me that Mananok states that she was at the Mission for one year only, and is now living with her parents at their village. In view of the short time Mananok was with the Mission, and as she has elected to return to her people and the pure native life, the intention to hand her over to the district officer, as expressed in the last paragraph of my letter of the 28th ultimo, will not now be carried out. That means that this girl has been forced to accept a marital relationship which was repugnant to her. There are contradictions in the facts presented by the A d ministration and the Mission respectively. I consider that whilst it is desirable to observe native customs, any native gir l who embraces a higher standard of life, through the opportunities afforded her by a mission, should nob be forced back into the primitive village life, and above all that every man or woman, whether native or otherwise, should have a full and free choice to determine their wish in any marriage contract to which they are required to be a party. Mr Cardew, who is in charge of native affairs in the Mandated Territories, is a most capable and sympathetic officer, and we are fortunate in having the services of a gentleman of his undoubted ability and valued experience; but, unfortunately, he has not the administrative power that he should have. Too many cases, such as the one I have mentioned, are dealt with by the Administrator or his secretary, who cannot, perhaps, appreciate the difficulties involved as could a more experienced officer like Mr Cardew. I protested to the Administration in Rabaul against certain undesirable features of the case I have related, I was coolly told that I did not "" think sufficiently black "" upon these matters. It is regrettable that time will not permit me to place on record the full corresponconduct dence, but I advise members to peruse the departmental file dealing with this case, which I have endeavoured honestly to briefly record. I desire that the people in the Mandated Territories, whether they be white, black, or brown, should receive the most humane treatment, and that wise administration will add to their comfort and progress, and give added lustre to the international prestige of Australia. I hope that the administration in futur e will not be such as to cast doubt upon the sincerity of the Commonwealth in professing to administer the affairs of the Islands with sympathy and justice.",46
103,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Swan) [ 9 . 1 1 ] - I gratulate the honourable member for mantle (Mr Watson) on his maiden speech this evening, and we ourselves are to be congratulated upon having Commonwealth Government amongst us a new member who is unSteamers doubtedly sincere and full of courage, and resolved to do his utmost to in sure that the legislation of this Parliament ment shall be in the interests of the whole of the people. The honourable member certainly has made a name for himself to-night, and I am confident that the people in Western Australia have in him a true friend and helper. It is hardly necessary to impress upon the Government the need for further economy in administration. We cannot ignore the great increase that has taken place in the public debt, and the fact that during the next few years large sums of loan money will have to be converted at a. higher rate of interest than the Commonwealth has paid previously. That will necessitate not only economy, but higher taxation. W it h increased borrowing and a heavier interest bill , in addition to sinking funds, the Commonwealth will have a very big liability to meet, and we must slow down in expenditure, and try to develop our industries in such a way that we may be able to honour our obligations. I regret that honourable members opposite, while finding so much cause for criticism in connection with the Government's trading operations, are yet continually urging them to persevere in When those transactions. I hope that the Government will shut down entirely on trading, operations. It is manifestly unjust bo the taxpayer that the people's money should be invested in industries that will compete with the enterprises of the men who are paying the taxation. And when the of huge business concerns is in trusted to public officials who have had no special training for that class of work, it is not surprising that they do not prove successful - There have been numerous attempts at State trading in the States as well as in the Commonwealth, and nearly every one has proved a failure. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will withdraw from such enterprises.",48
104,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,We are doing our best.,48
105,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I am quite content with what the Government have done in regard to trading operations, including the Commonwealth Shipping Line. I conrealize that it would be wrong at this Fremoment to endeavour to dispose of all the ships in the Government fleet. I should have been glad to see the Line of disposed of even at a loss. Y e t I can quite understand the Government wishing to continue it under the manageof a Board. The Shipping Line might hf successful if political influence were not exercised in its control, but, fiom experience, I know that to be impossible. One Minister may have good intentions, but the, next wishing to get a good name will allow political influence to become rampant, and the trading concern may go to the dickens.",48
106,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The best thing is to keep it out of the Shipping Combine.,49
107,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The venture will be absolutely useless if it joins the Shipping Combine.,49
108,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Does not the honourable member consider it will assist the primary producer to market his produce ?,49
109,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"No . This Parliament will have granted so many concessions, such as high rates of wages and improved working conditions, that the Line will be unable to compete with private companies trading with the Old Country, and paying much lower rates of wages.",49
110,Mr WEST,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The Commonwealth vessels will be made safe for travellers.,49
111,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"They will not be made safe. If I had time. I would show the need for the reform of the industrial affairs of this country. We live in a fool's paradise, and the sooner we realise it , place this country in a position to compete with other countries, the better. . Generally, I compliment the Government on the Budget, although I have one complaint to make concerning it . A mistake has been made in placing one or two items in the expenditure of last year for which no authority has yet. been given. Concerning the Tariff Board, things are being done today outside the responsibility of Parliament, which under its control would never have happened. I am always prepared to give way to the decision of Parliament; but we should demand the absolute control of the public purse. This is essential, because we have a recollection of the large expenditure incurred by the ex-Prime Minister (Mr. W. M. Hughes), without first submitting proposals to Parliament. During the war in many cases this was necessary, but it is not so now. No large commitments should be made without Parliament being first consulted. We are all agreed that there should be one tax-collecting authority in Australia, and that either the State or the Federal authorities should collect the income tax, and, if possible, the land tax as well. But whatever action is taken, care must bo given to see that returned soldiers do not suffer. I am doubtful as to the wisdom of dispensing entirely with the per capita payments. There will still be two collecting authorities. It is a mistake to have a separate land tax collecting authority, and arrangements should be made for one authority to take that in hand as well. When Federation took place, a great future was predicted for Australia. We were to get rid of the Customs duties between the States, and there was to be Free Trade throughout Australia. Difficulties of finance arose, and it was decided that for the first ten years the States should receive three-quarters of the total receipts from Customs and Excise. Later the per capita payment was arranged for, whereby the States received 25s. per head of population. A section of unificationists in this Parliament desires to destroy the finances of the States. I am personally a Federalist. The closer home rule is brought to the people the better will be the government. The National. Parliament should deal with national affairs, and social, and local government should be left as much as possible to the and people themselves. The people of Western Australia are very much perturbed because the finances of that State have been greatly disturbed by the high Tariff imposed by the Federal Parliament. Western Australia, which has made the greatest sacrifices in the Federation, is making the greatest effort of all the States to settle people on the land, and one or two very good systems have been adopted. We have been very successful in the south-west of Western Australia., where there are a number of group settlements composed of local men, and men from the Old Country. Subject to certain conditions, they have a great future before them, particularly in regard to markets. The working of the Tariff is greatly hampering their successful settlement. The great majority of the people in Western Australia are Federalists. If there is any desire on the part of the Unificationists, who are associated with the Government, to injure the financial position of the States, Western Australia will make a big effort for secession. During the last few years the people there have become very dissatisfied, and in any agreement which is made between the States and the Commonwealth concerning the financial proposals, care must be taken to see that the States finances are not unduly disturbed. The States provide for the every-day needs of the people. Let us take the enormous revenue of the Commonwealth and analyze it , and ask ourselves how much of this is returned to the people, how much is spent in education and in assisting to get produce to market, to build railways, and to provide other facilities? Outside of ;the Post Office what does the Commonwealth do for the people ?",49
112,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,There is a large expenditure for defence purposes.,50
113,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"There is an expenditure on defence, and also a large expenditure in interest on the great war debt. Even before the war the Commonwealth was spending large stuns of public money,. and the States received very little assistance for country telegraphic and telephonic communication unless the people concerned agreed to pay for it . I wish to congratulate this and former Governments for the efforts they have made, during the past four or five years, to increase the facilities for communication given to the people in the back country. I am slightly at variance with those advocating the new States movement. They should come out in the open and state whether they wish to build on the Federal or Unification system. Statement after statement has appeared in the press advocating greater powers being given to the Federal Government by an amendment of the. Constitution, to enable the creation new States. If the Federal system is to be continued, the States will not object to an alteration of their territories to provide for the creation of new States on terms to be approved of by this Parliament. If by this means we could encourage population to the north-west of Western Australia. I would welcome such a movement, and do my best to assist it. We would be quite justified in agreeing to the creation of a new State at one of the great outposts of the white people of Australia. I do not think there would be any grave objection from Western Australia; but it is of no use beating about the bush and asking for an amendment of the Constitution that will have no practical effect. Action must be taken within the States. It has been proposed that there shall be certain amendments made to the Constitution. In chapter S, under the head of "" Alteration of the Constitution,"" it is clearly laid down under what conditions amendments of the Constitution can be made. It is there statedNo alteration diminishing the proportionate representation of any ' State in either House of the Parliament, or the minimum number of representatives of a State in the House of Representatives,' or increasing, diminishing, or otherwise altering the limits of the State, or in any manner affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation thereto, shall become law unless the majority of the electors voting in that State approve of the proposed law. We cannot alter the original representation of the States in the Federal Houses of Parliament. Parliament has not the power to alter the boundaries of a State without the consent of that State.",50
114,Mr BOWDEN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Unless the Constitution is amended.,50
115,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,It cannot be done even by amending the Constitution. The only method is to repeal the existing Constitution and have a new one framed.,50
116,Mr STEWART,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Does the honourable member think that new States are possible under those conditions?,50
117,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"If there were sufficient people in the northern part of Western Australia, for instance, to warrant the formation of a new State there would be no objection to a new State being formed if it were constitutionally possible, that is, if the State agreed. The of formation of new States would not be the means of destroying our existing industries, but would probably tend to build up other industries. It is not a question of whether we desire new States, as our constitutional powers arc limited.",50
118,Mr MCNEILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The Constitution can fUU.Gllcl.Gcl.,50
119,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The boundaries of an existing State cannot be altered even by means of a referendum unless the approval of that State has first been obtained.,50
120,Mr MCNEILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,But the boundaries can be altered if a majority of the people in a particular State agree.,50
121,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Yes . This question must be decided in a State Parliament. Other sections of the Constitution can be amended, but the people of 2430 Budget, [REPRESENTATIVES.] that State have to agree before the boundaries of a State can be altered. I have referred briefly to the position in - which Western Australia is placed under the new financial proposals, and I should like to know whether it is not practicable for the Government to adopt a bookkeeping system for twelve months to show the position in which a particular State is financially placed. Under present conditions Western Australia is contributing enormous sums through the Customs, and is not receiving any commensurate return. We have enormous areas to develop, the wheat belt in Western Australia is larger than the whole of Victoria.",50
122,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Is it all under cultivation?,51
123,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"No , it is in the. early stages of development, and the settlers there, in common with those in other newly-settled areas, are encountering difficulties and expense in obtaining water. Some time ago I made a fairly long trip through the eastern portion of Western Australia, and on several occasions I twitted some of the settlers on the fact that, although they possessed motor cars, the provisions made for' water were most primitive. They were carrying on their operations fairly successfully merely because they have obtained high prices for wheat, but the prices realized during recent years are not likely to be maintained. The settlers in the newly-opened areas will have to engage in mixed farming, and should later be able^-althoug h it will take some time - to produce butter, milk, cheese, bacon, ham, and fresh and dried fruits. From a large area in Western Australia currants, equal .to those produced in any other part of the world, are being exported. It is costing an enormous sum to develop newly-settled areas, because those engaged in the work have to be assisted, and are not like our hardy old pioneers. Their efforts will be attended with success if we can only find markets for their produce. I trust it is not the intention of the Government to keep hidden in the archives of the Customs Department the document containing the offer made by the Canadian Government in relation to trade reciprocity. What is being done in this matter? I have read the speech of Mr Fielding, the Minister 1923-24. for Finance in the Canadian Government, who said that an offer had been made to the Commonwealth Government, and that they are prepared to give us special concessions in connection with the importation of currants and dried fruits. Why are we not told what offer has been made and what Canada is asking in return? I am looking to the time when the machinery required for the development of our lands will be available at the price at which it can be. obtained by a Canadian farmer. The supply of agricultural implements at a reasonable rate is the only means by which rural development can possibly progress. The value of the development of secondary industries in the Commonwealth, according to the statistical abstract for 1922, was £324,000,000. The added value was £118,000,000, and of that £46,000,000 went to New South Wales and £40,000,000 to Victoria. That added value has arisen as a result of protection. Queensland, also, gets special protection, and, surely a White Australia policy is as necessary in the west as in the east. I direct honourable members' attention to a very striking paragraph in the Tariff Board's report, which states that it costs more to send goods from Adelaide to Fremantle than from Fremantle to Great Britain. We are living in a fool's paradise. Have honourable members given a moment's attention to the excessive port charges imposed on a vessel visiting, say, Melbourne? The following statement may be of interest: PORT CHARGES-MELBOURN E 1021. Tonnage of vessel-gross , 9,512; net, 6,099. Arrived in Port of Melbourne with 1,037 tons of cargo. Stay in port, 64 hours.

Local industry could not live for a day without high protection and a local market, as Australia has no overseas market for her manufactures at present. Prior to the imposition of high duties we were exporting from Australia, and even today-we ought to be able to trade in agricultural machinery. In 1913 £190,000 worth of implements was exported, but when high Tariff duties were imposed our exports dropped right down to about £20,000 worth in 1920. The boot industry in Victoria has been protected for forty years, but a fortnight ago I was astounded to read that the manufacturers were working on short time.",51
124,Mr LISTER,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Owing largely to importations.,52
125,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"We should not be importing, as the Australian manufacturers should install the best possible machinery to enable them to compete with manufacturers overseas.",52
126,Mr MAXWELL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,What connection is there between the imposition of high Tariff duties and our inability to export.,52
127,Mr GREGORY,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The existence of Combines and industrial conditions generally have destroyed the best that is in our operatives, and manufacturers are now unable to compete. Reference has been made to the sugar industry; hut we can easily go too far in providing protection to the producers of this commodity. We have already gone too far, as the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Watson) mentioned, in placing an embargo on imported sugar. With additional population our secondary industries will expand, and increased employment will be found in meeting the local demand. The following newspaper 5 0 paragraph is of interest:5 0 A suggestion to run British industry on the 4 4 0 lines of Henry Ford's Detroit factory is con2 10 0 tained in a Times leader, which expresses the 18 0 opinion that payment by results and not piecework is the real solution of Britain's industrial 0 difficulties. "" There is no charity about Ford's system, under which a man is paid extra on a scientifically devised scale for what is done and produced above the required standard, because he 3 10 is worth it,"" says The Times. ""Mutual confidence is the only durable basis of good relations between employers and workers. That confidence exists at Ford's factory, which is run on a prosperity-sharing plan, and productivity, efficiency, and high wages are the results."" "" If British industry is to secure a new lease - of prosperity, it must be run on those lines, with the co-operation of the trade unions, the simplification of the union system, and the institution of a general system of payment hy results. "" There lies the real hope of Britain's ability to sell goods on the open market."" A Canadian gentleman informed me the other day that in going into the yard at a stove factory he saw a number of motor cars. He said to the proprietor, ""You must employ a very expensive staff here judging by the number of cars."" He was then informed that they did not belong to the staff, but to the workmen, and that if a visit were paid to the yard on a Saturday he would probably see forty cars. It is not a question of what men are being paid, but whether they aredoing their best for the remuneration they receive. In the Census Bulletin, Mo. 18, the following paragraph appears:As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the primary producers have ceased to be the most numerous of the occupational classes. In 1911 the primary producers numbered 586,148, or 29.9 per cent, of all the breadwinners, and although the numbers increased to 598,604, this greater number represented only 25.8 per cent, of the breadwinners in 1921. The number of persons engaged in agriculture increased by 18.5 per cent., which was sufficient to increase slightly the proportion which the agricultural workers bore to the total breadwinners in 1911. The number engaged in the pastoral industries declines from 151,861 to 142,080, or by 6.4 per cent. The number engaged in mining was less in 192.1 by 39,043, or 36.9 per cent., having fallen to 66,761 from 105,804 in 1911. The number engaged in the pastoral industry increased from 151,000 to 102,000, or by 6.4 per cent. The number engaged in mining was less in 1921 by 39,043, or 36.9 per cent., than it was in 1911, the falling off being from 105,804 in 1911, to 66,761 in 1921. Tbat should be eudugh to make people think. I intended to quote the railway returns to show, approximately, the increases in tonnage carried, and the enormously increased cost in the handling of products; but I have not time to go into those matters. I had taken out some figures with regard to the jam industry. I point out that one firm that had a great name in Australia, and helped to btiild up the fruit industry of this country-that of Henry Jones and Company, of Tasmania-at no time asked the Government for protection in any shape or form. The firm's products were first class, and were sent to every part of the world. Now we have all sorts of Government interference, and our statistics show that in 1916 the value added to goods in the factories through labour costs of production, interest, and so on, was £856,000; whereas in 1921, in treating approximately the same quantity of fruit, the added factory value was £1,797,000. Is it any wonder that the fruit growers despair of the future? say we are living in a fool's paradise. At present, things look fairly well. Our export figures look all right until they are analyzed. If we take out quantities and values, we will see that very few industries show any progress whatever. We have been getting high prices for our pro- bate. ducts at Home, but those high prices will not be maintained in the future. When the values of our products come down, we cannot expect to continue industrial conditions as they exist in Australia at the present time. They cannot be kept up; and the sooner we endeavour to bring employer and employee together to organize better industrial conditions and cheapen the cost of production and the cost of livarguments used on either side? ing, the better. There is profiteering in this country .which should be prevented. I know that there are Combines here. I do not by any means throw all the blame upon the workers of the country. doubt, honourable members saw in the newspapers the other day that a baker brought a miller before a Court because he would not supply him with good flour. The evidence showed that, because the baker refused to charge as much for his bread as other bakers, he was supplied with bad flour. That is the only inference Mr Gregory. I could draw from the evidence. The State and Commonwealth Governments should endeavour to put down the Combines that are arising in our midst, and that are a danger to this community. I hope that the Government will make arrangements for a. conference between employers and employees to bring about industrial conditions under which the worker will be able to give of his best, and we shall have no "" go-slow"" movement, and no union regulations preventing men taking piece-work. I hope that conditions of employment will be agreed to such as are found in Canada, where a man who is expert in his trade may possess his own motor car, and be a gentleman in his own particular industry. If matters arc allowed to drift as they are drifting today, the time will come when we shall have most serious distress in Australia, and when, unfortunately, the worker will have the worse of it. I make these remarks more in the interests of the worker than of any one else. I hope that some organization will be arrived at to secure I cheaper living and better conditions for the people of this country. We must have Tariff reform, and non-interference by the Government in our industries.",52

We sent 400,000 men - overseas, and 300,000 of rethem were drawn from industry. They represented the virile manhood of the They were occupied for four years in destroying humanity at the behest of the very forces which we comwe cannot control in this Parliament.

We withdrew from industry counin Australia 300,000 men, and yet we can be have never experienced a period of greater prosperity owing to"" the beneficent Protecseasons enjoyed by the primary producers. Their only difficulty is that they cannot get as much out of things as they want to get. We have had an illustration of that in the references by the honinorable member for Fremantle to the price emof sugar lands. I believe the story of that member as to the real position goods of the sugar business. The same thing applies to every other industry in the There is profiteering in this country, and the profiteers give allegiance only to their own interests. That is revealed by the statistics of the country. Let us consider the area under wheat production. I believe that it was 3,000,000 if acres more in 1917-18 than the area merely under wheat today.

137,Mr YATES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"But why? There was a land boom once in Victoria, in consequence of which many men went through the Insolvency Court. In 1913-14, when there was the worse drought we ever had, there were only 24,000,000 bushels reaped, but the next year the result was 179,000,000 bushels, as against 103,000,000 the previous record. the year following that, the crop was 156,000,000 bushels, the next year 145,000,000 hush-els, and the next year 116,000,000 bushels. Then the crop dropped to 75,000,000 bushels, when it was said there was a drought. giving these figures from memory, but I am open to bet that they are right. Why all this calamity howling about Australia as an awful place to live in ? The people are doing too jolly wellthat is the position. But they want to do better, and, because they cannot attain the high altitude they did during the war, they are beginning to squeal. I remember once meeting in Adelaide a business man, and an old friend of mine, who got his first rise from a lucky h it at Tattersall's. We had a conversation about trade conditions, and the demands of trade unionists. He, knowing what I was and what I stand for, said, "" When are your chaps going to stop? They get a couple of ' bob ' rise, knock an hour' off their time, and then they come and ask for more."" "" Yes, that is quite so; but I remember your starting business with a shop, now you have another shop with two fronts, and I should like to know whether, if you had a chance of buying out Foy and Gibson's next year, you would do so?"" To this he said, "" Yes,"" and then I asked, "" And when are you going to stop ?"" When do these business men ever stop?

That is the fate of many men, good season or bad season, whereas a man on the land, presuming his land is any good at all , has only to have two or three good seasons, when he becomes comparatively affluent, and may ride about in his motorcar.

144,Mr YATES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I take it that the honourable member sincerely believes that. But I have been drawn off my theme, which is the Budget. This Budget is just the same as any other Budget. I do not say that from any personal knowledge gained by dissecting it and comparing it with the Budget of last year. I speak on the authority of the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes), who tells us that there is nothing new in the Budget, and even says that what the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) saya is, really is not. This must make the people outside wonder; and in my opinion it is juggling with the financial system, which will have to be altered before we can get any redress or benefit. The honourable member for Angas (Mr . Gabb) has shown us what will be the result of this kind of juggling. The financial system of today is closely approximating to a pyramid balanced on its apex, and is likely to f all at any time. There is no doubt about the policy of the Labour party. During this debate every honourable member has talked politics, with the exception of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Watson), who honestly told us what he really thinks, and showed things as they really are.

If ever the Labour party returns to power it will be as a Labour party, with no admixture cf Nationalist or Country members. policy of the Labour party is already in print, and ready for the public. Our idea is that majorities must rule, and it is by that means that our policy is arrived at. We always come out in the open. I desire to address myself to one or two subjects that are dealt with in the Budget. In one matter to which I invite attention, namely, the revenue from the duties of narcotics and stimulants, I hope I shall have the friendly interest of the honor the same extent as if I were advocating the abolition of the duties on agricultural machinery. I especially impress on the honourable member for Boothby (Mr . Duncan-Hughes) that last year the in crease in revenue from stimulants and narcotics was £8,108,320. The point I wish to make is that this impost, in the main, falls upon the working classes.",56
146,Mr COOK,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The Tariff has increased - the cost of living generally.,56
147,Mr YATES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I do not think that the Tariff is to blame for everything. I remember reading the report of a deputation that waited upon the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Austin Chapman) a few days ago, complaining that roofing tiles were practically in the hands of a Combine, and that builders could not get supplies at a reasonable price. I think the Minister threatened that if certain allegations were proved definite action would be taken.",56
148,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,It was not a threat; it was a warning.,56
149,Mr YATES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Perhaps it was; but I fancy I can see the Minister waving his 3tick when he issued the warning, and i m plying that if the Combine did not desist the stick would come down-and pretty heavily, too, I hope. The same influences are at work in connection with the supply of bricks, lime, and cement. The big business men are responsible. I challenge honourable members supporting the Government to prove otherwise. If what I am saying cannot be disproved, the responsibility must rest upon them, since they - represent that element in the community. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr . Watson) also quoted a case in point, mentioning the action of certain millers who declined to supply flour to retail establishments except under certain conditions. The ramifications of these Bings extends throughout Australia, and, in the words of the honourable member for Wentworth The (Mr Marks), I ask honourable members opposite, "" What about it ? "" These difficulties were existent prior to the war, but the war furnished the opportunity for further exploitation of the people, and the position since then has become infinitely worse. As honourable members are aware, we desired to alter the Constitution to give the Government power to deal with Trusts and Combines. We also wished to insure that the Tariff should not operate in such a way as to benefit manufacturing industries only. tunately, sufficient lies were told to induce a. majority of the people to vote against the proposal to alter the Constitution in the direction I have indicated.",56
150,Mr COOK,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Did not members of the honourable member's party oppose that referendum ?,57
151,Mr YATES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"We opposed the jerrimandering of the proposals. In essence they were not identical with the amenda ments agreed upon when the ex-Prime Minister (Mr W. M . Hughes) was member of the Labour party. Had they rises. been, every member of the party would have been behind them. I believe certain members of my party were in favour accepting the proposals as an instalment, num. although they were not all that we required. I opposed them then, and would do so again. I believe it is no ""use adopting half measures in connection with the alteration of the Constitution in relation to industrial powers. I join issue with honourable member for Boothby in conloans nexion with the proposed increase of age pensions.. Many of these pensioners who now require this assistance'' in their old age have contributed heavily to Customs and Excise revenue by their use of narcotics and stimulants. As matter of fact, I believe we have got direct taxation. from them more than they will receive in the way of pension payments. that At one time. I was not strong enough mind or character to talk as I am talkat ing now; I was foolish enough to drink sufficient intoxicants to float a ship. not think the honourable member for Boothby was fair to the old-age penfinance sioners, or those who may qualify for ponsions, when he said that the Commonsystem wealth cannot afford to provide the money. He pointed out that the bill old-age pensions amounts to £5,400,000; and for the maternity allowance, £690,700. If the cost of war pensions is added, amount is increased to £13,000,000. old-age pension is merely a partial pense to the old people who have perienced the stress and trouble of rearthe ing families, and who, by their efforts, have developed the Commonwealth into the splendid country it is today. Throughout their lives they have been taxpayers according to their circumstances. All have contributed to the revenue of the country through Customs and Excise duties; and those who earned an Unfor- income above a certain amount made a further contribution through the income tax. Our loan indebtedness' involves the Commonwealth in an annual interest bill of £21,075,943. If to that is added the £911,000 paid in interest on moneys loaned to the States, the total interest paid by the taxpayers of the Commonwealth is £21,986,943. That interest is certain income for those who have lent the money; they know that it will be paid a on the due date as surely as the sun In addition, the States pay £21,37.6,390 in interest each year, making the total interest bill of the Commonof wealth and States £43,363,333 per an",57
152,Mr COOK,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,How much of the capital expenditure it represents is reproductive?,57
153,Mr YATES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"That is a big question. I am inclined to think that very little of the borrowed money returns sufficient in the come to pay the interest bill. The war are not productive. Waterworks olddo no more than pay interest, and the railways do not give even that result. As a matter of fact, almost the whole of the interest payment comes out of Consolidated Revenue, which is represented a mainly by Customs and Excise duties, and Does the honourable member for Indi know of one railway line pays interest on the capital expendiin ture? I shall not delay the Committee this stage in further discussing the public debt, to the continuance of which I do I am entirely opposed; but I shall later state my views as to how Commonwealth should be managed. The present is out of date, and must be changed. At the outbreak of the great for war, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach told the people of Great Britain that it was immoral to continue the old system of borthe rowing in order to conduct the war, and The that a new system of finance would have recomto be evolved. That remark applies exequally to the Commonwealth. I claim attention of the Treasurer for a few minutes while I seek enlightenment in regard to one passage in Ms Budget speech. The honourable gentleman saidSome minor alterations are intended in relation to inmates of benevolent asylums and hospitals. Where the inmates are at present in receipt of 4s. a fortnight, the payments will be raised in September next to 6s. a fortnight. Up to the present, the allowance has been paid only to those inmates who were pensioners .before entering the asylums. In future, all the inmates will receive the 6s. a fortnight, provided that they have qualifications which would entitle them to pensions if resident outside. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr . Duncan-Hughes), referred to the Minda Home in South Australia, and I am very curious to know whether that paragraph will apply to the inmates of that institution. If any person is entitled to a pension he is the chronic invalid. I interpreted the Treasurer's statement to mean that the inmates of Minda Home will benefit from the liberalization of the pension.",57
154,Dr EARL EPAGE,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,If that home is a benevolent asylum its inmates will be qualified for the increased payment.,58
155,Mr YATES,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"It is conducted through the benevolence of the people of South Australia, subsidized by the Government; but it is riot a State institution like the Old Men's Home or Destitute Asylum in Adelaide, or the Home for Consumptives. It comes under the same category as the Old Men's Home, at Beaumont, Adelaide. In Minda Home are gathered invalids who cannot fend for themselves, and I hope that the Treasurer will see that they benefit by the increase in the pension.",58
156,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Parkes) [10.39] - Mr . Chairman,58
157,Mr CHARLTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"If the honourable member speaks now, the compact to terminate the debate at 11 o'clock is off, and no more such compacts will be made.",58
158,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The interjection is rather uncalled for, because no member occupies less time in speaking in this chamber than I do.",58
159,Mr CHARLTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Honourable members opposite refused to speak last night. If the honourable member for Parkes speaks, honourable members on this side will be at liberty to continue the discussion to the limi t of time allowed by the Standing Orders. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member for Parkes is a member of this Committee, and as such he has a perfect right to speak without interruption. [93]",58
160,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Eo r no Budget that has been presented to this Parliament has more time for discussion been allowed than for this. I have a perfect right to speak. The Opposition occupied nineteen hours in this debate yesterday.,58
161,Mr CHARLTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,The honourable member knows that an arrangement was made to allow the members of the Opposition to speak.,58
162,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,No compact was mad» to prevent members on this side from speaking. Honourable members opposite know that my remarks' would occupy but ten minutes of the time of this Committee. I wish to refer to the economic position of the world.,58
163,Mr CHARLTON,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,I call attention to the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.'],58
164,Mr MARR,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I wish to deal with the trade of countries immediately adjacent to Australia. The debate on the agenda for the Imperial and Economic Conferences indicated that in relation to the world's trade Australia was in a critical position. The disposal of our surplus produce is of vital i m portance to this country. The Govern. ment should realise the necessity for opening up markets in ' the East. As Central Europe is closed to the trade of Australia, we must look to countries in our vicinity in which to market our surplus produce. I am opposed to the creation of any new Commissionerships. We should follow the example of the Canadian Government, and establish exhibition halls in the markets of the Eastern countries. The Canadian Government have one at Shanghai, wherein their products are exhibited. Their merchants visit the . various countries where a market may be found, and make their own selling arrangements. A co-operative institution, representing the primary and secondary industries of Australia has recently been established. The object is to obtain markets in the East and other countries adjacent to Australia. This cooperative company should be encouraged. It has three men operating 'n th-*. East--at Shanghai, Singapore, and Batavia. There is also an exhibition at Bandoeng. The Commonwealth Government should establish exhibition halls at various centres outside Australia, in order to advertise its products. This Government should assist this Australian cooperative company in the same way as the Canadian Government finances Canadian organizations. Herbert Hoover, the Secretary for Commerce in the United States of America, dealing with co-operative marketing, statedCo-operative marketing associations should receive the encouragement of Governments, because they make for economic distribution and for stability in markets and marketing. They bring about an improvement in the quality of the products handled co-operatively, and save waste. One item of particular interest and importance to Australia is the proposed scheme of national insurance. It should be introduced as soon as we can bring it about. If a Commission is appointed,, it should submit to this House arguments pro and con based upon experience gained in other - countries. That would be of great benefit to honourable members, and would assist them in devising a sane and satisfactory system.",58
165,Mr COLEMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,Reid) [10.46] - At the .outset of my remarks I desire to enter an emphatic protest against the attempt which is being made by the Government to bludgeon this Budget through.,59
166,Mr HILL,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"If the Government bludgeoning the Budget through, the honourable member would not now be talking,",59
167,Mr COLEMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The Opposition entered into a compact with the Government to close this debate at 11 p.m., on the understanding that we would have a full opportunity to discuss the Budget. By common agreement among members on this side a time limit was fixed for speeches. We entered into that compact in the belief that the supporters, of the Government, consistent with their actions throughout this debate u n t i l today, would remain silent and give us our rightf u l opportunity to express our opposition to many of the proposals in the Budget and the Government's policy generally. They have broken this arrangement, and I , with other honourable members on this side, enter my emphatic protest. I consider the tactics of the other side most unfair.",59
168,Mr MANNING,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"The honourable member could not "" play the game.""",59
169,Mr COLEMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Some members on the Government side evidently do not know what "" playing the game "" is. No Government has had more consideration from an Opposition than has the present Government. Owing to our fairness we have been subjected to criticism by the so-called organs of public opinion which voice the political views of members of the Nationalist party. I , for my part, consider that we have ""played the game"" too long. If we had displayed more opposition to the policy and methods of the Government we would have - done no more than our duty to the people who sent us . here. We have been elected .to this Parliament to oppose the Government, and we are definitely pledged to oppose its policy. I certainly object to any restriction being placed upon us in the discharge of that duty. I would draw the attention of honourable members on the Government side to the fact that the Budget contains proposals of far-reaching importance. It involves an expenditure of many millions of pounds, including loan expenditure of £19,000,000. The alteration in the method of collecting taxation, and various other matters, are involved, and in view of their importance no restriction should be placed upon the discussion. I have listened carefully to the debates, and was have attempted to for m an opinion of the Government's policy. I admit that it is difficult to do so, particularly in view of the fact that the Treasurer, who formerly led a party known as the Country party, has seriously departed from his pre-election promises. Before the elections the Treasurer was lavish in his promises to the electors of Australia. He promised all kinds of concessions to the farming community. He told returned soldiers that cases of hardship arising out of the administration of the W a r Pensions Ac t would be ameliorated by amending legislation. He said that the occupants of Wa r Service Homes would be relieved of the exorbitant charges levied upon them. It might well be said that we were promised a veritable financial banquet, whereas we are confronted with a .Barmecide's feast, a sham, and a delusion. Mr F . MCDONALD - A snare.",59
170,Mr COLEMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"Yes , a snare. I would like to refer to the way in which honourable the Budget has been presented. I hope the time is not far distant when the Budget will be presented in such a form that any one can readily understand it . In the present Budget there is a of unnecessary information that has direct reference to the financial affairs of Australia, while, on the other hand, much explanatory and important inforper mation that ought to have been included has been omitted. Our national balanceannum. sheet should be so simplified that the man in the street can readily understand it . At the present time it seems designed with the object of confusing not only the people outside, but the members inside Parliament. I thought that the Treasurer, who was an advocate of economy when he was on the election platform, before he became a member of the composite Ministry, would make proposals for a reduction of our debt and a restriction of our rate of borrowing. We find, instead, the Government's proposals will not preciably reduce our burden or make our position any safer. Official stapresented. tistics show that Australia is more effected, heavily burdened with debt than Great Britain . Great Britain owes, approxisition mately, £7,000,000,000, while we owe about £900,000,000, which, per head our population, is greater than the debt of Great Britain . In fact, our financial position is infinitely worse than that many other countries. W it h the proposed additional loan of £19,000,000, and the accumulation of interest, Australia's financial position before very long will be acute, and we shall be on the Governments. verge ' of national bankruptcy. position is, indeed, a serious one. I The Treasurer, after his expressions about economy in his pre-election speeches, might have been expected to propose something to reduce our burden of national debt. Let us consider loans that will need to be redeemed present next year. Speaking from memory, £76,000,000 of loan money will f all due future to meet our commitments. next year, and I understand it was raised at 4£ per cent. The Government is periencing great difficulty today in verting a loan at £ 5 9s. 3d. per cent., which is practically 5£ per cent. It quite obvious that when £76,000,000 falls due next year, the national debt will be materially increased, owing to the fact that the new loan will have to be raised at a much higher rate of interest.. I should have thought that a Government that pledged itself to economy would, have brought forward proposals to reduce the tremendous burdens which Auslot tralia is carrying at the present time. no We owe a war debt of £90,000,000 to Great Britain , and are paying interest and principal at the rate of 5£ per cent, annum, which means an annual payment to Great B r it a in of £5,000,000 per I thought that the Government would, at least, have brought forward proposals for the funding of that debt on the to be basis upon which British debts to America have been funded at 3 per cent. - That would reduce our annual payments to Great B r it a in by nearly £2,500,000 per annum. The ex-Prime Minister (Mr W . M . Hughes) has rightly suggested that the Government should take back the Budget and simplify it so that the financial position of the Commonthat wealth might be made more clear. Other aphonorable members have criticised the manner in which the Budget has been If there are to be economies and I think there should be, they should start, as the Leader of the Oppo(Mr Charlton) has contended, with defence expenditure and the restricof tion of expenditure on immigration. It is typical of a Government dominated by commercial class interests, that it should of not propose to reduce the heavy burden of m i l it a ry expenditure although it does propose to reduce the number of public servants in the Taxation Department under the proposed arrangement with the State It proposes also to curtail The the staff of the Repatriation Department. t seems to me that a reduction in m i l i tary expenditure is the only economy that can be practised which will not result in untold suffering and hardship. I do not think there is any justification for the the reduction of postal rates in view of our financial position. Higher rates will have to be imposed in the The reduction of postal rates will not exbenefit the workers of the country, but con- - only the commercial interests and big business firms. If we are to believe what is appears in. the press the Government receives substantial donations to its party funds from the commercial interests, and one is impelled to believe that the reduction of postal rates is proposed as a quid pro quo. Instead of reducing postal , rates, it would be better to apply the sur, plus earned by the Post and Telegraph Department to the improvement of postal facilities in the country districts and trade in Great Britain . generally throughout the CommonHouse, wealth. W it h reference to the Government taxation proposals, I claim that there no justification for the surrender of tion hy the Commonwealth. In its proable posal to hand over the collection of Fedeof ral income tax to the State Governments, £56,000. the Government has surrendered a power which has been exercised by the Federal authorities, and will be needed again ifconditions do not improve.",59
171,Mr GABB,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,I call attention to state of the Committee. formed.'],61
172,Mr COLEMAN,AMALGAMATED WIRELESS,"I believe that the Treasurer is strenuously endeavouring to the Commonwealth. justify himself politically by embarking upon startling departures of policy. No real benefit will be conferred upon the tion. people of Australia by giving the collecreceiving tion of State and Federal income taxation to one authority. The fact that annum each. taxpayers will be required to fill in one schedule will not materially benefit them. The issue of one assessment for adequate salary. State and Federal income tax will mean that the taxpayers will be called upon pay both taxes simultaneously, and that will make it more difficult for the people, and particularly the workers, to meet their taxation obligations. , The State and Federal methods of assessment differ, and I believe that the collection of State and Federal income taxes by the State authorities will lead to fusion, and that mistakes w i ll be made in assessments which will result in ral dissatisfaction. An y proposal i volving unemployment should be refor garded very seriously at the present time, The saving of a few hundred thousand pounds per annum by the reties tirement of Federal taxation officers will not justify the change to be made. The creation of unemployment when there is so much of it prevailing throughout Australia is a very serious matter. Whilst I was abroad I had an t u n it y of observing the immigration methods followed in London. I have np.en through Australia House. In New would accrue.

In looking through the Estimates, I find that a small amount is being set aside for the purpose of advertising our products and In Australia when I was there, complaints were general amongst senior officers regarding the small amount that was is voted by Parliament for the purpose of taxaadvertising Australian products. Honormembers will notice that the upkeep Australia House will this year cost Of that sum, the miserable amount of £1,500 is to be spent on advertising. That is totally out of proportion to the enormous amount that is to be spent upon the high-salaried officers, eight of whom are to receive salaries totalling the £5,090, or an average of £ 6 3 1 each.

Low wages, after all, are a very bad advertisement for Australia. Efficiency cannot be expected from an immigration staff unless those officers are paid decent wages. The payment of these low wages is, no doubt, largely responsible for the many complaints that have drifted conto Australia regarding Australia House. If the Government paid decent wages, it genewould secure an efficient clerical and n - general staff, which would do more good Australia than a High Commissioner who spends most of his time in attending banquets. There are big trade possibilii n Great Britain . We have neglected to open up fresh markets by propaganda.

Too much attention is paid by the High Commissioner's office .the entertainment of visitors. The York office is serving a very useful purpose. I pay a tribute to the efficiency, capacity, and energy of the official secretary, Mr D. Edwards.'

I should like more attention paid to the development of trade with America. Many persons that there is no .possibility of improving our trade balance with America. I disparticularly agree with that opinion. When I was New York I found that the American opinion of Australia was grotesque, even among educated business men. They knew very little about this country, and cared less; it was as far removed from political and geographical outlook TJraguay or Patagonia is from ours.

I am sure that ' if the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page); - and the Government .generally, conversant with the facts they would lend a sympathetic ear, and .do what the Superannuation Board finds itself unable We to do under the Act. It appears that between the date of the coming into force idea of the Act, and the date on which the - .contributions of the public servants to the Superannuation Fund commenced four In these cases, lessen of course, no payment had been made to the Superannuation Fund, although ±he deceased persons had signified their intention to take up certain Because of the fact that they as 'had not contributed to the fund, their the widows and children have no legal claim on it . But if these men had lived a few dayB longer, their widows would have been entitled to thoir proportion of the pension. These widows have thus suffered a double misfortune. The Government might ask. the Board to make the pension payments, and then indemnify the Board, or the Government itself might declare that they regarded these cases as coToxng within the Act. These men were previously State public servants, and, had they remained in the State service, would have received State pensions, and their widows and children would not have, been left dependent on charity. When State servants were transferred to the Commonwealth Service, it was stipulated by the Constitution that all their rights should be safeguarded. This was a right which came subsequently. If the Treasurer will assure me that the Government will givo this matter its sympathetic consideration I shall say no more.",62
