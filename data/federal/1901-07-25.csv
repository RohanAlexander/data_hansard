Mr ""WILKS - I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice--1 . Is there any truth in the statement of the Sydney Morning Herald of 23rd July that the High Commissioner for the Commonwealth in London will be selected from among the exGovernors of the States % 2. E Sirther, will the Prime Minister state the intentions of the Government in reference to this most important appointment 1",14
1,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"There is no truth in any statement which implies, that the Government has considered the range of selec- . tion for this appointment, because-and this wil l answer the second part of the question-until a Bill has been at least considered, it is not, in relation to it , or to other Bills involving important appointments, the desire of the Government to complicate matters by deciding upon them. ADJOURNMENT. NA MAIL STEAMERS.",14
2,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED LABOUR ON,"I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Bland that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to - discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The increasing employment of coloured labour on subsidized mail steamers."" Five honourable members having -'risen in their places, Question proposed.",14
3,Mr WATSON,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED LABOUR ON," I am one of those who think - that the power to adjourn the House should be taken advantage of very sparingly by honourable members, but it seems to mo that in respect of the question that I am bringing up on this occasion, there is justification for directing immediate public attention to the increasing effect that seems to be likely to follow from the employment of coloured labour, especially on the mail boats that this Commonwealth subsidizes, or will have to subsidize. Por many years past there has been an agitation among a great number of people against the continued employment of coloured races' on mail boats, and I think that, at one of the postal conferences some years ago, a resolution was come to that steps should be taken in respect to any future contracts entered into with the various steam-ship companies to insert a clause to provide against the employment of these people objected to. Steps in that direction were, I think, taken by the then Postmaster-General' of New South Wales on behalf of the other Postmasters-General to obtain from the British Government their concurrence-in view of the fact that they contributed towards the subsidy. Of course, the main point of objection was to the crews with which the P. and O. boats were manned. Por some years previous to that, in fact ever since Orient Company started opposition to the P. and O. Company, the former company had been employing white labour, and at the same time hod to compete against the P. and O. Company, whose crews were composed almost entirely of lascars. think the only exceptions so far as the P. and 0. boats - were concerned were in respect to the engineers and officers and quartermasters, who were Europeans. Well, I am sorry to say that the Fostmaster' General of New South Wales was not on that occasion able to convince the Secretary of State for the Colonies or the British Postmaster-General of the necessity of taking steps in the direction desired; and only very rosently a development has occurred which seems to point to such serious consequences that the whole ground may very well be covered again, and the question rc-opened. We have to consider that this is a question affecting not only those who travel by the mail' boats between here and the old land, but one which very materially affects the conditions of employment of seamen right along the Australian coast. We now insist, and, I think, very properly, that seamen and other maritime workers engaged along the Australian coast shall be employed under something like fair conditions, and at fair rates of wages, and I am glad to say that the colonial steam-ship owners have been extremely reasonable in meeting the men, afc any rate during the last year or two, with the result that we have as good conditions obtaining along our coast as exist in any parfc offcheworld. The importance of this new development;-in ' which the Orient Company have apparently afc last had to succumb fco the . competition of - the P. and O. Company in respect to the employment of coloured labour-affect s every seaman on the coast, because these mail steamers compete is regard to the passenger traffic to a large extent, and 'in a lesser degree, perhaps, in respect to the carriage of cargo, with the vessels on the coast owned by our own people and manned by white labour. If we are to have an extension of this new development to the whole of the vessels employed byfcheOrient Company in the Australian mail service, it seems almost; a certainty that the other lines of steamers trading with the old country, which are not subsidized, will be also compelled to follow suit. .1 do not the know atfchepresent moment of any other of the regular liners trading between here and the old country, such as the Lund line or the two White Star lines, that are employing anyfching-bufc white labour-as far as I know fchey are employing white labour only. It dqes I seem, therefore, that apart from the question as it affects our citizens, who become passengers to Europe, we are interested by reason of the competition' between these vessels and our own coasters in insuringfchafcthose who own the coastal vessels should not have to compete on an unfair footing with these steamers manned by coloured races. The developmentfcowhich I have referred is the fact that the Orient Company has at' least one vessel on the. coast .manned almost entirely by lascars: We have heard this development attributed fco the Admiralty regulations governingfcheaddition of vessels to the naval reserve, but I dissent from that view altogether. It was stated that because the Admiralty regulation regarding vessels attached to the naval reserve, or classed as Admiralty cruisers, provided that a certain proportion of the crews of such vessels must be British subjects, that therefore the Orient Company were discarding their white crews with the view to the employment of British subjects only in the persons of lascars. I do not think that argument will hold water for a moment, in view of the fact known to. myself and others who are interested in shipping matters, thatfchewhole of the men who were employed on the Orient Company's boats, and who, I am glad to say, are still employed onfchemajority of them, are British subjects. The stokers and engineers, and the whole offchedeck hands on these boats, with few exceptions, have been British subjects up to the present time, and therefore the argument that the Orient Company has been driven to' this course by the Admiralty regulations is altogether beside the question, in my view; and the - whole thing narrows itself down to the fact that the Orient Company after a struggle extending over many years, during which they have been anxious to properly preserve the British seamen as a class and keep them from absolute extinction-whic h seems to be the way fchey are going, under the present policy of the British people-ar e now driven by the fierce competition of many other lines, and especially of the P. and 0. Company, to employ coloured labour. The P. and O. Company has been allowed for years to continue, even with the subsidies that were paid, to employ lascars at very low rates of wages, and not only at low rate of wages, but under conditions as to air space and accommodation under which the Board of Trade will not allow any white man to work. The Board of Trade have passed a regulation, under the Merchant Shipping Act, governing the minimum air spaces to be allowed for each seaman on a vessel, but unfortunately the P. and O. Company have been enabled fco avoid these regulations, in the past - althoug h I believe there is an attempt now being made to compel them to abide by them-o n the ground that the' people they employed were not subject to the Act in the way that white men were. In spite of this the Orient Company have continued to employ white men, and now we have the development; in the shape of one boat afc least, probably as the precursor of others, with a lascar crew. I contend that, notwithstanding that these lascars are British subjects, we have the right to object to anything that will have the effect of lowering the tone of the race generally or will have the effect of unfairly competing with our own citizens who are already employed on the coast. And if we give a certain subsidy to the various vessels engaged in carrying the mails, surely we have a right to insist upon the conditions which shall obtain. I might direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that in New Zealand fchey now have a section in the law-- I forget the name of the Act-whic h governs the letting of postal contracts, providing in so many words that any vessel which receives a subsidy must; employ white labour only. There is no possibility of the money of the New Zealand Government being used forfcheemployment of a race which is objectionable from many points of view. In Queensland also, some time ago, the Government had a clause inserted in tbeirmail contracts, I believe, which precluded the possibility of the employment of coloured labour on the mail steamers; but I understand- I speak subject to correction by those who are better acquainted with the local details-that the action taken in Queensland at the time that the clause was inserted, was the direct consequence of the proved unreliability of these lascars in time of peril and trouble. Most honourable members will probably recollect the circumstances attendingfchewreck of the Quetta on the Queensland coast, arid I understand that it was because of the behaviour of the lascars on that British-India boat on that occasion that the Queensland Government were forced by public opinion in that State to take steps to prevent the repetition of such a scene in connection with subsidized mail boats. I do not wish to say a great deal with respect fco the behaviour of the crew on that occasion, but it is well known that the boats were rushed by the lascars, and that a very poor' chance was given to women and children and other passengers, probably unable to take care of themselves, to save their lives.",15
4,Mr WILKS,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED LABOUR ON,The lascars were panicstricken.,16
5,Mr WATSON,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED LABOUR ON,"Ye s ; they were panicstricken and rushed the boats. I have another instance in my mind. I think it was in the case of the steamer Deuccm in the Red Sea, where an almost similar set of circumstances occurred, and the whole evidence goes to prove that, while for the mere purpose of stoking or doing casual work in fine weather, these lascars may be fairly efficient, it is certain that in time of stress and trouble-which is the time when everything in the way of stamina, and coolness, and courage is required-they are wanting, and it does seem to me that we, who participate in any proceeding which encourages the employment of that class of men in duties of this sort, .are certainly moral participators in the responsibility, which must be shouldered by those who have charge of these affairs. ""We hear constant complaints in the magazines and other thoughtful about the disappearance of the purely British seaman, not only in the old land, but also on our own coast. Other nations, I am glad to say, take a little livelier interest in the encouragement of their marifcimepopulations. We do not find, as far as Germany is concerned, that her subsidized mail boats employ other than her own citizens, and in respect to America they put a clause in their Acts, which govern the granting of subsidies to mail steamers and others working under their flag, that they must employ at least a certain proportion of their own subjects before they are eligible to claim any subsidy. So that it does seem to me that, apart from the question of the competition that our own steam-ship owners and our own seamen have to put up with, we have a right from the point of view of the encouragement of the large body of sailors who form an important port of our population, to insure that preference shall be given to their One reason why I bring the matter up at this stage is that recently we saw adopted in another place a provision, in respect to this very subject, and I am sorry to' say, that as far as we have been able to glean the intentions of the Government, it does not seem that they are prepared to take any steps in the direction indicated. reason which actuated me in bringing forward this matter today was a desire to emphasize the new development. bad enough in all conscience whilethe thing was confined to one particular Large company as that is, still it only did a fraction of the business that was transacted throughout Australasia - but when we see the sheet-anchor of white employment disappearing, and the Orient Company forced Mr Watson. to give in to the severe competition with which it has had to contend, surely it becomes a matter for the reconsideration of the Government whether they shall not take some steps to preclude the possibility of the further extension of this evil. I have no desire to weary the House with anything more on the subject; but I do ask the serious .and earnest consideration of honourable members to the danger that seems to be before us in respect to the employment of these lascars. Especially do I ask the Government to reconsider their position beforefchePostal Bill comes on for discussion in this House; and that an opportunity may be given honourable members of projournals nouncing in favour of a white Australia, so far as our maritime population, as well as that within the borders of the Commonwealth itself, is concerned. Question resolved in the negative.",16
6,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED LABOUR ON,Thaf c is shabby treatment from the Government.',17
7,Mr BARTON,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED LABOUR ON,"I did not rise fco speak at once, because I thought that the debate was going to be continued. If the honourable member for Bland will ask me a question upon the matter tomorrow J. will answer it .",17
8,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED LABOUR ON,"It is very shabby, anyhow. NA COMMONWEALT H.",17

10,Mr BARTON,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"This matter, will be considered with a view rather favourable to sending such a communication. The VOTES AND PROCEEDINGS. . Mr VL SOLOMON (South Australia). - Before the business of the day is called on I It was should like to direct attention, sir, to the Votes and Proceedings as printed on July 17, company. which are somewhat incorrect and not in accordance with Hansard. In the Votes and Proceedings the entry in regard to the f Public Service Bill is in these termsMr V. Ii.

Edwards moved, That this Bill be now recommitted to a committee offchewhole House for the reconsideration of 58, and 60. That is not correct. The position is that, having made an error to which nvy attention was called by the leader of the Opposition and other honourable members in moving the recommittal of the whole Bill, by consent of the House I withdrew that motion, and substituted a that the Bill be recommitted for the specific purpose of reconsidering clause According to llamswd, which is correct, the honourable member for South Sydney was very shabby. movedThat the following words be addedfcothe motion:-""and that it be an instruction committee to reconsider clause 68."" I ask, Mr Speaker, that the Votes and will be treated alike."" Proceedings may be rectified i u order they may give a true record of what did wishes to refer to. occur. Mr SPEAKER, - In answer to the honourable member I may point out that every honourable member has a right to speak once to every question. The honorwhich able member having exhausted his right speak on this particular question by moving thatfchewhole Bill be recommitted, even though he afterwards withdrew that tion, could not speak again with a view to move another. The honourable member for South Sydney moved a further motionwhich he had a perfect right to do, as had not spoken before-and to make the cord in accordance with the standing orders the entry appeal's in its present form. could not appeal' as the honourable member asks that it should, whilst the standing orders are asfcheyare.",17

But is the Prime Minister in order in explaining anything which he may have omitted to do, sucli as not having spoken to a question has been decided ; because if he is, to then any honourable member who failed to catch your eye, Mr Speaker, would have a right to explain how it was that he did not mospeak upon any particular question ?",18

25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,I rise to a point of Has the Prime Minister a right to allude to objections as captious?,18

I hope that that order will characterizefchefurther proceedings of honourable members which has characterized them in the past. . A little while ago there was a motion before the House which I shall not now debate. The question was put from the Chair, and declared i nfchenegative. At that moment I "" was busily engaged attending to something else; and I wish to say, especially as my action has been misunderstood, that if the honourable member who moved that motion wishes to suspend the standing orders in order that he may ask me a question on the subject, or if he wishes that I shall move the suspension of the standing orders",18
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,I rise to a point order.,19
29,Mr BARTON,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,Surely .1 may make a statement.,19
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"The right honourable gentleman rose for the purpose of explainof ing something upon which he was misunderwhether stood. He is doing nothing of the kind, and I submit that he is entirely out order.",19
31,Mr SPEAKER,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"The Prime Minister expressly said that he would conclude amotion. Ifc will be quite in order if the Prime Minister concludes with the motion "" that the standing orders be suspended,"" for example. .I am not suggesting that. is not my place to suggest what the Prime Minister should do, but should he conclude with such a motion it will be perfectly i order. Mt. BARTON - This further attempt interrupt me having faile'cl, I should like address myself to the motion about fco moved, for I shall conclude with a motion that the standing orders be susto pended. I think the sense of fairness the House will support me in giving my reasons for moving that motion. The submitted by the honourable member for Bland, which has already been negatived, was put whilst I was very busily attending night. fco another matter. I expected some other Mr Reid honourable member would express his views on the subject, and it - would have been easier for me fco speak in reply to speeches than in answer fco one. Of course I cannot carry out the course which I pose if honourable members are not willing that it should be done; but inasmuch as seems to be only just that the honourable member for Bland should have some answer to the question which he raised; I move That the standing orders be suspended, in order to enable the discussion to be continued on the motion moved by the honourable member for Bland.",19
32,Mr BEID,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"I wish to ask your ruling, sir, upon a matter which is of great importance apart from this question altogether. Ifc is in reference to the question of urgent necessity. If you admit the right of the Prime Minister to move this motion, a similar right must be extendedfcoevery honourable member of this House. There cannot be a right under the standing orders which enables the Prime Minister or any other Minister to do a thing which a private member cannot do. 1 do not wish to go beyond your rulingof yesterday fco the of effect that the standing orders should be suspended only in cases of urgent necessity. Leaving that ruling, that a motion is not necessary to declare urgent necessity, out of the question, I should like, as a matter practice for the future, to know you consider such a motion can be brought before the House without at of least a statement from the honourable member who. intends to move it as to its urgency. The standing orders seem fco with me to contemplate a departure from our ordinaiy rules only under very grave circumstances. What is the use of standing ordersif they can be torn - to pieces at a It moment's notice ?- Before a motion is put from the Chair, which has the effect of enabling-any honourable member to do as he n likeswithout notice, I think it is due to the Housefchafcfchehonorable member moving to t as a matter of urgent necessity should, i fco afc any rate, state tofcheHouse the reasons be for his action. The Prime Minister moved this motion without giving any reason as its urgent necessity. The standing orders of surely mean that we are not to be allowed to suspend the rules of the House except in motion . the case of urgent necessity. Mr .WATSON - Thei r suspension was moved in the middle of a debate the other - I am sorry for that precedent. I do think that, consistent with your ruling, Mr Speaker, it is due to the two House that the matter should be stated to be one of urgent necessity, and that reasons proshould be given for adopting the course.",19
33,Mr BABTON,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"It is only fair that as it the leader of the House I should be called upon to give some reasons against the point of order. This House has repeatedly, in cases of inadvertence, re-opened matters, and only the other night, on the motion for the third reading of a Bill having been stated from the Chair",19
34,Mr VL SOLOMON,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"Wrongl y stated from the Chair. Mr BABTON. - Onl y the other night, on the motion for the third reading of a Bill having, been stated from the Ohair, and Mr Speaker having given a decision that as the matter had gone so far, and as objection had not been taken at the proper time, the subject could not be re-opened, the courtesy was extended to the honourable member for South Australia,. Mr Solomon, of moving that the standing, orders be suspended in order that a certain matter might be reconsidered.",20
35,Mr VL SOLOMON,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,In that case an admitted error had been made by the Chair.,20
36,Mr BARTON,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,":-It matters nothing to me, because this question is whether the House has a right to exercise a certain power. It can exercise that power whether the inadvertence is on the part of the Chairman, the leader of the House, or the humblesjb member of it . It is a matter of fair play all round. That is the reason why I ask that this motion should be earned. I ask it on another ground, viz., that if it were ruled by Mr Speaker to be out of order, bhenfchemost wrong impressions might get abroad through the action of some honourable member in preventing the House from exercising its own undoubted function in the carrying on of its business.",20
37,Mr MCDONALD,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"Probably I had something to do with this matter, inasmuch as I applied the word "" shabby "" the treatment meted out to the honourable in either case. member for Bland by the Prime Minister. I understand now that in New South Wales it is the custom when a motion the adjournment offcheHouse the Minister to wait until a number of honourable members have spoken, and then three points to which I must refer. to reply. Tbat being so, I desire to apolothe gize to the Prime Minister. The practice to which I have been accustomed, is for the Minister in charge of the particular partment under whichfchematter forming the subject of the motion comes, to reply immeable members. diately the mover has concluded his remarks. The object of the motion today was allow the Minister to follow that course, and so to save time. The Minister not taking that opportunity, I thought he was treating the honourable member for Bland in rather a shabby manner, but now that I understand that there was no intention to do so I desire to apologize. Like the leader of the Opposition, I must certainly enter my protest against the continued suspension of the standing orders. It is one of the most dangerous practices that any assembly can fall into. In the early history bf this Parliament it was overlooked, on the ground that"" the standing orders wei-e new, and that honourable members were unfamiliar with them. But; when once the provisional standing orders were placed upon the table of the House the genei'al impression was that it would be wise not; to allow of their suspension so frequently. There-is another serious point which suggests itself to my mind in connection with the suspension of the standing orders in the present instance. The House has already come to a deeision upon the motion submitted by the honourable member for Bland. Now, without any attempt to rescind that decision, we are about; to re-open the question. I am sorry that this difficulty has arisen. I should like to suggest that seeing that a mistake has been made, unwittingly on the part of the Prime Minister, it would have been a wise course - for him to ask the permission of the House to say a few words in reply.",20
38,Mr BABTON,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"I could not do that without the suspension of the standing orders. Mr MCDONALD, - That would have avoided the suspension of the standing orders.",20
39,Mr BABTON,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,The suspension of the to standing orders would have been necessaiy,20
40,Mr MCDONALD,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"The unanimous permission of the House could have been for granted without the suspension of the is moved, for standing orders.",20
41,Mr SPEAKER,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"There are two or As to first point which was raised by the' leader of the Opposition, I desire to say that there is no rule which applies to one honordeable member-n o matter who he may bewhich does not apply equally, to other honorNo practice would' be tolerable which applied to one honourable to member and not to all. In the next place a question has been raised as to what is an urgent matter. There are two standing orders which refer to the matter of urgency. The first is Standing Order No. 38, which permits of an informal discussion for the purpose of dealing with a definite matter of urgent public importance, which the honourable member raising it must state and hand in to the speaker. The other standing order is No. 407, which statesIn cases of urgent necessity any standing or sessional order or orders of the House may be suspended for the day's sitting on motion duly made and seconded, without notice : Provided that such motion is carried by an absolute Miujorifcy offchewhole number of the members of the House. In both these cases clearly, I think, according to the intention of the standing orders, and clearly according to the practice, so far as laid down in them, and so far as our goes-clearly, according to the standing orders and our practice the responsibility of determining whether a question is or is not urgent, rests on the honourable member who moves the motion. Naturally he knows more about the question than any other honourable member, and if an honourable member, be be Minister or private member, rise to move a motion which can only be moved as one of urgency, then urgency is at once presumed. Ou two or three occasions under Standing Order 38, urgency has been presumed ; members have risen in support of the motion, the debate has proceeded; and even today the same thing has heen done. In regard to the suspension of the standing orders, urgency has been presumed from the very fact that under the necessary plea of urgency the suspension has been moved; therefore', the practice I propose to follow is that wherever under the standing orders a member, Minister or otherwise, presumes that a matter is of urgent necessity, requiring action under the standing orders, that urgency will be admitted so far as I am concerned, and I do not think the Chair ought to challenge it. If the House chooses to challenge it that is another thing, but the way"" the House can challenge it, in the case of Standing Order 38, is first by refusing to rise in support of the urgency, and, under Standing Order 40, by the majority of the whole House required under the clause to suspend the standing orders, refusing to give their concurrence. The honourable member for Kennedy has raised two points, first, as to whether the motion proposed is not a rescission of a previous question. I maintain Mr Speaker. that it is not a rescission. The previous motion wasThat the House do now adjournsome half an hour ago. "" The motion which will be before the House, if the Suspension of the standing orders is agreed to, isThatfcheHouse do now adjournat a quarter past three, or such other time as it shall be put. That is no more a rescission of the previous motion than a motion carried at ten or eleven o'clock to-night that the House do then adjourn, would be a rescission of the vote taken now.",20
42,Mr VL SOLOMON,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,What is the motion now ?,21
43,Mr SPEAKER,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"I will state the motion in a moment. The further and only other point is a . suggestion by the honourable practice member for Kennedy, that the Prime Minister might have spoken tofchemotion by leave of the House. I would remind that honourable member that the Prime Minister did propose to speak to the motion, by leave of the House, but that leave was refused by one honourable member, leave always being refusable by any one honourable member who chooses so to refuse' it . The question now before the House isThat the standing orders be - suspended in order to enable the discussion to be continued on the motion moved by the honourable member for. Bland.",21
44,Mr WATSON,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E," I trust the House will allow the standing orders to be suspended under the circumstances, because of the reason put forward by the honourable member for Kennedy, in the suggestion that honourable members were not all acquainted with the unified practice now being followed. That was put forward as a reason for this particular motion being carried. Por myself I was rather expecting the New South Wales practice, or custom, to be followed, namely, that a number of honourable members, if there were a difference of opinion, would get up and say what they wished to say before the Prime Minister replied. That has been the custom in New South Wales, though it is not a practice laid down; but in any case I trust, as there seemsfcohave been an error, the House will carry the motion, and that the Premier will make the statement he desires to make on behalf of the Government.",21
45,Mr REID,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E," I do not think any honourable member of the House can have the faintest desire to prevent that which is aimed at by the motion / of the Prime Minister. No one could wish that after an honourable member of the House has made a statement on an important question, that the Prune Minister who as we now see was by mere inadvertence deprived of the opportunity of speaking, should not be debarred from replying. I wish it to be distinctly understood that my only desire was that, as these are matters which are bound in the future to be of very great importance we should have a practice clearly settled I certainly intend to support the motion. I wish, however, to point out that there is one thing that the suspension of the standing orders cannot do, so far as I can see. The motion of the honourable member for Bland having been negatived, cannot be put before us again. There are a number of things we can do by the suspension of the standing of'ders, but we cannot undo some things unless, as I suggest, the Prime Minister includes in his motion something that will have the effect of doing that. The mere suspension of the standing orders, so far as I can see, will not do that.",21

47,Mr BEID,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"Perhaps the words which the honourable member has used might be taken as sufficient. This is one of the awkwardnesses of the situation-namely , that the discussion has been closed and the House has decided, so that something more is required than to merely move the suspen-. sion of the standing orders. However, I shall co-operate with the Prime Minister in every possible way, in order to give him the opportunity he wishes.",22
48,Mr BARTON,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"On the question of order. I would point out that the re-opening of the discussion carries with it the putting of the motion again. If the discussion be re-opened it means thatfchevote just taken can be reconsidered-no t that the same question shall be moved twice, or that the motion shall be before the Chair twice, but that the same motion can be reconsidered. Otherwise there would be no object in re-openingfchediscussion, because that might lead to a change in the minds of honourable members generally, and they would be deprived of the opportunity of expressing an opinion by vote. Therefore, the re-opening of the discussion carries with it all that follows the discussion,. and must therefore carry with i tfcheputting of the motion. If you, Mr Speaker, think otherwise, I will include further words in the motion, but I have a fairly clear opinion that it is not necessary, but thafcfcheone thing includes the other.",22

51,Mr SPEAKER,MEMORIAL OP THEBIRTH OP TH E,"I am very glad the right honourable member for East Sydney has given already one opportunity tosettle the practice, and that he has now given a further opportunity to settle another practice.

ADJOURNMENT. NA MAIL STEAMERS. Debate resumed (vide page 3056) on motion by Mr WATSONThat the House do now adjourn. , - Mr BARTON (Hunter-Minister of External Affairs) - The honourable member for Kennedy is right in saying that under the practice of New South ""Wales, with which many of us are better acquainted than with the practice in the other States, it is customary for a Minister' who can speak only once on a motion for adjournment, before he exercises his full right of speech, to hear, what has to be said, or at any rate enough to enable him to gather the scope of the question. I intended to follow that course, and I was taken by surprise by the putting of the question. As to this matter I do not intend to detain the House at any length, but simply to put myself right with honourable members lest it might be supposed I was not considering the question or not giving sufficient attention to the views put forward by the honourable member who raised it . The Government are aware of the proceedings at the Postal Conference to which reference has been made, and our attention has been called to the recent development of which the honourable member speaks. There was a statement in the newspapers-though , of course, I cannot guarantee its accuracy-to the effect that the Orient Company are yielding either to competition of to some other influence, and are likely to employ a considerable number of coloured labourers in the working of their ships. All that can be done by the Government in a case of this kind is to regulate those matters in which as a Government they have control. In all matters in which this Government has control it will certainly use its best influence to prevent any employment of coloured labour that can be avoided. In the contracts with the companies which are carrying the mails, there are some difficulties. We in Australia ate not the only parties to the contracts. The Imperial Government, as well as the companies concerned, are parties as well as ourselves, and the difficulty which arose to which the honourable member for Bland ""has alluded, was due to this very fact-that , while there was a readiness here to exclude the employment of black labour from shipscarrying specified mails, there was not the same readiness on the part of the Imperial authorities, who thought these matters could not properly be included in a mail contract. No doubt their rigid adherence to what are considered their - fiscal principles might to some extent impel them to such a conclusion, but the difficulty was that the contract could not be carried out, or rather, hedged round in the way we desired at this end, because there was nofcfchesame readiness at the other end. There are many matters in which this restriction does not prevail, and in respect to those matters we shall, as I said, take such a course as will minimise the employment of coloured labour. Then i u reference to mail contracts-another factor has yetfco be considered, namely, that the boats which carry the mails carry them in the main, between Australia and another country, which is an equal participant in the contract, and the views of which are equally entitled to be respected, and which, on the whole, has the greater power.",22
57,Mr WATSON,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,Does the Prime Minister think there was sufficient firmness in the application made last time on behalf of the colonies 1,23
58,Mr BARTON,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"So far as I know there was. We must always expect such a difficulty as has arisen, from the fact that the bulk of the journey is between two countries equally participant i nfchebenefits, and one of which countries has, in matters of this kind, ultimately the greater power. On the other hand, it may be as the honourable member has suggested, that sufficient firmness was not exercised. There is always the consideration to be faced that in respect to postal contracts regulations dealing with the class of labour to be employed- I am talking of oversea contracts - has not hitherto been generally considered to be within the scope of the Postal department. Now I admit that, notwithstanding the past, it is possible to take further steps and to bring about, I think, a larger measure of success in these matters, because I take it that the minimising of this class of labour is the success we shall be united in desiring. So far as T am concerned, that is my desire and my object, a*id I hope that in future contracts we shall be able to provide that this class of labour shall be discontinued on the ships which carry the mails. I only wish to point outfchedifficulties in order to show fco the House that the matter is not so easy as may be generally supposed, notwithstanding our strong good-will towards the object which the honourable' member for Blaud has in view. So far as I am concerned, notliing will please me better than to endeavour to bring about that object. And more than that, not only would nothing please me better, but I shall do my best to bring that object about. I only mention matters which stand in the way, in order that it may not be supposed we are dealing with this question in a light or easy way, and in order that, i u the face of the difficulties we have to confront, we may have the sympathy and support of the House on any future occasion when we may wish to ask for it. I think we shall have it .",23
59,Sir JOHN QUICK,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,Can the Prime say when the existing contracts will be Open to revision 1,24
60,Mr BARTON,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"I am not particularly informed of the date, but I will make inquiry. As soon as they are open to revision, however, so far as this Government is conlet cerned, strenuous efforts will be made, notwithstanding the general supposition the past that mail contracts are not concerned with the class of labour employed on for Australia. the oversea"" journey-and although that has been the practice I do not think it right practice, because I think we are fectly entitled to make our own - terms and conditions-so far as this Governbut ment is concerned, it will endeavour to - have terms and conditions made which will minimize, if they cannot utterly do away with, this class of labour on sucli journeys. So far as I if that class of labour can be totally done away with I shall be the better pleased. The honourable member for Bland has pointed out one or two reasons besides racial reasons for his motion. He has instanced certain cases in which coloured labourers have given way to panic in times of stress and disaster. Of course we know that panic is unfortunately a universal accident on occasions, but I believe the people of our own race are not so liable fco it as are coloured races, and there is a .good deal of reason i u what the honourable member has put forward. Taking the whole question, the honourable member may rest assured co-operation and support offcheGovernment. It rests with the Government to take initiative in matters of this kind, and the question is re-opeued, the honourable member may take it for granted the Governtrade ment will do its best to see that this class of labour is not employed in carrying tralian mails. Mr REIT) (East Sydney) - I Gan only say that so far as I am concerned-and I believe I speakon behalf of every member the Opposition side of the House- I wish Suez Canal. the Prime Minister to understand that we are heartily with him in any efforts which he may make in order tp duninish the employment of coloured labour on board ships which are related to us, as these ships are, under a postal contract. I quiteagreewith the Prime Minister thatfchematter is one in which the Government may expect to have very great difficulty in bringing about the objecti n view, however strenuous and earnest they Minister may be. As to the P. and O. steamers, which have not been particularly mentioned in this discussion",24
61,Mr BABTON,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"Yes , fchey have.",24
62,Mr REID,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"A special difficulty, I think, arises from the fact that these contracts are in a general way. I nfchemother countiy the Postal department deals with the whole_ in of its contracts at the same time.",24

66,Mr BEID,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"Well , these lascars 'are British subjects, and the inhabitants of a country which pays an enormous amount of the postal subsidies to the mail Steamers, so that, as far as the lascars are concerned, fchey being British subjects, anclfchecountiy in which .they are born, being a countiy which contributes enormouslyfcothe postal subsidies, it becomes a great difficulty for the Government of Australia to have its wishes carried out.",24
67,Mr WATSON,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,Is there not a separate . of the mail service to India %,24
68,Mr REID,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"It is very difficult to draw the any distinct line in connection with the when, actual trade that is carried on by these steamers, because, up to a certain point, the is of a general character. Take the case of a steamerfchafccomesfcoAustralia. AusShe will, perhaps, carry the mails of all countries to the East for fully half the extent of her voyage out to the colonies.",24
69,Mr WATSON,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,The Indian mails are on taken from the Australian steamer afc the,24
70,Mr REID,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"The steamer that leaves England with her ultimate destination in Australia carries the mails from London for the East, fchey are transferred at a con-, venienfc point, and the voyage is half completed, before the service becomes purely Australian. That creates a considerable difficulty in the way of the Government as far as the P. and 0. Company is concerned. As far as the Orient Company is concerned, the question is a simple one, but this difficulty arises with them-that if a rival company trading to Australia, such as the P. and O. Company are allowed to employ coloured labour, the claim of the Orient Company to use this labour becomes very strong. I only moke these few observations with a view to emphasize whatfchePrime Minister has saidas to the great difficulty of getting at what I feel sure everymember of this House desires. But it will greatly strengthen the Prime Minister when he knows that he has practically a united House behind him in this matter.",25
71,Mr SAWISKS,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,Would the right honourable the leader of the Opposition go the length of excluding the products of coloured races 1,25
72,Mr REID,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"Now , my honourable friend, the member for New England, who is generally inclined to save time, and is conservative in his ideas, should not throw out a bone of contention of that sort. I think the Prime Minister unnecessarily referred to this as a fiscal matter, but I wish the Prime Minister to remember that, as far as the British flag is concerned, it is not a fiscal matter, bceause it endeavours to give the utmost; amount of freedom beneath its folds to men of every race, and every colour, and every creed. It is not a fiscal matter i nfchafcsense, and as far as we are concerned in Australia the honourable member for New England must know well that the foremost men in Australia who lnv\e grappled with this question of the introduction of coloured races were men like Sir Henry Parkes and the others who followed him. I had the honour of carrying au Act which dealt with the restriction of the immigration of coloured races generally, whilst Sir Henry Parkes brought forward legislation dealing with the restriction of the duction of Chinese into Australia. Therefore, I think thafcfcherecord of the party fco which I belong, in the matter of legislation to keep out coloured races, and prevent them from mixing with our race, is a very good one.",25
73,Mr SAWERS,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,Thes e men are not coming herefcomix with us at all j they only help to bring goods here for our consumption.,25
74,Mr REID,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"Surely the honourable member drinks tea, although it is grown in China. Why does not the honourable member draw the line at Chinese tea, and drink colonial beer 1 I will guarantee that with all the fiscal views of my honourable friend, you will often see him drinking British beer, .but you will never see him by any chance drinking a glass of the colonial article. That is a matter of white labour entirely ; but as for colonial labour; I do not think there is a bigger tea drinker in Australia than the honourable member for New England. When he is drinking the beverage is there never a cloud passing over his mind as to the horrible depravity of drinking tea made .of an article that is grown in a place inhabited by coloured people, which is manufactured by coloured jieople, and which comes greatly into competition with colonial beer ?",25
75,Mr HUGHES,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON," I desire fco say a word or two with reference to the matter to which the honourable member for Bland has calledfcheattention of the House. I was very glad to hear from the Prime Minister that he propose-i to take steps at au early date' to, as far as possible, restrict the employment of coloured labour. I understand from what be saysfchafchis attitude is simply one which is limited as far as the complete abolition of coloured labour is concerned by the fact that Great Britain herself is a partner in the postal contracts, and necessarily may limit his actions in fchafc direction, and in certain other ways. I did understand-althoug h it is obvious I must have been misinformed-that the Prime Minister's colleague in the Senate expressed an opinion altogether afc variance with, or afc any rate not nearly so hopeful as, that which he has himself given us today. I understand that the Postmaster-General was questioned as to his intention in respect to this matter, and that he declared that the Government could not see its way at all to deal with it, and I am now very glad to know either that I was misinformed, or that the Prime Minister has seen the better way. I would like to be able to point intro- out one or two matters in connection with this question, and I do so because I have some acquaintance with the subject. I venture to say, first of all, that there is no nation, no great nation at any rate, which follows the very pernicious practice that the British nation does in this matter. We see foreign subsidized mail steamers coming into our ports, and we shall not find in one of them one man who is not a native, or at any rate a naturalized, subject of the country which pays the subsidy. The Messageries Maritiraes employ all French sailors-the stokers, I admit, are men from Africa. The Nbrddeutscher Lloyd steamers, and the Japanese mail boats, are all manned with natives of the respective countries to which the vessels belong, withfcheexception, in the case offcheJapanese boats, offchequarter-masters. Now, it is a notorious fact, as the honourable member for Bland has pointed out,fchafcthe lascars have nothing to recommend them, except, perhaps, a docility that is absent in the Britisher, and a picturesqueness which, although afc other times it is doubtless effective enough, does not appeal fco one in a time of danger. The fact that these lascars are British subjects, I admit, opens up a very big question, ""but it is one which I am very certain that our fellow subjects in Great Britain would not for a moment view with equanimity if they were face to face with the same imminent danger that presents itself to us. To the Englishman, the coloured man is an object of interest, and not of danger or menace afc all. He is a man who ""is to be found so seldom that he is an object of curiosity, and I will venture to say that not one Englishman in every hundred residing in Great Britain bas ever seen a coloured man of any sort or kind. Therefore I am not at ali influenced by the fact that the Imperial Parliament opposesfcoour demand some sort of decision that does not accord withourown views. The Imperial Parliament has never had to face the Imperial constituencies on this matter. Britisher knows of the coloured man is the part he played in bringing about a spectacular effect in connection with the jubilee and other processions. We, however, have to deal with him as he is, as a competitor-as a hawker, and in other avocations. We know how dangerous he is. We know what an insidious and tireless competitor he is. He has an}' number of virtues, which I am not slowfco-recognise, but we are not concerned with his virtues. We know that he is a competitor who has a tendency to lower the industrial, moral, and social tone of the country, and for that reason I am opposed to his employment. I wish to point out to honourable members that this question is now becoming a matter concerning not Australia only, but the Empire, and I wish to quote upon this subject a very excellent authority- a man whose word in this particular should go for more than that of anybody else. I refer to Lord Brassey. His remarks on the lamentable and deplorable falling away of the element of the purely British seaman in the mercantile marine of Great Britain are worth noting. He says thatIn the mercantile marine the number of British seamen is diminishing year hy year, and unless steps are taken to prevent it they will diminish still more rapidly in the future. I have here a table showing bow the number of British seamen has diminished from the year 1891 to the year 1896, and I find that under uo age from 15 fco over 50 has. there been an increase in the number of British seamen, either per cent, or actual; whilst in nearly every one there has been a substantial decrease. I find that the whole of the British seamen rated as belonging to some British port---that is, bo'rn in the British Isles-numbe r 115,824, ancl the British seamen not otherwise defined number 4,368. The colonies supplied 4,621 foreign countries, 27,446 : and lascars and Asiatics made up a total of 27,911. These figures show 55,000 foreigners, including lascars, out of a total of 180,000 British seamen. The foreigners are not even naturalized. I think that these figures present a most deplorable outlook ; and the position of affairs which they disclose is becoming worse every year - Lord Brassey thought'so much of this matter that he called a conference in Melbourne in 1S96, at which all masters of ships lying in port were asked to be present. Apparently the result All the of the conference, according to the Naval Annucd, page 106, was a statement fchafc whether the seamen were Britishers, Scandinavians, or Dutchmen was a matter of no concern to the ship-owner as a man of business. Lord Brassey' points out, however, what a matter of vital interest it is to the nation, ancl I do not think any one will deny fchafc. Prom the stand-point of the man of business, it does not matter whether a man is a Britisher, a Scandinavian, or a lascar; but in time of trouble it will be better for these men of business to have their marine manned by British seamen than that they should perhaps lose their avocation ancl their marine as well. The employment of British seamen is an insurance fund against risk in time of clanger. Ifc is not to be supposed that the foreigner will fight for a country in the same way as a native of it . That is an absurd supposition, ancl I do not suppose any one would contend that the lascars like us so much that at a time of great danger they would come to our aid. I am not referring to such a time of national danger as we have just passed through in connection with the South African war, but I have in my mind a great European crisis when the hands of England will be full. Is it to be supposed that in sucli an emergency we shall turn to the lascars for support and protection 1 Shall we not rafcher be afraid that they will be found amongst our enemies instead of amongst our friends 1 At least that is a fair supposition. Now this matter of finding seamen for the mercantile marine is becoming so serious that in the JVavcd Annual of 1891 it is pointed out that 50 years ago there were 200,000 British seamen in the mercantile marine, whereas today we have scarcely half that number; that is a reduction of 50 per cent, in 50 years, and it is a very seiious thingfcocontemplate. Ifc is onewhich the ship-owners, however, apparently regard only from the .stand-point of commercial gain. The effect of employing coloured labour is, in the first place, to lower the dustrial standard, to lower the standard of living, fco lessen the intensity offchedemand for better navigation laws, and generally to institute a condition of things which is highly objectionable to the passengers who have to travel by sea, and, in addition, to the nation at large. I only wish to say in conclusion that I think it will be a very unfair thing-seein g that now the ocean-going companies are competing with the local companies in carrying Inter-State traffic ancl passengers-to ask the local companies fco pay men at the rate of £ 6 or £ 7 per month, and allow the P. and O. boats to cany men whom they pay 30s. per month. Viewed from any stand-point one pleases, it is a highly objectionable condition of things; but I am pleased to hear from the Prime Minister that he proposes afc an early date fco deal with the matter. I hope that he will not allow anythingfcohinder him from going as far as he has indicated today.",25
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON," I entirely approve of the course the Prime Minister proposes to take, and my objection to his attitude in the first instance arose the impression that he intended to give us nothing more than a mere explanation. I objected fco that; but when he told us that he proposed to re-open the whole question I was delighted, and I am glad that it has been re-opened. I view with the greatest possible apprehension the advent of coolie labour to the Orient Company's boats. Ifc seems to me that the matter is assuming so serious an aspect fchafc the Government should take it up with some degree of firmness, put its foot down sternly, and say, "" As we subsidize these boats to the extent that we do, we shall take care that our own race is not excluded from employment on board them."" That is the serious aspect of the question.' It would not be so bad if these steam-ship companies employed either black or white labour indiscriminately, but in employing black labour they go further than that, and discriminate i u favour of black labour. In effect-they say that they will not have white -> labour to do this particular kind of work. Ifc seems to me thatfcheychallenge the position of the whole of our mail contracts and the entire sentiment of the States when they take up an aggressive attitude of that kind, because I cannot describe it as anything else but aggression. inI rejoice that this matter has passed over fco the Commonwealth, because I believe that the Commonwealth Government will be able to take up a stronger attitude than we were formerly able to adopt through the medium of our postal conferences. We used to meet from time fco time, and invariably when we met we discussed this question of coloured labour. So surely as we discussed it, we found that our views had to be subject to a compromise. We could not do anything such asfcheCommonwealth Government will be able to do. I do not think there would be any serious consequence if the Government put their foot down firmly and said, once and for all - "" Our labour must not be excluded from these boats."" That is the attitude we should take up. Ifc is uot so much a question of black labour being employed, but that white labour is being pushed off these boats. That is the grievance we should take the earliest possible opportunity of remedying. I do not agree with the honourable member for .Bland that the Orient Company, is being d ri ven, by stress of competition, to employ black labour on their boats. There are other reasons for the employment of this class of labour besides from that of cheapness 1 What does the agent of the P. and 0. Company say regarding the reasons . which induced the company to employ black labour % Honourable members will understand, when fchey hear his statetralia. ment, that the companies have a stronger objection to the British seaman costs a little more than the lascar. I regret that we have hitherto been unable to come a unanimous decision regarding this matter, because the moment that unanimity is cheaper reached that moment black labour will have to go. I think it a fortunate circumstance that this question of mail contracts passed over to the Commonwealth GovernGhange-which ment, because there seems to be more prosreason pect of unanimous action being taken. The agent of the P. and O. Company, in a comsubjects. munication addressed to the Postal Confercriminate. ence in 1895, says :The reason of this« company employing native crews in preferencefcoEuropeans is, thai; after many years' experience of both, the former have proved themselves to be in every way more satisis factory. The immediate reason for doing away with European crews infchelower grades is they caused an infinity of trouble through drunkenness and disobedience, &c. I do not believe a word of that. I think fchafc is a paltry subterfuge, under which get cheap labour on the boats, and, of course, to do that they feel that they must insult the class of labour which has been hitherto employed. He continuesAs a matter of fact the employment of lascars fchem. costs the company more than if they employed Europeans, forfchereason thatfcheformer are kept and paid all the year round, whereas the latter are, as a rule, signed off the articles on arrival in London. The honourable member, for Bland will see fchafc the Orient Company is employing black labour on the statement; of the agent of the P. and O. Company, not upon the ground that it is cheaper, but for other reamake sons. Ifc appears to me that since we have fco pay a subsidy for the carrying of these mails, we ought to have some voice as to the. class of labour that shall be employed board. Another statement which has been made during the debate is that the.people India subsidize the mail boats which carry our mails backwards and forwards to Engthat land. That is not so. We pay £75,000 year, and the British Government pays £90,000, so that £165,000 is the total amount paid, and that expenditure is I divided between the British and Australian Governments. The Indian Government pays absolutely notliing towards the conprofits, tract.",27
77,Mr BEID,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,I did not mean to convey that fchey were contributing to the postal contracts of the mother country with AusA l l that I said was-that the mails might be conveyed up to a certain point in than that he the same boat.,28
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"I was about to ex to plain thafcfcheHome Government has always saidfchafcthey could get our contract much by reason of entering into it at the same time that the contract is made with the Indian Government. That is one of the has reasons why they would not make the has been suggested. Another is that they decline to discriminate between the various descriptions of British Our answer is, that they do disThey allow companies to say that they will not have white labour on their boats. There is discrimination employed in regard tofcheclass of labour to be carried on the boafcs, and that discrimination against the white labour which used to be fchafcemployed. Now that this evil is spreading to other companies than the P. and O. Company, it seems to be assuming a very serious aspect indeed. I am glad to hear the Prime to Minister say that he will take firm steps to see that white labour is not excluded from these boats--thaf c as we subsidize these boats to such a large extent, he will see that only our own labour is employed on",28
79,Mr MCDONA LD,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON," I desire to say a few words upon this matter. Ifc is their just another one of those economic conditions with which we are surrounded. The fact is that this company finds today that this fchey can make more money by employing black labour than white. That is the whole position which the company takes up-the y no bones about it . They said distinctly in a letter the other day that the white man is not reliable. The fact is that the white man has unions, and is prepared to fight for on better conditions fchan the company are willing to give. Because he wants to get of those conditions the.. company say that he is not reliable,fchafche is a drunkard, he is immoral, and that he is not a fit to associate with mankind generally. That is just about the position which the ship-owners take up in this connection. f we go back to the time prior to the introduction of factory legislation, we shall find that the employers, in trying to make bigger were prepared not only . to sacrifice the women, but also the children of - their own race. Now, we find, when factory legislation prevents that sort of thing, they are prepared to sacrifice the white manwhom they call upon to protect their property in time of need-for the sake of making bigger dividends by employing coloured labour. It is perfectly true, as - has been stated by the honourable member for West Sydney, that in England it is all very well to allow this question of black labour to slide by. Ifc is all very well for to turn round and say-""Our Indian subjects are British subjects, and we have no righb to interfere with them."" It is very nice for the British peoplefcosay that when there is no fear of black labour going there. The conditions surrounding England are not such as are favourable fco coloured races, but here the conditions are altogether different. Those races thrive here, and they are within easy distance of their shores. . Under such circumstances it behoves every honourable member of this House, and every individual in this country to take warning by the Motion of the ship-owners in this particular connection. A little while ago the employment of black labour was confined to one or two companies. Now, owing to competition, another company follows their example. But, if it is a reasonable thing that these companies should be allowed to make bigger dividends by the employment of coloured labour on their ships, why should we not allow the same thing in connection with our coastal steamers 1 Without going any further into this matter, because we shall have an opportunity of dciling with it later on, I wish heartily to congratulate the Prime Minister on the statement which he has made this afternoon, that he will endeavour to deal with it in a way that will be creditable not only to the Government, but to the country generally.",28
80,Mr OMALLEY,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON," I am indeed pleased that the leader .of the democratic party in this House, the honourable member for Bland, should have risen this afternoon to move the adjournment in order to call attention to a growing and intolerable evil. There is no question now that the time has arrived when something should be done to give the white man in Australia a chance. It is gradually becoming a black man's country. Every time that the democrats of Australia attempt to do something to put the white man on a level of equality with the gentleman' of colour, a wire comes from across the continent, saying-""You must not interfere withfcheBritish subject."" I suppose that if 50 or 60 of these coloured gentlemen were to knock a man down and kick him, the answer would be- "" you must not interfere, because they are British subjects.""",29
81,Mr TCJDOR,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,What do they do in the United States ?,29
82,Mr OMALLEY,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"Shoo t them. I am very glad that my honourable friend has them called attentionfcothafc. The slaves in the southern states were forced upon them 200 years ago by the merchants of Liverpool. The commercial age demanded it, and today the American people have to face one of the greatest problems of the age through the commercial sordidness of England 200 years ago. I am pleased fco think that the Prime Minister is the right man in the right place, because he is a trueblooded Australian, and wants to keep Australia for the white man.",29
83,Mr WH GROOM,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"Darling Downs) I desire to say that I am very much pleased that the honourable member for Bland should have brought this question before the House. I had a conversation with some honourable members the other day in relation to it. This question bas been before the people of Queensland both at general elections and also particularly before its Legislature, and the unanimous opinion is that all ships coming to Queensland which are subsidized by the Government should carry none but white sailors. We had a most painful illustration of the undesirableness of lascar crews, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Bland-in the unfortunate wreck of the Quetta. The terrible scenes which were witnessed On that occasion, and the way in which the women and children were thrust aside in order, that the lives of these lascars might be saved, sent a thrill throughoutfchewhole of Queensland, and the Legislature demanded that there should be no more lascar crews employed upon steamers subsidized by the Government.",29
84,Mr SAWEHS,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,Is that state of things confined to one race?,29
85,Mr WH GROOM,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"I do not say that it is. I am only mentioning this as an instance. I dare say that those acquainted with the circumstances of that wreck will remember that there was one unfortunate young lady who was in the water for 36 hours. After she bad been there - for 24 hours she succeeded in reaching a raft, on which there were three lascars. In place of exhibiting any traces of humanity on such a terrible occasion, these lascars exhibited such a savage character towards the young lady that she preferred to go into the water again rather than risk her life with those men.  Mr WH GROOM' - It is perfectly true, because it is in our official records. The Queensland people at once demanded that there should be a change in reference to the employment of black labour on vessels subsidized by the Government. That change was carried into effect. delighted to hear what has fallen from the Prime Minister and the leader Qf the Opposition. I think that the Prime Minister can now appeal to the British, authorities with confidence knowing that he has the States afc his back, and that allfchemembers of this Legislature are also behind him. I think this is a time when firmness should be exercised. I have every confidence i nfcheright honourable gentleman that after such an expression of opinion as he bas heard today he will make such representations to the Imperial authorities as will bring about all that we desire.",29
86,Mr SAWERS,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON," I cannot refrain from adding afew words to this debate. We have had a great fuss made about the employment of a few lascars on board ships subsidized by the Australian Government. I am quitein touch witlifchehonorable member who brought this question forward, because I have always advocated that we should do our best to give all possible employment toour own people in preference to coloured races, but I cannot understand the consistency of the honourable member for West Sydney, who delivered such a glowing free-trade speech in-this House some time ago, or the leader of the Opposition upon this question. What position do they take up? That these lascai*s- a miserable number after all-ar e robbing a few of our white population of employment. I would call attention to the fact that not long ago there ' was a great industry in the Scottish town of Dundee, which was then the centre of the jute trade.",30
87,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"I do not think that the question of the jute trade is under discussion, .and unless the honourable member can connect it with the subject he will not be in order in referring to it.",30
88,Mr SAWERS,EMPLOYMENT OP COLOURED LABOUR ON,"I am not going to discuss the jute trade. I am only giving an' illustration of the way in which the people of India have robbed the people of Dundee of a great industry. Dundee was the centre of a great trade, but because the jute trade could be carried on in India at a cheaper rate than was the case in Dundee, the Indian people have captured that trade all over the world. Yet I will guarantee that the leader of the Opposition is an advocate of the Indian people retaining that trade as against our own people - I wish to point out the absolute inconsistency of honourable members and the degradaI am tion of this screeching to the galleryof this bid for the democratic vote. There is no consistency in the attitude taken up by honourable members on the other side of the House. - Mr FOWLER (Perth) - The state of my health is, I think, a guarantee that I will not detain the House very long. But I feel impelled to make one or two observations principally in connection with the tone of pessimism adopted by the Prime: Minister when he discussed the likelihood or otherwise of our suggestionsbeing adopted by the Imperial Government. There is no doubt that in the past the Imperial authorities may have been somewhat unwilling to deal with this matter; but although the lasfc postal conference does not take us very far back, still from that date until the present time events of a very important character have happened with regard to the Empire, and the importance of conserving the interests of the Empire. I feel quite sure that if this Parliament presents this matter to the Imperial authorities in the proper way-no t as a question affecting Australia alone, and not by any means as a fiscal question, as some honourable members have tried to make it, but as a matter affecting as it really does the whole of the Empire- I take it we have every reason to hope for the careful consideration of the Imperial authorities in dealing with this very great question. It is rapidly assuming a serious character. The thin end of the wedge has already entered, and commercialism is rapidly driving it home. We know that there is no patriotism in the commercial spirit of the age. AYe know that commercialism is willing to trade as far as it can with the most deadly enemies of the country. That has happened time and again in the past, and it will happen in the future. I feel sure that as soon as the various countries realise that the employment of coloured lahour means additional profits, they will be simply tumbling over one another in their hurry to adopt the system. Where will that lead us 1 Ib siniply means the extinction of British maritime supremacy. If that point alone is emphasized in dealing with this matter, I feel sure that the people of the mother country will compel their statesmenfcogive earnest and careful consideration to the very important subject we are discussing this afternoon.

90,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"This is a clause to whichfcheChamber, of Commerce of Adelaide has drawn attention, and I believe the be honourable member for Melbourne also menfor tioned the matter during the course of the debate. Ifc is objected that the making of a sight entry is left too much in the discretion of the collector, and I propose to amend the clause to meet the objection. Clause amended to read as follows - and agreed toIffcheowner cilnnofc immediately supplyfchefull particulars for making an entry, and shall make a declaration to that effect before the collector, he to a commitmay make a sight entry. Clause 66. Entries shall bs made of the whole of any cargo landed or to be landed not later than seven days the report offcheship or within such further time if any as the.collector may see fit to allow; and so that if the goods are placed in quarantine seven days at the least shall be allowed for entry after their release from quarantine. (a) If default shall be made in the entry of any goods pursuant to this section, the collector may cause the goods to be removed to a warehouse; and if the goods are not claimed and entries passed there for within six months after such removalfchegoods may be sold by the collector. (ft) If the goods are of a perishable nature they may be sold at any time the collector thinks fit, either before or after warehousing.  This is another of the clauses in which the 145, Chamber of Commerce, at Adelaide, and the Importers' Association of. the same city desire to have alterations made: The objection is that the wharfs at Adelaide are all privately owned, and the importers prefer to retain the words in the.existing Act. To that end I move That the words ""seven days,"" line 6, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""the period prescribed in the Customs Act.""",31
91,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Is that the wording in - the present Acts ?  , submitted by the Chamber of Commerce and the Importers' Association. Minister can suggest other words to meet the difficulty I. should be glad.",32
92,Mr BIEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,What is the period prescribed in the Customs Acts 1  in the South Australian Customs Act. The Adelaide merchants object very strongly to this seven clays arrangement.,32
93,Mr HABPEK,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"This is merely a limitation to the effect that the period shall not exceed seven days.  and I suppose the merchants have seen that also, but they are very strong in their objection.",32
94,Mr HARPER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It may be desirable in . other placesfcohave the seven-day period.,32
95,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I would ask the committee not to accept this amendment. This is a Customs Act, and we do not want fco interfere between importers and ship-owners unnecessarily. As far as the collection customs is concerned we are satisfied if theentries are passed within seven days after the reporting of the ship, but the fact is thafcfcheship-owners or. the merchants wish to bring pressure upon' one or the other by shortening the term. We do not want to interfere, but prefer to let tliem make their contracts as they please to meet the case. We do not want to lay down a hard-and-fast rule with regard fco a shorter period,- and I am sure that honourable members will see that the clause should stand. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed fco. Clause 70 agreed to. Clause 74 (Annual fee).",32
96,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"There was an objection taken fco the schedule, and honourable members will see that I have brought down a schedule which we shall have an opportunity of discussing afterwards; but in order to make it applicable we must alter the clause in the way I now propose. Clause amended to read as follows, and agreed toPees for warehouses according to the scale in Schedule 2 shall be paid by the licensee as to the annual fees by equal, quarterly payments in advance, onfchefirst days of Januarj', April, July, and October in each year, and asfcofchefees for lookers' attendance by monthly payments. Clause 93 (Regauging or reweighing"" of goods).  But if the wish to have this clause amended by striking out the words of the clause which seem to throw the expense of having goods regauged, reweighed, or examined upon the owner of the goods, irrespective of whether the regauging has been done either by direction of the collector or at the request of the owner. It is considered unreasonable that the owner should bear the expense in cases where the regauging is clone by the collector, ancl I move That the words ""and expense"" be omitted.",32
97,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"There must be some misunderstanding regarding this clause, because where the regauging is done by the direction of the collector, no expenses are charged, but where the owner asks for it he is required to, and, I think, ought, to bear the expense. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 119 (Goods exported to be of landed afc proper destination).",32
98,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It was pointed out in connection with this clause that goods were very often entered for places to which it wasnofc intended fco send them-tak e Guam for instance.,32
99,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Not only fchafc, but vessels have sometimes to call for orders afc certain ports.",32
100,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Yes . All our concern, is that if the goods are not landed in some foreign countiy, but are brought back fco Australia, they shall not be landed here without the permission of the collector, and I propose to amend the clause ""So as to make this quite clear. Clause amended to read as follows, and agreed to No goods shipped for export shall be unshipped oilanded withoutfchepermission of the collector, except in parts beyond'the seas.

I move That the words ""or to account for such goods to the satisfaction of the collector "" be added to the clause. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 133(1) Whenever any dutiable goods are composed of two or more separate parts an}' part though imported by itself shall be proportionately chargeable with duty afc the rate applicable to the complete goods. (2) When the duty on the complete goods is specific or both specific and ad. valorem the Minister may fix the proportionate rate of duty wibh which any part shall be chargeable.  has been pointed outfchafcsome parts of the goods which are contemplated by this clause might be duty free, and exception is taken to this provision on the ground that it will enablefcheCustoms authorities to tax goods which are not chargeable with duty under the Tariff whilst in a complete state. I would ask the Minister to amend the clause in such a way as to meet this objection. - Mr THOMSON (North Sydney) Apart from the representations made by the honourable member for Soufch Australia, I desired to see this clause recommitted. My objection is that it gives extra power of imposing duties where it is not intended by the Tariff that they should be imposed. Any part, if imported by itself, will be proportionately chargeable with duty afc the rate applicable to the goods in their complete form. There may be some chemical preparation which bas so many parts of one chemical and so many parts of another, and under fchis provision, although one of these chemicals would be free if imported by it self, because fchis chemical goes into an article which is dutiable, power is to be given to enable duty to be charged upon it.",32
102,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,That is not the intention.,33
103,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If , for example, there is a duty upon buggies, and some one imports spokes for a buggy, although those spokes are notduitable, they are to be charged duty if they form a portion of the buggy. But if they are imported separately they will not be dutiable. I should think the substitution of the word ""pieces"" for ""parts"" would be desirable.",33
104,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,That would apply to machinery.,33
105,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It might go beyond machinery. I think that what I propose would effect the desire of the Minister. Then there is the question which has been raised by the honourable member for Soufch Australia, Mr Solomon. If Parliament puts spokes on the free list, and spokes came in accompanying a buggy, but not as a part of that buggy, then under this provision the Minister would have power to charge duty on the spokes that are separate.  machinery which come in free. Mr THOMSONYes ; brass work might be free, and engines might be dutiable. As the clause stands it gives power to the Minister fco impose a duty on all sorts of things that are not i nfcheTariff.",33
106,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The position seems to me to be very clear. There is so much duty levied upon an article. The people interested cut the article into two, and say that it is not the article which is dutiable. Thus they get at us.",33
107,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,There is a clause which covers that.,33
108,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If there were a duty upon buggies, for instance, of say £ 1 0 , I do not think that the honourable member wishes that the persons importing a buggy should be able to put the wheels into one package and the body into another, and thus evade the Customs. In such a case they might say-""Oh , this is not a buggy."" Surely that ought to be prevented. There is no intention to impose a duty upon an article which this Parliament does not intend to be taxed. The clause says ""any part"" of dutiable goods. Here there is a lump sum as regardsfchewhole. Whenever any part of dutiable goods is introduced we charge in proportion to the whole of the fixed duty. I think that is fair.",33
109,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The Minister does not arrive at what he wants.,33
110,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I think so; it is the best way that I know of afc this moment.,33
111,Mr MCC AY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I confess to sharing the apprehension of the honourable member for North Sydney in reference to clause 133. We want Parliament to decide what the duty is to be, and not to leave the matter vague. Let us suppose that bicycles carry a duty of 10 per cent. All parts of bicycles are admitted free at the present time, the object being to give employment in putting the machines together. It seems to me that this clause will in all probability interfere with some such object in many oases. Under this clause every part used in the manufacture of a bicycle would be - dutiable, and yet Parliament might say that parts of bicycles are to be admitted free. Then the Minister might raise the question that some particular part of a bicycle might be used in some other way. I am a strong believer in the principle that everything which is not specifically made dutiable should be free. This seems to me to create a difficulty. I cannot quite understand the meaning of the word "" proportionately "" in this clause. The second portion of the clause is clearly applicable to specific duty, or to specific and ad valorem duties. Presumably, therefore, the first part applies to ad valorem duties. I do not know that it could not be interpreted to mean that if an engine which was worth £100 pays a duty of 20 per cent., and that part of it were imported which was worth £ 1 0, that it should only pay one-tenth of 20 per cent.",33
112,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Oh , no.",34
113,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Of course, I know that that is not intended. I think that the use of the word "" proportionately "" confuses the meaning if sub-clause (1) is meant to apply to ad valorem duties.",34
114,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Does not the honourable and learned member think that the word "" part"" is going beyond the intention of the clause 1",34
115,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Personally , I have not that apprehension. I do not think that "" a part"" means. an ingredient, though I quite admit that it may be argued in that way. Por example, bicycle bearings would form part of a bicycle. But if the tire were composed of india rubber and canvas mixed together, fchey would not be parts.",34
116,Mr SALMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The word "" separate "" is used here.",34
117,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I think that that refers to the part itself, and not to the ingredients which go to make up a complete article.",34
118,Mr SALMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I think this is one of the most difficult clauses in the Bill. Ifc is difficult for the committee fco come to a right conclusion, [195] owing to the absolute impossibility of being definite on the point. In my opinion this is one of the matters that will have to be left to administration. I believe it is absolutely impossible to lay down a hardand-fasfc rule.",34
119,Mr HARPER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The honourable member has had experience of a similar clause. Mu. SALMON - Yes , in the Victorian Customs department. I am not in favour of Parliament relegating its duties to the Minister, but under the circumstances, I say, from my experience, that it will be impossible for us to lay clown a rule which can be followed in every case by the Minister who is acting on behalf of the State. The honourable ancl learned member for Corinella has said that in his opinion every article not specifically charged with duty ought to be free. That is a matter of opinion. I recognise that when a Tariff is being framed it is impossible for every article which may be manufactured during the period of the operation of that Tariff to be taken into consideration by a Parliament. New articles are being placed on the market every day, and we must be governed largely by the preceding clause, which allows the Minister to exercise discretion as regards substitutes. That clause, is absolutely necessary in order that the revenue may be safeguarded, and also that the fiscal policy of the country-if it be a protective one-shal l be adequately protective in itself. If we say that every article which has not a duty placed opposite to it upon the Tariff list is to be free, then on the other hand there is nothing to prevent us from saying that those articles which are not specifically set down as free shall be charged a certain duty. Let us take any article that we choose, divide it into its component parts, and it will be found that a rate of duty will be chargeable on those parts. Some of those parts may carry no duty at all, but if we take the whole we shall find that in very few instances does the duty on the finished article agree with the aggregate of the duty charged upon each separate part. This shows the. difficulty that exists and - that will continue to exist so long as we have these intricate matters to deal with. The provision in the clause is mandatory. It says- "" Shall be proportionately chargeable with duty."" The Minister is not allowed any discretion. It would not be the desire of the Minister to charge duties upon articles which had been specifically placed upon the free list. :",34
120,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The Minister could not charge duties upon articles declared to be free. ',35
121,Mr SALMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"No exception is made in the clause. It says that "" every, part shall be chargeable."" The Minister will be compelled to charge a proportionate rate of duty upon every part, even though that part may be an article which has been placed on the free list.",35
122,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The honourable learned member's objection can be met inserting the word "" dutiable "" before the have actions afc law. word ""part.""",35
123,Mr SALMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Then we are met with the difficulty that unless a specific duty placed upon each part it will be impossible for the Minister to protect the revenue, because it may be found that the duties the parts imported do not aggregate the duty on the finished article. I should prefer to see. this matter leftto the discretion of the Minister. In my opinion the clause should readWhenever any dutiable goods are composed two or more separate ports, any port, though imported by itself, should be proportionately chargeable with duty if the Minister so directs. No doubb such a provision would result i the making of a number of decisions by Ministers. But I do not see how we can tionate avoid what is known as the "" Decisionwould book "" in connection with our Commonvide wealth Customs. A decision-book is already in existence in the States, and although cases. there are perhaps only 1,000 or 2,000 articles on our Tariff list, the decisions ber perhaps 10,000 or 12,000. Knowing but I do not see that it is so necessaiy in re that, we should frame as perfect a Tariff as possible. But in my opinionfchisis one of the cases in whichfcheMinister should have discretion. I would rather see the clause altered as I have suggested than make it mandatory upon the Minister to charge duty upon every part, or haveit provided parts shall be admitted free unless they are charged with dufcy.",35
124,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," May I draw the duty attention of the Minister to the possible scope for litigation under this provision. The first sub-clause provides that parts shall be portionately chargeable with dufcy, while the second sub-clause provides that in tain cases-wher e the dufcy on the complete goods is specific, or both specific and valorem - and in those cases only, the [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. Minister may fix the proportionate rate of duty. Where the dufcy is purely ad valorem, the Minister has no power to fix the proportionate rate.",35
125,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,That is provided for by. the first; sub-clause.,35
126,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If there is any dispute, the matter must go to the law courts.",35
127,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,No .,35
128,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That must be so, because who else is to decide the question ? 1 think, that the Minister should take powerfcofix and the proportionate rate in every case where by there is a dispute, so that we shall not (",35
129,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Can the honourable and. learned member give us an instance in is which the duty on the complete goods is both specific and ad valorem ?,35
130,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I do not know that I on can 1 But I will take the case where the? duty is ad valorem only-as it is onwatches, bicycles, and guns. I am clear that; the clause means that the Minister shall "" have no power to fix the. proportionate rate; of duty unless the duty on the complete of goods is specific Or both specific and a d valorem. Therefore, if there is a dispute between the department and importer, it can be settled only by the law courts. Then importer will say to the department;- "" The Minister has no power to fix the proporrate in this case."" I think that it save trouble and litigation to prothat the Minister shall have power fco fix the proportionate rate of dufcy in all",35
131,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"There is a great numtemptation to give the Minister that power, r gard to the first sub-clause as in regard to the second sub-clause. In the cases mentioned, in the second sub-clause it may be troublesome to apportion the specific and ad valorem rates, and to say what is a fair duty to be charged upon a part; but the morethat I look at the clause the more inclined I am to think that it is right. Let us suppose that a buggy upon which the rate of chargeable is-let us say, to please the. honourable member for North Sydney- 5 per cent., is imported in parts. If the Tariff procontains an express declaration that these parts are to be admitted duty free, well cerand good; the Customs authorities will have fco smile and bear it as best they ad may. But if there is no such declaration, what ought to be done 1 It seems to methat the value of the various parts should he considered as parts of the whole, and that fchey should pay duty accordingly. That is all that we are asking in the clause.",35
132,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I know that that is what is intended byfcheclause.,36
133,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Yes ; and I do not think that anything else is provided. Considering the fairness of a provision of that sort, I trust that' the honourable member will allow the clause to pass. As regards the second part of the clause, where it is a more difficult matter of calculation, the Minister may fairly be asked to exercise his discretion in fixing the proportionate rate, in order to save complications - An imported buggy may be worth £ 5 0 , its body may be worth £ 2 0 , and its wheels some other amount. What we propose is that each part shall be proportionately chargeable with duty according to its value.",36
134,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I do not object to the intention which the Minister has in view-that if any machine or vehicle is chargeable with dufcy no importation of it in parts shall enable the importer to escape the payment of that duty; but the regulations made' under this clause will override any Tariff Act that we may pass in the future. They will apply to all such Acts and will, I presume, override their provisions. I have not looked at this matter from a fiscal point of view, nor have I considered any of the provisions of the .Bill from that stand-point. But I say that if Parliament decides that certain duties shall be charged, the Minister should not have power to act contrarily to that decision. The honourable and learned member for Corinella says that under the present Victorian Tariff bicycles are chargeable with duty, but imported parts of bicycles are not. Suppose the Federal Parliament determines what in my opinion would not be a proper thing to determine, that parts of bicycles shall not be chargeable with dufcy, though completed bicycles shall be chargeable, this provision will allow the Minister to charge duty upon those parts, and thus act contrary to the determination of Parliament. »",36
135,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The clause could not have that effect, because the Tariff, being the later A.ct, would have the fuller force.",36
136,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I think that the regulations made under the clause would override any Tariff that we might pass.,36
137,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"No , they could not. 3075",36
138,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If that is so, there is less objection tofcheclause, though I do not see why, if the spokes of a buggy were not chargeable with duty, the Minister could not. under the clause malte them chargeableOne of. the suggestions which I made-that the word "" pieces "" should be substituted for"" parts ""-ha s been answered by the debatewhich has taken place, find I am of opinion now that the word "" parts "" would not cover "" ingredients."" I still think, however, that the clause should be made fco more fully express what is desired by the Minister.",36
139,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The honourable member for North Sydney is a little in error in thinking that the provisions of the clause would override any Tariff that might be passed by the Parliament. They could not do so. If any provision in this Bill clashes with the provisions of a measure passed subsequently to it, the provisions of the subsequent measure will hold good.",36
140,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Why not take the suggestion then that the parts shall be chargeable at the discretion of the Minister?,36
141,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I could put in the words "" unless otherwise provided "" ; but, of course, whatever is provided subsequently and differs from this provision ""provides otherwise."" The measure which we are now considering is not like the Constitution Act, which Parliament cannot alter.",36
142,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I should be prepared to leave it to the discretion of the Minister.,36
143,Mr SOLMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS, What I suggest is that the clause should readShall be proportionately chargeable with duty when so directed by the Minister at the rate applicable to the complete goods. That would place upon the Minister the responsibility of deciding whether the parts should or should not be charged with dufcy. Although I am not in favour of allowing the Minister to impose duties-thaf c being the business of Parliament-in cases like this it is absolutely necessary to leave matters to his discretion.,36
144,Mr HARPER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS, T l i e provisions of this clause should apply only to parts of machines or vehicles j they could not apply to ingredients.,36
145,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Thaf c is so.,36
146,Mr HARPER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I understand that the intention of the clause is that parts of a machine which is chargeable with duty shall not be allowed to escape duty if imported separately. I understand that it is not intended to apply to the raw material. Suppose, for instance, that wood which has been turned, and is ready to be made into spokes, is imported, it is not intended that the clause shall apply to it, butfchafc,on the other hand, it will apply to spokes which are finished and are imported ready to be placed in a wheel. If that is so, I do not think that the clause will do much harm. But I . would ask how it will be possible.in such a case to comply with the concluding words of the first part of the clause-thaf c the part Shall be proportionately chargeable with duty at the rate applicable fco the complete goods. What proportion would the spokes of a buggy bear to the complete vehicle ?",36
147,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"We do not want the word "" proportionately."" Ifc will be sufficient to say "" chargeable afc the rate.""",37
148,Mr HARPER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Suppos e that the duty on the buggy is 10 per cent.,37
149,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,That case is dealt with in the second part of the clause relating to cases where the duty on the complete goods is specific,37
150,Mr HARPER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I think it will be rather difficult under the circumstances to tax a part in proportion to the whole.,37
151,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," This matter ought, to be left to the discretion Of the Minister. The last speaker said he did not think this clause would apply to goods generally, but; I think it would apply to saddlery and harness, where dutiable parts are very often imported. I know of cases where harness has been imported bearing metal parts which were dutiable, while the other parts of the harness were not dutiable.",37
152,Mr HABPEA,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It will applyfcoharness or machines.,37
153,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It will apply to machinery, saddlery, or anything of that kind, and the matter had better be left to the discretion of the Minister.",37
154,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I am willing to amend the clause hy omitting the word "" proportionately"" ; but first I move That afterfcheword ""shall,"" line 3,fchewords "" if so directed byfcheMinister "" be inserted.",37
155,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I would like to say one word of general application. This Bill confers enormous power on the Minister to legislate in many respects, and clause 132 also gives that powerfcoan enormous extent. The present amendment seeks to do the same thing, and allows the Minister to say whether duty shall be chargeable or not. Some of these days a question will be raised under the Constitution, whether it is competent for us to delegate our power to anybody. The first section of the Constitution Act vests the legislative power of the Commonwealth in a Federal Parliament, and under American decisions it may be found that some of the provisions we are now making to confer legislative power on the Minister are invalid.",37
156,Mr CROUCH,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Are. there notalso decisions the other way, such as on the question of the referendum 1",37
157,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"No ; the decisions to which the honourable member refers are of a different class altogether. In reference to Canada, I know the Privy Council bas decided that infcheDominion there are plenary powers of legislation, and that the Parliament may delegate powers; but the words of their Constitution are very different from the words of our Constitution. I only say this in order that the Minister may consider the matter in this and future legislation. This is a question which cannot be easily decided at once, but is a very serious and important question; and it would be well for the Minister in future fco see that he gets as much"" power as he can provided in the Bill. The question will be raised sooner or later, and how it will be decided is a matter of conjecture, but the words of the Constitution are very strong. The judicial power is vested in the High Court, and the legislative power is vested in Parliament; and it is veiy doubtful whether these powers can be delegated. The usual power to make regulations to a limited extent may be given to the Minister, but here we give him the enormous power of saying whether or not a tax shall be put ou the people. That is an important part of the legislative power of-the Commonwealth.",37
158,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That is an important point, and I think it was raised in the Apollo Candle Company case. I am obliged fco the honourable member for drawing attention to the matter, but I should be sorry to believe that we had not as large power as it is proposed to exercise here.  objection uot be met by inserting after the word ""chargeable"" the words "" in such proportion as the Minister decides."" The .Minister would not be deciding that a dufcy should be charged, but only the proportion in which it should be charged.",37
159,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I want to get rid of the word "" proportionately.""  made the Minister would direct what proportion of dufcy the parts should pay.",38
160,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,What we want is really to give the Minister power to fix the value of the parts.,38
161,Mr A MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Thaf c would be mentioned in the invoices, and would not be difficult to arrive at.",38
162,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I think we had better let the clause stand as proposed. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr KINGSTON) agreed toThat the word. "" proportionately,"" line 8, be omitted. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 134Dufcy shall be charged ou all essences, condensations, concentrations, or preparations of goods liable to duty according fco the quantity of dutiable goods into which such essences, condensations, concentrations, or preparations can be converted.  some quarters it is thought that this clause should not appear in this Bill but in the Tariff Bill, where there could be clearer definitions as to the proportions of the essences and other preparations referred to. I suppose, however, thafcfcheMinister is the best judge as to where the clause should appear. Those who have a lot to do with the Customs say that there should be some additional definition as to the essences, condensations, and so forth, and that as a great deal of trouble might be caused by the clause, it had better be omitted. I shall not move at present to omit the clause, will wait until I hear what the Minister to say.",38
163,Mr SALMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I regard it this clause as a natural sequence to' 132, but I do not think the provision is specific enough. I should like to see an selected. alteration made by the omission of the words ""quantity of dutiable goods into which,"" and the words "" equivalent quantity done. of dutiable goods for which "" put in their stead. Then the last three - words ""can be converted"" .ought to be omitted, and the words inserted in lieu thereof "" capable being used or substituted.""",38
164,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I think substitution is sufficiently provided for in clause 132.,38
165,Mr SALMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"We do not know from day fco day what new inventions or what new applications of old materials there may be. It is absolutely necessary we should have some means of dealing with goods which we may consider it necessary to protect at the present time, but which may be displaced by subsequent inventions or manufactures foi"" the specific purpose. The amount will necessarily vary in almost - every case, and we know that the strength of the essences or condensation really should govern the duty which should be placed on tliem. Mi'. KINGSTON - Why not say "" quantity or equivalent quantity""? I want to meet honourable members, but I am inclined to think-the word ""quantity"" covers the case. Would it not be making the clause too Strong to insert "" equivalent ""1",38
166,Mr SALMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I shall leave the matter entirely to the Minister. Clause agreed to. Clause 137All medicinal or toilet preparations not completely manufactured, but imported for completing the manufacture thereof, or for the manufacture of any other article by the addition of any ingredient or by mixing such preparations or by putting up or labelling the same alone or with other articles or compounds under any proprietary or trade uaine shall be irrespective of cost valued for duty, and duty shall be paid thereon at the ordinary market value in the country whence imported of the completed preparation when put up and labelled under such proprietary or trade name lessfcheactual cost of labour and material used or expended in Australia in completing the manufacture thereof or of putting up or labelling the same.",38
167,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS, This but seems rather a peculiar and extraordinary has clause. I believe that a. similar provision appears in one Customs Acfc. Most certainly does not appear in many of the Acts of the clause States. I do not know why medicinal and toilet; preparations should be specially,38
168,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Because it is in connection with these preparations that it is,38
169,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The same thing is done in other preparations, but that is regarded as nothing. After the first part of of the clause we come to an intricate and complicated provision by which there is a certain set-off against the duty, as shown in the wordsLess the actual cost of labour and material used or expended in Australia in completing the manufacture thereof, or of putting up or labelling the same That means to say that if there is a certain ingredient which it is known is going fco be put; into a proprietary article, and that article happens to be in the Tariff, then the duty shall be charged upon that ingredient, although the same ingredient may be admitted absolutely free to the proprietors of any other similar articles and where it is going fco be manufactured into a product of the same character. Thafc is an extraordinary power to give. It will give power to the Minister to make dutiable what has been declared by Parliament not to be dutiable. The only reason for ib is that a heavier dufcy may be collected where there is a dufcy on an article, or that a dufcy may be collected where there is no duty at all. When we were discussing clause 133, it was said that the Tariff Act would override these regulations. Thafc cannot be affirmed in connection with this clause, because the only reason for putting the clause here is fchafc an article which is not otherwise dutiable, or is . chargeable with a lesser duty, shall be charged with a duty or a higher duty. Ifc cannot, therefore, be contemplated that pills and perfumery. the Tariff will overridefchisclause.",38
170,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Every subsequent Act can override it .,39
171,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I would ask the Minismanufacturer ter how that could be under this particular clause. The ""Only object of putting it apparently, is to enable the collector charge duty on an article which would otherwise, under the Tariff, escape dufcy, to collect a higher dufcy on an article which under the Tariff would be subject to a lower dufcy. Therefore, if the Tariff would override these regulations, what would be the use of them ? The clause not only gives a power which could be exercised in the direction of preventing the evasion dufcy, if there were evasion, but it would create other most inequitable conditions. Take the case of Barry's "" Trioopherous."" Under fchis clause, i ffcheingredients of preparation were imported separately, and subsequently the agents for the proprietors put them together and sold them within Commonwealth as Barry's ""Trioopherous,"" the Customs authorities could come down and charge dufcy upon the ingredients in same way as if they had been imported made up in the first place.",39
172,Mr HAKPEB,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Eve n though the ingredients might be used for a variety of other purposes.,39
173,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Yes . The ingredients might be used for other j>urposes, and the Customs authorities would either have to make the most invidious distinctions, or levy dufcy upon all these ingredients for whatever purpose they might be used. Further than that, there is nothing to prevent similar articles being put up by another person within the State, and going into consumption without paying a farthing of duty. An enormous injustice might be done to the proprietors of the preparation in one aspect of the case, and in another aspect of the case great hardship would be inflicted if the dufcy were charged on the articles used, not only in making up these preparations, but for other purposes. This is a most unnecessary and undesirable provision, and it may very well be left out of the Bill. Ifc is not in any other Customs Act except one, namely, that of Western Australia.  and has special reference to pills.",39
174,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It is chiefly aimed at .,39
175,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It may be aimed at pills and perfumery, but the power goes beyond what is desired. Apart from that, I would like to know why pills j>ut up by one in the State should be chargeable with duty while the ingredients of the in, pills put up by a neighbouring competitor to should not be chargeable with duty. Where is the fairness of compelling a man to pay or dufcy on the materials that he brings in i u order to make up a certain thing whilst allowing his aeighbour to make a similar article, perhaps with the very same ingredients, and to go scot free of duty upon the materials that he imports. I think that, in view of the small chance of loss to the Customs, Ave of should not have a clause of this sort inserted in the Bill, which would go beyond the intentions of the Minister, and which even within the bounds of his,, intentions this would operate very unjustly and dangerously to the users of similar ingredients for making 1 other articles than those specially held in the view. A'ictoria and New Soufch Wales have never found it necessary fco have any sucli provision, and as owing to its injurious thenature the clause should be left out of the ""Bill altogether, I hope the Minister will agree to that course. ' Mr KINGSTON - I hope honourable - members will not be desirous of dispensing ""with this protection to the revenue. As I - pointed out, it is simply intended to meet the case of pills and perfumery. Those are two typical classes of medicinal and toilet preparations. The fact is that in the 'absence of provision of this kind-althoug h it is to be found in the Western Australian Act;-the practice has been with regard to pills, which, when made up and labelled, are of very considerable value, to practically mix up the materials in bulk, and then bring them in without being made into pills, or without a label. When the proprietor's are brought up, they say as regards the mixture out of which their pills are' made, that it is worth nothing, and that is the sort of case we want to meet. W it h a little labour,fchismaterial is ver}' quickly manufactured into enough pills to supply the whole continent, and perfumery is similarly dealt with to a very large extent. If these pills were imported made up, we should get a very fair contribution fco the revenue,' but, as matters stand, the proprietors are ""able to avoid j>aymenfc of duty. The way in which the manufacturers import their - goods afc present is simply a "" try o n "" to ;gefc a good deal the besfc of the revenue, and we think that the provision we make is quite fair.",39
176,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I resent the Minister's imputation that I am - defending any crime, and 1 say that it is no crime to do what he describes. If it is a - crime, then he gives every opportunity fco other people to commit that crime-eve n with the clause in the B i ll as proposed. How canfcheMinister justifyfchisprovision which be says is intended to meet the case of people importingfchematerial for making up pills. Just fancy our putting a clause in : the Bill bo deal with pills only. It seems - ridiculous that the Federal Legislature should be asked to put a clause into the Customs 'Regulation Act to meet a trifling loss such as'inighfc be incurred through raw materials coming into the State for the manufacture of pills here, instead of the pills being brought in in a manufactured form.",40
177,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,This is to prevent the revenue from being pillaged.,40
178,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The Minister's defence of this clause is like his defence of a good - many others in the Bill ; it never touched J i the provision in the Bill at all. The Minister practically says that it would be a crime to allow the proprietors of these pills to import the raw materials and then make the pills up here and sell them for a shilling a box and afc the same time entirely escape dufcy. But it is a crime only for one man. It is not a crime on the part of others who may do i tfcoany extent. The article-if it is a Commonwealth pill-ca n be manufactured to any extent. There aie some large manufactures already within the Commonwealth. They can bring in the raw materials free. If a proprietor chooses to put his workmen to that operation within the Commonwealth, then we invoke the provisions of a special clause, which has not been found necessary in any of the larger countries, to deal with that manufacturer as if he were a criminal-as the Minister states - for - doing that which is done in every Tariff Act under which raw materials are admitted free and the manufactured articles are dutiable.",40
179,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,He knows well when he brings in his Tariff that it will be all bitter pills.,40
180,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,We are giving far too much power to the Minister if we pass this provision. It deals with much more than pills--it deals with all medicinal and toilet preparations.  for completing their manufacture.,40
181,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I am quite aware of that. The clause, as I have already said, covers all medicinal and toilet preparations. If there is any reason why it should deal with all these things, the same reason will applyfcoother articles. The fact is simply that there has been a special object to get at the manufacturers-as the Minister puts it-of some pills. We are asked to give the Minister power to deal with every medicinal or toilet preparation, or with the ingredients which go fco make up these preparations. We are asked to allow him to ' deal with them in a way that is not proposed in the Tariff, although we may be interfering with other industries that consume the same articles fchafc are consumed in these preparations. Ifc is a very small matter, upon the Minister's own showing. Ifc has not been found necessary in other States, and I think it is highly undesirable to give to the Minister this great power to deal with such trifling importations as pills.

If after any agreement is made for the sale or delivery of goods duty paid any alteration takes place in the Tariff affecting goods before they are delivered for home consumption then in the absence of express written provision to the contrary, the agreement shall be altered as follows :(a) In the event of the Tariff being altered by a new or increased duty the seller after payment of the new or increased duty may addfchedifference caused by the alteration to the agreed price. (6) Infcheevent of the Tariff being altered by the abolition or reduction of duty the purchaser may deduct the difference caused by the alteration from the agreed price.",40
182,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I wish to question this clause upon the ground of equity, and also upon the question of the possibility of carrying it into effect. The first portion of the clause says that these provisions shall apply to all goods which the Tariff affects before they are delivered for home consumption. to point out a difficulty which may arise in that connection. Sometimes goods are sold for delivery for a considerable period ahead. Take, for instance, an item like that of tea. A certain number of halfchests of a particular line of tea may have been sold duty paid under contracts fox31 future delivery. A Tariff is then imposed. 15 Perhaps a thousand half-chests of this particular tea have been sold in that way.. 16 The vendor has only 500 half-chests duty paid in store. The other 500 are in bond. AYES. How is the vendor to deal with that case V To whom is he to give the duty paid portion, and to whom the portion which is in bond, upon which he will have to chargethe extra dufcy? The Minister does not provide for that. Then, in the next subclause, it is stated that in the event of an alteration of the Tariff the purchaser may deduct the difference caused by the alteration from the price agreed to. Ifc seems to* me that that arangement is not mutualThe vendor may have paid the duty, and yet the purchaser can deduct it . In the other case, perhaps the vendor has not paid, the dufcy, and the purchaser cannot be NOES. charged. But in the second case the vendor may have paid the duty and yet the purchaser can deduct it . To bring the two into unison, either the words "" afterpayment"" in sub-clause (a) should be omitted, or there should be inserted in subclause (6) a provision that the purchaser may, unless the vendor has paid the duty, deduct the difference caused by the alteration. That is to say, those gentlemen stand on a different footing. In the one case such payment is required by the' vendor, which will be very difficult to establish in many cases. In the case of an individual articlewe can easily establish it, but when we are dealing with thousands of articles it would be very difficult, indeed, to say which of that portion sold forward' was duty paid and which was not. If the words,. "" after payment"" in sub-clause (a) are to be retained, then the provision should be made in sub-clause (&) that thededuction shall take place only in the circumstances which I have indicated. It is merely a matter of equity.",41
183,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Does not the clause apply entirely to duty-paid goods ?,41
184,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The clause savsa ° If after any agreement is made forfchesale or I wish delivery of goods dufcy paid.,41
185,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The agreement is for the delivery of duty-paid goods, but the delivery may not take place until three or six months after the payment of the duty.",41
186,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Paragrap h (a) provides that the vendor shall pay an increased duty, ancl may add the difference to the agreed price.",42
187,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That is all right where some particular article-a steam-engine, for instance-is concerned. There is no difficulty about that part of the clause, and no objection can be taken to it on the ground of unfairness. But I am referring to agreements for the sale and delivery of articles which are sold by the ton or the pound or the package-articles sene, sugar, candles, corn, ancl so on-where there is no distinction made except in'regard to brands, and perhaps in regard to shipments. A merchant may have a certain quantity or weight of duty-paid articles - say 50 tons-in his store, ancl a certain quantity or weight of the same articles in bond, ancl the difficulty arises, supposing the duty is increased, ancl he has sold 150 tons duty paid, how is the increase to be apportioned ? However, that is merely a complication that arises incidentally. chief objection that I have to the clause is the want of mutuality between paragraphs (a) and (b).",42

Possiblyfcheclause is unnecessary; but I would suggest, either that the words "" after payment"" in paragraph (ft) be omitted, allow both parties to take, their chance, w or that in paragraph (b) the words "" unless the dufcy has been paid by the vendor,'""' be inserted after the word "" deduct."" That would put both parties on the same footing. As the clause stands, there is no mutuality between the paragraphs.",42

In such a case the vendor cannot recover the difference fromfchepurchaser.

204,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The words in the clause, "" delivered for home consumption,"" do fiot mean delivered to the purchaser. They refer to the clearance of the goods. I am willing to make that plain by inserting the word "" cleared.""",43

215,Mr HARPER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"A similar clause, was put into the Victorian Act only in 1896. We always did without such a clause befoie then.",43
216,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The object of the clause is that unless they have really agreed that the Tariff shall affect the bargain, and express that in writing, they shall not be held to have made that agreement.",43
217,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,But why should it be expressed in writing ?,43
218,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It is a simple way of preventing all sorts of attempts at imposition.,43
219,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Say , for instance, there is a contract to sell 100 tons of sugar, to be delivered three months ahead. Just prior to the time of delivery- a limit of time having been fixed, ancl the goods having to be delivered, say, on the 1st of October-in September, the Minister, we will say, proposes an alteration of the duties, which, as a matter of fact does not become law until December. The seller, owing to the increase in the dufcy, hasfcopay the increased dufcy in order to deliver by the 1st of October, the Tariff then being in its interim condition. Under the words of this clause he is not protected then, though he is protected if he can postpone delivery until after the Tariff actually becomes law.",43
220,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The seller may get a refund, which he may or may not give to the",43
221,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"He will not get a refund, because I am presuming that Parliament afterwards approves of the interim proposal. In that case the party is not protected, whereas he is protected if he is ' lucky enough to have a delivery day subsequent to the date when the change is lawfully made and the Governor General's assent is given to the Tariff proposal. If he is not entitled to protection in one case, he is not entitled to protection in the other. But if ' the date of delivery happens to come between the resolution protecting the revenue, ' which we will be sure to get in some form",44
222,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It may be impossible to it in any form.,44
223,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Af c any rate we will get it in future Tariffs. If the date of delivery happens to fall between the time of the "" Government proposal, after which the altered duty is collected, and the time of the lawful imposition of the dufcy, then the clause will not apply at all. If it applies in one case it ought; to apply in the other. The seller who hasfcopay an increased duty under a dubious resolution of the House of Representatives is surely as much entitled to be protected by Parliament as a man who has to pay an increased duty under the lawful Act of the two Houses of Parliament and the Governor General representing King.",44
224,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Bette r omit the clause.,44
225,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,There is a good deal to - be said in favour of that course.,44
226,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Let the parties look after themselves, and make their own contracts.",44
227,Mr HARPER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"-The solution suggested by the leader of the Opposition is the proper one. The clause would cause immense complications in view of impending changes in the Tariff. Merchants are all apprised of what is going to happen, and can take care of themselves. A similar clause was introduced i nfcheA'iotorian A ct in 1896, but since then I do not think it has been operative, because we have had no changes. The clause had better be omitted.",44
228,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The suggestion is one which recommends itself to the Government, and perhaps we had better let the clause go.",44
229,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," The suggestion to omit the clause having met the approval of the Government, may I point outfchafcfcheprovision was never intended for - cases such as have caused the Government to consent to 'the omission. It is not intended for the Tariff, which we all know is coming before us-in a few years. It is intended for cases of a different kind altogether, and is really a most useful and fair clause. Ifc is intended for cases where the Treasurer comes down and makes Tariff proposals, when perhaps not a human being in the community knew he was going to impose any taxation of the kind. A Treasurer has fco keep his proposals secret. We know in the States that when a Treasurer is going to make a financial statement there is a great deal of speculation whether or not there are going to be any duties, and the clause is intended for cases where the people have no get notice of impending changes, and have no idea afc the time they make the contracts fchafc the Tariff will be touched.",44
230,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The leader of the Opposition does not give much credit to merchants for intelligence if he thinks they do not know what the financial position is.,44
231,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It is not Onlyfchekeen men of business who have to be considered, but other people who may suffer seriously and who may not, perhaps, have keen lawyers to advise them. The average trader, perhaps a retail man, who is not accustomed to very large transactions with the Customs, might easily enter into an arrangement forfchedelivery of goods over a long period, and a the sudden alteration in the Tariff might be made that no man could foresee. The effect of having no provision of this kind is practically fco turn contracts upside down by some duty being brought in on the spur of the moment.. This is one of the most useful and fairest clauses in the Bill. As I say it is not intended to apply to the coming Tariff of which e very one knows.",44
232,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHABN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"They do not know much about it in England, and many people sell goods there to be delivered here.",44
233,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That may be. I strongly suggest to the Minister that fchis clause is not intended for the coming Tariff, but for sudden surprises sprung on the business community. But since the Minister has announced his intention to withdraw the clause I do not intend to argue with an Egyptian sphinx.",44
234,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I do not think a proper view has been put forward by the leader of the Opposition, and I speak with some experience.",44
235,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,A large experience .,44
236,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Wit h a little more experience perhaps than the leader of the Opposition has had amongst the trading community. From what I know of them. I should say fchey are quite able to protect themselves in respect to alterations of this sort.,44
237,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,And yet every Customs Act Customs Acts of the States. has a clause offchekind.,45
238,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,We were told a few moments ago that a similar clause was introduced into the Victorian Act only a few years ago.,45
239,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It was introduced only in 1895.,45
240,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Victori a is a special case.,45
241,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Victori a has had more experience of Customs, the leader of the Opposition will admit, than himself. The object aimed at by the clause is to protect traders generally. In nearly every instance retailers do not order far ahead, but where they do, and they see that the finances of the State are such as to render likely the imposition of duties or the alteration of the Tariff, they provide against contingencies. I have seen quite enough instances of where that has been done.",45
242,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Is that not a pretty striking argument for having such a clause ? Every Customs Act, including the last English Act, has a provision of the kind.",45
243,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I was very much impressed by the point pufc forward by the honourable member for North Sydney, and also struck with the difficulty of providing for every possible contingency. If we are going to provide for every contingency, why not provide for the public being refundedfcheamount of duty which may have been paid.",45
244,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,If c is impossible.,45
245,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The general public are the most likely to be defrauded- I do not say wilfully-o r the most likely to suffer, and if we cannot protect them surely we can trust the intelligent trader to look after his own interests.",45
246,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The man who escapes is the wrong man. The man who has paid the duty does not escape. The wrong man gets the money.,45
247,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If c is very difficult indeed to provide for every case in an equitable way, and in the meantime we might well letfcheclause go.  clause will not be omitted. It is not intended to deal with such cases as those to which the honourable member for Bland has referred. When taxes are taken out of the purchasers' pockets they ought to go into the Treasury, aud no alteration of the Tariff should be made a source of profit to traders. There is a provision of the kind in most of the We are not going fco give full notice of alterations which will be made in the future, and traders will rely on the law as it then is, and in a good many cases trouble might be caused by not having a clause of the kind to fall back on. I think the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney will meefc the only reasonable objection to the clause. This is not a matter affecting the Government or affecting the revenue, but it does affect traders.",45
248,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I understand that all the objections that have been raised to the clause will be removed by substituting the word ""entered"" for the word, ""delivered "" in the fourth line. .",45
249,Mr A MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Could the Minister not confine the operation of the clause to the goods before they are taken out of bond t,45
250,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"What it is intended to provide is that where there is an alteration in the Tariff as regards goods subject to a contract, and that alteration actually benefits or disadvantages the vendor, as regards the benefit,fchepurchaser shall have it, wheieas the vendor shall be protected against the disadvantage. What we say here is this, that there is a contract for the sale of goods duty paid, and an alteration is made in the Tariff which has not been contemplated or provided against by either paity before the goods are cleared, so that if there is an increase the vendor has to pay, whilst if there is a deduction be will get the benefit of it .",45
251,Mr A MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Supposin g the duty is abolished, does the State gain ?",45
252,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The State does not gain, butfchepurchaser gets the benefit.",45
253,Mr A MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Thaf c is, if the clause deals' only with goods in bond before the dufcy is ""paid.",45
254,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Yes ; the clause, as it stands, affects goods beforefcheyare "" delivered for home consumption."" But the word "" entered "" is a better word than "" delivered,"" because it is before the goods have leftfchecontrol of the Customs that they are affected by the alteration of the Tariff. People are supposed to contract with reference to existing conditions, and if these conditions, through no fault of any one, and without express provision that this section shall not operate, are altered, with the effect of making the vendor pay more dufcy, or letting him get his goods delivered at less cost, then, where it is an increase, we can charge it against the purchaser, while, where a reduction is made, the purchaser gets the benefit of it. The clause only applies to alterations of the Tariff before the goods are entered for home consumption. .",45
255,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Is there any objection to providing that the clause shall apply to goods entered for home consumption not merely before any alteration of the Tariff bufc before an alteration is proposed or passed 1,46
256,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I will look into that a little further, but I would rather not alter the clause.",46
257,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I would like to point out to the Minister that the most likely cases in which this alteration in prices will be required will be in connection with contracts for delivery during the interval between the proposal of the Tariff and its becoming law. Two or three months usually elapse before the Tariff is actually passed into law, and it is during the interval that most forward contracts will probably be completed. Ifc is in connection with these that the most trouble will arise, and this clause, which seeks to protect both sellers and buyers against undue advantage in consequence of an alteration in the Tariff, will not apply in the great bulk of cases where the operation of the alteration will actually take place. The clause should be alteredfcoprovide for any alteration that may be proposed or that may take place. According to my reading of the law, the Tariff alteration does not take place until the Governor General actually affixes his signature to the law approved of by both Houses, and the result will be that the great bulk of the transactions to which the clause ought to apply, if it is to apply afc all, will be transactions to which the clause will not apply because of the way it is framed. I would earnestly ask the Minister fco considerfchenecessity of amending the clause.",46
258,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If the words ""duties collected "" were substituted for "" Tariff"" I think ib would meet the case.",46
259,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Yes ; that seems to do what is required, together with an alteration in the sub-clause.",46

261,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," This clause, until it was amended, i u what I conceive to be a very proper manner, only dealt with the actual imposition of the Tariff, and consequently there could be no subsequent refund of duty. Now under the clause, as amended, we are dealing with the collection of duty, which may be only a temporary collection, and I would ask whether it will not be necessaiy to insert a provision that, in the event of there being a refund to the vendor, the purchaser shall receive credit for it .",46
262,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I will try, to meet that by inserting a fresh paragraph in the clause.",46

264,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," Does the right honourable gentlemen mean that the seller may add the difference in the price during the time that the Tariff proposals are under discussion and when the proposed law may never pass, and a case may never arise to make it a just thing to have the difference added.

265,Mr FE MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I do not know whether it has been the custom in Customs Regulation Acts or Customs Acts generally to include a provision of this kind, but it occurs fco me that these are matters after all in which the parties interested are very well able to look after themselves. I do not think that there arc many mercantile firms in the large cities today who have not their contracts prepared in such a way as to safeguard themselves in the event of duties being imposed or remitted, as the case may be. It occurred to me that we are showing a very benevolent interest in the affairs of people who are well able to take care' of themselves. Unfortunately,- we are not able to take care of the ultimate consumers of goods who have to pay, whether fchey are preparing for the Tariff or not. Sir ""MALCOLM MCEACTIARJJ - If the honourable member had been present before the adjournment for dinner, he would have heard a discussion upon this. We had two hours of it.",46
266,Mr FE MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I am not denying that. I have not come across many merchants who are not far-Sighted enough to make their contracts cover contingencies of fchis kind. I am quite satisfied that there will be less litigation arising out of mercantile contracts than there will be out of our Acts of Parliament. As a mafcter of general experience, I think we must allow that mercantile people do not incur very much litigation in connection with their contracts. This provision refers to one of those things which might very well be left alone. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 147 (Value for duty).  am desirious of securing an alteration in this clause, so that in cases where an invoice has not arrived the owner of the goods shall not be prevented from warehousing. move That the words "" or for warehousing,"" in clause (o) he omitted.

267,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It is not intended to prevent goods from being actually taken into the warehouse before the production of the invoice. What is intended is that the right of the Customs to require the production of the invoice before fchey enter the goods as received into the warehouse Shall not be affected. The production of the invoice is of the utmost importance, and the entry for warehousing is also of the utmost importance, because that regulatesfchebasis upon which subsequent proceedings between the Customs authorities and the merchant proceed. In conference with my officers, fchey tell me that if we provide that warehousing arid the taking of the account of goods is to proceed before the invoice is pro- duced, results may accrue which ought to be avoided - I think that the provision at the . end of the clause covers everything that can be desired by the honourable member. I ask him, therefore, not to press the point. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 159A (Provision in case Western Australia continues intercolonial duties); .. Mr GB EDWARDS (Soufch Sydney). - This clause deals with a question of some difficulty. The Minister inserted it afc my instigation to meet the disadvantage which the manufacturers of the other States of the Commonwealth would suffer by the exerciseby Western Australia of the power allowed her under the Constitution A ct to continuefor five years to tax goods imported from the other States. The effect of the exercise of that power, if she put a duty upon some manufactured article the ingredients of which had to pay dufcy on coming into the Commonwealth, would be to unduly hamper the manufacturers of other States in their competition with foreign manufacturers. But if honourable members look at the clause they will find that it does not meet the case. It refersfcothe imposition of duties of customs on goods passing into the State and pot originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. As a manufacturer could not get a drawI back upon an article which had not been imported, the clause does not meet the case afc all, and I have therefore drafted a new subclause, which I propose to substitute for it, and which, while doing no damage to Western. Australia or to the revenue of the Commonwealth, will put the manufacturers of the other States upon the same footing as foreign manufacturers. Western Australia, for instance, might put a duty on confectionery and jams imported from outside the Commonwealth, and from the other States, and while the English and American article would have been made from sugar upon which no duty had been paid, the article manufactured in the other States might have been manufactured from sugar upon which a very high dufcy had been paid. In dealing with the exports fco Western Australia fromfcheother States we must treat her as a foreign territory. A great misappreof hension exists upon this subject, because seems to be thought that the difficulty arises through the imposition of duties by Western Australia on the manufactures of the other States, whereas it really arises A ictoria. from the imposition of duties by the Commonwealth on the raw materials used Victoria in those manufactures. I propose to strike out the clause in the Bill, and to substitute for it the following provision :Drawbacks of import duty may be allowed to sncb an extent and in such manner as may prescribed upon sugar contained in goods exported from any part of the Commonwealth the State of Western Australia during the tinuance in operation of section 95 of the monwealth Constitution Act. Where raw products, such as potatoes, but, onions, and wheat, are exported to Western Australia, the difficulty does not arise, where manufactured articles, the raw rials of which have paid duty to the Commonwealth are imported, unless a clause like is introduced into the Bill, certain manuafter facturers will be prevented from trading with AVestern Australia, because they be hopelessly beaten in their competition with foreign manufacturers who have paid no duty upon their raw materials. To my mind, there is no reason why the State manufacturers should be hampered in that way.",47
268,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The proposed new clause is to take the place of a clause was inserted only after considerable discusduty, sion, and it applies only to sugar, whereas the clause in the Bill is much wider in its application. We have provided in Bill that, so far as Western Australia exerin cises the special power given to her under the Constitution to impose duties upon portations from the other States, we will allow drawbacks in respect to goods upon which duty has been paid, exported to AVestern Australia, just as if she were foreign State. We are now asked to make a special rule on the subject of sugar, I see no reason for it. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHABN (Melduties bourne) - Suppos e there were a dufcy of per cent, on woollens coming into Victoria and a duty of 20 per cent, upon woollens imported into Western Australia, would not imported woollens sent from Victoria - AVestern Australia have to pay a duty of 40 per cent., if no drawback was allowed Victoria ? I acknowledge that it is difficult to arrive at a clear understanding the effect of section 95 of the Constitui t tion. But if the result would be as I have stated it, it would be easy for New Zealand to take away a great deal of the trade that . would, under other circumstances, come to T",48

I to think that the Minister has given the concorrect replyfcothe honourable member for ComMelbourne if he was speaking offcheperiod after the imposition offcheuniform Tariff; if this Bill comes into force before we have a uniform Tariff, > there will be some but veiy serious inconveniences in regard to the matetrade betweenfcheseveral States. Mr KiNCiSTON - The intention is that thethis Bill shall not come into existence until the imposition of a uniform Tariff.  will must be made clear. Under the present State laws, if goods such as jam ancl confectionery manufactured from dutiable articles, such as sugar-upo n the importation of which into Tasmania or Victoria a duty of £ 5 or £ 6 a ton is charged-ar e exported from those States to New Soufch Wales, or some other State, a cirawback iswhich allowed equivalent to the amount of the and thus trade between the States is unhampered ; but when this Bill comes into force the drawback powers of the States will, the cease, and the only drawback provisions existence will be those contained in the measure itself, which will apply only to imgoods exported beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. Therefore if goods such as I have referred to are exported from Tasmania or Victoria to some other State, the a exporters will not be able to claim drawback in the State where they were manufactured, but ancl when they go into consumption in other States they will probably have to pay under the local Tariff, or under 20 the Commonwealth Tariff, if it is tentatively imposed under a resolution of this House. Thus trade will be seriously interfered with. Ifc is evident thereforefchafcthe to measure should not be brought into force until the imposition of uniform duties. The in honourable member for South Sydney desires very to secure the refund of the whole of the duty paid upon imported sugar, because he says that when the articles in whose manufacture it is used reach Western Australia, they will be subjected to the AVestern Australian Tariff. Mr G. B. EDWAKDS - Not the manufactured articles will be subjected to the Western Australia duty, but because the sugar contained in them will already have paid duty to the Commonwealth.  is referring to the period after the imposition of the uniform Tariff, that cannot happen, because the duty on the sugar, wherever it was first collected, would be held by the Treasurer, to be paid to the State in which the sugar is consumed. Western Australia is in this position : She has said- "" We cannot be content to receive only our share of the duties collected under the uniform Tariff, and for the first five years of the Commonwealth we must retain the power to levy special. duties upon Australian products."" She wants, not only what all the States get - a share in the Customs revenue of the Commonwealth proportionate to her consumption of goods-bu t she also wants to cliarge a duty of £ 3 or £ 4 per ton uponsugar and jam imported from the other States.",48
270,Mr HENKYWILLIS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Can she cliarge that duty, under the 95fch section of the Constitution ?  power to levy duties on imports from the other States for the first five years of the Commonwealth, but subject to yearly reductions.",49
271,Mr HENIIY AVILLIS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Eve n if duties already been paid on the goods ?  gets no benefit from the provision in the Constitution. I am very glad that we shall not have this difficulty in regard to Inter-State trade, and that until the uniform Tariff is imposed the local laws relating to drawback will continue. Those who have manufactured goods there would still be able to take advantage of the local drawback regulations, and will carry on their trade as hitherto. I was glad to hear that, because I was very fearful, looking to the passing of the Bill as a possible means of bringing about a state of deadlock in regard to several important industries.",49
272,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"AVestern Australia). - Wester n Australia entered federation on the understanding that, because of her sparseness of population and her isolation, she was to get certain benefits. One benefit was that she could continue her present Tariff for five years after the uniform Tariff came into force, deducting 20 per cent, per annum because during that period, and thus bringing her ultimately into line with the other States. AVestern Australia does not want any more than she is entitled to. I am sorry that the honourable member for South Sydney looks on Western Australia as a foreign State, merely because there is this difference in the Tariff. AVestern Australia is perfectly willing to abide by whatever is done in a fair spirit. Andfcheproposal of the Government is a just one.",49
273,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I should like to put some facts of the case as they appear to me in the light of the clause under discussion, combined with the last sub-section of section 95 of the Constitution Act. I will take imaginary figures, and ask honourable members to suppose that Western Australia increases her duties between now and the coming into operation of the Tariff, with the result that the duty on woollens is 40 per . cent, during the first year after the imposition of uniform duties, while the Commonwealth duty is 20 per cent. Under the last sub-section of section 95 of the Constitution Act, if the foreign maker of woollens sent his woollens direct he would have tb pay 40 per cent., in the same way as would the colonial makers. But suppose the foreign maker exported the woollens from abroad into Victoria, he would there pay have the Commonwealth Tariff of 20 per cent. Now, if those goods were shipped from Victoria to Western Australia, where is the power under either the Constitution or this clause to make the importer to the latter State pay a duty of 20 per cent. 1",49
274,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The importer has got the goods into the Commonwealth.,49
275,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,And the importer will take his goods to Western Australia as freely as if they were taken from another town in Victoria ?,49
276,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Yes .,49
277,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Then the result is that the colonial maker of woollens would under the circumstances, be paying 40 per cent, to get his goods into Western'Ausfcralia, wliile the foreign maker would only be paying 20 per cent.",49
278,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,And then there is the drawback.,49
279,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"T am inclined to think that under clause 159A the foreign importer would get a drawback of 20 per cent., so that his woollens would go into Western Australia free, while on colonial woollens there would be a duty of 40 per cent.",50
280,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I think there is provision in sub-section (3) of section 95 for the payment offchehigher dufcy. . Mr MCCAY - I think thatfcheprovision thafca higher dufcy should be collected on goods when imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, applies only to goods going directly from abroad to Western Australia, and not to goods which get into the Commonwealth in any other State, and are then sent fco Western Australia. The words are ""imported into Western Australia from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth,"" which, I take it , would not refer to goods imported into Victoria, and then transported to Western Australia. I do not pretend to say that my interpretation of the clause is final, but afc present fchafc seems to be the result to which it leads, and I may say I am not the only member who thinks so. - Mr HARPER (Mernda) - The honourable member presupposes a certain condition of things with regard to woollens. He puts it that certain woollen goods manufactured in Europe are imported into Victoria, and that when they are sent fco Western Australia certain results follow. But the answer to the honourable member is that inasmuch as the Customs authorities require every entry outwards to be produced, special care, I believe, will be paid while this state of things exists in Western Australia, to see that the origin of every parcel of goods is accurately described before the goods are shipped. These goods being shipped to Western Australia, and described as being the produce of Great Britain or Germany, as the case may be, will necessarily involve their paying a higher rate of duty whenfcheyentered Western Australia.",50
281,Mr MOCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Where does the honourable member get that ?,50
282,Mr HARPER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Thaf c is the practice. The Constitution says that goods which are to be subject to the special duties are to be made in the Commonwealth. - Mr MCCAY - Thaf c is exactly what I say - the local manufacturer will pay the dufcy, and the foreign manufacturer will escape.",50
283,Mr HARPER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If c will be observed that the honourable member for Corinella quoted [196] the last sub-section of section 95 of the Constitution Act, which provides that in the event of the special duty imposed by the Western Australian Government being in excess of the duty on foreign goods, the duty on the latter has to be raised to the same rate. If these goods coming to Victoria from Great Britain are sent to Western Australia, they would, according to my reading, have to pay 40 per cent.",50
284,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," The object of section 95 of the Constitution Act was fco give Western Australia special power to levy duties for five years on Australian products. As to goods imported from parts beyond .the Commonwealth, the ordinary Commonwealth law will operate, with the qualification that if the duty which, under the section, Western Australia levies on an* Australian product is higher than the Commonwealth duty on a similar article imported from beyond the seas, then according to the sectionIf afc any time during the five years the dufcy on any goods underfchissectionThat is, Australian goods. is higher than the duty imposed by the Commonwealth on the importation of like goodsThat is, goods from beyond the seas, then such higher dutyThat is,fchedufcy on Australian-products, shall be collected on the goods when imported into Western Australia from beyoud the limits of the Commonwealth. That is to say, Western Australia is not to be allowed to put a higher duty on Australian goods than is imposed for her benefit on foreign goods. The duties are, therefore, equalized.",50
285,Mr GB EDWARDS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Soufch Sydney). - The leader of the Opposition has accurately described the whole position, which, if he has been listened to, ought fco be pretty well understood. But the question, so far as I am concerned, is not at all touched by the question whether Western Australia will impose duties or not. I hold that if manufacturers in the other States have to pay the same duty in Western Australia as English goods, when the former have already paid duties on the material they use, they are handicapped out of the race. It is no part of the public policy to shut the markets of Western Australia to these other States. And I move That all the words after "" If, "" line 1, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words-""During the continuance in operation of section 95 of the Commonwealth Constitution manufactured goods, which include goods upon which dufcy has been paid are exported from any part of the Commonwealth fco the State of Western Australia, drawback of import duty be allowed to such extent and in such manner may be prescribed."" If there are any varying circumstances about the duties imposed by Western Ausif tralia, including the tapering scale she obliged to. adopt, the Minister can accomdrawback modate himself to the circumstances as they arise by giving the manufacturers a just equitable drawback, and not forcing them, asfchelaw at present stands; to leave off manufacturing for Western Australia altoif gether, on the bare ground that they would very far beyond it. be utterly unable to compete, with the manufacturers of foreign countries England.",50
286,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I must say not think that sufficient attention has been given fco the view presented by the. honourable and learned member for Corinellai I listened to the leader of the Opposition, and I regard thisas a matter of very great importance.",51
287,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Is it not more theoretical,51
288,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I can see very strong practical possibilities.,51
289,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,But it is very unlikely Western Australia will raise her Tariff.,51
290,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Wester n Australia can do so. A great deal of reliance was placed this clause, but we have to see that manuis facturers in this part of Australia are guarded from possible disadvantage. seems to me the position is this: Putting clause 159A into other words, if it be possugar sible to put it more clearly, it means that Western Australia exercises the power taxing Australian' products, then, as to goods imported from abroad into, say, toria, drawback shall be allowed in cases where the duty is paid and those goods which duty has been paid, are sent to to W estern Australia. When the drawback T is allowed, no duty will have been paidthese goods, being goods originally imported from beyond the limits offcheCommonwealth, are not taxable when they get into Westthem. ern Australia, but go absolutely free, while all Australian products have to make the difficulty. pay the Western Australian duty. Now that is surely placing Australian manufacunderstand turers afc a disadvantage, so far as Western Australian trade is concerned, as compared with foreign importers. Western Australia Sydney. is not entitled to tax goods that originally Act* came from abroad, but there is a special power given to Western Australia as a dis^ tinct State to make a distinct Tariff as against may Australian products. Take the case of as woollens, as to which, by hypothesis, 20 per cent, duty has been paid upon the goods being imported into Victoria,. This clause-says that the Victorian importer exports his goods to is Western Australia he cannot get the Same as if he exported them to F i j i . What I would like to know is, whether it is and intended that this clause should apply to. import duties paid only before the coming into operation of the uniform Tariff, because that is the intention the clause will go It will operate as long as Western Australia has a right to tax and of Australian products.",51
291,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," It seems clear I do to me that the case which the honourable member for South Sydney has put is a veryproper one for consideration, but that it cannot very well be dealt with under this clause. Take the case of jam. This clause would coverthe case of jam if any excise dufcy had been paid on the jam in the State ? in which the jam had been manufactured, and drawback would go tofchemanufacturer whose product went to Western Australia.",51
292,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,This does not .apply to excise duty.,51
293,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Yes ; but the case which the on honourable member for South Sydney brings a special case. We all know that sugar enters so largely into the manufacture of Ifc jam that it practically constitutes half that article, andi f an import duty is paid on it seems to me to be perfectly proper if that tofcheextent to whioh that sugar has of paid dufcy there should be a drawback, while Western Australia can impose a duty Vicon our Australian jam. I think that the case which the honourable member for Soufch on Sydney has put before the committee ought be met by a special clause. It is a matter of great importance and fairness that some provision should be made. Looking at the last words of the clause more closelv, I certainly confess that I cannot understand",51
294,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The last words of the clause,51
295,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS, I that the Minister is endeavouring byfchisclause to carry out the proposal made by the honourable member for South,51
296,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I do not know that.,51
297,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The ' Minister has put the clause in on the representations made byfchehonorable member for . Soufch Sydney as to the effect that the continuance of the duties in ""Western Australia may have on the manufactures of the other States which consist partly or largely of imported duty-paid articles. The clause seems to me to be contradictory. The Minister proposes under it fco provide for all that he considers to be reasonable in what the honourable member suggests. ""Under the clause it is provided that if the Parliament of the State of Western Australia, in the exercise of the power conferred by the Constitution, imposes duties on goods passing into that State, and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, drawback may be allowed in the State in which import duty has been paid. Now, no power is given to the Western Australian Government to levy duties on goods originally imported from beyond the' limits of the Commonwealth, and yet if import duty has beeu paid upon the goods, they must have come from beyond the Commonwealth. This clause, in the first portion-and that governs the whole clause*-deal s only with goods that are not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, and yet the provision is that the drawback shall be granted, in respect of those goods, of the duty paid at the time of importation. We have already decided under the Bill that "" import"" means an import from beyond the Commonwealth, so that here we have two opposing conditions-firs t of all, that the goods must not be goods that are originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth; and secondly, that drawback shall be allowed only on goods that have been imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth.",52
298,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"AV e are not attempting to deal with the question of excise, because that has to be considered separately; but the position is this. We are a Commonwealth, and free-trade exists subject to a qualification, and we say that our merchants are not entitled to a drawback as regards any dufcy they have paid on their goods in the Commonwealth when they export them from TasmaniafcoVictoria, or from Victoria to New South Wales or Queensland, and why 1 Because there is free-trade. We have, however, to make one qualification, and for what reason 1 That, although we are one Commonwealth with Inter-State free-trade, there is the one qualification that AVestern Australia-may charge a dufcy on Australian goods, subject to certain conditions. AVhafc we say is this, that as far as AVestern Australia does that she is a foreign country, and that goods affected byfcheimposition of such duties shall be the subject of drawbacks, and thoseonly. I think that is perfectly fair.",52
299,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Excep t that itdoes not cover the special case mentioned by the honourable member for South Sydney..,52
300,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I do not know that it does cover the special case, but it covers the whole case as provided for under the Constitution. We have free-trade throughout the Commonwealfeh', and sothere can be no drawback, from one end of the Commonwealth tofcheother, withfcheoneexception that I have mentioned.",52
301,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I would like to ask the Minister a question, as an affirmative answer may save a deal of discussion. I would ask if a colonial, manufacturer has to use some duty-paid article from abroad in his manufactures, and then sends his completed article to Western Australia during the five years' period, would not the Government return him as drawback any money he had paid by way of dufcy on that particular part of his manufactures that he had imported. Take the case of the jam manufacturers. Half their jam is sugar, on which perhaps they have paid duty as imported sugar. Thepeople of Western Australia with thensugar free of dufcy would have an advantage over the Australian manufacturer who has to pay duty on the sugar he uses in the production of the manufactured article. I would like to know whether the Government would be in favour of a refund of the dufcy paid on the sugar used in the manufacture of jam sent to Western Australia 1",52
302,Mr A MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I would like to have one misapprehension that seems to exist amongst honourable members cleared up. I understood that under this clause the intention of the Ministry was to allow drawback in respect of goods imported into one of the States of the Commonwealth from another State before the imposition of uniform duties. Some honourable members say that the clause as drafted goes a great deal further than that, and that even after the uniform Tariff comes into operation a person importing goods from outside the Commonwealth will be allowed drawback in respect to those goods when they are re-exported to AVestern Australia. Mr KINGSTON* - Why should he?",52
303,Mr A MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"There is no reason why he should, and if the clause would have any such effect, the objection raised by the honourable and learned member for Corinella would be unanswerable.",53
304,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I do not incline to the opinion that drawback is to be allowed in respect of duty paid on foreign goods because they are sent to AVestern Australia, any more than if they are sent to Tasmania. Western Australia has no special power in regard to imported goods, and we have no right to treat exportations to her, in regard to which she is no more a foreign country than is Victoria, in any special manner. However, in cases where AVestern Australia is in effect a foreign countiy we are proposing to allow drawback.",53
305,Mr A MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Is it certain that the clause will carry out the meaning of the Ministry 1,53
306,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Yes , I think so: because I have stuck as closely as possible to the wording of the Constitution.",53
307,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS, Do I understand the right honourable gentleman to say that it is limited to goods in respect of which import duty has been paid before the imposition of the uniform Tariff? If it does not mean that then it does not mean what the right honourable gentleman says he intends it to mean. There are no words of limitation so far as I can see. The provision seems to extend to the whole period of five years.,53
308,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It clearly speaks of a period of five years.,53
309,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I do not think that the Minister has explained to the committee how this clause meets what he himself intends it to meet. The object of the honourable member for South Sydney is that goods which go into Western Australia-no t in the form in which they are imported, but in another due to the process of manufacture which they have undergone-shall , as they will be chargeable with the AVestern Australian special duties, be exempt from the payment of the Commonwealth duly.",53
310,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The honourable member refers to local products.,53
311,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Yes , in the form in which they go into AVestern Australia. But, although the Western Australian Customs house will not recognise it, a considerable portion, of those articles, such as jam, ifec, may have to pay an. import duty upon entering the State in which they are manufactured. It is held that, to put the Commonwealth manufacturer on the same footing as his foreign competitor, the duty which has been paid on the ingredients forming the manufactured article should be refunded on shipment to AVestern Australia during the period that section 95 of the Commonwealth Act is operative.",53
312,Sir GEOBGE TUBNEB,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The honourable member will need to put another clause into accomplish that.,53
313,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If this clause does not deal with that, what does it deal with ? It seems to me that the first portion of the provision absolutely contradicts the second portion.",53
314,Sir GEOBGE TUBNEE,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The honourable member wants to go further and cover something which is not covered by this clause.,53
315,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I submit-that the clause is contradictory, and does not meet the case raised by the honourable member for Sydney.",53
316,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Indee d it is not contradictory.,53
317,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Sectio n 95 of the Constitution says Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the Parliament offchisState of Western Australia, if that State be an original State, may during the fi rsfc five years after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, impose duties of customs on goods passing into that State and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the colon}'. That section therefore permits of the imposition of duties on goods not imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, and yet this clause in the Bill allows of a drawback upon goods which have been originally imported.",53
318,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Indee d it does not.,53
319,Mr THOMSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If the provision is meant to deal only with cases of goods passing from one State to another, why not insert the words ""from another portion of the Commonwealth "" 1 But I would point out that the clause does not deal with the point raised by the honourable member for Soufch Sydney.",53
320,Mr FE MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I think that the Minister for Customs has clearly explained the intention of the clause. But after listening to the remarks of the honormeans able and learned member for Indi, and of other honourable members who have analyzed the clause, it seems to me that there is for doubt as to whether the last three lines carry out the intention of the Minister. What he intends to provide for drawback upon those goods which have originally paid duty when passing from Statefcoanother.",53
321,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Exactly , it was argued last week.",54
322,Mr FE MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The honourable and learned member for Indi and others, howdufcy ever, assert that the effect of the clause will be to enable drawback to be obtained on all goods exported to Western Australia, which may have been imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. If we divide on the amendment which is now before the Chair, I ask the Minister whether the last three lines of the clause cannot altered i u such a way as to more clearly express his intention.",54
323,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"There is one word which I wish to strike out there. Mr F.*E. MCLEAN - I think fchafc amendment proposed by the honourable duty."" member for South Sydney is a most important one, and that we should not place our own manufacturers afc a disadvantage as compared with foreign manufacturers. I shall, therefore, vote with him to amend the clause in such a way as to give fco the Commonwealth power to grant drawback npon those dutiable goods which are included in manufactured goods which are sent fco Western Australia.",54
324,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Wester n Australia has no more power to tfix them than has Tasa mania.,54
325,Mr FE MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"But Western Australia, under a special provision in the Constitution, can place a duty paid upon goods manufactured in other As those goods will contain a very large proportion of dutiable articlesarticles which have paid duty ing into the Commonwealth-som e provision must be made for allowing drawbacks goods pay duty ? upon those materials.",54
326,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I am a suggestion which I think will meet the case. If honourable members will look at clause 159, to which clause 159A is really an appendage, they will see a general proviNow sion for ' the drawback of Undoubtedly, "" import duty "" i nfchafcclause ""Commonwealth import duty."" Then clause 159A was introduced to provide for drawbacks in the case of imports from any room other State fco Western Australia. But the words ""import dufcy"" are again used, and those words mean, unless qualified, "" Comis simply a monwealth import duty.""",54
327,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Is the honourable one and learned member sure of that, because fchis provision may be in operation for threeor four months before the imposition of the uniform Tariff?",54
328,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I must say that import there means "" Commonwealth import duty."" To make it perfectly clear we could, insert the word "" State "" before the words and ""import dufcy."" What I understand the Minister fco mean is that, if beforefcheimposition of uniform customs' duties a Statehas collected duty upon goods under its State laws, and if those goods are exported be to Western Australia, then drawback may be allowed, provided that such goods wereoriginally imported from beyond the limitsof the Commonwealth. The whole difficulty could be overcome by inserting the word; the "" State"" before the words "" import ! Sir GEORGE TURNER - We could put hr I the words "" before the imposition of uniform) duties "" after "" has.""",54
329,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,At present the clause is too large and indefinite.,54

"" Export"" in the true sense of the word is entitled to drawback, but it is not question of export to Western Australia,, except for a special purpose.

339,Mr GB EDWARDS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," We are gradually getting to the meaning of the clause. I was blaming myself for my inability to understand it ; but, since there are many trained legal minds in the Chamber who do not seem able to agree in regard to the provision, and as it has been only wjthin the last few minutes that the Minister has been able to express himself clearly as to its meaning, I do not know that the fault is entirely mine.",55
340,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I explained the clause in the same way last week.,55
341,Mr GB EDWARDS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The clause was inserted because I asked the Minister fco allow me to put some provision into the Bill which would permit of drawbacks being paid where goods-dutiabl e goods-were imported into AVestern Australia. Now we are told that the clause is to meet the case where goods are transferred from one State to another, and are then exported fco AVestern Australia- a set of circumstances by which not more than £ 2 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 worth of goods will be affected, while within the first five years of the Commonwealth hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of goods will be affected by the arrangements which I desire to alter.

346,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I do not want the Minister fco impose conditions upon other honourable members in order to oblige me. Progress reported. INTER-STATE COMMISSION BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed (from 17th July, vide page 2668) on motion by Sir JOHN PORRESTThat this Bill be now read a .second time. Air. REID (East Sydney) - I am obliged to the Govei-ruiaent for their cburfcesy in arranging their business so that I may address a few observations to the House with reference to the Inter-State Commission Bill and 'the Defence Bill, as I shall be unavoidably absent when the debate on these measures is resumed on a future occasion. I shall, however, condense my remarks so that the House may adjourn at its usual hour, because I feel that it would be unreasonable .to prolong the sitting. The Inter-State Commission Bill is one of those measures .which, call for, perhaps, even more careful treatment .than do some of the other Bills which we have had fco consider. In dealing with - measures like the Public Service Bill and the Defence Bill, we are dealing with measures affecting subjects upon which a large number of Acts have already been, passed by the 'States ; but in dealing with the regulation of Inter-State commerce, under the developments which will follow from the imposition, of a uniform Tariff and the establishment of free trade between the States, there is practically no legislation which, from my point of view, can be a fitting guide to us. In my opinion the first great fault which has been committed by Ministers, in framing this measure, is that they have not fully realized the enormous' difference between the difficulties with which we have to deal, - and the difficulties which have been dealt with by the United States Cong-ess and by the British Legislature. The difference between the situation in tralia and the situations in America and in Groat Britain is essential and radical; bufc the Government have followed in strange, ancl I would almost say thoughtless, way, the legislation of those tw o counAustralia tries. To fully understand the question i is necessaiy to briefly reviewfchehistory the relations between the States before federation. We have had for many years pisfc many rivalries in commerce, and .State laws passed having a special effect upon. Inter-State trade relations, bufc I that I am withinfchemark when I say that a great distinction is to be drawn between our experience of what I might call our mercantile compefcifcion, and our experience of what 1 might call our railway compefciother fcion. So far as our mercantile competition is concerned, I think there has been very little cause for complaint. Seeing fchafc the. merchants of the different States have hadfcocompete against adverse Tariffs and artificial boundaries, I think I express the view of all who - have reflected upon this matter when I sayfchafci f the common carelements rier alone had been concerned, and not the State railways, the regulation of Inter-State commerce would ' not have assumed the importance which attached to it when it was debated in the Federal Convention. Throughout those most able and exciting debates upon the question, there was scarcely a reference to the shipping trade or to the mercantile community. Almost the whole trend of our considerations was directed towards the use which has been made of the State-owned railways for the encouragement of the trade of the States which own them. The first radical fault which I see in the Bill is that its scope is infinifcely larger than there is occasion for. It contains a multitude of vexatious provisions which have not been suggested by exanxious perience, and which could have been taken only from the legislation of some country whose circumstances are widely different from ours. The competition under which our mercantile and shipping enterprise has to be conducted is such that there is very ready cure for anything in the nature of a monopoly, or unduly high rates. The}' may prevail by force of legislation, when commerce is left free, it is generally found that the State has no occasion to interfere. IV n i g ht I have the happiness of feeling that with reference to Australian Auscommerce-wit h reference to commercial intercourse between one part of this Commonwealth and another, protectionists and freea traders meet on common ground. I believe I should misrepresent the protectionists of if I regarded them as desirous of r t hampering the intercourse of Australian with of Australian. I think l a m correct in making that statement. It has always been understood that with reference to commercial many operations within the Commonwealth there should be absolute freedom, and as far as think the Constitution can insure that state of things it has been insured. The true grievance was a state of things for which.business coidd offer no redress - If a steam-ship charges an unreasonable rate, there is ansteam-ship ready to come in for the trade, and take advantage of the position. But i u the case of State-owned railways, a very different set of circumstances presents itself. Within the limits of each State, the railway authority is above and beyond the reach of competition, and besides has legislative power. So that we have not only all the of ordinary business monopoly, bufc all those elements reinforced by State power and the total absence of competition. The problem was fco prevent State railways, and for that matter State rivers, from being used unfairly. We all aimed at freedom of commerce, and it was in order to insure that we should enjoy that freedom that we devoted so much time to the subject of an Inter-State Commission at the Convention. By the way, the Inter-State Commission was very much of an-after-thought after all. The* main brunt of the discussion centred round a proposition by the then Premier of Victoria, Sir George Turner, that the Commonwealth Parliament should have the power of preventing any rates on States railways which derogated from equality of trade. There were many others who were not for an Inter-State Commission, or even for the interference of Parliament. The Victorian delegates were sfcrong as to parliamentary power and did not wish an inter-State Commission. The Soufch Australian delegates were strong, I think, as a .to an Inter-State Commission; whereas we, of New South Wales, did not put forward an Inter-State Commission, and did not at all but approve of this Parliament becoming the controlling authority in matters might be deemed to excite. State interests and feeling. I myself took strong objection to such a body as this being charged with what might after all be fairly described sis judicial powers. Sir George Turner's view prevailed! at first, and Parliament was granted the power. But that victory, which was a very narrow one, by a majority of one, was subsequently so altered by decisions that the venue really shifted Parliament to the establishment Inter-State Commission. Ifc was a choice practically between Parliament arbiter and an Inter-State Commission as judges. Thus it was, I think, that the ' matter assumed so much importance in the Convention. I do not want to traverse' the ground which the Minister for Home Affairs went over, I think afc undue length. gave us an enormous list of preferential rates which were in force on the Victorian railways to attract the commerce of New Soufch Wales, and gave some rates showing a desire on the part of New South Wales to retain trade within her borders. here is a little map which shows the areas over which this competition between New South Wales and Victoria has extended. Before I refer to that map, I should say that long before the New South Wales railways were taken out to Hay, and on to Bourke, the battle was not between New South Wales and Victoria for the Darling trade, but between South Australia _ and Victoria. Soufch Australia had, I think, the advantage at first, owing to the river, but Victorian enterprise pushed communication up to different parts of the Murray, and Victoria entered the lists for ""New South Wales trade not as against that State, but as against South Australia. time went on, the authorities in New South Wales, moved thereto by the inhabitants of those districts, sent railway communication into the back country, and then that State came on the scene. This little map, which I have some reason to believe is correct, represents the State of New Wales. The very large covered blue, represents about .one-fourth of the State, and over that area there is a reduction, Murray termini of the Victorian railways to Melbourne, of from 46 per cent, to 61 per cent, on the rates which the Victorian Government charge its own settlers. from the very large block coloured yellow, Mr Beid. which representing the heart of New South Wales, the reduction is from 61 per cent, to 66 per cent. Coming down fco the country about Jerilderie and Wagga, there is a narrow strip along the Murrumbidgee, from which the reduction in rates is about 38 per cent, to 43 per cent., and from the wide strip shown onfchemap, near Victoria, the reduction is 46 per cent. Then, on the Murray, these inducements disappear. These, of away from course, are enormous reductions on the of an established fares and rates on the Victorian lines. But the Victorians in their enteras an prise and self-sacrifice, seemed willing that the rates on goods of our producers should be allowed to neutralize the difficulties of distance in competition with Victorian settlers. The effect, no doubt, to the producer was that the enormous distance from He a seaport, which put; the people of New South Wales at a disadvantage, as compared with the people of Victoria, was neutralized to a large extent, and they practically got as near to the sea as the Victorians themselves. I return grateful thanks on behalf But of the settlers of this arid country of New South Wales to the people, and the Governments of Victoria, for helping our settlers in this direction. I have no element of bitterness at all in reference to that, and one of the aspects of the sort of competition to which ,1I have referred between State railways is, that whatever may have been the effects on the States, the effects on the people were decidedly beneficial. The result was not to make carriage difficult nor to add artificially to the expense of railway transit. On the contrary, the effect was, as 1I have said, to neutralize distance i u favour of the persons whose goods were carried. So that really this competition, although it As may excite a feeling of irritation in the Railway departments, was a competition which had its good side. The railway authorities of New South Wales have naturally endeavoured to meet this attack and to retain their trade, and I believe they have been able to do so Avithout making such South enormous reductions as those to which I portion have referred. The Avork of' settling any existing discrepancies, according to the enormous standard of the neAV order of things, is a from the work which I think might Avell be left to a more conA-enienfc season. I should be better pleased if Ave allowed the State Governments, after Ave have passed our uniform Then Tariff and' haA-e settled doAvn to the neAV order of things, to come to some amicable agreement in reference to their respective lines. There have been a number of conferences, and on more than one occasion the railway authorities have agreed, though the Ministers of the day have differed. Under the new state of things I do not think it should be difficult for our railway authorities to come to some amicable agreement Avithout strife and Avithout litigation. If they can cpme to such an agreement I am sure it must be the feeling not only amongst ourselves, but throughout the whole of Australia, that there ought to be a settlement of that sort between two such mighty corporations. In Victoria, the railways are in the hands of the Government, Avhereas in NeAV South AVales they are under commissioners; but differences between those two mighty powers would be better settled amicably if possible than by means of litigation. I Avish to be extremely brief under the circumstances. The first general remark I wish to make is, that in my opinion this is a Bill which is not called for in the pressure of public business afc the present time. AVe must have our public sendee organized ; we must have our defence force organized; Ave must have our Tariff established; and Ave must bring in Inter-State free-trade. matters of organization Will reference to the Avorking of our great public departments, and the introduction of our fiscal measures seem to me to be the most pressing business. A measure of this sort, which may be necessary, is in my opinion one of the reserve poAvers of the Constitution which should be used only when necessity calls for it .",55

No doubt there are "" punctures"" afc the present time. I should be very sorry to take up a position which should be understood as a tolerant position towards anything of that sort. My first position is that an amicable arrangement amongst those who run the State railways Would be infinitely preferable to a forced interference of a power as the result of litigation as the result of a contest before a court. What would be ten thousand times better Would be an amicable arrangement, the result of which Would be that neither the great railwaj' department of Victoria nor the great railway department of New South AVales would drag the other before a' judicial tribunal. Many matters could be taken into consideration as betAveen the two great railway authorities, on give and take principles, which it Would be impossible to give due Aveightfcoi f they were both brought to bay. As to the shipping and commercial elements in our Australian intercourse, there is absolutely no justification for the vexatious and inquisitorial provisions of this Bill. In the light of experience there is absolutety no grieA-ance and no complaint, and the affairs of commerce-giA'e n the freedom and equality which the Constitu tion of Australia gives our commerce, Avithin a limited radius,' it is true, bufc still a radius Avide enough for the continent-ma y be conducted in such a manner as J;o enable us, for some time afc any rate, to regard our special control of them as no A'ery pressing matter. I musfc say that in the midst of these large departments Ave are establishing and in the midst offchemany high appointments Ave are making we must have some regard for the question of a fitting timo. We shall have from the force of necessity to establish a large number of expensive tribunals, and this tribunal is one, I think, which might Avell arise afc a somewhat later time. That These is the vieAv which I take generally Will reference to this Bill. At the same time. I Avish it to be understood that if any part of Australia is deprived of an administration of Australian traffic which is equal, which is fair, and which leaves no substantial grievance behind it , I am not the one to delay the operation of this correcting poAver; but Ave do not Avant to set a great piece, an intricate piece, of machinery in motion to crush small grieA'ances, to investigate trifling complaints, or to place upon the industrial in a energy of those engaged in commerce hindrances which it was, I thought, our glory to destroy. We may be separated on Tariff questions, but I think there is no one Avho is not as keenly alive as I am to the great advantages to Australia of making our commerce as free as Ave possibly can. I do not see the public necessity for this Bill, as far as the mercantile and shipping interests are concerned, and I think there Avill be no necessity for this Bill as far as the railway traffic of the different States is involved. But if , in reference to this railway traffic, any State finds that it is being treated in an unfair Avay - in a seriously unfair way- I quite admit the right which that State hasfco come to a tribunal of this, sort to have .its grievances redressed. Bufc such grievances would be a thousand times better redressed by some voluntary arrangement. Jn America the arrangements as to railways are ;as different from ours as can possibly be. None of those railways are owned by the State. Nofc a single railway used in commerce, amongst their tens of thousands of miles, is a State-owned railway. As one can imagine, with the. power of capital located in all sorts of quarters remote from the centres of actual traffic, and having its interests so distributed as to admit of all sorts of contrivances to depress the traffic of one State, or one line, or one part of a line, or to enhance the traffic of any State or line, or part of a line, or even a long series of lines, there is a myriad of temptations that have doubtless been fully availed of to make the conditions of commercial intercourse in the United States far from what the Constitution intended. . I am happy to say, however, that our commercial intercourse has not.been complicated in that way. Mr HuiiE COOK - No r by corrupt legislation.",58
348,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"No . But the difference between State-owned railways, managed as they are in Australia, and the private railways, managed as they are in Amecica, is very considerable, to say the least of it . I should like to refer to one or two of the provisions of this Bill, bufc first of all I would say a word with reference to the constitutional position of authority. Section 102 of the Constitution Act, looked at now as we can look at it , free from the heafcedmediaof the Convention debates, seems to wear asomewhafc singular complexion. The intention at first' was, .as I have said, to make Parliament the authority to prevent obnoxious railway rates. In its jiresent shape, the first part of the section, gives Parliament a limited - power, butfchevalue of that limited power is taken away in the latter part of the section. In the first part of the section theParliamenfcmay by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid as to railways any preference or discrimination by any State. Thafc is not a general power, but the general provision with regard to trade and commerce is, as honourable members know, contained in section 51. There is a general power in section 51, but this section gives Parliament a special power which in one-sense is a limitation. Ifc is .providedThe Parliament may by any law with respect; fco trade and commerce forbid, as to railways, any preference or discrimination by any State, or by any authority constituted under a State, if sueh preference or discrimination is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State. But in the latter part of the section it is providfedBut no preference or discrimination shall, within the meaning offchissection, be takenfcobe undue and unreasonable, or unjust to uny State, unless so adjudged byfcheInter-State Commission. So that here we have a .most extraordinary spectacle .presented to us, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth is in one breath allowed to forbid certain things if they take a certain aspect, and then there is a proviso that that power shall never be exercised by the Parliament unless an inferior tribunal has adjudged it to be that which Parliament is supposed to forbid.",59
349,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It is hardly .an inferior tribunal; it is, in one sense, a committee of experts.",59
350,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The honourable member for Bland has very properly corrected me. In one sense the Inter-State Commission is an inferior tribunal, and in another - sense it is not inferiori t is practically a delegation from Parliament of a certain power.' But the inconsistency still remains, because in the first part of the sectionfcheParliament is given certainlegislative power, whilst in the second part it is to have that power only if another authority says it, shall exercise it, and that other authority is supposed to have power to do the thing for itself. This provision has a limiting effect, and the Bill strangely enough does not recognise the force of these limitations. Por general purposes we are fully competent to pass a Bill clothing the Inter-State Commission with certain powers. But there are certain things which we cannot do, and we cannot do that which the Government asks us to do in some of these clauses. Now, take clause 16 dealing with rates on State railways, which provides(1) Ifc shall not be lawful for any State or for any State railway authority to.give or make upon any railway the property offcheState in respect of external or Inter-State commerce, or so as to affect such commerce, any preference or discrimination which is - undue>and unreasonable or unjust to any State. That is in the Constitution, but the Constitution has provided that that shall not be lawful, because as to State railways the Constitution says this Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid as to railways any preference or discrimination by any State or by any authority constituted under a State, if such preference or discrimination is undue and unreasonable or unjust to.any State. Clearly I submit with great respect to any' one who may differ from me, that that is not an authority to forbid by general phraseolog}', bufc the legislation on this very point as fco the railways has the effect of pointing out what Parliament shall, asfcothe railways, have the power to forbid. If this had been left out the power of Parliament would have been infinitely greater, because the Constitution points out what the Parliament shall do with reference to railway rates, whilst it says nothing as to the other rates regarding which Parliament has a general power. Regarding railway rates, however, the Act prescribes the special way in which Parliament shall act, and in expressing that special way the Constitution does not give as to railways a general right or a general power such as is exercised in other matters. You may put in the words of the Constitution if you. l i k e ; fchey are harmless; but if it is intended by the wording of clause 16 to maintain the position that Parliament can forbid at large by the mere use of the phrase, I maintain that Parliament can do no such thing.",59
351,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Does the right honourable member mean fco say that there ought to be in the clause a statement that the Inter-State Commission shall first decide that the rates are unjust ?,60
352,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I am not talking about the Inter-State Commission, but I am speaking of a section in the Constitution Act, and what I wish to point out is that there is a condition attached fco the forbidding of a railway rate as unjust or unreasonable, if a certain thing exists in reference to that rate. How can that language imply the power to forbid wholesale without inquiring intofchecase of each particular rate as to whether it has the effect described or not. Recau self such preference or discrimation is undue, unreasonable, or unjust, that is a question to be investigated before Parliament can forbid. Thafc process is entirely foreign to the power' which this Bill is made to claim of forbidding i nfchewords of the' Statute. So far as they follow the - words of the Statute there is no harm done, because the Statute forbids the same thing. And tine Statute can forbid. But the Statute says to Parliament- "" Your power of forbidding must be a power exercised in particular cases after ca particular investigation, and only if you have come as to each of these things, tofcheconclusion that that preference or discrimination is as a matter of fact undue."" If it is undue, that involves an investigation of the facts, and it involves a process foreign to the power of writing a string of words and saying that a certain thing is forbidden, without inquiry, without investigation. Now as to the definition of external or Inter-State commerce, I am strongly in favourof striking out the words in chaise 2 which bring external coninierce within the scope of this Bill. The scope of the American Act had necessarily to be .much larger than it need be in our case. America had a long and artificial boundary line between herself and Canada-partl y a water line and partly a land line--a n enormous boundary line dividing it from Canada. All sorts of operations might have the effect of diverting trade through another country and into the ""United States again, and many provisions were necessary in the American Act which are absolutely inapplicable to the conditions of Australia. But I do not object to these words being retained in the Bill so as to enable us to follow commerce anywhere, if it comes back into the States again. 1"" think that the words are utterly idle in view of our .geographical position, bufc still I do not object to the power because it is Inter-State commerce after all, and if in that commerce there is any design to escape from the law by means of a circuitous route, clearly, we can follow it when the traffic returns to the Stafces. Bufc that power is almost idle under our circumstances. I am thoroughly in favour of restricting the scope of the Bill to Inter-State commerce. I am opposed to any attempt to give this commission, if established afc once, the power which the Bill proposes to .give with reference fco the whole of the commercial operations of these Australian seas. 1 thinkfchafctask is a gigantic one without the slightest warrant of necessity-w*ithou t the slightest list of abuses which would warrant such a gigantic enterprise. Clause 4 provides that the Governor General shall, as soou as conveniently practicable, appoint three persons to be commissioners. There is nothing in the Constitution Act which compels ns to appoint three commissioners. There is notliing in the Constitution which compels us to make provision that the members shall be paid for the whole of their time. Bufc this Bill prohibits them from engaging in any Other employment, and therefore large salaries will have fco be paid. Yet the commissioners may be doing nothing. I think it is possible, at any rate in the early stages of this commission, that the commissioners will have very little to 'do. Of course, if there were half the grievances to be dealt with that this Bill aims at, we should a dozen commissioners, and not three. But from my ]joint of view, when once we get the railway systems of Australia into order, within the meaning of the Constitution, this commission will have very little to do.",60
353,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Once the policy is laid down we shall never depart from ib.,61
354,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I am happy to think that I am not shutting my eyes to facts. It is a grand thing in ' regard to Australia that the great grievances which have caused this demand for an Inter-State Commission centre round our State railways and not round the management of our rivers, because, as honourable members know, New South Wales has spent a considerable sum of money in snagging her rivers without charging any toll. In that respect we have managed our rivers in a very fair and open spirit. There is no suggestion of any rights, in regard to those rivers of ours, to infcefere with the free play of Inter-State enterprise. The Minister for Home Affairs was astonished to find that the Railway Commissioners would come under the heading of "" common carriers."" According to the provisions of clause 15, we are made to prohibit every rate which is unreasonable or unjust. The Commonwealth Constitution says-""unreasonabl e and unjust."" That is a slip, I imagine. We cannot make the power wider thanfcheConstitution makes it .",61
355,Mr BARTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,No ; bufc the common carrier is made to charge reasonable and just rates.,61
356,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I am not questioning the power of this Parliament with reference to common carriers generally; but I am pointing out the effect of section 102 of the Constitution regarding State railways. I do not question any of the powers in this Bill, except that power to forbid as to the State railways in general language, without the investigation of the particular thing which is objected to as unreasonable and unjust."" In clause 18, this distinction, which I have drawn, seems to be recognised. The clause statesNo common carrier or State authority other than a State railway, shall, directly or indirectly, by any special rate, discount, or rebate, drawback, or other device, charge, demand, collect, or receive from any person, <fec. That is a provision which but for the Constitution Act it would be perfectly fair and proper to apply to the railways, as require well as to the ships. The object of that clause is exactly what this Bill is intended for. But the draftsman there draws a distinction between other carriers and the State railway authorities. In that clause it seems to me that the provisions of section 102 of the Constitution are borne in mind. Then the expression in the subsequent clauses, "" any such carrier,"" would no doubt be read in conjunction with the same exception right through, namely, "" other than a"" State railway authority."" Now I come to the burden of proof, which is provided for in clause 20. That clause provides thatfche burden of proving that such lower rate or difference in treatment is not an undue or unreasonable preference' or advantage shall lie on the common canier or authority. Here again we are reversing all the ordinary rules of administering justice. There is a mania now apparently for invading rules which we still respect in matters of vital concern, in matters affecting, liberty and life. When a complaint is made by some authority constituted under fchis Bill, why should the burden of proof that a thing is not the offence complained of be on the person against whom the imputation is made?",61
357,Mr BARTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I think that paragraphs (a) and (b), if proved, simply amount to primd facie evidence of undue or unreasonable preference, and that of itself would shift the burden of proof.",61
358,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"There might be all those things which are mentioned in sub-clauses (a) and (b) for an honest, sound, commercial reason, which no Inter-State Commission should question, if upon investigation it is found to be genuine. I say that in no case should the burden of proof be on the person against whom' some rival in business makes a complaint. It is. shifting the onus in a way that I do not appreciate or believe in. In clause 21 certain things are made prima"" facie evidence of undue preference, when there are a number of things which may answer to the wording of the clause, ancl yet be perfectly legitimate. I cannot express my feeling of curiosity upon this point. What in the name of common sense rendered it necessary to insert in clause 22 the provision for the free carriage of certain persons 1 Why, even Members of Parliament are picked out with paupers ancl destitute persons as individuals with respect to whom the provisions of this Bill shall not apply. It is a tribute to the marvellous ingenuity of the draftsman in putting in every conceivable liability ancl every conceivable exemption. I think that he has managed both to perfection. Regarding clause 23 I wish to point out that a person requiring traffic to be forwarded can address a request to the carrier specifying the route by which he says that the carrier ought to take the goods. If the carrier does not take the goods by that route there may be a complaint. If within ten days after receiving that request, - or within a longer term, as the commission may prescribe, there is no written objection cither to the proposed route or rate, the route shall be deemed agreed to. But if either the route or the rate is objected to, the objection is to be stated. commission is then to have power to determine whether the route is a reasonable one-whethe r in fact a man who does nob belong to the company, or whether the company itself shall run its own business. An y person can under this clause prescribe to a company the route it shall follow in carrying ibs goods and the company is immediately subjected to an inquiry before the commission, which is to have power to decide. that the route suggested by the outsider shall be the roube followed by the carrier. This is a marvellous piece of legislation. Again I admire the boldness of it . There are a number of other mabbers in connection wibh this Bill to which I could call atbention, bub I wish simply to take this opportunity of putting, as briefly and as broadly as I con, the views which have occurred to me in regard to it . I wish it to be distinctly understood that I have no lack of zeal for pubbing this Bill into operation when it is proved to be necessary-whe n our experience of the working of the Commonwealth under our new conditions shows that evils, if they exist at all, still continue, or that new mischiefs are developing themselves. There is no man who will then be prepared more readily than I to put that machinery in motion. May I say, as my deliberate opinion, which experience will test, that if there are any particular persons who ought to wish fchis law to be put in motion, either in Victoria or New South Wales, which form the two Stabes between which the biggest conflicts exist in regard to trade, those in New Soufch Wales have a great deal more reason to desire fchis Bill bo become operative than have our friends in Victoria, because it is not conceivable that you can charge on the Victorian railwaysfchepresent rates for bringing traffic from the Darling on the plea that you are developing your own property when you are charging your own people twice as much as you charge people 300 miles off. That will not help Victoria. The provisions in the Bill, therefore, will cut right against that State. There is not a Victorian rate designed to attract New Soubh Wales wool or goods traffic which will not stand condemned when the Inter-State Commission is established.",61
359,Mr CROUCH,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Is that the proper standpoint 1 The Mr Reid - I say that it is not, and I view the mabter from another sfcand-poinfc. Honourable members know thab I have had opportunities of getting .pretty accurate data from the railway authorities of New South Wales during the last few years, and I assure them that, in taking the position I am taking now, I am acting, not as a representative of New South Wales, but as an Australian. I do not want to rip up the railway system of Victoria if the railway authorities can come to some friendly arrangement amongst themselves. I do not - want to see the iron hand put; upon any authority unless there is the absolute pressure of necessity. There is a sort of inquisition which we may have to set up to deal with some sbern evils and great abuses; but the fewer"" inquisitions we set up in this free community the better. It may be necessary to establish this inquisition, and, if so, .1 would not hesitate to establish it ; bufc I would s a y - "" I shall not set up this inquisition, and put this expensive machinery into motion, until I see that it is absolutely necessary to do so."" If bhese differences can be amicably adjusted in the light of our broader citizenship, fchafc is a far better thing than the settlethe ment of them by the setting in motion of machinery like that provided for in the Bill I do not want to take upa party that position in connection with a Bill of this sort. I fully recognise that any Governdustry. ment which might have had to set this Commonwealth in motion would have had a most arduoustask upon their shoulders. We must all feel that, and,, therefore, I not wish to push too far any criticism of this Bill or any similar Bill. I feel that Ministers have a very great burden of responsibilit)* and labour to bear, and I hope that they will accept these remarks to-night as having no tinge of party feeling or design. I am not proposing a absolutely course which would force matters into a party groove. If the House feels that large and important measures which have been put before it are not so urgent other measures, it will be a perfectly legitiperience mate thing for Ministers to postpone the consideration of those measures, and they can do it without loss of dignity. Whatthat ever the Government may choose to do in that reference to this Bill, I wish to say that remarks in regard to it must be taken made in the broadest possible spirit.' Debate (on motion by Sir. J OHN QUICK) military system adjourned. DEFENC EBILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed (from 24th July, vide page 2996) on motion by Sir WILLIAM militia LYNEThat this Bill be now read a second time.",62
360,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I really feel very much indebted to the Government for allowing me fchis opportunity to briefly express my views uponfcheBill. In dealing with the subject of defence, the Ministry have had the advantage offchelegislation the States and of the deliberations of conpositions ferences of military commandants both recently and in past years. Whilst I in a position of authority in' another State, I endeavoured to bring the military comand mandants offcheStates together as often I could, to get them to thrash out questions of concerted military action as thoroughly as possible, and we have now a volume of research and authority with reference to military matters which must have been great assistance to the Government. What has been the main principle running through Sta'fce Acts in reference to defence ? I think I am correct in sayingfchafcthe backbone of our military system is the principleour forces shall consist cliieliy of volunteer soldiers recruited fromtlie ranks of inThafc has been the wisest principle for us to follow, not only from considerationsof the highest moral order, bufc also from considerations of actual economv, and do I want to see that principle made, not only the main principle of our addresses on this the subject, but the"" main principle of the Bill, and the principle carried oufc i nfchewhole organization of our military forces. We must, however, have a. small nucleus of permanent professional soldiers. That is necessary. Ifc is necessary in the interests of the volunteers themselves that they should have the advantage of trained professional, skill. In dealing with this 'as subject we must all speak from our exin the States from which we come. I cannot presume to speak of the system which has existed in any other State than to which I belong, and therefore I hope I shall be forgiven for referring to the my military system of New Soufch Wales. Ifc as has always seemed to me that whilst our volunteers have been the backbone of our",63
361,Mr MAUGER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Does the right honourable and learned member use the term ""volunteers"" in contradistinction from the term ""militia""?",63
362,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Yes . I shall deal with the presently. It has always seemed to me that in the practical administration of our military forces, the regulars have come first and the volunteers nowhere. We put the volunteers infcheforefront of our military system, but in the-daily administration of it they come last. In one sense they must do so; but in the past they have done so to a degree which I think is absoof lutely a misfortune. I should likefcosee the in our permanent force placed at 1 the disposal of men who have earned diswas tinction in serving their country as volunteers. In the State of New South Wales, perhaps in other States, there has been as too much marrying into the army. That is a most disgraceful state of things. Officers have married into the New South Wales army, and we have been unable to get rid of persons who were notoriously incompetent. of I had to bring out an artillery general to command our forces in order to get rid of two such persons, such was the enormous influence they possessed. That system has been a curse and a blot upon our forces-. To my mind one of the grave defects of the Bill is that whilst we are careful that there shall be no political patronage in regard to the clerks and the labourers in our public service, we allow political patronage to remain in connection with the most vital department of all- a department where excellence and merit should be the only qualifications for appointment and promotion. The Minister for Defence spoke with ill concealed disgust of the main principle of the Public Service Bill, but I do not share his feeling. The House emphasized unmistakably its determination that in connection with our clerical service there should be some sortof machinery which would make political influence in its thousand forms as difficult of success as possible. The Governor General and his Ministers cannot appoint a clerk under the Public Service Bill, but under the Defence Bill the Minister can appoint every one in the forces. That is a position, of affairs which I do not appreciate. I cannot see why we should lay down oneprinciple in regard to the clerical drvision of the public service ancl in regard to the young military power whioh we are bringing into existence allow the old state of alfairsfcocontinue. In the Defence Bill the Minister is everything which we have provided that the Minister under the Public Service Bill shall not be.",63
363,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,What would the right honourable gentleman have in place offcheprovision infcheDefence B i ll ?,64
364,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That is another matter. We must point out the defects of a Bill before we proceed to legislate. I ask the honourable and learned memberto remember that I am about to deal with a large subject in a vei'y few minutes, and I wish to occupyfchetime in expressing my views upon the Bill. When I am asked "" What would you do ?"" I reply that the genius which was capable of doing something in the Public Service Bill might be capable of doing something in this Bill. That is my answer to the honourable and learned member.",64
365,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I am afraid that I am nowiser.,64
366,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That is my answer for the present- a flying answer. I do not mind at once committing myself to the opinion-- although I do not say that it is a good onethat infinitely better than the uncontrolled power of a civilian and a colonial is the control of an imported military man. In these matters sometimes, the further you are bom from the place where the fellows want billets the better. Under these circumstancesthe Minister is absolutely the wrong man to settle our military system; because it must be borne in mindfchafcby our appointments and promotions we determine the character of that system. We can pass all the Acts and regulations in the world, but it is the men who command and the spirit that runs through the lineof promotion that is the spinal marrow of the serviee, whioh is responsible for its good or evil. I would infinitely rather provide, as it has been provided in the Public Serviee Bill , that appointments shall be made on the recommendation of the commissioner; that not a single appointment or promotion shall be made except on the recommendation of the general officer commanding. By that arrangement we have the benefit of Ministerial control, whatever it may happen fco be worth, in military matters, and we have the benefit; of the control of the general officer commanding. It may be asked, "" What Minister will appoint without the recommendation of the general officer commanding 1"" But if you bring an officer from England- I do not care how disfcinguished he is-and place the power of appointment in the hands of the Minister, making it his business, it is astonishing how many appointments will be made which the general officer commanding will not oppose, although he may have some doubts about; the expediency of them. If you put the responsibility on him directly - if Parliament in organizing the military system puts on the officer the obligation of being the recommending authority, and Parliament looks to him as a man sharing authority with the Minister, I do not at all fear but that any officer appointed will faithfully perform his dufcy. But the general officer is placed in a false position if we expect him practically to appoint, and put the power of appointment entirely independent of him.",64
367,Mr HUME COOK,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"But if the whole appointments be left to the general officer, very few Australians will get a show, especially if the officer be a British officer.",64
368,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Then the Minister comes in again. I do not leave the appointment to the general officer - I do not propose any1 thing of the sort. This is where we get some benefit from the two authorities working together. The commissioner, under the Public Service Bill, cannot appoint a single man to the service without the approval of the Governor General in Council. So, in this case, we have the Minister who will look after abuses of this sort, and we want the other man to look after the local abuses. If we have a Minister to keep the foreigners out, and a general officer to see that colonials do not get too big a show - fro m circumstances quite apart from military achievement-the n between the two I hope we will get a much sounder state of affairs than we should have with the uncontrolled authority of either. But what I wish to sayis, that if we will not trust the Ministry with the appointment of a clerk in charge of a quill, how can we, with any common sense or consistency, trust the Minister for Defence with appointments to the military forces ? ' - Mr HUMECOOK - I would rather trust the Minister than a general officer from old country.",64
369,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"But you need not trust either. We trust both together, hoping that that will be better nil round.",65
370,Mr MAUGER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It all depends on who responsible.,65
371,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The Minister is responsible, of course. I do not propose that the general officer should appoint, but I follow the guage which the Government has accepted in connection with a clerk in an office, namely that the Governor General shall appoint on the recommendation of the missioner. I . am sure my friends Ministry do not for one moment think that the responsibility is lessened by such a proit? vision.",65
372,Mr BARTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Whateve r is done there must be a Minister responsible.,65
373,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Exactly . And any man stood who has occupied a position of responsibility feels that. The law may say that the commissioner is to recommend, bufc what Minister would ever be so absurd as to say"" The law gives the power of recommendawe tion, and although I knew it was wrong, passed it through the Executive Council."" Britain. Sucli a Minister would be hurled from office. If all the responsibility is thrown on missioner, as is the case in connection the railways, it would be unfair to make Minister responsible in some things which law prevents him from regulating. Bufc not propose to put this matter in comfco mission. I wish to preservefcheMinister touch as the ultimate source of authority, but I say that in the interests of the Minister himself, as well as in the interests of the public service, the arrangements which I suggest would work better. We speak of the partially paid forces. That is a form of force to which I do not object, but give me, if possible, the volunteer principle.",65
374,Mr MAUGER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It has failed absolutely in Victoria.,65
375,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If it fails, let us have something as near to it as possible. We know that the volunteer movement may fail one day, and that owing to circumstances the movement may spread like wildfire on another occasion. The Governments of Australia', including the Federal Government, will miss a great opportunity if they do not take advantage of the feeling which exists in Australia at the present time, not to encourage military adveniure, but to encourage the enrolling of the citizens of this the country in a volunteer force. We can have, I suppose, twenty volunteers for one regular soldier. We, with all the problems of development we have to solve in these lands, cannot spend money as they spend money in is the old country on militaryaffairs. When I had the-honour of being a representative in Great Britain two or three years ago, a most distinguished statesman took advantage of lana public occasion fco impress on us all the dufcy which he said we owed to the mother country of making a large contribution to the military and naval expenditure, comand becoming a partner in the burdens of and the the British Empire.",65
376,Mr MCDONALD,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Would they not like,65
377,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I ventured to say in the same distinguished company that it was time the British people thoroughly under the state of Australian feeling-that we oufc in these far lands, in developing the resources of this greafc continent, were doing a far greater duty and rendering a more valuable service fco the British Empire than should do by any pecuniary contriI bution to the military chest of Great This contribution, which would be insignificant in the vast total of British a comexpenditure, might to us be a source of with embarrassment, and might derange our the finances so as to cause a state of feeling the which no lover of the British connection I do could wish to see developed. I am happy say that veiy shortly afterwards all the in difficulties at the Premiers' Conference seemed fco disappear, and Mr Goschen told us that we were to have a first-class training man-of-war, and that they did not want the limit altered-in fact they wanted nothing. I thought 1 had performed a public service in letting the British Government and the British public know the true state of affairs. I say again that those wild projects of inviting these young struggling communiwith ties to become partners in the responwhich sibility of managing this vast empire are doomed always to failure - We can never occupy a position in that august centre Imperial ' power which can be equal make fco that which we now occupy as a selfvolunteer oontained and a self-governed community. We should have to reverse almost the first principles, I will not say of politics, bufc of Surpassing grandeur. nature to make such a project rational. have always felt in this case fchafc the .frailer is indeed the stronger tie. I have always felfc that, built as we are, we need no legal forms or solemnities to accentuate the relationship in which we all stand. There run within us feelings and instincts which can never be destroyed, and which will make us readj afc all times to take a fair share in the defence of the integrity of the Empire. But there are tasks that are beyond us, and the task to which I have referred' is one of these. I am sure honourable members will pardon this digression. I say again that we must have a permanent force, bufc the smaller fchafc force isfchebetter. There ought nofcrant to be a single man beyond the proper numthe ber for the purpose of the nucleus of volunteer army. I have no sympathy with those clauses which reduce us to the trauniform. ditions offcheGermans. I have no sympathy with those clauses about that class kilts! of men and this class of men being brought out tier after tier in defence of their country. I say that we do not need legislation when the tune of trouble conies. Make your preparations-ye s .make your system of volunteer defence such that you can attract an adequate number persons within its ranks, and such that those who will not join the volunteers join rifie clubs. Bufc I have no sort sympathy with that sort of legislation which triesfcodo in an empty form of words that which, after all, does not make an Englishthe man abetter soldier, or a man more likely to defend his country. These clauses do no harm; and I do not suppose they will. Bufc fchey have a sound in our ears There bo which we are not accustomed. As to [197] of the children of the country, fchafc is a noble development of the military movement. I would like to see little boys of four and five years of age march into their schools under discipline. Thafc is a grand development, and it is the first germ of a genuine volunteer movement. I am entirely the Ministry in regardfcothe position they propose to give to the cadet corps. As to' the principles on which our defence force should rest, I again earnestly of say that we must, by some method or other, m the position of the volunteer and the officer a position of credit and distinction. Glittering scarlet uniforms are very beautiful. I myself have a uniform of But I must say in I reference to the foundation of an Australian defence force that my eyes travel away from those beautiful and glittering uniforms to the figures of men like Sherman, Lincoln, and Grant in the United States. We know the style of uniform they wore. They had not to depend on a uniform for the respect with which they were treated. Those are ideals, and our ideal should not find its climax r in gold lace. The Minister of Defence may say that the poor man likes, if possible, more gold lace thanfcherich man. If that be so, it only shows what a bad example the Government are setting the poor man. The evil is not in the poor man, but in the military system which makes gold lacefchewarof the first-class military hero. I say let uniform spell something else. Let it be a no sort of distinction that puts a man on a pedestal-let us give our officers a working Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAJM* - Pu t them in",65
378,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The kilb is a noble uniform, and no man could look better in it than the honourable member for Melbourne-excep t myself, perhaps. We notice, when the stern ; business of war begins, how all these things are thrown off. I would like to treat this of matter seriously, and I hope the honourable member for Melbourne, who is always a will model of demeanour, will try to do the of same. . He leads me astray, knowing my disposition to.levity. I really feel that in this matter there is a little more than meets eye. I would like to see something of the rough American style about our military may uniform-man y gradations below the marvellous creations we see on review day. is a brilliancy about the officers in these the small communities which quite takes the shine out of the great reviews afc Aldershofc. There is another thing I am pleased to see in the Bill. There is a provision which, it seems fco me, will help us to avoid - what will perhaps be the greatest evil of all. Thafc is the continuance in responsible military positions, calling for active attributes, of men who ""have become old and infirm. Afc our review in Sydney the other day before the Duke of York there were some grand men, but there were also a lot of venerable relics present, hardly able to keep on their horses. These men had rendered grand service in their d w , remember. No doubt some of these old gentlemen had been pillars of the volunteer movement in days gone by, bufc it is altogether wrong that such men should be. relied on in matters of life and death-it is altogether wrong that the lives of men should be put into the hands of those who are utterly unfit, even physically, to go through the fatigues of an ordinary clay's parade. I say that in this young Australian army of ours I appreciate the principle which Ministers have included in the Bil l that men shall not vegetate in positions of responsibility. I believe that the provision under which the occupancy of any one position is limited to a period of five years is applied to the volunteers as well as to the other branches of the force. It certainly is a principle that should apply all round. We must set about this work as if it really is what it professes to be, and the recent events in South A f rica have shown us that if we have the right sort of material, it is astonishing how soon we can trainfchafcmaterial to fight. With reference to that remarkable struggle, that painful struggle-becaus e Britishers as we are, and loyal as we are, there is a grandeur about the courage which animates these Boers which no man can affect to disparage - cin e of the great lessons they have taught Great Britain- a lesson sadly needed-is that the whole genius of the administration of the British army must be changed. There is no doubt the officers are all brave - splendidl y brave men, but there is something wanting. There was a good deal wanting about our own officers, but it was not their fault.",66
379,Mr KIHWAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,They were not wanting in bravery.,67
380,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"No, none of them, either officers or men-the y have proved their bravery; but there is something better almost than bravery, and that is the skill and discretion which avoid slaughter ancl defeat, ancl even those of us who cannot presume fco judge military men, know well enough-becaus e the lesson is written in characters too plain for any one to misunderstand-thaf c the old style of tactics, which took masses of heroic men to slaughter, must be changed. Bravery is counting for less and less, mere human impact is counting for less and less. It isfchafcmysterious conflict of genius, as expressed in the implements and munitions of warfare and in the brains of great generals ; it is that mysterious conflict of forces which will now determine the fate of armies ancl empires, ancl we who glory in the tough valour whidh carried Britain through so many glorious difficulties, had better be warned in time. We had better remember that we are but a handful of people, who are claiming the richest and largest part of the surface of the earth. We must remember that if there is a community of communities which clown to its furthest extremity should be alive to the wants of today, it is that wonderful series of communities which form this British Empire. I here again say that this is a Bill over which no sense of party spirit should ever come. iWe must feel that, small as our population is today, it is confronted with mighty risks. We may feel proud of the mighty strength of the British Empire, butfchetask we have now afc once to perform is to provide for the internal defence of this Commonwealth. Thirty years ago, when the councils of littleEngland prevailed, . British, troops, were withdrawn from these colonies, and we weretold "" You may depend upon our fleets, bnt no longer upon our soldiers ; you must arm and defend your own shores."" I do not object to fchafc, but, on the other hand, I think that we ought to rise to that responsibility, ancl that we ought ""to do it thoroughly. I hope to see-nof c so much for the emergencies of today, but as a part of the evolution of an Australian, system of defence-ou r Australians exercising upon ships of war. Why should the honourable member who referred to this question be laughed afc for talking about founding au Australian navy-1 There is no necessity, perhaps, to begin the founding of a navy now, but there is no reason in the world why these ships of war, which are lying idle in our ports, should not be made the training ground for the future naval defence force of Australia."" It is a. system that I would put side by side with our military system. Our""' Australian squadron-the ships of His Majesty's fleet - offe r every convenience for the development of a school in gunnery under the conditions which would prevail in repelling an attack from the sea, and yet with all these vast opportunities at our hands of nourishing the germ of our naval power we have.never used them. Of course while we talk about the necessity of founding these systems of defence, let ns neverforget that war is a horror; let us never forget that with all the glitter and glory of deeds of heroism on the field all these are black, dark chapters in the progress of humanity. Let our Australian spirit expand itself, not in dreams of. military adventure in other lands, hut in qualifying itself to put round this great continent a .rampart of triple steel; that is a legitimate ambition for a man or a country. Do not let the statesmen of England think, because we are ready to send our men to Africa, that Australians are infected with any lust of military enterprise. AVe are not prepared to enter those lists. At the same time if any emergency comes when the motherland is beset with danger, it will ever, I trust, be found that we are ready to shed our blood in defence of her, not only for her own sake, but because she and we are associated, and our institutions are guaranteed by the strength and glory of the British Empire. Debate (on motion by Mr WISTEH COOKF.) adjourned. House adjonrnerl at 10:41 p.m.",67
