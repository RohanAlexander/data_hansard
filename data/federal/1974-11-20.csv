That the traditional weights and measures are eminently satisfactory. Vour petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Metric Conversion An be repealed, and that the Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional and familiar units to be restored in those areas where the greatest inconvenience and distress are occurring, that is to say, in meteorology, in road distances, in sport, in the building and allied trades, in the printing trade, and inretailtrade.

Metric System Marriage The honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) That the whole principle of the Family Law Bill 1974 is aimed at destroying the entire concept of marriage as traditionally recognised in Australia, with its special obligations between husband and wife and between parents and children. (2) That the Bill fails to recognise or provide for the equal rights andreponsibilitiesof both parties to a marriage, such as are provided for in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including therightsof parents to choose the type of education they desire for their children.

Family Law Bill illegal under international law To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully shows: (1) That there are very many responsible citizens concerned about the provisions of the Family Law Bill 1974 and are opposed to it becoming law in its present form. (2) That very many are concerned that the provisions of this Bill will change marriage into a voluntary union terminable on the wish of either party. The Bill will allow an innocent spouse to be abandoned on 12 months notice on the wish of the other party, leaving the innocent pany to bear his/her own costs. It will be the only contract which can be broken unilaterally with the blessing of the law. (3) That we believe the Bill is a direct assault on the stability of the married state and of the family. The direct result of the Bill, if passed by Parliament, will be the diminished members of the House stability of society. That the inevitable rise in the divorce rate will increase number of deprived children already causing profound concern and huge expense in our society. national health scheme is not free the (3) That there will be more potential criminals in our society as aresultof more broken marriages. (6) That women may fear to have children lest they be and left with a young family in very unfavourable economic circumstances. They could be faced with the prospect of lifelong loneliness and hardship. They could fear in being abandoned and paid off with a small lump sum. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of in Parliament assembled should not admit the law of this land the Family Law Bill in its present which functions efficiently form.

3,Mr VINER,MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS,Iremindthe Minister for Housing and Construction that ever since the December 1972 elections the people of Australia have been promised a tax deductibility scheme in relation to home mortgage interest payments. They have not yet seen the scheme despite all the promises. I have been watching the daily program anxiously to see whether such a Bill is to be introduced. We still have not seen it. This sessional period is to conclude in a little over 2 weeks. Will the Minister advise the House whether enabling legislation will be introduced during these last 3 weeks of this sitting?,19
4,Mr LES JOHNSON,MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS,The best answer I can give to this question is to recommend that the honourable gendeman look at an account of the proceedings. If he does that he will estabhsh that the Bill was introduced last Wednesday.,19
5,Mr FULTON,MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Northern Development who no doubt is aware of the announcement by President Ford of the United States of America that a global quota will be established for imports of sugar into the United States. Will this action futher accentuate the shortage of sugar that is now causing serious concern to many importing countries, including the United States?",19
6,Dr PATTERSON,MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS,"It is true that President Ford of the United States of America has made an announcement which in effect establishes a global quota of 7 million short tons of sugar which can be imported into the United States. The decision was made to ensure that the United States is guaranteed supplies of sugar. The President made this decision because of the critical world shortage of sugar. The current United States legislation in regard to sugar is to expire on 31 December this year. If the President had not taken this action, tariffs on sugar imported into the United States would have had to increase. By making a proclamation which provides for an import quota-in this case a global quota-the President has been able to ensure that current tariffs or import duties will remain. So in effect the President has taken action to ensure that sugar is imported into the United States at the lowest permissible rates of tariff which can be adopted under the United States laws. What the action of the United States President again emphasises is the critical shortage of sugar on world markets. President Ford said: Users of sugar can help ease prices by buying wisely, conserving supplies and consuming less sugar. He went on to say: I urge all Americans to reduce the amount of sugar in cooking and to put in half the amouni usually used to sweeten coffee or tea. The very serious situation that applies in regard to the supply of sugar is illustrated by the fact that the President of the world's most powerful nation is urging Americans to eat less sugar, not because of its qualities but because of the shortage. In view of the free advice that I gave to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about the qualities of sugar, I am not certain whether I am game enough to advocate that Australians should eat less sugar.",19
7,Mr ANTHONY,MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS,The Minister for Health says sugar is a third-rate poison.,19
8,Dr PATTERSON,MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS,"Yes , I accept that there is a difference of opinion on sugar between the Minister for Health and me. But I have made very clear to this House the great energy attriSUGAR butes of sugar. I think the Leader of the Australian Country Party is a good consumer of sugar. This shortage is a very serious problem. Australia is now taking steps to increase its production of sugar. This decision has not been taken lightly because as honourable members know 80 per cent of our total production of sugar has to be exported. Also, the growing of sugar is a mono-culture and therefore the sugar industry in northern Australia is at the complete mercy of export markets. As I said, we are taking steps to increase the production of sugar within the existing mill areas. I have saidtimeand time again in this House- I believe all honourable members will agree with me-that before a major expansion of the industry can take place we want to be sure of guaranteed markets through long term agreements with importing countries. ALBURY-WODONGA",19
9,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS,"Is the Prime Minister aware that in order to attract industry to decentralised growth centres such as Albury Wodonga, State governments give concessions to industries which have the effect of increasing their profits? Is he aware that, as a result, half of the concessions granted by States finish up in Commonwealth consolidated revenue? In view of the fact that every week industries are retrenching staff in this so-called growth centre, when will his Government lay down policies which will attract and maintain industries in this area? In particular, when may we expect the implementation of his 1972 election policy promise for local call telephone access from Albury to Melbourne and Sydney?",19
10,Mr WHITLAM,MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS,The Royal Commission on the Post Office under Sir James Vernon-the second Vernon Royal Commission-mad e some recommendations upon the matter of concessional telephone and telex charges to designated growth centres. They are being discussed with the State governments. GOVERNMENT'S WAGES POLICY,20
11,Mr RIORDAN,MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS,My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and Immigration. Has the Minister heard allegations that the Australian Government does not have a realistic and responsible wages policy? Is there any truth in this allegation? Is it not true that the Parliament has no jurisdiction to legislate on incomes? Did not the Liberal and Country Party members actively campaign against this Parliament being given such power during the campaign which preceded the 1973 referendum on prices and incomes?,20
12,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS,"I did read in the Press that a gentleman in the Parliament last night made the absurd allegation that the Government does not have a responsible and realistic wages policy. I understand, if the Press can be believed, that that statement came from the person who poses as the alternative Prime Minister of this country. I notice that the honourable member for Wannon is rather amused at that proposition. I can understand the reason for his amusement and I sympathise with him. The Government does have a very positive, realistic and workable wages policy. For the very first time in 25 years we have a government that has a positive policy on wages, a policy which, if adopted by the Arbitration Commission, will bring about the stability in the economy that the whole of the Australian people are craving. What it will do is to index automatically wages to whatever price movements are revealed in the consumer price index so that workers will know in advance what their wage increases will be. It will not be necessary for workers to make exaggerated wage demands based upon expected movements in prices. They will not have to go on strike two or three times a year to get that which will now come to them automatically each quarter if our proposition is adopted by the Commission. In addition to that, each year there will be a review of productivity. Superimposed upon the quarterly increases that will flow from the automatic indexation of the consumer price index will be a further increase based upon a flat division of the total productivity. This should go to the whole of the labour force. In between these annual reviews and in between these quarterly automatic indexations of wages there will be opportunities to correct any anomalies arising from exceptional circumstances that may come from changed techniques, changed work values or changed work skills. The one big question that has agitated the mind of the Government is when indexation will commence. From what date will it operate? I say that because already there are some wage increases that have not been fully dissipated and measured against price movements. Those increases have not yet been fully absorbed. The Government believes that the December quarter ought to be compensated for by giving to wage earners a real tax reduction in lieu of any wage indexation for the December quarter. In this way we will be able to postpone any automatic indexation of the consumer price index until the results of the March quarter are known. That figure would become known to the Government and to the public at large on about 20 April. From the first pay period commencing after 20 April there would be an increase in wages to compensate for price movements. So we would have a substantial reduction in tax to compensate for the price movement in the December quarter, and then there would be the automatic adjustment for the March quarter towards the end of April. This will give employers a breathing space of from today until towards the end of April, with workers being better off in their after tax pay and the employer being required to pay nothing at all in increased wages until about the end of April. This is not only an effective way of guaranteeing that wages retain their value and are preserved from erosion by rising prices; it is also a very effective, common sense and realistic way of dampening down the rate of inflation which would otherwise occur if nothing was done to increase the take home pay after tax, and nothing was done to index wages automatically. NA NA",20
13,Mr CALDER,SPECIAL BRANCH,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General and I refer to the reply given by him to remarks I made concerning the aboUtion of the Northern Territory PoUce Special Branch. The Minister then said that the Special Branch was disbanded because it was a poltiical pohce force. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that the Attorney-General has ordered a special secret poUce investigation into the personal, social and political Uves of members of the jury which in October 1974 found Mr Syd Anderson of Papunya, via Alice Springs, guilty of the murder of Mr Eric Erlensen. Anderson was duly sentenced to IS years gaol with an 8-year non parole period. Is the legal aid service in any way connected with the request for this inquiry? If not, who is? Does the Minister consider it right that there should be a breach of the privacy of citizens under these circumstances?",20
14,Mr ENDERBY,SPECIAL BRANCH,"I recall the answer I gave some time ago to the honourable gentleman's question as to why the Special Branch was disbanded. I repeat that one of the best and earliest actions taken by this Government was to dismantle a political arm of a police force which operated in Australia, because it was iniquitous and went completely against everything for which this Government, and I am sure every Australian, believe in and stand for. I have no knowledge of the allegations made by the honourable gentleman but I am happy to express the opinion that the allegations, if true, would be completely inconsistent with everything that this Government stands for. Naturally I will direct the inquiry to the Attorney-General. May I add that this is typical of the form of question that comes from the honourable gentleman in that he seeks to associate the legal aid scheme- a system designed to assist ordinary citizens of Australia, particularly those on low incomes-wit h something that is wrong and to smear and slur it in some way. It is quite typical. This is a pattern to be found running through all his questions. Having said that, I add this thought: It is well known that the deliberations of jurors is a matter for them and them alone. The anonymity of discussions in the jury room is something that is essentially basic to the adrninistration of justice in Australia and comes to us through tradition from the United Kingdom. GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC POLICIES students",21
15,Mr GARRICK,SPECIAL BRANCH,I ask the Prime Minister: Is it a fact that the Government's economic policies require the co-operation of all sections of community to break the wage-price spiral and reverse the trend in unemployment? What critical response has the Government received to its appeal?,21
16,Mr WHITLAM,SPECIAL BRANCH,"I am glad to say that the squeeze, Government has had a very favourable from employer and employee organisations to the program I outlined on Tuesday night of last week. Employers feel confident in being able to put men and women on their payrolls and keep them on their payrolls. Employee organisations in a great number of cases have responded positively by telegram, letter or telephone call supporting the Government's approach. Apparently it is only, in public life, among people on the opposite side in this Parliament that we find no positive response to these matters. I observed that in his speech last night the Leader of the Opposition did not make any mention at all of wage indexation. One would have thought that the great issue in which all governments will be engaged before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the next few months would have been something justifying his passing interest. He showed no interest in it at all. Mr Snedden-It is a phoney, that is why.",21
17,Mr WHITLAM,SPECIAL BRANCH,"I would have thought that the honourable gentleman would have said that it is a phoney. He is capable of using terms like that. It is a term he uses quite often. But his response was utterly negative. He is just a nark and a knocker. One would have thought that in the course of 7 days and 7 nights burning the midnight oil one should have been able to come to some positive view on the proposals. But of course all the financial newspapers have categorised the right honourable gentleman's own proposals for tax reductions as being naive and woolly, whereas, of course, we have tied them in with the general context of a contract between employees, employers and the governments of Australia. I am satisfied that the Commission will respond to such positive suggestions. NA NA",21
18,Mr SNEDDEN,SCHOOL LEAVERS,"I ask the Prime Minister: Is the Government going to do nothing about the position of many thousands of young Australians leaving schools and universities who will go straight on to the unemployment register, and the thousands of secondary and university who will be unable to find the vacation jobs that are so important to many of them? Does he understand that this situation will have an immense economic and social impact upon the these young people? How can the Government justify abandoning these young people at this point in their lives when they are about to embark on their working careers? Why will the Government not adopt positive policies to stimulate the private sector and end this crazy credit reduce interest rates and get the housing response industry going again?",21
19,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SCHOOL LEAVERS,"Always at the end of every year-this has been characteristic of our to society ever since we have had compulsory schooling-ther e are many young people who are not able immediately to find work. This has always been the case and always will be. It is true that this year there will be more students than there were last year who will not be able to get work immediately. Last year was a boom year. I have had a look at the ngures and they show that there was a total increase in the work force last year of 220,000, which is an all-time record. It was a boom year, and those conditions could not possibly have been repeated indefinitely. This Government has done something of which I feel we on this side are all very proud. We have introduced a career reference centre in every one of the main capital cities which, for the very first time, will give these young people an opportunity to have vocational guidance instead of being required to make their own decisions without the proper information as to future trends and future job opportunities. The Cabinet, at the instigation of the Prime Minister I am very proud to say, took a positive decision to increase the intake of young people into the Public Service by a total of 1,450. A total of 450 graduate clerks and more than 1,000 school leavers will be taken into the Public vice. The Public Service is also increase the number of apprenticeships that it will offer to young people wanting to take up apprenticeships. We have increased the intake the miserable 50 apprenticeships a year, which inherited when I became Minister for Labor, no fewer than 300 apprentices. It will be this year if my recommendations can be accomspoken modated. We are not happy with the fact that is not possible any year for everybody leaving school to get a job immediately.",21
20,Dr FORBES,SCHOOL LEAVERS,Why do you not do something about it?,22
21,Mr SPEAKER,SCHOOL LEAVERS,Order! I warn the honourable member for Barker.,22
22,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SCHOOL LEAVERS,"There is nothing Sir that anybody can do about that. What I want know from the right honourable gentleman opGovernment posite is: Will he try to explain to us how his proposition of reducing Government expenditure by 8 per cent will help this situation? That means that he will reduce the Public Service per cent. He is going to cut back spending housing by 8 per cent and on transport by cent. He is going to clip 8 per cent off the cation budget that we have. Presumably he will clip 8 per cent off the unemployment benefit. is going to clip 8 per cent off social security. going to clip 8 per cent off every item of govern the ment expenditure. If that is not what he intends to do, he has not yet said so and he has not yet indicated what will be the total saving of the 8 per cent he intends to clip off only various areas of government expenditure. The right honourable gentleman, yesterday, if he is correctly reported, wanted to reduce public expenditure by $ 1,000m. Reducing Government expenditure by $ 1,000m is no way to provide more employment; it must provide less. I can only hope that the young people of Austraha will never have to face a government that proposes to reduce its expenditure on employment-makin g projects by $ 1,000m a year. CANBERRA-BATEMAN' S BAY ROAD",22
23,Mr WHAN,SCHOOL LEAVERS,"I address my question to the Minister for Transport. Is the Minister aware of the heavy demands made by Canberra traffic and in particular gravel and sand trucks on the road connecting Canberra to Bateman's Bay? Is he aware also of the very serious condition that this road, having been constructed in about 1959 as a 35-mile an hour road, has now reached? The road has now been reduced to a goat track. Can the Minister tell me what action this Government can take to assist in restoring that road to a Serreasonable condition and perhaps, in the future, offering to reahgning the road?",22
24,Mr CHARLES JONES,SCHOOL LEAVERS,"I am aware of the from concern of the honourable member for EdenI Monaro as I am aware of the concern of the to honourable member for Fraser and the honourmore able member for Canberra, all of whom have to me about this matter at some time or it another. As a result of their representations, I have written to Sir Charles Cutler, the Minister for Highways in New South Wales, seeking his co-operation in doing something about the problem. As honourable members will understand, provision is made in the roads legislation in each year for the construction or reconstruction of rural arterial roads. The Bateman's Bay road comes in that category. Therefore, I have said to Charles that, as it comes within that category, to I would appreciate it if he would use Australian money to reconstruct that road or to construct those areas that have to be constructed. On the matter of maintenance, when Sir by 8 Robert Menzies agreed to finance this road back on in 1957-58, one of the conditions was that it 8 per would be maintained by the New South Wales eduDepartment of Main Roads. I have therefore suggested to Sir Charles that he might, if it is not He a construction or reconstruction job, use funds to He is maintain this road immediately, having in mind thousands of people who will travel on the road in the Christmas period. Reconstruction of the road would be a very expensive job and I understand from councils in the region that the cost is estimated to be approximately $5.7m. So that would make a great hole in the allocation for rural arterial roads. I appreciate the honourable member's concern. The Government has made the necessary representations in the matter. LABOR PARTY'S POLICY",22
25,Mr DONALD CAMERON,SCHOOL LEAVERS,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he recalls that, as an electoral candidate for the Australian Labor Party from the New South Wales division of his Party, he signed a pledge which concluded with the words: I also pledge myself to actively support and advocate times the Party's objective-the socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange. Does he recall that on many occasions he has stated that he is proud to be a socialist? I further ask whether he remembers that part budget address last Tuesday week which stated: The Australian Government fully recognises the crucial importance of the private sector in the development of Australia. The lack of public response in the last week to the new budget is connected closely to lack confidence because of the conflict of socialist vows of the Prime Minister and",23
26,Mr SPEAKER,SCHOOL LEAVERS,Order! I remind the honouration able gentleman that quotations are out of order. have been very tolerant. Would the honourable gentleman ask his question?,23
27,Mr DONALD CAMERON,SCHOOL LEAVERS,"Will the Prime received Minister please honestly explain ment, for the sake of all, including those 200,000 fellow Australians now unemployed, exactly how he sees the role of the private sector in relation to the pledge to socialism which he renews prior to every election, or has he seen the light and given his vows away as being a dismal failment ure and unacceptable to Australia?",23
28,Mr WHITLAM,SCHOOL LEAVERS,"Of course I have signed the manent Australian Labor Party's Pledge whenever have sought to be its candidate at very many this elections, and I expect to be doing so for many elections to come. To help the honourable gentleman, I might extend his research by pointing out what the Australian Labor Party's Platthe form says by way of elaboration of the general objective which he had quoted. It says: With the object of achieving Labor's objectives, establish or extend public enterprise, where appropriate by nationalissition ation, particularly in the fields of banking, insurance, marketing, housing, areas of anti-social private monopoly. I am proud to say that my Government has taken initiatives in each one of those matters which I have just quoted. It has established or extended public enterprise in each of those matters. I believe that it has done so with public support. The resources of this continent and the opportunities of our people would be very much less if the Australian Government had not at last decided to extend or establish public enterprise in those fields. The honourable gentleman asks me to elaborate on the attitude of the Government towards private enterprise. In a nutshell, the Government recognises that three-quarters of the men and women in Australia are employed by private enterprise. This is a mixed economy and we therefore want to make it as efficient and at all as just as we can. Despite a great deal of continued obstruction by the Senate, the Government has been able to pass quite a number of Bills which have made Australia's mixed economy a more just economy than it was when my of his new Party came into office. NA",23
29,Mr JAMES,AGE OF PARLIAMENTARIANS,"Mr Speaker, my question is directed to you. Following several telephone calls from people in my electorate of Hunter I ask: Is it of a fact that a number of the best speeches made from the other side of the House yesterday were made by the older members of the Liberal Party approaching pensionable age, the early terminof whose parliamentary careers is sought I by the young turks of the Liberal Party?",23

31,Mr MCLEAY,HOME BUILDING ASSISTANCE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to the announcement made on Tuesday of last week that the Governis to advance $150m through the savings banks rather than through the co-operative perbuilding societies in an attempt to assist I the home building industry. I ask the Prime Minister-no t the Minister for Housing-whe n was decided in principle and what Ministers were present.,23
32,Mr WHITLAM,HOME BUILDING ASSISTANCE,"This matter was decided by full Cabinet last Tuesday and the Bill will be introduced, I expect, next Tuesday. I welcome this quesuon from the shadow Minister for Housing. It is signincant that the Leader of the Oppolast night in his speech on the economy did consumer finance, not mention housing. stevedoring, transport and in NA",23
33,Mr WILLIS,BANK LENDING,"I ask the Treasurer: In view of recent assertions that the Government's measures to expand the availability of credit have not been effective, could he inform the House of the extent to which the capacity of the banks to lend money has in fact been improved in recent months? Could he also explain why there has been a recent upsurge in bank holdings of Treasury bills and notes and whether these increased holdings can be taken as reflecting a failure of the Government's monetary policy or as representing any legitimate basis of criticism of actions by the Reserve Bank?",23
34,Mr CREAN,BANK LENDING,"The Government has taken number of measures directly and indirectly Treasurer through the Reserve Bank with a view to extendDoes ing the supplies of credit available through the banking system. There have been several releases from the statutory deposit system. We have varied the provisions by which savings bank investment is regulated as between governhe ment securities and housing loans. We have reduced the liquidity requirements. This years? immediately made cash available through that area. Of course Treasury notes are short term curities for the investment of $100,000 or for periods of less than 13 weeks or less than weeks according to the nature of the Treasury note. I believe that quite a number of holdings Treasury notes in recent months ticipatory of the company taxation that has to be paid. I have been asked quite a number of questions about that area. I point out that something like half of the panies have already paid their quarterly installieved ments by the due date and no doubt those transhave actions will be reflected also in the holding Treasury notes. We recently reduced the interest rate on Treasury notes to make them a relatively less attractive investment and other areas, like the semi-government loans, relatively more tractive. During the month of September particuquarters larly quite a number of semi-government loans in were in fact over-subscribed, as I believe the rent one for the Melbourne Board of Works be. I think the honourable member would have noted that there was a record release by the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the Commonths monwealth Savings Bank of money for housing ful. during the last month. I think what ought to be occasionally stressed is that some of these measures do take time to work through. I notice that the apostles of gloom for the economy are already trying to forecast what December consumer price index will reflect. I regard this as a quite unscrupulous exercise. body will know until about 15 January what the December CPI will be. I point out that even Statistician himself was wrong last quarter because he originally showed the figure at 5.4 per cent and in the outcome it proved to be 5.1 per cent. I do not think that any service is rendered to an economy by trying to suggest an exaggerated picture as to the rate of inflation. I suggest that it is about time we sensibly got down to analysing what the root causes of inflation, unemployment andflagginginvestment really are. NA",24
35,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"My question is a follow-up a question to the one just answered by the and it is directed to the Prime Minister. the Prime Minister recall his criticism not so long ago of the Opposition for being prophets of doom, saboteurs and so on? Does he agree that what is urgently needed in Australia is confidence, certainty and a sense of direction? Did say this week that Australia aces the worse f economic situation it has faced for some 40 Did Mr Hawke say recently that the worse depression in Australia since the great depressesion of the 1930s will occur next year? Will the more Prime Minister stop acting like a prophet of 26 doom and a saboteur of national confidence and begin acting like a national leader, instead of tryof ing to condition the public to his own Governhave been anment's mismanagement?",24
36,Mr WHITLAM,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I did say that conditions economically were more difficult than they had been for over 40 years. However, I also said in comthe same context-the same interview-that I be that by the middle of next year we would turned the corner. Mr Hawke did say about of Australia what the right honourable gentleman has quoted; he also said it about the rest of the world. I do not believe that any purpose is served by giving people to understand that in the next atfew months, the next quarter or even the next 2 there will be any dramatic improvement the statistics or the indices. It is a fact that no cureconomic measures that any Australian Governwill ment takes or probably that any government anywhere takes in an economy like ours can have an immediate or an early effect. It takes a few for any of these measures to be successI also do not believe that there is any point in giving the impression that Australia is alone or can act alone in these matters. The fact is that Australia is one of the largest trading countries in the the world. There is no other mixed economy, there is no other industrialised country which has Noa greater percentage of its economy dependent upon trade than is the case with Australia. Threethe quarters of our trade takes place with western Europe, North America and Japan and they all have the same twin problems as we have, those of inflation and unemployment. In those circumstances we all have to try together internationally and we also have to try domestically to reverse these deplorable trends. It is a fact that conditions are worse in the trading-the industrialised-countrie s with rnixed economies than has been the case for over 40 years. I believe that we are taking steps which will mitigate those effects internationally and domestically. I do not believe that the right honourable gentleman helps things by taking half of what Mr Hawke says or half of what I say. If one takes the whole of what Mr Hawke said and the whole of what I said, I believe that there are gpod grounds for thinking that by the middle of next year there will be a marked improvement in these 2 problems which beset the Australian economy and society.

I caU upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their",35
58,Mr SNEDDEN,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"The manufacturing industry in Australia is in an extremely depressed state. There is no confidence. There is no investment. There are retrenchments and there is no likelihood of the situation improving for a considerabletime.The reasons for this are enthe decisions of the Government. A political party should state quite expUcitly its objecand policies in respect of manufacturing especially if that political party is in the government. Unless a government is prepared to state that its objective is to develop and sustain an efficient, growing and diversified manufacturing industry, an appropriate level of confidence will not be established. A government should adopt clear poUcies to achieve this objectivewhich must include the creation and sustaining of an environment which encourages in manufacturing. The policies must by be guaranteed to be stable and long term. We must have as a policy a consistent and constructive tariff policy, and that must be followed through. Australian ownership and control should be encouraged but overseas investment should not be discouraged. Incentives should be BOARD given to responsible industry in order to assist efficiency and profitability. The Government scale industry-th that it favours large, medium and e full range of industryincentives will be given. The manufacturing industry provides over 25 per cent of the gross domestic product. It provides one-third of capital spending by industry. It employs 1.5 million people. Each manufacturing job supports one tertiary job. Without a strong manufacturing industry we cannot have a growing Australia. Without a strong manufacturing industry we cannot achieve our national objectives-nationa l objectives of growth, improvement in our Uving standards, the provision of education and health services, the relief of poverty, aid to the poor, the provision of aid to overseas countries less well endowed with resources and people than we are. None of those can be achieved without a strong manufacturing industry. Manufacturing is the great job provider. It can be successful in Australia, and it has proved that it is successful. It has proved that it is efficient. An example of this is the growth in exports. The value of exported manufactured goods in the mid-1950s was $ 100m. By the finan-Minister cial year 1973-74 this had grown to $ 1,340m. is efficient. It can compete with any country the world. It can export. Note how things have changed now in the outEach look for manufacturing industry. The Associated of Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, in asimmensely sociation with the Bank of New South Wales, Governmentbad undertook a survey for the September found that there were falls in employment, falls Australia, Mainline Corporation in overtime, and falls in orders. It found the most Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd sheer widespread ever reported drop in these three essential items in the survey's history. An unprement cedented 78 per cent of the people surveyed expect worse over the next 6 months. They share the view of the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and of the Prime Minister industry. (Mr Whitlam). Against this background the Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Enderby) has said that the manufacturers and their management are frightened of their own shadows. If they were able to say in this House what they think of the Minister for Manufacturthe ing Industry then it would perhaps explain to him that they are not frightened of their own shadows; they just want to get on with their jobs and have the capacity to do their jobs. The Prime Minister called them nervous Nellies. He called his own parliamentary colleagues the same. But this is not going to help manufacturing industry. Basically manufacturing industry is area in which jobs are being lost. This is the in which retrenchments are occurring. This area in which there is no investment, and it is area in which help needs to be given. It is clear that nothing that the Government has done that survey was taken has restored confidence manufacturing industry. Fixed capital spending is down; it is falling on the basis of real prices. 1973-74 there was actually $50m less spent than in 1969-70 in real terms. Investment in manufacbonds turing industry is not keeping pace with the domestic product. The result is that we have ageinterest ing plant in our manufacturing industries. have ageing technology. The capacity for efficiency and competition with overseas comout petitors for export markets will diminish. Our pacity to have increased productivity will diminwe ish. Our capacity to have a lower unit cost will diminish as plant gets older and as technology gets out of date. There is gross under-training in the manufacUc servant? turing industry because there is not the capacity exist. to invest. There is not the cash flow; there is not way. the incentive. There will be negative productivity cent instead this year in the manufacturing industry, and this cent. is a great indictment of this Government and its for Manufacturing Industry. The causes It are lack of confidence by the Government in the of manufacturing industry and lack of confidence in the Government by the manufacturing industry. has lacked confidence in the other. The lack confidence by the manufacturing industry in the Government is well placed. There has been management on the part of the quarter. It collapse of the Leylandout in carrying its policies. Was the Motor Corporation of Ltd and coincidence? Of course it was not. The bad manageis occurring in Canberra. There is today no coherent economic policy of any kind, and there is. certainly no policy for the manufacturing The Government has given no positive statement of policy or objections in relation to manufacturing industry. It is prepared to stand by and see the imposition on manufacturing industry of most intense credit squeeze that has ever been applied in the history of this country. It is perfectly clear that jobs are being lost in the manufacturing industry, and that is where incentive and help needs to be given. The only reason why the Government maintains a credit squeeze is that it is determined to lift government spending. If government spending is going to be Ufted in that manner then pressure has to be put on the the private sector to stop the private sector from area competing for the goods and services supplied to is the the people. That is why I say: 'Cut back on the government sector spending so that there is no need to have a credit squeeze'. The Government since could reduce interest rates. The Government in could say tomorrow: 'We will pull back on government spending. We will then have the caIn pacity to say to the Reserve Bank of Australia: ""Go out into the market place and buy, buy, buy so that you put money back into the econgross omy and you reduce the yield and bring down rates. You will then stimulate the private We sector. We will stop the retrenchments and we will re-employ those people who have been put of their jobs"".' The reason why I say governcament sector spending should be cut down is that cannot have government sector spending taking aU of these things from the private sector and think it is doing some good. When did any honourable member last meet a retrenched pubRetrenched public servants do not There is no need to retrench them in any ment All we need to do is to hold back governspending to a reasonable level of 25 per of the spendthrift level of 33 per",35
59,Unknown,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,37
60,Mr SNEDDEN,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"Mr Speaker, before the sitting of the House was suspended for lunch I making the fundamental point that the cause the loss of jobs is the pressure that has been on the private sector. The private sector has been put under pressure by a credit squeeze. The reason for the credit squeeze is to prevent the vate sector from making use of money, resources, goods and services, and people so that they can all be transferred to the public sector. That is where the error Ues. This Government, if it wishes, can give instructions today to the Reserve Bank to buy, buy, buy Government bonds to put money into the private sector, lower and reduce interest rates. The Government has made some very serious pohcy errors. It has appUed a credit squeeze-th most severe in our history. It has raised interest rates to the highest level in our history and it done that by insisting upon buying votes throughAssistance spending in the Government sector. It made a very serious error when it cut tariffs across the board by 25 per cent without any consideration of whether the industries affected were decenforces, traUsed industries or under competition without considering the nature of the work force or whether there were women in it. The curious thing is that the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. Cairns) was not consulted in that tariff cut. all of these poUcy decisions are coming home rest. Great unemployment has been achieved and I say 'achieved' purposely because the Labor Party adopted the option of having unempoUcy'. ployment to tackle inflation. The Government adopted the wage setter principle for the PubUc Service. It encouraged big wage increases got the wage price spiral going. Now the Government understands its error but it is incapable of doing anything about it. Rising costs are a threat to the survival manufacturing industry and indeed to the whole of the private sector. What the Government wants to do is to leave the private sector array so that the Government can offer to take all the spending in the public sector. This the Government said in the Budget Speech. It said that it would take advantage of the turn in the private sector to advance the public sector. That is wrong and there is no point in Government now saying it will write a letter the Prices Justification Tribunal to teU it that profit is honourable. What the Government needs to do is to bring legislation into this and set out guideUnes. There are no guideUnes for the Prices Justification Tribunal. The Government has made a judge of the Arbitration Commission the man to determine prices but it has not given him any guideUnes. was Revaluation was said to be the great achieveof ment of the Labor Party but is was not a great put achievement; it was a disaster. What the Government achieved was to take out of the private sector the capacity to compete. It took confidence priout of the private sector and did nothing about inflation because it was entirely home grown. Devaluation will not help either, while the inflation rate in Australia remains higher than that of our competitors. Devaluation has not achieved anything especially as it is even less than the total of the upward valuation which the Government the yield deUberately set out to make. There has been unco-ordinated policy. There are more commissions, task forces and inquiries e than a person could count, using everyfingerand toe of every member of this House. All of these had bodies are totally unco-ordinated. The Industries Commission is going in one direction, the Prices Justification Tribunal is going in a different direction and the Trade Practices Commission is going in another direction. AU the task advisors-the multiplicity of advisers that and Ministers have-hav e not achieved any coordinated policy. The Industries Assistance Commission as set up by this Government has F. forgotten what the word 'assistance' means. The Now IAC is now saying to the Government: 'Will you to please have a co-ordinated poUcy'. Here is an outside independent body saying to the Government: 'For goodness' sake, have a co-ordinated The IAC made a submission to the Royal Commission into the Australian Public Service in exactly those terms. It said that the Government and should develop a common and explicit framework of poUcy objectives. Manufacturing needs confidence; manufacturing needs certainty and the Government should state clearly its objectives and policies. It has totally failed to do so. It of is no good the Deputy Prime Minister trying to be all things to all men, aU countries and all people. What has he achieved? Absolutely nothin dising. If he has not the power in Cabinet and up Caucus, then he ought to abandon his attempts. is what What we want is a poUcy statement now, not after the Jackson report. The Opposition is very downconcerned that no manufacturer as such is a member of the Jackson Committee. Mr Jackson the of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd, is a very to eminent man, but where is the actual manufacturer who should be a member of the Committee. Where on that Committee is the representative House of a small business? He is just not there. We have positive proposals. I want to make it clear that we are committed to growing efficient manufacturing industry but we first need to get the economyright.No tariff cut should be made without full consideration; there must be consistency of tariff making. There must be certainty for long term investment; there must be investment incentives to manufacturing industry and small businesses must be encouraged. There are 250,000 of them in Australia, 90 per cent of which are manufacturing companies employing half the Australian work force and producing 40 per cent of manufacturing output. What we want is a smaU business bureau in the department of Manufacturing Industry. This idea too has been stolen by the Labor Party.",37

I would have much more faith in what he has to say if he were prepared give somebody else just a Uttle bit of credit. This afternoon we have heard from him small edition of what we heard last night. Indusview try is depressed, he said. The truth is that parts of industry are depressed and some parts are not. Industry is important, industry is important; industry is important for reasons of employment, for reasons of welfare and for reasons of exports. It is important for the reasons that he said. Anyone from the Government side of the House, concerned as we are for the maintenance of employment and the Uving standards of the Australian people, will recognise that it is primarily through private industry, where three-quarters of the Australian work force are employed, that employment and Uving standards are maintained. The Leader the Opposition says that it is solely because this Government's decisions that everything gone wrong. That is what he says; that is the essence ofit.",38
63,Mr ANTHONY,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,That is true. Mr MCLeay-That is right.,38
64,Dr JF CAIRNS,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"The interjections around the House confirm what I have had to say what the Leader of the Opposition said. But is aridiculous,inadequate explanation of what has occurred. What has happened in Australia is the result of an economic process, and that economic process is worldwide. Unemployment is rising in Australia and it is high. Unemployment is high everywhere else. (Opposition members inteijecting)",38
65,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition was heard in comparative silence and I demand that the Deputy Prime Minister be heard in silence.,38
66,Dr JF CAIRNS,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"Unemployment in Australia is at an actual figure of 2.5 per cent, adjusted 3.2 per cent. Comparablefigurestoday other parts of the world are: Canada, 5.3 per Umted States of America, 6 per cent; the Republic of Germany, 3.8 per cent; the United Kingdom, 4 per cent; Italy, 4.5 per cent; and Japan, where thefigurehas doubled in the quarter, 2 per cent. I have been in half a no dozen countries where the unemployment rate is more than 15 per cent. I have seen the effects of I have seen industries that are in Pardifficulties in Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong-the textUe, electronics and building They are in exactly the same situation as they are in here, except that in some of those to countries unemployment is more than 10 per cent and people are starving in the streets. Unemployment is serious if only half a dozen people a are out of work. But from a national point of and an international point of view unemsome ployment in Australia is trivial in comparison with unemployment in other countries-absolu he said. Of course tely trivial. We have heard a lot about growth. There are aU official Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentfiguresrelating to growth. We have been told that industry in Australia is terribly depressed. Some sections of industry are in difficulty; others are not. But the official OECD forecasts of growth for 1975 indicate these rates of growth: Canada 2% per cent; the United States of America, minus VA per cent; Japan, 2 of per cent; France, 3 per cent; the Federal of RepubUc of Germany, 1V4 per cent; Holland, has minus VA per cent; United Kingdom, 1 per cent; New Zealand, 3 per cent; and in Australia, 2% per cent. Australia is in a good condition compared with any other country mentioned in that table. In the last month the car industry in the United States has retrenched 102,000 people. The Fiat company has retrenched 70,000, the about Audi company in Germany 30,000, and the that Volkswagen company in Germany, 14,000. Retrenchments are far more extensive than in Australia, both absolutely and proportionately. If one examines these unemployment and growth figures and conditions in those particular industries, one sees that the position that the Leader of the Opposition spoke about as though it was only an Australian condition caused by the Australian Government is actually a world wide situation. It is part of an economic process. The Australian Government is not the cause. I should not think that even the Leader of the Opposition would suggest that the Australian Government is the cause of the retrenchment of 102,000 workers in the American automotive industry or that the Australian Government is the cause of 10 per cent unemployment in Hong Kong, S.3 per cent in Canada, and 6 per cent in the United States of America. The Australian Government is not the cause of that situation. What is happening is a world-wide process and, as everyone in the outside world reaUses, it is a more serious economic difficulty than the world has experienced for nearly half a century. Unless a person is capable of reaUsing that this is an international problem he will never come up with a policy or action capable of deaUng with it. This is a world-wide problem, but the Australian Government can do something both to moderate inflation and to prevent unemployment. How can we moderate inflation? Although inflation is running at 20 per cent, the Leader of the Opposition never mentioned it in his speech. Is he not concerned about inflation or is he concerned only to exaggerate unemployment and blame the Australian Government for all of it as though it exists only in this country and nowhere else? Inflation has to be understood before it can be dealt with. Inflation is the excess of income demand for goods over the supply of goods. Income demand rose in Australia in 1971-72 because of international factors. There was a great inflow of funds from overseas. Exports rose by $2,000m and capital inflow by $3,000m and on the basis of that situation there was a great credit expansion in Australia which the Leader of the Opposition, at that time the Treasurer, did nothing to restrain. There was an inflationary boom. Inflation is not an accident; it is understandable. Incomes, demand and money had to be regulated if inflation was to be reduced but for 18 months the previous Government did nothing, desperate as it was to win back the support it had lost under the MCMahon-Snedden coalition. It went along with inflation. It allowed the Mainlines to boom. It allowed these pyramids, which are based on very Uttle cash, to inflate land values and put up building costs enormously. It aUowed the inflationary boom to be released in Australia and did nothing to deal with it. Would Mr Snedden have rejected any kind of credit squeeze? Would he have allowed that inflationary boom to continue forever? And what about the professor of economics, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards), who sits on the front bench? Is he against any kind of credit restriction in an inflationary period like that? Would he have done nothing to restrict credit? I know that some honourable members opposite are interested in another kind of squeeze, but I am talking about monetary policy. Would they not have done anything to increase imports with the great shortage of goods? Would they have done nothing to appreciate the value of the Australian doUar? If these things had not been done by this Government-the y were radical policies in Australia's history-inflatio n would have been 10 per cent greater than it is now. If inflation is to be checked in circumstances Uke that-unfortunatel y it had to be done 18 months or 2 years later than it should have been done-som e depression of industry and some unemployment unfortunately must occur. What the Government does about depression in industry and unemployment is to end it here and now. I emphasise that this is a matter of judgment.",38
67,Mr HOWARD,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,And you have it?,39
68,Dr JF CAIRNS,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"The honourable member has never shown much judgment. If reflation starts too soon we will get back into inflation and more unemployment. The Australian Government has begun reflation and no other government in comparable countries has gone as far as we have gone. Certainly the reflation can be more precise. I do not say that our policy is perfect. Last night I think the Leader of the Opposition made some useful remarks about monetary pohcy, but what is he doing? He is refusing or falling to analyse inflation and unemployment because he wants to attribute them to the fault of the Government. He sees no further than that. He is claiming that the Government is solely responsible and therefore he has no adequate analysis of unemployment and inflation. He has no idea of what causes them if he thinks the Government has caused them. If he has no idea of what causes inflation he cannot produce a policy to deal with it. In fact, he is offering a policy that may be inflationary, particularly on the monetary side. Presumably he would reduce taxation by a great deal more than we have done but one does not have to get past the first chapter of any economics text book-the Leader of the Opposition has at least seen the cover of one-t know that if a reduction of taxation is a signincant inflationary factor. It is a matter of judgment and no one here or elsewhere has any claim that his judgment is perfect. I think his policy, insofar as it differs from ours, is unacceptable on the expenditure side. He keeps on bleating: 'Cut government expendihave ture'. But cut it where? Whenever runs for cover. We hear the cry: 'Cut it by 8 per cent here and 8 per cent there'. We know what would be the consequences of a policy of this kind. Government expenditure cannot be cut nificantly without cutting expenditure on education, health and well being. That is no way to deal with the problem of inflation, unemployexaggeration ment or anything else. Labor will not cut the standards of the people in and welfare because of economic pressures. We have suffered too much from this depression mentality-fro m this prescription for tragedy-to take it over now. There was no mention by the Leader of the Opposition of wages or industrial sumably he does not see this as any kind of factor in the unemployment or inflationary situation. He asks us for a wages policy, but what sort of wages policy does the Leader of the Opposition have? He does not express any opinions one way or the other about indexation. He does not seem to be aware of the fact that in countries where there has been a reasonable kind of relationship between the trade union movement and the government, inflation is less than He does not seem to be able to reaUse the importance of this signincant attempt to reach what is called a social contract between the workers and the Government. He does not know that the indices of increases in the cost of living are lower where that has been achieved. I know what would happen if the Leader of the Opposition were the Prime Minister and the government were drawn from the other side of the House; there would be a confrontation with the trade union movement. We are unhappy about any kind of industrial stoppage or any kind of Nobody wants them. Their incidence is too high in Australia today. But if the Government was changed, the incidence of stoppages and strikes would double within a quarter because a governare ment drawn from the Opposition would adopt poUcy of wage freeze. It would go back to the penal powers. We would have trade union leaders in goal. We would have a confrontation which would wrack this country from one end to the other. It is alreadv happening There is an insurrection in the streets in Italy. o People in those countries have grave doubts goes too far it about the future.  Dr. J . F. CAIRNS-I would be keeping it in order, and I would not be getting any help from you. My role in insurrections in this country is to make them peaceful, and it always has been. I never had any help from you to try to make we ask him he them peaceful. ",39
69,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"Order! The honourable sigmember for Kooyong will cease interjecting. Dr. J . F. CAIRNS- I can claim without any to have done far more to keep order in the streets in this country than all of you social security, health combined. Mr Hodges-Who is responsible for the mess? Dr. J . F. CAIRNS-You were responsible for the mess by sending young Australians to Vietnam. Almost every young Australian in this country was against the former Government berelations. Precause of that. Mr Hodges-Wit h whom does the blame Ue?",40
70,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"Order! The blame will lie with you if you are not careful. Dr. J . F. CAIRNS-We came out of Vietnam and we have peace in that respect in this country. That is why it happened. The Parties opposite were responsible for that-yo u who were not game to go yourselves but were wUling to send it is elsewhere. everybody else. I say that if we had any change of government here, the conditions that the Leader of the Opposition has criticised and has the right to criticise-w e should take full note of his criticismwould be doubled in their intensity in the space of a quarter. You would not get any reduction in unemployment; you would get an increase in unemployment under a government drawn from the other side of the House. You would not get any less inflation; you would get more inflation strike. because every prescription that honourable members opposite have given to us in their policy is an inflationary prescription likely also to produce unemployment. Conditions in Australia difncult. But they are easier and better in this a country than in any other comparable country.

120,Mr ANTHONY,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"The Opposition has brought forward this matter of public because of its very great concern for secondary industries and the significant pan or which they play in employing Australians. About 28 per cent of the Australian work force is associated with the manufacturing industry and be 28 per cent of the Gross National Product is produced by this very important segment. So the importance of this industry just cannot be I think that all honourable members-at least those on this side of the House-were rather amazed at the performance of the Deputy Prime (Dr JF CAIRNS) who treated this matter as being very insignificant. In fact he seems to think that an unemployment rate of about 3.2 per cent or 190,000 people is trivial. The Deputy Prime Minister used the words: 'We have to stan to accept that unemployment is necessary'. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party is accepting now that unemployment has to be pan of anti-inflationary measures. I hope that every Labor man and every unemployed person reads what the Deputy Prime Minister had to say. It was also quite amazing to hear the manner in which the Deputy Prime Minister spoke this afternoon. I have never heard him speak in such a frantic way. He spoke almost as if he were leading some moratorium march. It is obvious that tensions are building up within himself and his own Party at their mismanagement, ineptitude and inability to cope with the situation which the Government itself has produced. It is no use for the Deputy Prime Minister to shelter behind the international situation. He is cowering behind a mass of statistics of other countries. This country should never have suffered the unemployment that is now taking place. We have not been subject to the same circumstances to which other countries have been subject. We have not been involved with the energy crisis to nearly the same degree as other countries because we have been 70 per cent self-sufficient with the cheapest fuel in the world. Dr Gun-You would soon fix that, wouldn't you?",42
121,Mr ANTHONY,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"Well , we would at least review it. We would not put ourselves at the mercy of the Arab States, as the Government will do with its negative policies. We have some of the cheapest steel in the world. Our copper and food are cheaper than those of most comparable countries. It is a lot of nonsense to use the international situation as an excuse for the position in which Australia is now placed. I wonder how investors would have reacted if they had heard the darling of Wall Street perform today? I am sure that the distressed way in which the Deputy Prime Minister acted today would never engender any confidence in them to invest in Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister completely ignored the situation in which manufacturing industries find themselves and he completely ignored the consequences of tariff cuts, devaluation and all of these other matters. Unemployed workers from secondary industries have a lot to be worried and concerned about in what the Deputy Prime Minister said today. I think that those people who have the opportunity of reading what has been said this afternoon will agree that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) put forward a strong and constructive speech outlining the concern that the Opposition has, because there is great concern. The Deputy Prime Minister said that some secondary industries are doing well and some are doing badly. I suppose anyone can make a generalised statement like that. We know from the surveyfiguresthat are now being compiled by the Department of Manufacturing Industry that the prospects are the gloomiest since the surveys were first conducted. Other surveys conducted by the Bank of New South Wales and the ANZ bank indicate great concern as to how secondary industries are to cope in future. I think the difficulties of manufacturing industry can be summed up in this way. There has been a very sharp rise in imports; profits are being squeezed by rising wages and costs, and by the activities of the Prices Justification Tribunal; interest rates are very high, and finance is hard to get; domestic and export demand have slackened; and unchecked inflation is eating the heart out of the economy. The net result of all this is a fall in profitability, a consequent fall in capacity to invest and capacity to employ people. The Government, after producing an extremely serious situation in the manufacturing sector and badly hurting many of Labor's strongest supporters-the people in the work force-ha s at last begun to show some faint signs of understanding about what is happening, and why it is happening. There has been a slight reduction in the rate of company tax, but there needs to be a great deal more to engender any confidence. All companies, in all sectors, should be told that there is no need to comply with the requirement that they pay the quarterly tax instalments which are going to place tremendous strains on liquidity. The Government's adamant, if not dogmatic, approach to 3 revaluations of the currency last year did enormous harm. The Government must do something about the damage being done to industry as a result of its arbitrary and indiscriminate across-the-board tariff cut of last year. This cut failed to do what it was supposed to do-that is, to keep down prices. All it did was to damage Australian industry and put many thousands out of work. But the Deputy Prime Minister says that this is a trivial matter. I am not suggesting a blanket reinstatement of the previous tariff levels. What I am suggesting is selective action to repair the damage caused by the Government's inept handling of this matter. There must be more encouragement of export. There must be encouragement of investment in industry. Industry must be able to get investment finance on better terms. The tragedy is that, whatever the Government does-and there is really no sign that it intends to do anything more than the meagre amount it has done already-the outlook for the immediate future is by no means encouraging. Thefirstquarter of next year seems certain to see inflation at a rate of about 25 per cent. Unemployment then could be as high as 300,000 in March. I suppose that is going to be trivial too when they have to face up to it. There is no sign of increasing domestic demand. World demand will remain slack. World commodity prices are unlikely to pick up to any degree. Liquidity will remain a problem, and interest rates are unlikely to fall. All in all, the picture is a depressing one, and the responsibility largely rests with this Government. Of course, when we have tried to draw the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) to these things in the past, he has accused us of being rumourmongers, prophets of doom, and saboteurs of confidence. Yet now we have the Prime Minister himself talking about the worse economic prospects for 40 years. We have the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions predicting the worse depression in Australia since the thirties. Who now are the saboteurs of confidence, the rumour-mongers, the prophets of doom? How can there be any certainty, and confidence that the Government knows which way it is going, when we are seeing so many somersaults and about-faces and changes of gear? We have the Deputy Prime Minister, the erstengage while foe of foreign investment, the champion of Australia for Australians, now running around the world, cap in hand, pleading-crawling-fo foreign money to try to get the Australian economy out of the mess this Government has got itself into. We have the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron), that former battler against the evil, sinister world of big ness, now self-righteously shouting to the world the virtue-the absolute necessity-for business and industry to make profits. How on earth anyone have the sUghtest confidence that this Government has the faintest idea of where it is going when you have these backflips going on all the time in the 3-ring circus caUed the Whitlam Government? We even have the Prime Minister writing the Prices Justification Tribunal telling it squeezing compames so hard they cannot find the money to re-invest. What an admission. What an admission now after about 12 months of practically crippUng them. What a shambles this Government is in. After nearly 2 years of industry bashing, the larrikins of the Labor Party are beginning-bu t only beginning-to come to their senses, and to reaUse how much damage they have caused. The trouble is that there is no easy way to repair that damage. The government now has to knuckle down to the job of trying to patch up the mess as best it can, and to carry manufacturing industry through the coming tough times to avoid the impact and social fallout that will be the result of its poUcies. Dressed-up dole schemes, Uke NEAT and RED, are aU very well, and all very necessary. This Government has a lot to answer for for the 'trivial amount' of 190,000 unemployed now and the 300,000 there will be next year. But as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, it is not trivial at all. It concerns the lives of people; it concerns industry. If we have an opportunity we will instil a bit of confidence back into the Australian community. We will encourage savings and the capacity to reinvest. That is what this nation desperately needs. I doubt whether it wiU ever get it with a Minister for Manufacturing Industry telling industry what it ought to do, giving it Uttle lectures from day to day on an academic approach to these problems.",43
122,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,Order! The right honourable member'stimehas expired.,44
123,Mr ENDERBY,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"It is understandable that speakers in this chamber should in debating points, but on a matter as serious as this it is perhaps to be regretted that Opposition spokesmen try to score points all the r time. For example, the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) in his speech referred to unemployment in Australia being trivial compared to what it is overseas. That is all he meant. He stressed the seriousness of it generally to any Labor busigovernment but the triviality of Australia's unemployment compared to what it is overseas. His words were taken completely out of context and can twisted as would cheap schoolboy debaters. The seriousness with which the Opposition takes the point can be appreciated if one reflects on the fact that since this Parliament resumed in this sessional period on 17 September some 14 matters of public importance have been raised to for discussion. As Minister for Manufacturing to stop Industry I have watched each day come and go waiting for some kind of reference to manufacturing industry to indicate that some concern was being felt by Opposition spokesmen about it. Fourteen occasions came and 14 occasions went and today, after a long delay, the Opposition suddenly has got around to it. It suddenly has discovered that there is a thing called manufacturing industry. As long ago as the last election campaign in April and May of this year, this Government was concerned about what was happening to cenain aspects of manufacturing industry and in particular the textile industry. During the election campaign the Government sent a reference to the Textiles Authority on the subject. It was a 30-day reference which was acted upon promptly and which resulted in voluntary restraints being imposed on overseas exporters of certain types of textile articles to Australia, with considerable effect. That was in April of this year but, if one peruses the records of this House and the questions that have come forward from Opposition spokesmen who have now belatedly suddenly discovered a thing called manufacturing industry, one will find a benign indifference and a benign neglect of the importance of the subject. As the Opposition spokesmen try to single areas and, without saying what should be done, say: 'Do something, do something, do somethey thing', directing remarks to this Government which has done more in its short term of office than any other previous government ever did in Australia, they bring disrepute upon themselves. I just remind some of the honourable members who sit opposite of their attitudes to some things. For example, one hears references to cent reduction in tariffs that was made as long ago as July 1973- a fine decision made properly and not criticised at the time. I remind the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden), who sits opposite, that he was given the opportunity in July 1973 in a radio broadcast to make ment and he did not utter a single word of dissent from that proposal. Today it is fashionable common and the in thing to say: 'Ah, you should not have done that'. When he had the opporand tunity to dissent, there was not a single word dissent. The Opposition front bench spokesman on these matters, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards), accepted the across the board tariff reductions at that time as being useful weapon against inflation. I can direct to the passage in Hansard if he wishes me to so. One can find such examples wherever one looks. I remind honourable members that as this Government took steps and action on economic matters during 1973 they were universally applauded. How often was it said: 'No one can you likefault the economics of the Whitlam Labor Government'? But now, because of world-wide trends which are affecting most of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, and we are only one of twentythreeMr Lucock-What about New Zealand?",44
124,Mr ENDERBY,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"Yes , including New Zealand. Honourable members opposite argue as though Australia is an island not related to the rest of the world and not sharing the international trading patterns which affect the rest of the world as well. May I put to honourable members some information coming from such an authoritative source as the Secretariat of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of which Australia is part. It is estimated that there will be Uttle, if any, economic growth-on e of the symptoms that affects Australia at the moment-in any of the OECD countries during 1975. We are not Robinson Crusoe; we share this world with a lot of other countries and they all share these problems. According to the same source, consumer prices are out rising rapidly in aU the OECD countries. In Japan and the United Kingdom, for example, are rising at the annual rate of 23 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. In those countries unemployment is very widespread. It stood at 6 per cent of the work force of the United States in September; in Canada it was 5 per cent; in West Germany it was more than 3 per cent; and in all 3 countries, as in the other OECD nations, it is the 25 per expected torisestill funher. I repeat that the situation that the world has now appUes in Australia and it is not of any assistance to honourable members in this debate to forget what were the troubles last year. There a comwas a world-wide commodity boom. We all know it. There was excess liquidity throughout and the entire world. Money was coming out of the pores of the trading nations in excess quantities the explanations for it can be put at various of doors. Some people say that it was the result of the way in which the Vietnam war was financed. So be it if it was; it may have been caused by other matters. But the symptom was clear. As our a Treasurer (Mr Crean) once put it, Australia was him left completely defenceless by the previous do Government against those developments which were taking place overseas. We had nothing like a variable deposit rule or a proper exchange rate for the Australian dollar, and the foreign money poured into Australia creating such an element of excess demand that inflation took off in the latter pan of 1972 helped-aide d and abetted if",45
125,Mr ANTHONY,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,Why is there inflation now?,45
126,Mr ENDERBY,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"I shall come to that. It was aided and abetted by the Budget of the previous Government in 1972 which had a deficit of $660m, as the then Government tried to bribe itself through the 1972 election. This Government has tried successfully to put right the injustices of so many years of neglect in social services, health, hospital benefits, redress for the cities and so forth. The Government has not lost sight of the need to encourage industry. Indeed, one of our first measures, I remind honourable members, was the creation of the Industries Assistance Commission. There could be no finer charter of what this Government stands for than the language we wrote into the Act to establish the Comnussion, which had the full hearted support of the Liberal Party notwithstanding that the Australian Country Party saw in it the danger to certain interests of privilege that it sometimes in reality represents. But with the support of the Liberal Party this Government, in section 22 of the Industries Assistance Commission Act, said: The Commission shall have regard to the desire of the Australian Government, in pursuing the general objectives of national economic and social regional development, to improve and promote the well being of the people of Australia, with full employment, stability in the general level of prices, viability in external economic relauons, conservation of the natural environment and rising and generally enjoyed standards of living . . . In that respect we have been largely successful, notwithstanding the obstructionism of the Senate.",46
127,Mr ANTHONY,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,The Minister has not said one word about manufacturing industry.,46
128,Mr ENDERBY,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"Have I not? Just listen to me. We set up the Industries Assistance Commission and we recognised that the form, the structure, of industry in Australia was not at its optimum, as the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) has been heard to say on other occasions in other places but rarely in this House. I have read some of the speeches he has made to bodies like the Manufacturing Industry Advisory Council. We began a program of structural change. The Leader of the Austrahan Country Party has talked about dole schemes. There is nothing to do with the dole in a scheme like the assistance scheme for country towns, which will assist- I emphasise the word 'assist'-firm s in country towns, in wi-.ich employment opportunities and investment opportunities are perhaps not as widespread as they might be, to move into more viable areas. There is nothing of a dole mentaUty about a structural adjustment board which will seek to improve",46

135,Mr CREAN,MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Honourable members will recall that my colleague the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt), on behalf of the Australian Government, announced on 27 August that the Australian Wool Corporation would operate a minimum-floor-pric e equivalent to 250c per kilo clean for 21 micron wool during the 1974-75 season and that the Government would guarantee sufficient funds for this purpose. Honourable members will also recall that, in addition to the $ 13m provided in the Budget for advances to the Corporation, Parliament, in September last, made available $150m by way of a special appropriation under the Wool Marketing (Loan) Act. The purpose of this Bill is to amend that Act to enable me, on behlf of the Australian Government, to make further loans of up to an additional $200m to the Corporation. Thus the total provision under the Act would be increased to $350m. Proceeds of loans to the Corporation under the Act are available forfinancingpurchases of wool at auction-includin g tender-and for the making of advances to growers whose wool is withheld from the market by the Corporeffect ation.

137,Dr PATTERSON,DIARY ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM,"The amendment of the Marginal Dairy Farms Agreements Act 1970 the last session was essentially an intermediate step pending introduction of the present compreeral hensive legislation. This Bill provides for repeal of the Marginal Dairy Farms Agreements Act 1970-1974 and incorporates those elements of the program brought into effect by that Act. contains a savings clause to provide the necesspleased ary transitional arrangements between the two matter. pieces of legislation. As in the Marginal Dairy Farms Agreements Act and for reasons again explained in the preamble to the present Bill, assistance to be provided under the 2-year dairy adjustment program from 1 July 1974 to 30 1976 will be exempted from the need for reference to the Industries Assistance Comscheme mission. The question of Government assistance to the dairy mdustry after 30 June 1976 has already beenreferredfor inquiry and report the Industries Assistance Commission. I turn now to the new features of the Bill. title of the Bill reflects the significant broadening of the former marginal dairy farms reconstrucDebate tion scheme, namely the transition from a scheme providing limited assistance income segment of the industry to a program with broad appeal for a signincant part of the first time. industry. The expression 'marginal dairy farm' in the 1970-1974 Act has been replaced by 'uneconomic dairy farm' so as to describe curately the wider range of farms whose owners may be eligible for assistance under the program. There are 2 changes of substance in the Bill. Firstly it will enable any dairy farmer to be sisted to convert torefrigeratedbulk milk delivoffice ery. Under the Marginal Dairy Farms Agreereview ments Act interest free loans for the purchase and installation of refrigerated vats were tricted to the owners of marginal dairy farms. The second changerelatesto assistance dairy factories. Clause 16 of the Bill provides the making of loans to dairy factories in cases where alterations are required to be made to land, premises or where plant and equipment have to be purchased in order to provide facilities fbr by suppliers to change-over to supplying Uvesrefrigerated bulk milk to the factory. It is by grants for the write-off of intended that loans will be available for delivery to develop more readily and receival facilities. However, there is proloans vision in the Bill for assistance with the installaand tion of processing equipment in special circumstances and subject to the consent of the Australian and State Ministers or delegates authorbeing ised to act on their behalf. Assistance to a dairy apply to factory will be provided where finance is not readily available from banking or other normal commercial sources on reasonable terms. in The State governments have undertaken to administer the dairy adjustment program. SevStates are already operating those parts of the the program authorised by the Marginal Dairy Farms Agreements Act. The full co-operation of the States is essential for the successful adminisIt tration of a scheme of this nature and I am to acknowledge their assistance in this The Bill authorises the implementation of the the whole of the dairy adjustment program except in relation to assistance for displaced dairy factory June workers. That part of the program is being encompassed by the Government's general of adjustment assistance for structural change. In the last session the dairy adjustment program received the unanimous support of all by members of Parliament. It has been well received by the industry. This Bill will enable the Program to be put into effect at factory level as The well as on the farms. I commend the Bill. (on motion by Mr Nixon) adjourned. to the lowDEFENCE SERVICE HMS BILL 1974 Bill presented by Mr Les Johnson, and read a Second Reading more ac Mr LES JOHNSON (Hughes-Minister for Housing and Construction) (3.18)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. As honourable members will be aware one of the asfirst steps taken by the Government when it took in 1972 was to carry out a comprehensive of the war service homes scheme. The changes which were subsequently made by the resDefence Service Homes Act 1973 were the most significant since the enactment of the original to War Service Homes Act, which received the for royal assent on Christmas day 1918. The Government has carried out a further review of the the scheme and this Bill makes provision for a number of additional important changes in the scheme which are designed to improve substanflexible tially the borrowing arrangements under the ance scheme. Provision is made in the Bill for an increase in of the maximum loan to $ 15,000. The Government considers that this is necessary in view of increase in the cost of acquiring a home since the balance maximum loan was increased to $12,000 in tract of sale 1973. The Bill provides also for a liberalisation the eligibility provisions of the Act which will remove the restrictions which, since the inception of the scheme, have prevented single widowers with the necessary qualifying service from receiving assistance. A similar restriction relating to the granting of assistance to single and widowed females was removed last year. This amendment will remove all discrimination in the Defence Service Homes Act against single persons, thus giving full recognition to the ciple that defence service homes benefits are granted not only as a measure of repatriation, but also as a reward for service. The Bill contains limited provisions which enable the balance ofan existing loan to be made available for the acquisition of another property in special circumstances. Since the inception of the scheme in 1919 it has been the intention an eligible person shall be granted assistance under the scheme in respect of only one home. In conformity with this intention, the Act provides that the Director of Defence Service Homes shall not grant to any one person a loan in respect more than one property, except with the apnot proval of the Minister. Under the existing provisions of the Act, when a purchaser or borrower sells his defence home and discharges his liability, the amount received must be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and is not available for allocation towards the building or purchase of another home. While the Act empowers the Minister to approve the grant of assistance for another erty, the loan must be provided from the annual appropriation of funds for defence service homes. As a consequence, where a second loan is$12,000, approved, the funds available for applicants who have not previously been assisted under the scheme are correspondingly reduced. Although the policy is being administered more liberally and sympathetically than prior to December 1972, it has been necessary to be careIt ful and conservative in approving second loans in order not to jeopardise the interests of seeking initial loans. The Government feels there is a need for more arrangements which will enable the balof a loan to be transferred in special circumstances without adversely affecting the interests persons seeking assistance for thefirsttime. Accordingly provision has been made in the Bill the for a standing appropriation of moneys in the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the extent of the of the moneys outstanding under a conor advance under the Act paid to the Director, where, by virtue of an approval by the of Minister under section 19B and 20A of the Act, the Director has entered or enters into a further contract of sale or advance with that person in men and respect of another dwelling-house. In conformity with the intention of the scheme, the balance of an exisung loan will be made available for the acquisition of another home only in special circumstances. In general, approvals will be limited to cases where the appliprincant is compelled to move from his present defence service home through circumstances beyond his control. An apphcation for approval must be made before the first home is sold and the amount of assistance will ordinarily not will exceed the balance of the existing loan. The Bill provides for an extension of the definition of'holding' in the Act to include a lease that on Norfolk Island from Australia or from the Administration of the Territory granted for a term of not less than 28 years. At present the only leasehold interests on Norfolk Island which can be accepted under the Defence Service Homes of Act are leases in perpetuity or leases for a term less than 99 years. This has caused some difficulty as leases on Norfolk Island are normally limited to 28 years. service The Government has reviewed the interest rate charged on loans made under the Act. The present rate of 3% per cent per annum was fixed in 1946. Since then, the long term bond rate has risen from 3V4 per cent to 9Vi per cent per annum. The Bill provides for an interest rate of 3% per propcent per annum to be charged to a purchaser or borrower in respect of a loan not exceeding $12,000. Where the amount of loan exceeds the Bill provides for interest to be charged at the prescribed rate in respect of that part of the loan which exceeds $12,000. Provision is also made for interest to be charged at the prescribed rate in respect of any additional loan made to a purchaser or borrower. is proposed that the prescribed rate shall be 2 per cent below the most favourable rate charpersons ged by the Commonwealth Savings Bank on housing loans. The most favourable rate at present is 9V4 per cent and accordingly the Bill provides that the prescribed rate of interest be 7V4 per cent per annum or such other rate may be prescribed. In reviewing the interest rate to be charged defence service homes loans, the Government noted that loans were being made to eUgible perthat sons such as widows, totaUy and permanently incapacitated pensioners, persons living on an age or invalid pension or small superannuation payment who ordinarily could not meet the gations of home ownership except under the cessional conditions presently provided in the Act. Provision has accordingly been made in Bill for the granting of a measure of reUef in tion to the instalments payable in cases where those instalments include an amount of interest at law.' calculated at a rate exceeding 3.7S per cent per annum and the Minister is satisfied it would cause hardship to the purchaser or borrower were required to pav the amount of instalments infuU. The Bill includes a number of other amendspecified ments to the Act which are either ofan adminisGuinea trative nature or are consequential upon the proposed changes in the interest rate provisions and other measures included in the Bill. The defence service homes scheme has been in operation for more than 55 years. During that time nearly 350,000 persons have been asmatters sisted under the scheme to become home owners. Since it took office in December 1972, the Government has liberalised and extended scope of the scheme and it can what it has done to provide homes for service and ex-service personnel under the scheme. The provisions of this Bill will enable the valuable contribution made in past years by the defence service homes scheme to the housing of the traUan people to be maintained and improved upon. I commend the Bill to the House.  journed. PAPUA NEW GUINEA BIIX (No. 2) 1974 Bill presented by Mr Morrison, and read a first time.",48

However the transfer of final control to Papua New Guinea within this framework will allow Papua New Guinea to give effect to its own policies and priorities in these matters, pohcies and priorities which in fact it is already formulating. As I have said, Australian policy is to enable Papua New Guinea to exercise authority in all matters of government before the formal step to independence, and these amendments are designed to give effect to this. Clauses 4 to 9 of the Bill relate to Part VI of the Papua New Guinea Act-the judicial system. With the transfer of authority over the Supreme Coun of Papua New Guinea, Part VI of the Act will be amended to provide for the funcuons now assigned to and powers held by the Governor General under sections 58 to 61 of the Act to be conferred on and exercised by the High Commissioner of Papua New Guinea. The High Commissioner will have responsibility for the appointment of the Chief Justice and such other judges and acting judges as are required and for other decisions relating to the qualifications of judges and to the tenure of judges' appointments. In line with these amendments the Governor General's instructions to the High Commissioner will require him to act on the advice of the Papua New Guinea Government in exercising his functions under Part VI of the Act. Sub-section 62A (6) of the Papua New Guinea Act at present authorises the Governor General sidered to disallow rules of court.

The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Judges' Pensions Act 1968-1973 to provide for the payment of pensions to persons who are or have been judges of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea (Papua New Guinea judges). This Bill has been prepared after consultation with the Papua New Guinea judges.

Such a judge who, not being otherwise entitled to a full pension, ceases to hold office a judge because his services are no longer required by the Papua New Guinea Government will receive a full pension irrespective of his length of service. If a judge leaves voluntarily fore completing the qualifying period of service, the judge will receive a pro rata pension based on the total of the years that he has served as a judge and the period of leave due to the judge on his retirement. If special circumstances exist, the Governor General may determine that a judge who would otherwise be entitled to a pro rata pension is nevertheless to receive a full pension. Clause 5 ensures that a judge pensions in respect of the same periods of service. It brings the existing provision in the Judges' Pensions Act up to date.

140,Dr FORBES,DEFENCE FORCE RETIREMENT AND,"The provisions of this Bill are confined to increasing defence forces retirement benefits and defence forces retirement and death benefits to compensate, suppose you would call it, for inflation. The method adopted is to apply the 16.2 per cent increase in average weekly earnings for the months ending 31 March this year to a notional consolidated revenue portion of the pension. This is done in Ueu of the automatic annual adjustment mechanism which was recommended by the Jess Committee and which the Government is committed to introducing but which it is still studying. The Opposition supports this Bill, but I would like to make a few comments on it. The first comment I make is that I wonder as whether, in the light of a situation which the Government admitted in its Budget of wage increases of over 20 per cent, this 16.2 per cent increase will be sufficient to protect the recipients beof these pensions against inflation. In fact, I am sure that it will not be sufficient. The pensioners wiU get further and further behind. I make this point because it adds force to the next point I want to make, that is, the importance which the Opposition attaches to the introduction of the automatic system of adjustment which presumably will cater more precisely for increases in costs and anticipated increases in costs than the present ad hoc method adopted by the will not receive 2 Government. There are 2 matters in which the Government is dragging its feet in the general area of defence It forces retirement benefits. The first is the area I have just been speaking of, that is, the failto introduce automatic adjustments to pendesions. It is more than Vh years since the Jess Committee recommended that automatic adjustments be made to pensions. I reaUse that the Bill Government has been looking at new proposals have been put to it and the effects their possible introduction may have on the future of the updating arrangements currently in force. But surely 2 years is a sufficient time to bring this sort of examination to a conclusion. such time as automatic adjustments are introduced, the pensioners under this scheme will be dependent on the whims of the Government to make annual adjustments. I ask the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) in replying to this debate to give the House a report of when he Second Reading believes it will be possible to introduce the automatic adjustments. The second matter on which the Government has been dragging its feet relates to the fact that it is now more than a year since the Minister announced-it was widely circulated in Service circles-that anomaUes had been revealed by the I appUcation of the new scheme, particularly in relation to officers who froze their contributions under the old scheme. He said then that the 12 anomaUes would be removed by the introduction of amending legislation, probably in the autumn session of Parliament. This statement was made last year. The autumn session has passed. He also stated that the benefits would be made retrospecmuch tive to 1 October 1972. In those circumstances would have been reasonable to expect that these amendments would be included in legislation introduced in November of 1974. Again, I hope the Minister will inform the House of the position in relation to that undertaking and those amendments when he replies to the debate. The main point that I wish to raise this afterThat noon relates to those people to whom, so far as I to am aware, the Minister has given no undertaking issues, except that automatic updating of pensions will lucky apply to them. I refer to the 8,000 or 9,000 penunder sioners who retired prior to October 1972 and sistant who are not included in the new scheme. very generosity of this new scheme-it is a Incidentally, generous one-highlight s the situation of these people. I cite the case of 2 officers whom I know personally. They are of the same rank and retired only a month apart. They retired a month apart purely because of an accident of birth. They both entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in the same year. They retired a month apart. But a result of that month's difference in retirement dates there is no less than $5,000 a year difference between the pensions that the two of I believe them receive. The reason for that of course is thatletter, one retired before 1 October 1972 and the other seems retired afterwards. I might add that the person tration. who retired first, and who is receiving $5,000 a year less in pension, over the period ofhis servicedifficult. for various reasons contributed in total more to portionately the scheme than the person on the higher lengths pension. I am informed- I have not been able to get any accurate assessment of this-that the disparity on the average between the pensions received under the 2 schemes taken overall-of course there will be individual exceptions-ma y well be of the order of 50 per cent. In other words, the pensions of people under the new scheme-thos e people in comparable circumstances and people who retired at the same rank-wil l be 50 per cent higher. Of course every time there is a percentagepUght increase such as the one contained in this Bill disparity widens. It has widened twice in the 2 years as a result of these 2 annual adjustments brought in by this Government. It is not as these people contributed less as a percentage their pay; in many cases they contributed more. Towards the end of their service some of them contributed much more. Indeed, it was the harddecision ship done to these people, particularly the who were subject to payments of very considerpeople able proportions of their salaries as contributions towards the end of their service, which led of the pressure to set up the Jess Comit mittee and the introduction of the new scheme. To demonstrate the point I am making about the difficulties suffered by some of these people, perhaps I could read a letter from a retired warrant officer living in Canberra. The letter states: Analysis of the copies of letters and replies forwarded under cover of my letteris, letters to the Minister for Defence. you dated 24 June 1974 will prove how specific questions - comment s made by me on down to earth dollar and cent do not receive tangible replies; in fact, some infer how I am, or, even more undiplomatic, how lucky those are the new scheme. I believe that the Minister or his aswho signs these replies has only a sketchy idea as to The what it means in actual pension rate. I do not believe that this is correct because I believe that the Minister knows a great deal about this scheme, particularly as he was a member of the Joint Select Committee on the Defence Forces Retirements Benefits Legislation. But nevertheless it describes the feelings of this warrant officer after he had been in receipt as of communications signed by the Minister for Defence or the Minister assisting the Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison). The letter continues: also that if hereadthe replies concurrently with the he would doubt if he was signing the correct paper. It a case of the Government being run by the adminisIt has reached a point where trying to get through is Most of the replies talk percentages, and that prowe are not badly off; also they go to great to pad out their letters, amplifying matters on which I have never criticised, complained about, or raised. I purely wanted to get home to him that my residual pension, after commuting one-third, is a taxable $19.43 (repeat $19.43) per week, with correspondingly poor widows pension in the event of my death. Replies that ' I haven't been badly done by percentagewise' doesn't comfort me or my wife, and doesn't increase my ability to pay bills. My ex-service friends receive similar replies. I would add that the increase we are talking about in this legislation will give that person, as I calculate it, an extra $2.49 a week but it will not bring his pension up to a princely sum. The Government's failure to do anything about the of these people contrasts strangely with its the generosity to other groups of existing pensioners last for whom the Commonwealth has responsibUity. I mention particularly the position of existing if pensioners when the parUamentary retiring alof lowances scheme was changed by this Government. I think that was a great step forward. One of the concomitants of a government's taking a to provide a scheme of that nature is its ones readiness to do the same in relation to other for whom it has responsibility and who are simUarly placed, because I contend that there to is no difference between a DFRB pensioner under the pre-October scheme and a parliamentary pensioner who retired, say, 20 years ago and whose pension under new legislation, regardless of the amount contributed, will automatically become 50 per cent or more than 50 per cent higher, depending on his period of service, of the existing parUamentary salary and any increases in parliamentary salary which might be granted in the future. I believe that if a government is ready to take a decision to treat one group of pensioners in a certain way, it should accept the consequence of that decision that it has an obUgation to treat other pensioners for which it has responsibUity in a similar way. It is difficult to know precisely what the Committee intended in relation to this group of people. Certainly these people came within the Committee's terms of reference. But from what I could discover from the odd reference in the report itself and talking to some members of the Committee, the pressure to make recommendations for a new scheme was such that it left the Committee insufficient time to sort out the complexities involved in making recommendations in respect of this particular group, except for the one recommendation that it made, relating to automatic updating. The point I am making is that, if my information is correct, the sence of specific recommendations in respect of this group does not mean that the Jess Committee beUeved that nothing should be done. Indeed in the comparable debate in May 1973, one member of the Committee, the previous honourable member for Isaacs, Mr Hamei, used words which lead me to the beUef that the Committee felt that something more should have been done about this particular group of pensioners. The Minister was a member of that Committee and perhaps when he replies in the debate he can give us his version of where the Committee was placed and what the Committee intended in respect of this group. The Opposition supports the suggestion which, I believe, has been put to the Minister by the remaining members of the Committee who are members of this Parliament and who are not Ministers-m y colleague, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett), Senator Maunsell, and Senator Devitt who is a member of the Minister's own Party. We support the suggestion made to the Minister by that group and by the Regular Defence Forces Welfare Association that a new committee be constituted to make recommendations in relation to servicemen who retired prior to October 1972.1 believe that it should be a select committee of the Parliament for 2 reasons: First, the original committee was a select committee and this could be looked upon as a continuation of work which that committee did not have time to complete and, secondly and perhaps more importantly, it was this Parliament which took the responsibility for providing the precedent in relation to Commonwealth pensioners when it passed the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Bill. Therefore, it should be a committee of this Parliament which faces up to the responsibility, the equity and the moral obUgations that the Parliament has, in the light of that particular decision of the Parliament, to other groups for whom the Commonwealth has responsibiUty. Irrespective Jess of whether the Minister agrees to set up such a select committee, the Opposition is committed, when it is returned to government, to set up such a committee to make recommendations in relation to equitable treatment for the pre-October 1972 pensioners. The Opposition supports the Bill.",52
141,Mr BONNETT,DEFENCE FORCE RETIREMENT AND,"Like the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), I support this Bill. There are a couple of comments I would Uke to make about it. This Bill is long overdue and, as far as I am concerned, is most ab- welcome. Why it has taken the Government so long to introduce it I shall never know because to my way of thinking it is a simple, straightforward and, incidentaUy, important enough matter to warrant earUer action. When the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) introduced the pension increases for defence force retirement benefit recipients 17 months ago he explained that those increases were an interim measure only and, in keeping with his promise, when he introduced the new Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (Pension Increases) Bill indicated that the increases would be automatic annual adjustments. Seventeen months later we are still operating under an interim measure and a permanent method of adjustment of ex-servicemen pensions is stUl being investigated. I wonder whether the Minister and his Department know that many ex-servicemen depend to a great degree on their pension to meet their living commitments and they have needed this increase. To have kept them waiting for 4 months or more to receive it seems to me to show a definite lack of concern for this section of our community. It is aU very well to say that the increases will be backdated to the first pay period in July, welcome though that is, but there was no need to embarrass for so long a period the ex-servicemen who depend on their pensions. I cannot accept the excuse put forward by the Minister for not introducing permanent adjustment arrangements. He said that all retired government employees should receive comparable treatment and that this is the Government's aim. I have no quarrel with that suggestion but I do not accept that the matter is so complex that it cannot be implemented without further inquiries. How much more time does the Government need to bring in the required legislation? It has beenfiddlingaround with this matter for approximately 18 months, trying to say that DRFB pensions will be the subject of automatic annual adjustments and not the subject of special legislation introduced each year, and which will be introduced at the Government's convenience. The Minister informed us that legislation will be introduced next year to provide for the future permanent methods of adjustment but, in view of the messing about that has been going on in regard to this matter since May 1973, I will believe it when I see the Minister introduce it. The matter of pension increases is not the only one which is vexing me and service personnel who retired prior to 1 October 1972. For instance, there is the surplus of funds mentioned in the fourth quinquennial report. At the last time of asking, the Minister informed me that the actual amount of surplus had not been decided. Yet the report indicates that on the basis of the old Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Fund the surplus of assets over liabilities is $3,065,000 in respect of pre-1959 pensioners, $11,828,000 in respect of pre-1959 contributors and a net deficiency of $544,000 in respect of post-1959 contributors and pensioners combined. If that information is available, surely it would not be too difficult for the actuary to arrive at an exact figure and surely it would not be too difficult for the Government to decide what to do with the surplus. Will the Government distribute the surplus among the contributors, as has been done previously, or will it sock it away in Consolidated Revenue? I remind the Government that this is contributors' money that it is fiddling around with. If the Government were to repeal the old Act and place every recipients of a DFRB pension under the new benefits scheme I would understand its wanting to put the surplus in Consolidated Revenue. But if it intends to retain the old scheme the surplus should be distributed among those who have contributed. How much more time does the Government need to make up its mind? Does it need another year or two, if it is still the Government? I can assure the Minister and the House that when we return to government there will be an end to this procrastination. As I said previously, many anomalies exist under the old DRFB scheme which are vexing the retired servicemen and of which I know the Minister is conscious. I well remember the Minister when he was in Opposition saying how he had plugged for a joint select committee to be formed to investigate the old scheme and to come up with a new, simple, straightforward scheme. Therefore he must be aware of the anomaUes that still exist in the old scheme. But now the boot is on the other foot. Is he content with the old scheme as is, now that the then Opposition is the present Government? An investigation by a joint committee into the anomalies that exist is required just as much as it was necessary previously. In fact, in the light of the new scheme benefits, it is even more necessary now. If the Government is fair dinkum in its expressed concern for the welfare of these ex-service pensioners it would have that joint committee on the job now. I mentioned the boot being on the other foot. Now I am plugging for that committee to be formed as the Minister did. The terms of reference for the committee will be on the Minister's desk this week. I am sure that if the Minister really wanted to do so he could persuade his colleagues that such a committee is warranted, for they too must know that the situation applying to DFRB pensioners warrants investigation. I will go even further and inform the Minister that, when we become the Government, that joint committee to investigate the anomaUes existing now in the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act will be formed immediately. We are committed to this; it will be done. I have no desire to delay the passage of this Bill through the House. As I said, I welcome it. I know that pensioners and recipients of ex-service benefits will welcome it also. It has been delayed long enough. Accordingly, I support the Bill.",54
142,Mr SULLIVAN,DEFENCE FORCE RETIREMENT AND,"I rise to speak in support of the Bill. I think it provides only due and proper recognition of the service given to this country by the men and women concerned. I am certain that the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) is aware of that just as much as I am. I think I could quote perhaps not from his words but from his intention when he said it was felt that the demands imposed on servicemen and the distinctive nature of their work warranted incorporation of their retirement benefits in a special scheme. I think this is a most important point which can be overlooked when we speak about the pension rights of servicemen and servicewomen. They do have dbtinctive work which is entirely different from that of any other section of the community. Because they do not have the opporthese tunity to complain to seek the conditions of vice that they would want in the job they have do, I believe compensation must be made for those circumstances after retirement. This is why from it is necessary that we recognise the work done way. The by these men and women when they give service the one referred to this country. That service is far different from the service given by a public servant in Canberra. I suppose most pubhc servants in this city would never at their jobs without a collar and tie and would never be expected to work in conditions other than those suitable for the work they have to do. The serviceman is never quite certain what his working conditions will be. I speak now of the bulk of servicemen; I do not speak of those few who are perhaps lucky enough to see some of their service here in Canberra. I speak of the jority who on occasions sleep in the most palling conditions because they must sleep in those conditions. I speak of those men and women who on occasions work for long hours in excess of any normal hours of work sought from men or women. Because there can be no recogniare tion given to this type of work and to the ditions during their service, I beheve it is vital that we recognise these aspects when they retire. Consequently, I support this Bill to the full. The Minister would be aware that anomalies do exist in the legislation, perhaps now not as far as the old legislation is concerned where the Speakeranomalies were felt by the servicemen themselves in their active service Ufe. I fects in the previous complex schemes which had been a constant source of grievance and unrest amongst a number of the armed Services, are now passed to the pensioners themselves. This is in respect of pensioners in receipt of prior to October 1972 as it is in relation to these people that the severe anomaUes exist today. I ask the Minister to investigate these anomahesundoubtedly he will-and where necessary take forthwith. appropriate action to overcome them. If he does reply this afternoon, I would Uke to hear him give some indication of when these investigations will take place. I ask him also to see whether he can get some word back from the actuary about the surplus money in the scheme. I think it was in March this year that a surplus was revealed. Questions were asked in July. We are now in November. There is still no word as to the amount involved or exactly what will be done with that surplus. find it just a little difncult to believe that there no urgency about this matter. I speak on behalf of the people who believe that there is urgency; are the people who need that money. I serwould Uke to hear when we can expect to get tosome reply on that problem from the actuary. I think pensioners all seek to have treatment the scheme provided in exactly the same most serious anomaly existing now is to by the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes) in which pensioners, a month apart in age, receive entirely different pensions. I do not think the civilian community be at large would accept this sort of thing with respect to age pensions. It would mean that those who reached the age at which they were entitled to receive the pension at a certain date in 1972 would receive a pension at a given amount and that those who quaUfied for the pension after that date would receive a pension far in excess of the pension paid to those who reached the elimagible age before that date. This anomaly must be aplooked at immediately. It must be overcome. The Country Party has much pleasure in supporting this Bill. Apart from those aspects that I have mentioned, the provisions of this legislation long overdue. The Bill is one which certainly conwUl be received with tremendous thanksgiving and pleasure by aU those ex-servicemen and ex-service women and by present serving men and women who can look forward intimeto something of a better deal.",55

I have noted that only Opposition speakers have taken part in the debate. I would like to hear some response from the Government to the points made by the Opposition speakers who I have participated in the debate. I do not know is whether the Standing Orders make any provision for this request to be met but I trust that the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) will at least respond by way of letter or in some other way and be courteous to that extent to those honourable members who have taken part in the debate.",56
145,Mr BARNARD,DEFENCE FORCE RETIREMENT AND," I do not want to detain the House. No one spoke in opposition to the Bill. As a matter of fact the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett), and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) who spoke in this debate all supported the Bill. It is true that they made one or two points about which there is some contention. Indeed I believe that those honourable members, particularly the honourable member for Herbert, know that there are problems that were considered by the Jess Committee of which he and I were members. These matters have been under consideration by my Department and me. Honourable members will also appreciate that it is not an easy matter to arrive at a cision on some of the anomalies that they know exist in the legislation. When I introduced the BillMr MCLeay-But you know",57

151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE FORCE RETIREMENT AND,Order! The Chair has been lenient in respect of the 2 speeches which have been made by the honourable member for Boothby and by the Minister on the third reading of this Bill. I have been lenient because of the circumstances relating to the second reading debate. I suggest that the Minister now be allowed to make'his comments without interjections.,57
152,Mr BARNARD,DEFENCE FORCE RETIREMENT AND,"Than k you Mr Deputy Speaker. I listened in absolute silence. I extended that courtesy to all speakers who have taken part in this debate. I do not want to delay the passage of this Bill because, as I have said, no one opposes it. I am not in disagreement with those who have indicated that there are some anomalies that have to be dealt with. The legislation which was introduced by me in 1973 gave immediate effect to the main recommendations of the Jess Committee of which the honourable member for Herbert was a member. If honourable members opposite want me to remind them of the situation that applied before the general elections of 1972 they will remember how the then Government procrastinated and could not make up its mind about the recommendations of the Jess Committee. We had the spectacle of the then Minister for Defence coming into the House and saying: 'We do not intend to introduce the legislation now to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee, but when we do make a decision-goodnes s only knows de- when that will be-w e will make it retrospective to 1 October 1972'. I said at the time that the then Government would not introduce the legislation and that I would introduce it. That is exactly what I did. I moved with speed to do so early in 1973. The introduction of this legislation was in keeping with the promise that we made during the 1972 election campaign when we said that we would introduce legislation to give effect to the Jess Committee's recommendations as soon as possible. I acknowledged when introducing the legislation that there were bound to be some anomalies and that they would be corrected in the future. I said that it would be better to adopt the main recommendations than to wait until we had thoroughly investigated what honourable members opposite are now referring to as some anomalies. I agree that there are some anomalies. That is why I said when introducing the legislation that if anomalies resulted from the legislation I would move to amend it. I have amended the legislation in one way today, that is, to provide an additional $3.2m, which is not an insignificant increase. I think that this has been acknowledged by honourable members. The question ofthose who left the Services before 1 October 1972 has been raised. Of course, this is a problem. I accepted the statement of the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn) when he was Minister for Defence that the legislation should be made retrospective to 1 October 1972. That is the reason why I chose that date and honourable members opposite will know how difficult it is to set a date. I did not have the prerogative to interpret what the Committee thought about those servicemen who had been discharged before 1 October 1972 because the Committee's main intention was to provide a new DFRB scheme. Is there any difference in the attitude which we adopted in regard to taking the previous Government's decision to make legislation retrospective to 1 October 1972 and, for example, its decision to stipulate that 35 years of age was the cut-off point for eligibility for a home savings grant? That is a decision which the previous Government had to make. I did not agree that the age limit should be 35 years. But I do not want to go over that argument. However, the same situation applies",57
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE FORCE RETIREMENT AND," commercial Order! Might I say to the Minister that he is ing things a little difficult in one sense in that question has been put and carried on the second reading stage of the debate. As I explained earlier, because of certain circumstances I have allowed the Minister a certain latitude to enable him to answer some comments made able members. However, unfortunately his speech is developing almost into a continuation of a second reading debate which has been gaginvestigation ged. I therefore suggest that the Minister restrict his remarks.",58
154,Mr BARNARD,DEFENCE FORCE RETIREMENT AND,"You have been very tionably generous, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I acknowlregarding edge that. I was asked to respond, although I not think it necessary, in regard to some matters. I shall conclude my remarks on this note: honourable members support the Bill that fore us. I acknowledge that it contains some anomaUes. I will move to correct those anomalies as soon as they have been thoroughly investraUan tigated. The question of those who left the vices before the new DFRB scheme was the introduced is one that deserves continuing consition's sideration and, I hope, early solution. Government will have to made a decision on matter. When a decision is reached it will announced at the appropriate time.",58

Bill read a third time. NA BILL 1974 Second Reading Debate resumed from 31 October on motion by Mr Morrison: That the Bill be now read a second time.  pose of this Bill is to establish the Australian Film Commission. The Opposition is not opposed to the estabhshment of the Commission and understands the need for the formation of such a body. After all, it was the Gorton Government in 1970 which first recognised the need to re-develop the Australian film industry. It formed the Australian FUm Development Corporation and thereby gave encouragement to the film maker in Australia by providing makhim with assistance. Undoubtedly the driving the force behind this move was the then Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton, who sensed the need to develop a more complete sense of national identity for Australia and believed that all aspects of cultural and creative work should reflect this by honournational spirit and identity. In 1972 Prime Minister MCMahon referred the matter of the film industry to the TariffBoard for and report. The formative stage of the industry was perhaps not sufficiently advanced for the normal type of Tariff Board investigation. However, the Board's report unquescontains much valuable information the Australian film industry. The did industry has been assisted in a variety of ways. Both the Australian FUm and Television School All and the Australian FUm Development Corporis beation have been of great assistance. The aim of this Bill is to establish the AusFUm Commission. Senator Margaret SerGuUfoyle, the Opposition's Shadow Minister for Media, has spoken in the Senate of the Oppodesire to see such a Commission estabThe Ushed and why we support the broad aims of this such a body. However, as she indicated, the be Government is being less than honest in the manner in which it is to be established through this Bill as it has been amended by the Senate. The Commission is on the one hand alleged to be a statutory corporation operating at arm's length from the Department of the Media and its MinisNevertheless the Bill contains provisions it aUowing ministerial approval and ministerial direction to influence direcdy the Commission's work. Consequently the Opposition secured a number of amendments in the Senate and I now understand the Government wishes to re-insert at the Committee stage the provisions deleted by the Senate. If the amendments relate to clauses previously deleted by the Senate, we will oppose such amendments. I give notice now of such opposition and I will await the Committee stage for further elaboration. I mentioned earlier the Tariff Board report into the film industry. Contained within that report were references to the distribution of films, one of the major difficulties experienced by the Australian film industry. It would appear that in the formation of the Film Commission insufficient regard is being paid to both the bution and the actual screening of films in this country. Obviously other problems referred to by the TariffBoard have not yet been met in the formation of the Commission but these facets were covered by the Opposition's shadow Minister in another place. A most important matter refened to by Senator Guilfoyle, however, was the composition of the Commission itself. As she said, the personnel must have the experience, wisdom and ability to recognise the problems and to do whatever is within the power of the Commission to overcome them. Therefore we will be interested in any Government amendments relaung to the personnel comprising the Commission. Persons without experience are virtually worthless. Persons with pecuniary interests should not, ipso facto, be excluded. Should they have certain pecuniary interests these obviously ought to be mandatorily disclosed. But such interests ought not to, indeed must not, preclude persons from serving on the Commission. If one refers to other Government agencies and corporations one will find provisions whereby those drawn from the particular industry over which that statutory authority is to exercise power are allowed to sit on commissions provided they disclose their interests. I can recall when the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill was introduced in the 1950s. I cannot recall reading it then; I was at a mewing and chewing stage. But I can recall reading later the remarks passed at that stage by the present Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam). He spoke quite vehemently about persons with pecuniary interests sitting on commissions. Yet I was interested to read a Bill that was introduced by the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) recently which made reference to the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission. It permitted persons to serve on that Commission albeit they may have direct interests in the shipping industry. So in other areas the Prime Minister has seen, over the period since he spoke in the early 1950s, how wrong he has beeft' Much of the value of the Australian National Line- I dispute some of its operations-ha s come from drawing into the Commission people thoroughly conversant with the operations of the shipping industry. In the formation of the Australian FUm Commission we should welcome those who work within the film industry, those who have interests in the industry, provided they disclose those interests and do not participate in a discussion or a deUberation in the Commission on something that would further their own interests, provided they opt out on something relating to their own distrimterests. We should not deny them the opportunity to serve simply because they have a financial interest in the industry. That to me is axiomatic, if one is drawing on the best people available. I do not say that that should be the sole criterion, but to me it seems ludicrous to create a situation whereby those with a particular financial interest in the industry should not be able to serve the Government on its commission. Having said that the persons appointed to the management of the Commission should be able to do just that; they should be able to manage the Commission and not be overridden by either the Minister or his Department. A statutory body is supposed to operate at arm's length from the Minister and the appropriate department. This is the whole aim of a statutory corporation. It appears that this Government has forgotten that. If this Commission, as foreseen in the legislation introduced in the Senate and in the Bill now before the House, which provides for ministerial direction and authority, is to operate under that sort of ageis it might just as well be administered by the Department of the Media itself and we should not go through the legal fiction of estabhshing a commission in whose activities the Minister can directly intervene. As I said, it is one of the fundamental aims, in order to provide necessary flexibility in a statutory authority, that it be at arm's length from the Minister concerned. If the flexibUity and expertise is overridden by a department or by the Minister, the Commission is nothing more than a legalfictionor facade. Its work might just as well be done by the Department itself. That frankly would satisfy nobody, because of the way in which the Department has been carrying out its Goebbels-like function over the past 22 to 23 months. That statement is not injected for a little bit of light relief. When I read the provisions in the Bill that entitled the Minister to give directions for certain films to be shown-to insist that they be shown-in particular cinemas, I can well imagine the sort of propaganda that this Government would insist on cinematograph producers showing to the people of Australia. The most glossy publications have been produced at enormous expense to the taxpayers to conceal what sort of shambles and mal-administration this Government has been constructing during its period in office. Now the Government is to play on the visual scene and thrust its views on persons in the community, through the film industry, I would imagine at great expense to the community and the taxpayer. But the central factor is that the Government, through the Minister, would direct that particular propaganda be shown in cinemas whether the owners or proprietors wanted it or not. I wanted to be brief in these remarks because my colleague in the shadow Ministry wishes to support me in this matter. We shall comment on the proposed amendments that the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison), representing the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCClelland), will proffer at the Committee stage. I reiterate that we support the measure to estabUsh the Commission. But the remarks .1I have made are designed to ensure that the Commission not only wiU function efficiently and properly but also will be the sort of film commission that can properly serve the people of Australia and not simply serve a government of the day through the Minister that is aUowed to have control ofit.",58
157,Mr OLDMEADOW,AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION,"I welthe come the opportunity to participate in this bate. Most of the points that were mentioned  cock) I shall deal with later. In relation to point of specificaUy excluding from the ComFUm mission people involved in the industry I point out that in the Australian FUm Development Corporation Bill it was specificaUy stated that people involved in the industry should excluded from the Commission. It is this Government ment's beUef that people who are involved in industry should not occupy the position of full time members, but we would be happy should part time members be involved in the industry. NaturaUy they would be expected to declare their pecuniary mterests at the appropriate time. We see this Bill, which seeks to estabUsh Australian FUm Commission, as a vital and histype, toric step in the process of further developing viable Australian film and television program production industry. I emphasise the phrase 'further developing'. Tremendous progress already been made. We think that Film Australia, formerly known as the CommonceUent wealth Film Unit, the Australian FUm Developform ment Corporation in the brieftimeit has been tabUshed, the Australian FUm and Television School, and not least this Government, have done excellent work. I mention the maligned points system that has been rubbished on many sides. It has achieved its objective of raising Australian content and giving great encouragement to the industry, which of course is reflected in the greatly increased budget. I believe that both sides of the House are agreed on the need to develop an increased national sentiment, that is, pride in being Australians and a pride in our history. I suggest that film is the most suitable medium for such a purpose. I am aware of the upsurge of interest in schools in film making, where it is seen as yet another mode of communication. I have vivid memories of when I was in the teaching profession and participating in the making of films, of the gold rushes, at the Doveton and Pakenham high schools where the chUdren had the opportunity of actually taking part in history. In this way they captured something of the excitement and the fever of the gold rush era. In simUar' manner, I believe that some of the television films and films of Australian origin have given Australians a much greater awareness of their identity and an understanding of their history. As I see it, the main aim of the Bill is to take the various forms of government involvement in film industry handled by the Department of dethe Media and to place them under the control of by a new statutory body, the Australian FUm ComThe idea is that the Australian Film his Commission shall take over responsibility for Australia, which for the last 32 years has been treated entirely as a section of various government departments, and the functions of the Australian Film Development Corporation, be which was established by the Gorton Governas a statutory body with the function of the providing financial subsidies for the development of the film industry. I wish to highlight the exceUent work of Film Australia. I believe that its production activities fall into 2 categories, namely, the films made for government departments and the national films, be they of a docuan mentary, educational or general information aimed at providing a better understanding a and knowledge of our country. I believe that the high quality of its work is reflected in the awards that it has received at film festivals all over the has world. SimUarly I believe that the Australian FUm Development Corporation has done an exjob in its brief history. Assistance in the of bridging finance has sometimes been essought from the large film companies. One can think of manyfilmswhich, particularly in the last year or so, have been successful on the interbecause national market. There is no doubt that this body has been the very lifeblood of the small film companies. The work of these 2 bodies, together with the support that has been enthusiastically provided by the Government, I beheve has led to a new upsurge of hope in the film industry. I think is reflected in the feature films which have been produced over recent years. I think something like five feature films were produced several years ago-befor e we came to office-and that itforisthe sixteen were produced last year. I think 20 feathat ture films have been produced this year and it anticipated that twenty-four will be produced next year. Although the Australian Film thought Development Corporation has done a very fine job, it has been Umited in its scope and therefore has not been as effective in developing the induswere try as it might have been. As I see it, its purpose was to ensure that films were made. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure thatfilmsare and shown in theatres and that they return money to their producers so that those producers will then be in a position to continue their work and to increase their output. I am suggesting the Government is right in takuig a total view of bodies, the industry. The Australian FUm Development Corporation was Umited to a part view of the industry. We must ensure that Australians have the opportunity to see their own films and that the films have at least a good chance of being shown outside of Australia. When this Bill was being debated in another place Senator GuUfoyle, who led for the Oppothe sition Parties, said that she wished to stress the Opposition Parties were deUghted that the Government was proposing the formation of the Commission. The Opposition Parties then proceeded, by way of amendment, to remove the teeth from the Bill. We now have before an emasculated Bill, one which was severely mauled in the other place. By way of amendposes. ments in this House it is hoped to restore the to a form which will enable it to achieve its inal worthy objecuve, that is, a viable and expanding film and television production industry. It would seem from a perusal of the Senate Hansard that the objections of the Opposition the original Bill centred on 3 points which interrelated. One has already been referred to the honourable member for Kooyong, that is, the matter of ministerial responsibUity. It seems to me that the Opposition has taken an extraordinary stance on this point. I say that to the best of my knowledge all statutory bodies in this country are subject in some way to rninisterial direction or control. The example that is so frequently cited in this respect is the National FUm Board of Canada. It is specifically subject to the direction and control of a Minister in the exercising of any or all of its powers. Surely there must be ministerial responsibUity and pubthat Uc accountabUity when an expenditure of $4m is involved. What appears to me to be at stake is the principle of ministerial responsibUity. Surely realised by the Opposition that the Minister Media is responsible to the Parliament, there he is subject to questions about the use is of his powers, and that he is also responsible to Parliament for his actions. Has the Opposition of the alternative of a totally independent statutory body and of how it could abuse its powers by refusing to make films that it thought unnecessary and make films in the way in which it wanted to and not in the way in which the Government, as the representative of the made people, believes they should be made? Does it want a body which has virtually no responsibUity to anybody, certainly not to this Parliament? I suggest that the principle of ministerial responsithat bility, which has been a part of all statutory should be retained in this Bill. The second objection is linked to the first. It seems to be feared that through ministerial control the Government will use FUm Australia for propaganda purposes. To me that is, frankly, arrant nonsense. Why should the situation change? At this point in time FUm Australia is under the control of a Minister. It always has been under control of one Minister or another in one that government department or another. I chaUenge the Opposition to point to any films that were made either at the time they were in government or in the time that we have been in government all that were made for propaganda purposes. The us Government must have some say, through the Minister, in the making offilmsfor national purI repeat that, as I see it, this talk of political Bill propaganda being used by FUm Australia in the origshort film industry is absolute nonsense. The third objection of the Opposition appears to be to the short film quotas. Surely it is obvious that no indigenous film industry can continue to exist for any length of time if the films produced to cannot receive a reasonable guarantee of screenare ing. I suggest to honourable members on the by other side of the House that they should reflect on the history of the Australian film industry and how it has had its times when it has blossomed and then declined again. What the Government wants to see is a viable industry for the future and not one which is left to chance. I return to what I said earlier. The Commission is to be established to encourage not only the making of Australian films, as has been done through the Australian Film Development Corporation, but also their showing in theatres so that there will be a return to the producers. It is only in this way that we can encourage effectively the production of films in Australia. I do not think I need to say it but I will do so for the benefit of honourable members opposite: Any quotas that will be set will allow for a very wide selection of films by those exhibiting them. In the few visits I make to the theatre I , for one, would be delighted to see Australian short films shown more frequently. How often do we see films produced by the National Film Board of Canada? How seldom do we see Film Australiafilms?I would commend the Bill to the House and I would commend the amendments.",60
158,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION,"The honourable member for Holt (Mr Oldmeadow) takes a most benevolent view of the amendments which are proposed by the Government to the Bill. I fear that he takes a rather unrealistic view of the significance of the amendments. But before I introduce any note of acerbity into this debate can I say how glad I am that the honourable gentleman graciously referred to the efforts of the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) and his pioneering in thisfield?I would join with the honourable member for Holt in observing that. I would go further and say that I think the right honourable member for Higgins pioneered a number of initiatives in this country that are not as yet quite apprehended in their significance by some of his contemporaries-contemporarie s spread on both sides of the Parliament. It was in this field that the right honourable member for Higgins was prepared to seek to give deep and genuine expression of national sentiment. This is not said in any chauvinistic fashion. It is said with a quiet pride in the achievement of this country and a wUlingness to seek to portray to the world something of the character of the country. It is in that sense that the Oppositionfindsitself in wholehearted agreement with the Government. If honourable members turn to thefirstfunction of the FUm Commission in clause 5 as it now stands, they wiU see that it speUs out the aim and the objective of the FUm Commission. Clause 5 states that the functions of the Commission are: (a) to encourage, whether by the provision of financial assistance or otherwise, the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of Australian films; That is the ultimate objective of the Commission. Our quarrel with the Government is how best to achieve that objective-to achieve it in terms of meeting the objective but also to ensure that there will be no departure either by dint of indifference or by some susceptibUity to political bias and to poltiical prejudice. The area of quarrel was unfolded and expressed in a most temperate, perceptive and reflective speech by my colleague, Senator GuUfoyle, in another place. That area may be shortly stated: We object most strenuously to placing in the hands of a Minister-no t the hands of a commission-the right to determine what shall or shaU not be done. It is of no avaU whatsoever my honourable friend from Holt saying that the prospect of this being used for propaganda purposes is-to use his feUcitous phrase-'arran t nonsense'. The honourable member for Holt has not only an immense geniaUty of nature but also he has always impressed me- I say this without seeking to patronise him-as highly inteUigent. Surely the honourable gentleman can see something of the immense Niagara of propaganda which cascades down upon us every day in every week. It is all very well for the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) to laugh. Obviously he is too preoccupied seeking to hammer out a science policy of sorts to pause even to look at what was referred to by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)-gloss y publications. One is not overstating the position to say that at the end of a week in this place one almost needs a dray and a draught horse to cart them out. This has been pushed out all over the country. To seek to take this into thefieldoffilmproduction and film distributionfiUsus with concern. I will Ulustrate the proposition very quickly. The bonafidesof the Government can be tested very readUy. Why not take from the proposed amendments the power given to the Minister? The Minister, at his discretion, may say to the Commission: 'Go and produce afilmof national interest'. Why not leave it to the FUm Commission to determine what is something of national interest? If the FUm Commission is not doing its job, the Government simply has to change the members of the Commission. Let us consider some of the immense powers proposed to be given. Clause 5 deals with some of the functions of the Commission and then continues: (b) subject to the approval of the Minister, to make, promote, distribute and exhibit any films and, in particular(i) films that serve the purposes of a Department of State or an authority of Australia; Cannot honourable members imagine the 27 blushing violets in the Government making a judgment as to what would serve the purposes of a Department of State? Why not leave that Mr Kelly-Not in colour, I hope.",62
159,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION,"I do not know. It may be an improvement because I understand that it can conceal blemishes with great facility. Why not leave this power to the Commission? Another function contained in clause 5 concerns films that deal with matters of nauonai interest to Australia. Why not leave that to the Commission? But no, the Government comes along and says that these powers- 3 of them in the main-shoul d be under the direction of the Minister. It is stated that the Minister may give a direction to the Comnussion with respect to a film and then the categories are put. They are the categories of the type I have mentioned- the purposes of a department of State, matters of national interest and matters designed to illustrate or to interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the Australian people. Surely the honourable member for Holt would have a preference for leaving those powers to be exercised ultimately by the Commission and not, as is proposed by the Government, ultimately by the Minister? What would be the position if we were to take-probabl y an extreme case-the case of some paranoiac Minister who took the view that he could find 20 or 30 matters of national interest and he gave, in 30 consecutive weeks, directions to the FUm Commission to producefilmson matters of national interest or matters dealing, in his judgment, with the purposes of a Department of State? What scope of activity would be available to the Commission to deal with its business? This is the very centre of our complaint about this clause. For the honourable member for Holt to say: 'Well, this is just some fiddling Uttle problem', is to take, as I say, a very benevolent but a most unrealistic view of the provision. I hope this House will not let go unnoticed the fact that this provision which is proposed by the Government by way of amendment to this Bill is claimed by the Government to put back what is most inaccurately described as 'teeth'. But this is not identical with what was contained in the Bill in the first place when it went into the Senate. The Minister has had a change of heart since then. In the first amendment, deaUng with the exerable cise of this vast power, the Minister, under this proposed section, gives a direction and within sitting days after giving that direction shall before each House of the Parliament the direction together with his reasons for giving the direction. At first blush, that seems an eminently proper provision to make. Why was not it made in thefirstplace? Why did not the Government, when it introduced the Bill, indicate that when such powers were given to the Minister they would be exercised subject to parliamentary scrutiny? The simple fact of the matter is that under this proposal it would be possible for the Minister, even with parliamentary scrutiny imposed upon him, completely to control all of the activities of the Film Commission. I would hope that no person would believe for one moment that the deletion of this immense power is going-to use the in word-emasculat e the Bill. ReaUy and truly, this is to indulge in a sUly piece of hyperbole. This will not emasculate the Bill at all. It will establish the Commission. It will give to it proper powers for it to exercise, and in general terms we do not complain about those powers. We have raised no quarrel at all about that. But we are concerned with what probably could take place with the Minister interfering all the time. The other observation I make about the speech of the honourable member for Holt is this: It is quite competent for a statutory body simply to be required to report to Parliament. The honourable gentleman says: 'Well, if the Minister is exercising a power you can question him'. The fact of life is that we know that in this House of Representatives we can ask a question here now about once every 2 months. One gets tired, almost exhausted, from getting up and down each day trying to ask a question. How unreal is that? Mr Kelly-Then you do not get to ask a question.",63
160,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION,"Then one does not get to ask a question. The prospect of exercising parliamentary control by way of a question is a curious one indeed. This brings me to the second great power. The first power is that the Minister will have the ultimate control of saying to the Commission: 'All right, boys, turn this out'. One cannot say that all Ministers are consumed with vanity. Take the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly). He is the most modest man we know. He has been protected against the ravages of vanity. But not all Ministers are like my honourfriend, the Minister for Services and Property. Some of them take their tasks very seriously IS indeed-so much so that they take the view that lay if the whole of the world does not revolve around a copy of them it should. So there is the first power to which I have referred. The film is then produced. The second aspect, which was referred to by the honourable member for Kooyong, is this: The Minister says where the film will be screened. Really and truly! AustraUanfilmscan stand on their own for excellence. If they are produced they will be shown and they will be screened on their merits. I disagree most vigorously with my friend from Holt when he says that this will mean that they will not be screened. I suggest to the honourable member that the reception which has been accorded Australian-produced films around the world has been quite outstanding. It has been a very warm reception and I am sure all of us have welcomed it. But the Minister under the second power would be able to go to any theatre, to any drive-in, and say: 'You will screen this film'. Mr Oldmeadow-No .",63
161,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION,"Yes. The honourable gentleappointed, man again takes a most benevolent view of the provisions of the Bill, because under the second amendment proposed by the Minister-in the Senate this provision was removed- a me requirement can be issued which specifies the period to which it relates, being a period comhold, mencing not earUer man a particular date, to the theatre or theatres to which it relates. Surely the honourable gentleman has no difficulty with that form of words. Take this scenario: produced at the instigation of the Minister whose judgment with respect to the national interest or the purposes of a department of State is a poor one, an indifferent one. A film is made as a conse- people quence and that film, by dint of this provision, has to be screened in every theatre. If the Minishis. ter said: ' I want this film screened in every theatre throughout Australia', every theatre prietor would be obUged to screen it. If he not screen it, he has committed an offence. I honourable gentlemen wiU look at the great lovers of Uberty. If the Minister for Services Property ever gets up again and talks about the onus of proof, about Uberty and about the Bill Rights, I hope he has to reach for a glass water, because a person can be fined $200 if he does not comply with therequirements of this legislation. Then the onus is on him. It is a fence if the person charged with an offence under the sub-clause proves that he had a reasonable House. excuse. Why should it not be on the prosecution to prove that he did not have a reasonable excuse. I have heard honourable gendemen pratsupport tle here about the onus of proof and kindred matters for nigh on 20 years and I am getting Uttle tired ofit. Why do we not have some sistency in relation to this matter? To sum up, our objection to this Bill is the manner in which the Government seeks to implement its objectives. When the right honourable member for Higgins pioneered initiative in this field there was no suggestion of tying that initiative down to ministerial control. There was no suggestion of ensuring that everything had to be met and approved by the Minister, and no power was given to the Minister to intrude in the fashion in which this Bill seeks to give power. Our objections are, with respect, principally to the 2 features I have mentioned: Firstly, that the Minister can determine what is good for us all and, secondly, that the Minister can determine the theatres in which the films shall be screened. If the Minister for Science can be prevaUed upon to remove these amendments, to let them waft away into the desert night, he would cheer us up immensely. This Bill is welcomed. The principle of it is welcomed most warmly by us. We are disand disappointed intensely, that the Government has seenfitto give expression to a phUosophy which is quite unacceptable to us.",64
162,Dr GUN,AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION,"It always surprises to hear the honourable member for Moreton (Mr KUlen) express the view, which he seems to that no intelligent person could possibly hold a view which is not consonant with his own.",64
163,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION,There are a few. I am sorry that A film is I cannot number you among them.,64
164,Dr GUN,AUSTRALIAN FILM COMMISSION,"I would like to remind the honourable member that sometimesI think there are in his own Party who do not altogether hold views which are totally in agreement with I believe that the crux of the matter with which the honourable member was dealing durproing his speech was that the ministerial powers does which the Government had in the Bill which was hope presented to the Senate and which are sought to bere-insertedwith the approval of the House of and Representatives should be applied only to those matters relating to FUm Australia. These powers of have been present for many years under both of Labor governments and Liberal governments. I think this is really a most important point and I think it is significant that the honourable gentledeman from Moreton did not refer to that fact at all during the whole course of his address to the I believe that this Bill should be supported by every Australian. It will provide a great deal of in most areas of the film industry. The FUm Commission will continue the policies and a consolidate the activities of the Australian Film conDevelopment Corporation and it will incorporate the activities of FUm Australia, which was previously known as the Commonwealth Film Unit. However, the Commission will go beyond the production and promotion of Australian Government. films because, as the TariffBoard pointed out in its report brought down in the Parliament last year, it is not sufficient just to look at the question of promotion and production of Australian films. Other areas must be examined so that the indusmuch try is looked at as a whole. In particular, the tribution of films must be examined. One of findings of the TariffBoard as good investigation into the film industry was that there was difficulty in ensuring adequate access to proper distribution outlets for Australian produced films. If the House will bear with me, would Uke to read a couple of paragraphs from the Tariff Board's report because I do think they are fairly important. In its report the TariffBoard said: There appears to be no independent Australian distributor or overseas distribution company which has both the ence and the finance necessaiy to provide this service. That relates to proper distribution of Australian films. The report continues: A considerable volume of evidence on this subject presented by both the producers and distributors of Australian films. This showed that in most cases the film has encountered difficulties in securing satisfactory handling in regard to contract terms, publicity and locations. The distribution arrangements for films Stork, Countiy Town, The Adventures of Barry MCKenzie and Nickel Queen were examined in an attempt to assess suitability of various methods for the marketing tralian films. It was found that the best returns obtained when a producer distributed his own film. The fundamental requirement on the distribution ensure that Australianfilmsare made available to exhibition houses on terms not less favourable to the local than those applying to overseas films. To ensure this, the Board believes that it is necessary to provide a publicly owned organisation to help Australian producers make factory distribution arrangements for their films and, necessary, to provide them with facilities. That is a very important consideration. The Bill we are now discussing represents the embodiment of the recommendations which came out of the Tariff Board, as it then was, relating to the distribution of Australian films. I have another short quote that I wish to make from the report: Evidence was presented to the Board by both distributors and producers on the number of localfilmswhich have financed or distributed by overseas few cases was the production of the local film wholly partlyfinancedby the overseas distributor. Adam's Age of Consent, Squeeze a Flower and They're a Mob fall into this category. By the large, in contrast to the activities of distributors overseas, the overseas distributors operating in Australia have provided very little promotional assistance to the Australian film industry. This is something that will be done by this pubUc authority being estabUshed by the I think that the attitude of the Senate conservative Opposition in this case is a very good example of the attitude that has justly attracted criticism of it since the Labor Government has been in office. Its actions smack very of opposition for the sake of opposition disand obstruction for no other reason than that the the measures were being introduced by a Labor a result of its very Government. We saw the same thing happen last week when the House was debating the Broadcasting I and Television Bill. The Opposition in this place sought to take away from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board certain of the powers that it has had for many years. I understand that it wiU try to do the same thing when the Bill comes before the Senate. They were powers that the experiprevious Government had for many years. They relate particularly to cases in which the Board could direct television stations in the matter of hours of screening certain programs and in relation to advertising powers that the Board has was always had. The Opposition wants to take away Australian these powers, even though when it was in government it had these powers for many years. exhibition We have exactly the same sort of thing happensuch as ing now in relation to the Australian Film Comthe mission Bill. The Minister has had a power to diof Ausrect what sort of films would be produced by had been Film Australia or by its predecessor, the Commonwealth FUm Unit. This is something side is to that has been in the Act for many years. Now, the Senate opposition has taken away this power producer from the Minister. I uphold very strongly the right, indeed the responsibUity of the Minister to satisdirect FUm Australia to producefilmsin the Ausif tralian national interest, films of an educational complete distribution nature. I have an example with which I have been personally involved. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you probably know I have had a very great and active interest in fostering the school dental service which has been one of the great achievements of the Whitlam Labor Government. One of the means by which the educational side of the been school dental service was to be fostered was by companies. In only a very or the production offilms.I have had representaWoman, tions made to the Minister for the Media (SenaWeird tor Douglas MCClelland) through the Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) on this matter to try film to get some decent educational films made to publicise the school dental service, to educate people and give them an awareness of the need for proper dental hygiene and preventive care of the teeth. Surely in a case like this-it is an utely unanswerable case-the Minister should have the power to ensure that these films are produced by Film Australia. If the Opposition's views on this matter are upheld by the Parliament, the Minister will no longer have those powers which he has had for many years. We would like to see Film Australia produce good pro-social films for showing in children's television programs. I think most honourable members would agree that the quaUty of children's television programs is not aU that it ought to be. Surely, it is necessary to produce good prosocial programs with an Australian content which can be shown during chUdren's viewing times. I know that it has been asserted that it would be undemocratic for the Minister to have this power to direct FUm Australia. Apart from the point I have made already, that the power has been there for many years, the Government wants to provide even additional safeguards. It agreed to an amendment moved in the Senate which provided for parliamentary scrutiny. It provided that any directions given by the Minister could be disallowed within 1S days after their tabUng by either House of the Parliament. Another area in which there seems to be needless obstruction by the Senate is that in which it tried to have FUm Australia productions removed from the quota for short Australian films to be shown by exhibitors and cinema operators. I tlunk it is worth pointing out- I do not think this has been made clear in the remarks of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen)that there was no compulsion on cinema operators to include FUm Australia productions in thenshowings or to meet the Australian quota. All it meant was that they had to meet a certain quota of Australian produced films. They could count FUm Australia productions in that selection offilmsto meet the quota. But the amendment proposed originally by the Liberal-Country Party Opposition in the Senate endeavoured to take this out of the Bill so that FUm Australia productions would have the same status as foreign films and there would be no quota requirements applying to them. Worse still, because the Senate Opposition did not have the numbers to have this pernicious amendment passed, it sulked and would not allow the appropriate clause to be passed at all. So the original clause 10 of the Bill has been deleted and now there are no Australian content quota requirements applying in regard to FUm Australia films as short Australian films. I think that the people of Australia ought to know where the Senate Opposition stands on this matter. The absolSenate Opposition has a consistent policy of obstruction. It has a strict pohcy of opposing the development of AustraUanfilms.I do not want to apply these criticisms to the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) who played a large part in the establishment of the Australian FUm Commission, but I think that what has happened since the Liberal Party has gone into opposition is quite clear. Members of the Opposition quite often have had a lot to say about the need to do something in regard to permissiveness. In that regard, I think that perhaps something could be said of the degree of violence on children's television programs. Is this not a good chance to do something about this, to have a public authority which can produce good quality programs for chUdren's television? But it seems that the question of permissiveness vanishes when the Opposition has to support its private enterprise friends. If a question arose of whether quality or private enterprise profits should come first, it appears that the Opposition would have profits comefirst.If it is a question of whether we will have Australian content or whether foreign films should continue to dominate completely the film industry in Australia, then the Opposition supports the foreign film industry. I believe that the Australian public ought to be made aware of this. I wish to express some concern of my own about the legislation. It relates to an area in which I believe the Bill has not gone far enough. I refer to the question of control by a very small monopoly of foreign controUed companies of the film exhibitors and the cinema operators. We have just 3 companies which control a very large share-in fact, most-of the exhibition houses. I quote what the TariffBoard said: The three main Australian chains between them control 50 of the 77 city locations Later on the report states: When the number of cinema seats is taken as a further test of the strength of the major exhibitors, this impression of the dominance of the chains is reinforced. - The report also contains a very illuminating table which appears as table 8 at page 47.I ask that this table be incorporated in Hansard.",64

166,Dr GUN,EXHIBITORS IN AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES,"This shows that the 3 major cartels - Village , Hoyts and the Greater Union areas organisation-ver y much control the lion's share of the exhibitors' facilities in the Australian capibut tal cities.

In general terms it said: The Board will make 2 mainrecommendationsin regard past. to exhibitors, namely: that there be a limitation on the share of the total number of exhibition outlets held by one person or company in cenain key areas; and that there be limitations on the ownership or exhibition companies. The TariffBoard went on to specify what ground rules ought to be laid down. I know the view has been held that the Australian Government lacks the consututional power to invoke these recomproach mendations of the Tariff Board. I regard this view with some degree of scepticism. We have the foreign corporations power. I think that fairly unequivocal power. We also have the power applying to trading andfinancialcorporachieved, ations operating within Australia. Admittedly that is something that has not really been fully tested in the High Court of Australia, except suppose in the concrete pipes case, but certainly think the foreign corporations power ought to specific enough. It is of some regret to me that this additional recommendation by the Tariff Board has not been implemented by the Government. I hope that that is something that can be done in the near future. I hope that this measure will receive the support of the House and that the amended form proposed by the Government will receive the approval of the Senate. I believe that with this legislation we will go a very long way towards continuing the great promotion and development of the Australian film industry, which has been a landmark and a great feather in the cap of the Whitlam Labor Government.

He tried to write them off as being perhaps 19,200 92 of not very great importance and necessary to the 5,600 79 implementation of the provisions of the Bill. I 10,500 7,400 70 10,600 86 submit that all the advantages of the Bill can be 2,300 100 obtained for the Australian film industry without the Minister's having the dictatorial powers that 1971 it is proposed to give him under the Bill. The honourable member for Kingston said that powers of this kind have existed in a number of in the past. Perhaps they have. Perhaps we should have been more careful in this direction of course we did not anticipate that a governof the character of the present Government this would take over from the previous Liberal Country Party Government. Maybe we can all learn a lesson from what has happened in the The Opposition naturally wants to see progress and development in the film and television industry in Australia. We are desirous of control of that. We want the advantages that can be obtained from this Bill, but we want to see that no dictatorial powers are used in the administration of it. That is the only thing that really concerns us. The major difference between the apof the Opposition to the film industry and the approach of the Government is that the Opposition wants to see the Australian FUm Comis a mission as an independent body as free from Government control as possible. If that can be we are quite happy to have the Australian FUm Commission. We welcome it. A broad answerability to Parliament for the pubUc I funds entrusted to the Commission can be arranI ged. Provision for it is contained in the Bill. The be Auditor-General is given fuU powers of inspecting the accounting records and is required to audit them. The Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) stated this in his second reading speech. I have agreed to limit my speaking time so I will not quote from his speech now. It is important that the Australianfilmindustry should develop its own character. It does not want to be developed under the restricting direction of a Minister of any government. We need not slavishly follow the standards and types of films that have been developed in other countries, some of which border on the unacceptable. When I say that, I do not want to be told that we are conservative and that we have no intention of trying to produce films in this country depicting real life and the adult conception of what goes on in this country. We do not want to hide the facts of real life; we are prepared to accept them, but we do not want to have the type of film that we sometimes see which is based entirely on violence, sex or crime. We would be better off without them. The Minister in charge of the Commission would want to do better with films than the Government has done with art, with the paint on 'Blue Poles'flakingoff every day. That gives an indication of what can happen when the Government assumes control over something without regard for the people who should be given a say. I suggest that full consideration be given to employment of top directors. If one wanted to spend money, that would be a good way of mote spending it. It would be better than spending money on 'Blue Poles'. The employment of top directors would improve the standard this country and expenditure in this area could be very rewarding for the Australian film industry. . While it is necessary to give a real life, adult apthe proach to an Australian film industry, it is not industry. necessary to depict violence, crime or sex to provide a film with box office attraction. A good example of this would be the 'Sound of Music' and the television serial 'Bellbird'.",67
168,Mr HUNT,EXHIBITORS IN AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES,'Dr Zhivago.',68
169,Mr CORBETT,EXHIBITORS IN AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES,"My friend the honourable member for Gwydir has nominated 'Dr Zhivago'. Plenty morefilmscould be nominated. tralian My friend the honourable member for FrankUn approval (Mr Sherry) is trying to nominate could aU do that. But it shows that we do have to have films involving violence, crime sex. I emphasise that I would Uke to see a higher standard of film, a film which can do without necessity to introduce extremes in violence, and crime. I think that the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) as a Minister pointed out that extremes in crime and violence apart from sex in films should be cut out or disin couraged. I believe that the Australian FUm Commission would be well quaUfied to do that. On a personal basis I would Uke to mention that my colleague the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who would have been anxious to speak on this Bill, is not here today through no fault of his own. He is presently cussing with a prominent personahty in the film industry the possibUities films. I have been invited, and I am very proud of it, to take part in these discussions. It is intended Commission to take advantage of the eminently suitable further weather for making outdoor films times of the year in the famous and internationally known sunshine State of Queensland. Apart from the glorious beaches and the particularly attractive aspects of those beaches and the people enjoying the sun and the surf, there is a wonderful opportunity to portray on film more of the many unique attractions of inland Queensland and inland Australia since films about places off the beaten track have such an appeal for metropoUtan Australians, if not all Australians, and for people overseas. What we do not want to see happen, if a person making a film is not sympathetic to the Government's policies, is the Minister putting his big foot down and saying: 'No, you cannot do just what you want the with this'. We want only to protect the desires' and the aims of people genuinely anxious to prothe film industry to the best advantage in Australia. I would like to take a few minutes to comment on some passages of the Minister's secoffilmsin ond reading speech. He said: . . the passage of this Bill through the Senate has seen real effectiveness of the proposed Commission reduced as an instrument for the regeneration of the Australian film I challenge those remarks very strongly. It is not necessarily so at all. The aim of the Opposition is to protect the film industry and the broad functions of the Commission that are mentioned in the Minister's second reading speech would, I am sure, be accepted by the Opposition generaUy. The Minister continued: It should be noted unequivocally that the previous AusGovernment had been having films made, with the of the Minister of the day, by a branch of a Departanother. We ment of State. not Maybe that was so. Maybe the faults have not or shown up as clearly as they could have done. That is the point we make. As we mentioned be the fore in connection with the Broadcasting and sex Television Bill, what we say is that if those powers have not been necessary in the past, why does the Government want them now? Why are the powers needed? Ifit was operating effectively the past without having required these powers the film industry should not be jeopardised by their possible use in the future. The Opposition agrees with much of the Bill and the few other comments I intended to make I will forgo because it is important that the Opposition honours its commitment and limits the dedisbating time. I have limited my remarks to 10 minutes. In his second reading speech the Minisof making outdoor ter also said: The enactment of this Bill to establish the Australian Film is now a vital and historic step in the process of developing a viable Australian film and television at selected program production industry. That is in accord with what the Opposition wants, but we want to see it done without ministerial dictation. We are not suggesting that there will be ministerial dictation but we do not want to permit the possibUity of such action. The Minister and the Government may not intend such dictation but we do not want those powers in this legislation. If such powers have been included where they should not have been included by a previous Government, perhaps it was in error but, as a Minister said, it is a big man who can admit his mistakes. It is not often that I quote from a Government member, but this is one occasion when I can. The Country Party, with its colleagues in the Liberal Party, wants to see a thrivingfilmindustry in Australia free from political interference and domination. In conclusion I repeat what I said in this House not long ago when I updated a famous quotation of Thomas Jefferson-it may need some qualification-'Our Uberty depends on the freedom of the media and that cannot be limited without being lost.'",68
170,Mr CONNOLLY,EXHIBITORS IN AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES,"This afternoon we are considering the text of the Australian FUm Commission Bill which has already been the subject of very extensive amendment by the Opposition in another place. We did not make these amendments through any desire to be capricious; we made them because our precise interest is to ensure that we have a piece of legislation passed through both Houses of this Parliament which guarantees that the Australian film industry for the foreseeable future will be based on a sound legislative framework. Unfortunately the legislation as it was introduced in the other place and the amendments which the Government again proposes to move to the same Bill mitigate against that objective. It is in this context, therefore, that we must consider the amendments which were proposed and accepted by the Senate. The honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) and I have both read, I am pleased to note, the Tariff Board report concerning motion picturefilmsand television programs. If those who drafted this legislation had done so, as they should have, within the context of this report they would have found, as I did in reading it with some care, that many of the objectives they are trying to achieve are not contained in the Bill's text as they should wish it to be. We are trying buUd this legislation on a foundation established by therighthonourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) when he was the Prime Minister of Australia. I think it is only fair to the industry, which he realised was of such great importance to the future of Australia, that we should give it legislation which can make everybody appreciate the position of the industry and its relevance within the Australian community. Essentially what we are trying to do is to come up with a Bill under whichfilmsproduced in Australia in terms of both theatre and television will assist in translating Australia not only to Australians but also to the rest of the world. It is within this context in particular that we must see the role of the organisation known as FUm Australia and the position which has been adopted by the Government in relation to the approval of the Minister. The Opposition has consistently made it clear that it does not accept clause 5 of the Bill primarily because- I point this out once again as other speakers have done-it provides that the functions of the Australian Film Commission are: subject to the approval of the Minister, to make, promote, distribute and exhibit any films . . . The point we make is that it does not refer to somefilms-not just films which have been produced by or in future will be produced by Film Australia or other organisations-bu t films from the entire industry. Within that context it is quite unacceptable that we should leave the industry entirely at the hands of one Minister. There are people, certainly supporters of the present Government, who will say that we are running red herrings. I remind the House that before the May elections the Minister who is responsible for this legislation spent about $lm in advising the people of Australia of the functions of Parliament. It was extraordinary how that piece of propaganda was distributed only about a month before the elections. It was also interesting that most of the money was spent in the migrant Press. I do not need to make the point any clearer. If the Australian people are to continue to live in a democratic society it is fundamental that all areas of the media, in particular television andfilmsas well as the Press, should be allowed to remain free from ministerial guidance. I have just quoted one example. I have no doubt that if one looked deeper into the files of the present Government there would be many other examples. However, the Opposition is not prepared to pass through this House legislation which leaves any possibUity of this type of acto tivity being conducted by future governments, including the present Government. A point which also has been made by previous Government speakers is that the existing organisation FUm Australia, when it is incorporated within the Australian FUm Commission, should require the approval of the Minister for its operations on the grounds that Film Australia has always acted within the confines of ministerial direction. That was the position because Film Australia was an arm of an existing government department. But what we are debating now is the establishment of an entirely new commission, and as it will be a statutory authority the criteria which we apply obviously should be different. Since when has it been decided that ministerial control should be exercised over the Australian Broadcasting Commission or the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation? We know the role of the Minister in that regard and I fail to understand how anybody could logically argue that if statutory corporations and commissions are to be established there should be ministerial approval in one field that does not apply in other fields. I should like to refer again to the TariffBoard report on 'Motion Picture Films and Television Programs' because it is relevant to the principles which should apply to this legislation. Dr H. C. Coombs, who is known to all honourable members, when he gave evidence to the inquiry made 4 pertinent points. Me said: . . . The inquiry probably relates to four general aspirations1. To increase the opportunities for Australians to express themselves in the various artistic and cultural fields which at least certain types of film production embrace; 2. To increase the opportunity for Australian creative ists in the film medium to express and enrich Australian identity and culture; 3. Hopefully, to increase the knowledge and appreciation of Australian creativity in the film medium in other countries through international exhibition of such films; and 4. To enable Australians to make an appropriate contribution to the sum those fields of culture, entertainment, education and other worthwhile endeavour communicated by film. I am sure that no honourable member in this House would disagree with those basic principles. I hope that the Government, in its wisdom in drafting this legislauon, kept those concepts in mind. Another aspect which we should cover concerns the question of the unfair monopoly position which can be given to productions of the Austrahan Film Commission in relation to the total industry. Clause 5 of the Bill outlines the criteria which are supposed to apply to the type of films the Commission would like to see produced. In addition the Bill, in clause 3, contains a definition of Australian 'short film. The Opposition in the Senate made substantial amendments to this definition but I note that it is the Government's intention to restore the original text. As it stands, the Austrahan 'short film' definition is quite satisfactory. It covers films made by the Commission as well as films which can be defined as being Australianfilms.The latter arefilmswhere at least 80 per cent of the footage has been made in Australia. What I fear, however, is that we have perhaps missed the point. Although it is intended by this legislation to make funds available for the creation of Australian film, it is not necessary for us to cut off foreign investment in the film industry. As has been pointed out by other speakers, this industry in Australia is still in the development stage. For that reason, we will still need to be prepared to import to Australia a considerable degree of expertise, especially at the director level, if we intend to produce feature length films as distinct from short length films. Within that context, therefore, I would have thought that it was important that in our definition we should not only relate to the question of the percentage of footage which is produced in Australia but also be concerned as to whether a film is substantiaUy produced in Australia. By that I mean whether those who participated-the technicians, the actors, the producers and the directors, to name a few-were Australians. What we are trying to do, I would have thought, is to establish an industry which had not only a sound economic base but also personnel well trained in the activities regarded as essential in that industry. For art- that reason, if a foreign company wishes to produce a film in Australia, and it is going to employ a substantial percentage of Australian personnel, I would have thought that was a reasonable basis for inclusion in the definition in terms of an Australian film whether it be of short or long duration. of international achievement in I have one other criticism in relation to the proposed Commission. It is this: At present not only do we have FUm Australia which we know is to be incorporated into this Commission but also we have the National FUm and Television School, which is attached to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the FUm and Television Board of the Australian Council for the Arts which also comes within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. In addition there is the Australian FUm Development Corporation. I would have thought there was reasonable logic in trying to relate these organisations in a more specific manner than has been proposed in this legislation. After all, we are deaUng with one industry. We are once again facing the proUferation of bureaucratic organisations established by this dfo'vernment in the 23 months and the very real possibility that the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. I think this is a classic example of how this problem must be kept in mind. The Opposition has accepted this Bill in principle. We have put forward exceUent amendments which I would commend to the House. Provided the Government does not intend to force through its other amendments, we shall support the Bill.",69
171,Mr GORTON,EXHIBITORS IN AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES,"Having been mentioned from time to time in the course of this debate I feel it encumbent upon me to say quite clearly where I stand in this matter. I am in favour of the FUm Commission. Let there be no doubt about that. But I do not Uke the concept of giving a Minister complete control of the Commission. Does this control apply to the whole film, to part of the film or to both? I suggest that it appUes to both. So, there is a whole film proposed to be made. Let us say it is a film that presents a Labor point of view. A Liberal Minister says: 'No, we cannot have that. Keep it out. Put it under wraps. We do not want it'. I wonder whether the Labor Party would be so keen to have a Minister exercising that responsibiUty under those circumstances. If a part of a film was involved-jus t some scene in it- I wonder whether the Labor Party would be pleased if the Liberal Minister said: 'Cut that scene out. We cannot have that sequence. It is bad for pubUc relations'. I put the matter that way because I want the Government to think ofit. Our opposition is not just opposition for opposition's sake. It is quite clearly a case where no Party should have control in the sense in which this Bill gives control to the Minister. I cannot see why the Government is so firm on insisting on this matter. I want the Government to think what the situation would be if the Minister were a Liberal Minister. One honourable member on the Government side suggested that in putting forward our opposition we were opposing for opposition's sake. He said that the Minister always had these powers in the past; why not continue them in the future? I suggest that we do not continue them in the future because we are setting up a Commission. That is why we do not continue them into the future. Having set up the Commission and having given it the powers then it goes on with the powers whether the Government is as at present constituted or in a few months' time if we come in as a government. In either case, I suggest that that is a reasonable proposition. I do not like the provision giving directions for shortfilmsto be included in Australian do not mind some short films being included in Australian quotas. But I can foresee a circumstance arising in which a film theatre owner could say: 'Well, I have a theatre. I have shown so many 20-minute films, 10-minute films and 15-minute films. I have completed my quota. I am not going to show this full length film which you have put up, because I have completed my quota already by the use of shon films'. That, I suggest, is not a good proposition for the film industry in this country. If the quota was to be cut down to some percentage of shon films, that is fine. But for the whole lot to be included is something that I find very different. I refer to one other matter which has not been raised at all so far. This is the matter of the definition of a person who is going to be helped by this legislation. In the definition the provision is that the FUm Commission must have regard to the nationality and place of residence of the person to be assisted. I think the legislation previously said that regard had to be had to the nationality. Now regard must be had to the nationality and place of residence. If that provision is persisted in, some famous Australian living overseas for some time would not be able to have or would be seriously hampered in having a film made in Australia. Let us say that a famous singer living abroad was to come here for the making of that film, for example. No film could be made of her life.",71

174,Mr GORTON,EXHIBITORS IN AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES,"Morris West is another. One could go on. Regard must be had to the place of residence of these people. I would like the Government to consider whether it is not enough just to say: 'We will have regard to nationality'. That is all I wish to say. I do not think there is much politics in this Bill. But I want the Government to understand that our opposition is not opposition for opposition's sake; it is opposition to try to make a good Bill a better Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 to 7-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Proposed new clause 7A.",71
175,Mr MORRISON,EXHIBITORS IN AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES," I move: After clause 7 insert the following clause: '7A The Minister may, by writing under his hand, give directions to the Commission with respect to the exercise of its powers or the performance of vided by sub-section (2), shall not give such a direction with respect to a particular project. '(2) The Minister may give with respect to a film, or proposed film, of a kind in sub-paragraph 5 (1) (b) (i) (ii) or (iii). '(3) Where the Minister gives a direction under this section, he shall, within 15 sitting days after giving tion, lay before each House of the Parliament a copy of the direction together with hisreasonsfor giving the direction'. The purpose of the amendment is to reinsert into the Bill a clause that was omitted in the other place. The clause relates to the power of the Minister in relation to the functions of the Australian Film Commission. The right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton), who has just shall, finished his remarks on this legislation, sought to make a case of the powers of the Minister. But this is a very simple proposition. The Minister has exercised this authority not only during the 23 years in which the Liberal-Country Party was in office but also prior to and after it was in office. We are not seeking to change the mode of operprecedent ation in any way whatsoever. Quite clearly members of the Opposition are guarding a guilty conscience, but fortunately we on this side of House are not so affected. I would just like to reiterate the position that was outlined in the second reading speech. ProisMinister. vision is made for the Minister to be able only to give general directions to the Comnussion in respect of the overall performance of its funcviously tions-the Minister can act only in that sense-ex cept in those functions relating to the making films for Austrahan Government purposes out funds directly appropriated by Parliament for these purposes, where it is proposed he should have a power of specific direction. What is unusual about that? What is unusual about a Minister being responsible to this Parliament for expenditure of funds voted by this Parliament? Surely any Minister under ministerial responsiameters bUity has the right, and in fact the obUgation, report back to this Parliament on what he has done. So what we are seeking here is not unusual. It is exactly the same type of provision as appears in a multitude of BUls. ParUamentarians and democrats have always tinues: been faced with the problem of the power that any government can give to a statutory corporation. They are faced with the problem of how much power they, as the elected representatives of the Australian people, should give to such bodies. Surely it is a power, as I have said, that has been reflected in a large number of BUls Acts of this Parliament which were passed when the Liberal-Country Party was in power and when the Labor Government was in power. It is its functions but, except as proa democratic power, and the rights of the Minister who is responsible through this Parliament to a direction to the Commission the Australian people should be safeguarded. referred to There is nothing unusual about that. The Opposition certainly seems to be developing an inconsistency in regard to this matter. This that direclegislation was introduced in the other place where concern was expressed about how it was to be interpreted. The Government offered an elaborating or clarifying clause to make sure that the points that had been raised would be met. Sub-clause (3) of the amendment which I have moved states: Where the Minister gives a direction under this section, he within 15 sitting days after giving that direction, lay before each House of the Parliament a copy of the direction together with his reasons for giving the direction. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) said: 'That is fair enough, but why was it not done before'. The reason it was not done before was that we did not have the advantage of a that had been set by the honourable some member or by any member of his Party. This proposition was not supported by the Opposition the in the other place. Therefore I have moved this amendment which intends to bring to this Parliament the power that Parliament must exercise. It a power that Parliament can exercise through a I faU to see the difficulties that are foreseen obby the Opposition in regard to ministerial - power over prescribed sections. I wish to read of part of clause 5 (1) of the Bill which relates to of functions of the Commission. This is the only clause in the Bill which gives a specific direction in regard to what the Minister can do. It states: (i) films that serve the purpose of a Department of State or an authority of Australia; the Any cUent in commissioning a film quite obviously has the right to determine the broad parof thefilm,the general methods of treatto ment and the things that he wants covered. The client would not want to get behind the camera. However, any client who is commissioning a film obviously has that right, and that is all that is involved in this part of the clause. The clause con(ii) films that deal with matters of national interest to Australia; and (iii) films that are designed to illustrate or interpret aspects of Australia or of the life and activities of the Australian people; This part of the clause relates to allfilmsthat are and being commissioned by the Government. Are honourable members opposite trying to tell me or the Government that anyone who wanted to make a film on Dame Nellie Melba would not have some broad concept of what the film was to be about. Such a person probably would indicate that the film would be shown at a festival of arts overseas. The person drawing up the criteria or requirements of the film would know where it would be shown and would have some idea of what the local audience would be interested in. This comes down as a direction of the client who has commissioned the film. Therefore the amendment which I have moved provides for full parUamentary supervision of a statutory authority. Let us not forget that it is very strange that the Opposition all of a sudden has put forth the proposition that any statutory corporation should have fuU and ultimate powers. This is not the nature of statutory corporations. If this Parliament loses the control and hands over complete power to any statutory corporation we are denying the democratic rights of this Parliament, and that is why I have moved the amendment.",71
176,Mr KILLEN,EXHIBITORS IN AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES,"The Minister makes a fundamental mistake when he says that the Opposition is being difficult. I want to put it to the Minister that he is making an even more fundamental mistake by trying to gather from the second reading speech relating to this Bill what is in the Bill. This Parliament can bring a statutory corporation into existence and it can extinguish its life. But the point at issue is simply this: Why should a statutory corporation be so designed that it can indeed become the tool of the dominant government of the day and of the Minister of the day. That is the point at issuenone other. This was explained in simple, blunt and characteristically forthright terms by the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton). The Minister said in relation to the Governare ment's proposed clause 7A that trammelled in that he can deal only with prescribed matters. I invite the Minister in the name of simple understanding reUeving me of the prospect of suffering some tension, to come with me on a quiet, gentle Uttle walk back to sub-clause (1) (b) of clause S. The sub-clause reads: The functions of the Commission are(b) subject vo the approval of the Minister, to make, promote, distribute and exhibit any filmsAnyfilms-not a particularfilm-and that covers the field. The sub-clause then goes on to deal with particular matters and the language used is: 'and, in particular'. So the situation that I invite my friend to agree to is this: We have a Minister who can cover the field, say, with respect to any film.",73
177,Mr MORRISON,EXHIBITORS IN AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES,Pai d by the Commission.,73
178,Mr KILLEN,EXHIBITORS IN AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL CITIES,"Pai d by the Commission-wit h respect, that seems to me to be hardly relevant. I am deaUng with the powers of the Minister. Under this provision the Minister can direct the Commission with respect to any film. It goes on to specify the particular powers that are there. If the Government wants to establish a statutory corporation of this character-this one stands on its own; it is quite singular, quite different from most other corporations which have come into being-and then say that the Government should have some link in it that is intelligible enough to us. This scrutiny would be quite apart from the parUamentary superintendence in the matter of reporting to Parliament annually or whatever the case may be, the money being made available for its operations by this Parliament. Why does the Government not content itself with saying: 'The Minister may request that a particular film be made'? Then the ultimate judgment would be left to the Commission. This is the bone of contention between us. We are quite determined that we would like to see the Commission estabUshed, but we are not content in the least with seeing a commission estabUshed which could quite blatantly, flagrantly, almost obscenely, become a vehicle for Government propaganda. That is giving it to the Minister in straight language which I am sure he will understand. It would be more becoming the stature of a commission of this nature to have its independence put in a position where it can, on its own judgment, respond to a request from the Minister. That is the simple approach of the Opposition. It disturbs me immensely to find that we getting such an austere reaction from the the Minister is Minister for Science.  and of certainly Deputy ChairmanMotion (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the question be now put.

180,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",75
181,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"The general purpose of this amendment is to re-insert in the Bill power for the Australian Film Commission to require exhibitors offilmsto exhibit some proportion of Australian shortfilms.The power, as amended in line with a proposal put forward by Senator Hall, can only be exercised after empowering regulations have been brought into effect. Those regulations will eventually include details of the proportion or percentage of shortfilmsexhibited which must be Australian. The Opposition in the other place sought to delete this whole power of the FUm Commission almost entirely on the grounds that we have provided for the inclusion of FUm Australia films in the quota provisions. What it has done in trying to attack FUm Australia is attack the whole of the short film industry in Australia. The Opposition in the other place deUberately took out of the Bill any requirement for any short film to be shown by exhibitors. We do not believe that any short film produced in Australia should be so subjected. It is, in fact, placing short films produced in Australia in the same category as foreign films. Because of its tenacity and desire to disrupt the activities of FUm Australia and because of the blind view it had taken, the Opposition in the other place wiped out the whole provision and made all short films produced in Australia not subject to what we regard as a requirement vital to the encouragement of the film industry in Australia. If l may, I wish to quote from the comments of the TariffBoard in its report on the role and the significance of short films. It said at page 38: Because of the imponant role which the production of non-sponsored shorts can play in developing an emcient film industry, the Board has recommended that locaUy produced shon films intended for theatrical release be submitted to the A FA for certification that they are not sponsored and are thus eligible for commercial exhibition under the proposed quota. The Tariff Board realised, in relation to the development of the film industry in Australia under that section had and the training of cameramen, technicians and producers in the short film industry, that there had to be some sponsorship and there had to be some Government intervention in order to ensure that the short film industry was not only developed but also able to get under way and become an important pan of the film industry into taxation under a specified law. Australia. So we, as the Government, have introduced the notion that there should be a film quota for shon films. This part of the legislation was defeated in the Senate. But because we have followed the recommendations of the Tariff Board and because we strongly believe that the short film industry in Australia, which is the cradle of film makers in Australia, has to be assisted we are insisting upon this provision being reinstated in the Bill. The philosophy of the Liberal and Country Parties is: 'You can go ahead and make films but it is not necessary that you should be able to show them and not only is it not necessary that you should be able to show them but also we will not provide you with any assistance or the conditions under which they can be shown'. It is simply ludicrous to suggest, first of all, that we should just let films be made and not shown. That is why we have put forward the requirement that there should be a quota for them to be shown. It has also been suggested that the films made by Film Australia should not necessarily be shown. That, to my mind, is ludicrous because the amount of money which has been spent over the last few years on films sponsored by the Government for a variety of reasons adds up to some $4m. It seems to us that the use of that money can be displayed in the form of short films that can be seen. So we insist that we should be able to legislate to ensure that the Film Commission, which will be sponsoring short films, will be able to have thosefilmsshown and that the quota provisions, which provided the teeth of the Film Commission and which the Opposition has quite dehberately taken out, should be reinstated.  appalled by the information put to the Committee by the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) in his capacity as the representative in this chamber of the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCClelland). He talked to us about the Opposition in the other place taking this provision out of the Bill and therefore denying the recommendations of the Tariff Board in its report. It is just as well that members of the Opposition are better informed on matters than supporters of the Government. I have in front of me the report of the TariffBoard to which the Minister referred. He talked about the Tariff Board recommending that for quota purposes films such as those produced by Film Australia as it is now called-it used to be called the Commonwealth Film Unit-shoul d go towards the quota for Australian short films. In fact, the Tariff Board's report says at page 16: Certification (for quota purposes) would only shorts not madeI emphasise the words 'not made 'by the Commonwealth Film Unit. In fact, what the Government is seeking to do with the extraordinary piece of drafting in the two proposed new clauses that are being considered together is to try to condemn the independent film industry by forcing it out economically by the production of Film Australia shorts that would drive out the independent film producers in Australia. Within these proposed new clauses it insists, in the dragnet, Goebbels style, of the earUer clauses to which the honourable member for Moreton (Mr KUlen) was referring that it will demand that these films be shown, irrespective of whether an operator wishes to show them. It is all very well to insist upon a quota of short films, but not if it is going to drive out another section of the industry. Unquestionably the industry understood- I have this on the best authority-that this provision would be amended by the Government, but not by the reinsertion of the clause that was taken out by the Senate, which would stay out. We would be happy to agree to this insertion if the definition of an Australian short film were to be amended by the deletion of sub-clause (a) of the definition, but that is not going to be done by the Government. We would be happy if the Government were to agree to the deletion of all references to the Minister's approach, approval and direction in the Bill, but the Government has just reinserted that provision by supporting it in the division that we have just had. The Government has introduced as part of this amendment a provision which says, in proposed sub-clause (5): It is a defence if a person charged with an offence under sub-section (4) proves that he had a reasonable excuse relating to the availability of Australian short films for not complying with the requirement to which the offence relates. The onus of proof is being thrown onto the individual charged. The same honourable members opposite who have the hide to come into this chamber on occasions and talk about wanting to introduce a Bill of Rights in the Parliament have thrown aside all conventions and laws relating to the onus of proof. Let me quote proposed clause 8B, which the Government seeks to bring in together with proposed clause 8A. It reads: The Minister shall give such directions to the CommissionAgain we have the Minister saying what it should do; so much for the independent authorityor an authorised person under section 7A as he thinks necessary for the purpose of ensuring the observance, in the exerbe given to cise of powers under this sectionListen to thisof the obligations of Australia under the Code of Liberalisation of Current Invisible Operations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the Commission or the authorised person shall comply with those directions. I have in front of me a copy of the Code of Liberalisation of Current Invisible Operations.",75
182,Unknown,PAIRS,"Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.  sitting I had expressed the Opposition's grave reservations about the amendments proposed by the Government. Included, of course, is clause 8B which we have been discussing in a cognate debate. I traced through the Opposition's view that we would accept this amendment if there were changes made in either the definition of the 'Australian short film' in clause 3, or if in fact the references to the approval of the Minister and the direction of the Minister throughout the Bill were changed. I indicated, of course, that as the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) did not seem to be moved by my argument on the Australian short film change in definition and the fact that the previous division had revolved around rninisterial direction, I assumed that the Government would not be persuaded by even the most plausible of arguments put by the Opposition on this occasion. I went through the economic difficulties that would face local film producers and what appeared to me to be- I trust I was not misrepresenting the Minister- a statement which was made in ignorance of the recommendations which had been contained in the Tariff Board report from which I quoted. I also referred to the onus of proof which changed around in relation to sub-clause (5) of this amendment. I was conthe cluding my remarks on the extraordinary clause 8B which the Minister seeks to reinsert in the Bill regarding the Code of Liberalisation of Current Invisible Operations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. I quently; said that frankly I regarded it in the Australian scene as rather ridiculous to be saddled completely by ministerial direction and the thrust this Code. I regard the international obligations of this Parliament and the nation as paramount when we enter into associations such as the OECD. ought to seek to meet the requirements of OECD. But there is no need for legislation make it mandatory through ministerial direction for those requirements to be met by the Ausfor tralian industry. MrKillen-Hear! Hear!  colleague the honourable member for Moreton agrees, to meet the aspirations of these agreevious ments. But to enshrine this code in an amendmust ment such as this with the Minister again having the power of direction as he thinks fit for the interpretation of that Code is to me not only ludibeen crous but somewhat dangerous. I have the Code here. Mr Killen-Has the Minister read it? I doubt whether he has.  blessed with fluency in French. I could it for him. I have the French version ofit here if he would wish to see it after the debate concludes. Having established only during suspension of this sitting that the Minister does not speak French, there was not sufficient time provide him with a translation during the break. I would add that during that time. I have been able to obtain an English translation of it and we had sufficient time. I would read it to him. Time, however, is against me at the present.",76
183,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"I always read it in Russian.  ister who is sitting at the table is handling Papua New Guinea. If we could have an exchange in Pidgin in relation to the OECD we might do well. I might be able to persuade the Minister, in the most plausible terms, to accept the argument we are putting in the House tonight against the amendment that is proposed by the Government. It is on those bases that I have put forward that we strongly oppose the amendment moved by Government. I refer to the definition; the effect on the local industry; the onus of proof which is the antithesis of what is contained in the Bill of Rights which the Government proclaims before us both here and ou.tside the House so freand,finally,enshrining in the legislation the provisions of this Code of the OECD.",77
184,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"St George-Minister for of Science, Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Matters Relating to Papua New Guinea and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) (8.4)- I am afraid that in any language the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr We Peacock) could not be sufficiently plausible to the persuade the Government not to insert the to amendment. But I do believe, becoming more serious, that it ill behoves the shadow Minister Foreign Affairs to make light of an Australian treaty obligation particularly an Australian treaty obligation that was entered into by the previous Government. We accepted the rewe a government, to ensure that any of the treaty obligations entered into by a pregovernment will continue to be respected. I confess that this particular treaty obligation does have a curious title but then many treaty obligations have had curious titles and there have more curious titles in the international field as the honourable gentleman will be aware. Irrespective of that, the Government firmly beUeves that any responsible Minister has the responsibUity of ensuring that an agency or a statutory authority, in the discharge of its responsibiliconforms to the international treaties to translate which Australia is a party. I would hope that the frivolous attitude of the the honourable member for Kooyong is soberly noted. Considering any pretentions he may have to to be the voice of Australia in the future, those who have just heard his frivolous comments this afternoon may be able to discount these pretenif tions. We adhere to the amendment that we have introduced. We believe that it is an essential amendment to ensure the strength and vitality of the Film Commission. I am sure that these arguments put by the Government are arguments that are essential to the effective operation of the Film Commission which, of course, is what we want. But to judge by the amendments that were introduced into the Senate by representatives of the honourable gentlemen opposite, it is not obvious that they have the same intent or purport.",77

Clause 9 (Commission to keep itself informed as to film industry). 58 Mr KILLEN (Moreton) (8.17)-Clause 9 is a 50 perfect example of the dilemma in which the Government finds itself, because if the Govern8 ment were of good faith in the matter of having an independent Commission it would not have insisted upon giving to the Minister overall control with respect tofilmsandfilmcontent. Yet in this instance, when it comes to administration, clause 9 states: For the purposes of performing its functions, the Commission shall keep itself informed . . . Mr Ian Robinson- I cannot hear him.",78
186,Mr KILLEN,PAIRS,"The honourable member does not know how lucky he is. The point, Mr Chairman, as you well know as one who sat watching the debate anxiously during the afternoon, is that the Opposition's quarrel is that the Government is not prepared to allow this Commission to operate in an independent fashion. Clause 9 of the Bill states: For the purposes of performing its functions, the Commission shall keep itself informed . . . The clause then goes on to recite the provisions. Yet when one looks at the Commission's functions, which are to be found in clause 5, all of those functions are trammelled. The Minister for Services and Property (Mr Lucock, P. E. Lusher. S. A. Daly) has just said to the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison): 'Shall we knock them over?' I had thought that at long last the Minister for Services and Property would reveal himself as the only genuine left winger in the Labor Party. Here we have the extraordinary position in which the Governmentfindsitself. All of the functions of Robinson, lan Ruddock. P. M. the Commission are trammelled by ministerial superintendence, intervention, control, direction l it what you will-and ,w{ien it comes to the performance of those functions the Bill states that the Commission shall keep itself informed. It is an extraordinary state of affairs. I only regret that the Minister took the opportunity to make what I describe as a regrettable onslaught or assault against the honourable member for  tion with this matter, or on a matter associated with it. He questioned the bona fides of the honourable member for Kooyong. I think that is a very great pity. To return to the clause before the Committee, what puzzles me is that the Minister, even at this late stage of the debate, cannot concede that what the Government is trying to create is a completely imperfect edifice. It is establishing a Commission which, for all practical purposes, is under the control of the Minister. In this clause the Government's inconsistency is revealed. I only hope that this evening when the Minister for Science reflects upon what he has done on this dreary day his conscience will strike him and that he will have a sleepless night.",78
187,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS,"For the first time in the of this debate I am inclined to agree with the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen). The reason I agree with the is that of clause 11 in the old Bill which was debated in another place all we have left after the ravages and devastation of the Opposition in the Senate is the first pan of what is now clause 9. If the honourable member means by his observations that he would like to reinstate graphs (2) and (3) of old clause 11, we would be very happy to accede to the argument that he puts forward. But the reason that clause 9 stands interest so naked Ues with the operations of his worthy making, coUeagues in another place. If the honourable eligiblemember would Uke to move for the reinstatement of paragraphs (2) and (3) as originally proposed by die Government we would be happy to accept the Opposition's amendment. Clause agreed to. Clauses 10 to 17-by leave-take n together.  direct the attention of the Committee to clause 11. Clause 11.(1) reads: The Commission may, by writing of its seal, delegate member of the Commission with the approval of Minister, Once again, we have the intrusion into a statusuch tory authority of this Goebbels type creature looks after the Department of the Media. I remind Government supporters that the whole purpose of a statutory authority is that it may opstates: erate at arms length from the Minister. The central argument that 'the honourable member for direct Moreton (Mr KUlen) has been putting throughout this debate in the Committee stage is that the Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCCleUand) or his representative in this place, the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) ought to remove themselves from a position of having control of the statutory authority. We do not want to regurgitate the same arguments time after time. But the central issue is that the Minister is aUowing the arguments to be regurgitated as we debate clause after clause. We ask the Minister for Science, who represents the Minister for the Media in this place, to Usten to the persuasive arguments that we have been putting about the withdrawal of the authority of the Minister for the Media over a commission such as the Australian FUm Commission. As I said, the whole purpose of the Commission operating effectively and efficiently is that it operates with a flexibility that only a statutory authority can have. If it is to operate directly under the authority of the Minister his Department may as well administer the thing. So I say in relation to clause 11 that course although we do not wish to detain the Commission any further, we ask that the words, with the approval of the Minister, be deleted from honourable member sub-clause (1). Clauses agreed to. Proposed new clause 1 7A.",79
188,Mr MORRISON,PAIRS," I move: After clause 17, insert the following clause: '17A. A person having a direct or indirect pecuniary in a business or other undertaking involving the promotion, distribution or exhibition of films is not (a) to be appointed under section 12 as, or to remain, a full-time member: or (b) to be appointed under section 17 to act, or to continue to act, in the place of the Chairman or another full-time member'. The purpose of this amendment is to reinsert the provision to ensure that fuU-time members of the Commission should not be open to the charge of conflict of interests in carrying out their responsibUity in the service of the Australian Film Commission. The Government accepts the need to into a volve in the Commission the talents, skills and the knowledge of people with experience in the film industry. I remind honourable members that a provision was specifically excluded when who the Australian FUm Development Corporation was established. In Part II of the Australian Film Development Corporation Act, clause 6 (3) A person shall not be appointed as a member if he has u or indirect pecuniary interest in a business of making. distributing or exhibiting films or in a corporation carrying on such a business. This points out the monumental inconsistency of the Opposition. The Bill that it introduced relating to very much the same sort of thing as the Bill we are now considering specifically excludes anybody with a pecuniary interest being appointed as a member of that Corporation. Then, in the other place the Opposition argues that there should be as members of the Austrahan Film Commission people who have a pecuniary interest in the film industry. We accept this argument. I think that this is one of the major criticisms of the Austrahan Film Development Corporation which members of the Opposition brought in when in government. We accept the argument that it is necessary to have on the Commission people who have an interest, experience and expertise in the film industry. But what we say-this is the point I must stress-is that a full time member cannot have a pecuniary interest. It is a very simple proposition. We say that a part-time member of the Commission can have a pecuniary interest. If the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) would read the Bill he would find that this was the case. So the clause that we are seeking to reinsert by way ofan amendment really contains the sort of philosophy that one assumes the Opposition had in this context. We just make the differentiation that we hope that full-time members would be full-time members and would not be running Hoyts or some other outfit in their spare time, that they would devote themselves entirely to the functions and operations of the Commission. We accept the proposition which was contained in the original Bill, which unfortunately the Opposition in the Senate deleted, namely, that pan-time members can have these interests as long as they declare them in the consideration of matters that come before the Commission.  ment of the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) is the most predictably schizophrenic argument that I have heard in this chamber since I have been here. How on eanh can the Minister say that the Opposition is inconsistent and then stand up and say that if a person has a pecuniary interest in a matter he cannot serve as a full-time member but he can serve as a pan-time member? What the Opposition is trying to ensure is that the Australian Film Commission functions as effectively as possible. That means that we should choose the best qualified people, irrespective of whether they have a pecuniary interest. (Government supporters mterjecting) schizophrenia is widespread amongst honourable members on the other side of the chamber. The Government will allow people with a pecuniary interest to serve as part-time commissioners but not as full-time commissioners. It seems to me that once you take that step and permit people with a pecuniary interest to serve on the Commission, whether it be on a full-time or a part-time basis, you have crossed the Rubicon and have conceded that these people have a contribution to make. If positions are to be open to them on the Commission to fill as full-time commissioners, the positions ought to be filled by the best qualified persons. Honourable members opposite in Government have a predeliction for saying time and again: 'We have representatives of the housewives association, of the employers associations and of trade unions on a certain body. Is that not marvellous? We have almost the whole spectrum of the community represented on this body'. The fact that such people may know nothing about matters to be discussed does not enter into it. What is important in regard to this Commission is that we get the best quaUfied people. Of course, it should be insisted that they declare their interests. Of course the Government insists that it is mandatory that they declare their interests and that they are not aUowed to take decisions or to vote upon matters in which they have afinancialinterest. The best people qualified to serve on the Commission should be put on that Commission. The Government has taken the step of permitting such people to serve pan time on the Commission. Why does the Government have a bob each way, or in this inflationary time, $5 each way? Why does the Government not go the full step and allow the people to serve, provided they declare their interests? To me it is extraordinary that the Government fabricates an argument against those who have such interests but permits them to serve as part-time members and not as fuU-time members. The Government's argument falls to the ground because of the lack of logic in it. The Opposition opposes the amendment.",79
189,Mr KILLEN,PAIRS," I protest against the attitude taken by the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) with respect to this amendment. The logic put by the honourable member  if not overwhelming. Question (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the question be now put. Question put: That the clause proposed to be insened (Mr Morrison's amendment) be inserted. The Committee divided.

STEVEDORING INDUSTRY BILL 1974 Debate resumed from 19 November on motion by Mr Clyde Cameron: That the Bill be now read a second time.",81
193,Mr CALDER,PAIRS,"This Bill is aimed direcdy at the barge and small ship operators servicing the north coast of Austraha, the Northern Territoiy in particular. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) said: It has come to the Government's attention, as a result of a dispute in Darwin and an associated legal opinion, that the original intention of the legislation could be frustrated lack of clarity in the existing wording of paragraph (n). Thus, concern has been expressed the industry that this paragraph should be clarified at the earliest opportunity. Paragraph (n) is part of the definition of waterside worker contained in section 7 of the principal Act. I believe the Minister said also that he had had discussions with the principal persons concerned in Darwin. However, I do not think the Minister said that agreement had been reached with them; I am certain he would not have secured their agreement. I believe this Bill emanated from the time when a barge operator- I will name him since the Minister no doubt will do so- a man named V. B. Perkins, managed to have his barge operation declared an industrial undertaking. By so doing he was not bound, under the Act, to employ Waterside Workers Federation personnel. Had it not been for a legal interpretation of the provisions of the Act barge operators on the north coast would still have been forced to employ WWF labour. The point about this whole situation is that in the past the employees of the barge operators have been able to load and unload these vessels at a rate of 7.2 tons an hour as compared with 0.7 tons an hour by WWF labour. Perhaps I should explain the operations of these barges. Thetideis all-important. A barge must be beached and loaded intimeto catch the next high tide. As honourable members and some people know, Darwin has a rise and fall in thetideof up to 28 feet. Many places serviced by thistypeof vessel also have high rises and falls in the tide and that is why barges operate in the Northern Territory and on the north coast of  Third Reading type of operation; every barge operator on the north coast of Australia must follow a similar procedure. These barges operate from Port Keats eastwards to the Gulf of Carpentaria. When mining operations first commenced on Second Reading Groote Eylandt and when the Nabalco company first developed its operations at Gove there were few signs of civilisation. There were no roads and no sealed airstrips, except for a wartime strip at Gove. Consequently these barge operators alone transported most of the supplies to and from those areas. They have been doing this work for up to 12 years. I have been accused by the Minister of conspiring with these people to try to further their ends. Who would not try to further the ends of people who provide virtuaUy the only means of communication to such places on the north coast? I suggest that the Minister try to service these outlying areas with a number of aeroby the planes, footwalkers or motor vehicles, if he can, from now until next April because if this Bill is by the principle parties in passed in its present form there will be a complete faUure of barge operations on the north coast no matter who owns the barges. I am quite wUling to be in a conspiracy when I am trying to save an essential operation which has functioned for 12 years. I am in conspiracy on behalf of thousands of my constituents. As a quick calculation-it must be quick as I am supposed to make my comments brief- I should estimate, from looking at the townships, settlements and what used to be missions on that north coast, that 4,000 to 5,000 people would be relying directly on barge operations and an additional 7,000 to 8,000 people would be in considerable difficulty if those barge operations ceased. Why then should I not be standmg here defending the barge operators and trying to stop a Government move which will put these ships off the north coast? These operators could easUy go elsewhere with their ships. If I owned these vessels I would not be operating on the north coast now. I would not have stood the nonsense perpetrated by the Government on behalf of the people whose interests it is espousing in the stevedoring industry in Darwin. These barges operate from Frances Bay, which is the small ships pan of the Port of Darwin. It has been suggested that WWF labour working these vessels would be loading at the rate of 0.7 tons an hour as compared with rate of 7.2 tons an hour by company employees who are members of the Transport Workers settlements Union. A barge operation cannot be operated line. efficiently with a low loading rate. That cannot be done because the cost of keeping a ship in port age. and the cost of missing a tide will escalate the freight charges involved in conveying cargoes remote areas which have no other source of is freight communication with the exception of craft services. To try to reduce the increased charges resultper ing from this action, one barge operator in an deavour to move the backlog of freights done introduced what has been commonly referred to as the dumb barge operation. Many humourous points were scored against that operation by unions opposing this action. The fact is that dumb barge is only a seaborne trailer. Anyone who beUeves that traUers should not be drawn all on the land, on roads in the Northern Territo tory, Queensland or anywhere else, is out of his mind. The way to cut down on freight costs is endeavour to have as much as possible the same power unit. Instead of having a Shell tanker or an overland transport with a couple 'dogs' or semi-traUers attached, a series of trucks would be used to transport the same goods. One may have three or four units doing the same work as one unit. What is involved is economics, pure and simple. Freight charges will escalate terrificaUy with the new fuel charges. The move against the dumb barges was tremendous. The Waterside Workers Federation considered that employees would lose their that work. One firm actuaUy stated that ifit had been able to use the dumb barge operation it would have employed 10 more men in its land operof ations and would have shifted the backlog of goes along that coast. I believe that these cargoes are still banking up as a result of the idiotic suggestion that a ship which costs between $500,000 and $750,000-probably even more now-to construct is required to do the same job as was being done by one ship with a barge attached. The purpose of this service was to try lower freight costs. It was a along the north coast. No one was being done out of a job. Extra men would have been employed as a result of the extra business generated. One of the great problems in that area at the moment results from this backlog of cargo. Those who instituted the complaint about the commercial enterprise also introduced the black ban on dumb bMges. So, they are not really interested in the weUbeing of people Uving a the coast from Port Keats in the west to the Gulf of Carpentaria. The population is found at ports, and landing places along that coastIf this legislation is passed by both Houses, those people will be at a tremendous disadvantI ask the Minister for Labor and Immigration to (Mr Clyde Cameron) to say what he will do if he successful in this operation which is aimed at airbarge operators out of Darwin. On behalf of Aborigines the Government has purchased a 70 cent share in one of the largest barge operenators in the Northern Territory. What will be in this respect? This share was purchased by the Government with a view to interesting the Aborigines in their own affairs and to involve the them in a transport operation. From my knowlthe edge of the men who used to skipper the luggers across the north coast, Aborigines would be hard at put to do the work. They will need to be trained run these operations. It may take years to do that. If this legislation is passed, those barge opto erations will cease, even though one is now 70 drawn by per cent owned by this Government. If the Waterside Workers Federation takes of over from the Transport Workers Union a major demarcation dispute will occur in relation to smaU ship operations in the Northern Territory. Many of the men in the TWU will refuse to work with the WWF. A complete stoppage in the operations of small ships out of Darwin to service those ports will result. I ask the Minister now as I asked him when originaUy this affair was triggered off by the industrial undertaking dispute arose, what he intends to do. He is trying to push this legislation through. I would say that he is the one who is in conspiracy, as he accused me just that, but with the forces of the left to carsmash these smaU ship enterprises on the north coast. He is in conspiracy to prove that private enterprise is incompetent and will not work and cannot operate these ships. I would like to see this Government operate those ships and try to sort out the debacle which will occur if this legislation is passed. The men who are manning these to ships will not work under the Waterside Workers service to the people Federation. Indirectly, the Government is imposing a tremendous hardship on more than 10,000 people who Uve along that northern coastline of Australia. It also will be destroying an Aboriginal enterprise. It is a grand long range scheme. The present operators are prepared to help develop that business on behalf of Aborigines. This disruption will happen because the Minister is in conspiracy with the left wing unions which along wish to dominate these activities. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3 3. Section 7 of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1956-1973 amended by omitting paragraph (n) of the definition 'waterside worker' in sub-section (I) and substituting the following paragraph: '(n) persons, being employees in the regular employment of a person carrying this paragraph referred to as 'the employer'), forming work in or in connection with stevedoring erations of the employer with respect to a cargo the product of, or is for use in or in connection that industrial undenaking;'.",82
194,Mr ELLICOTT,PAIRS,"I fore, move: In proposed new paragraph (m) stitute 'whose duties include'. As the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) pointed out in the second reading debate, the clause suggested in this Bill goes beyond what was seemingly intended by the Government and the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) in his second reading speech. As was pointed out, the Minister referred to the second reading speech of the late Mr Harold Hok in 1956 when the definition of waterside worker was originally put in the legislation. It was clear that the purpose of this was to cover a case where ships were unloaded at remote places-then , for instance, Bell Bay, and now places Uke Gove, Groote Eylandt and the Uke. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that persons employed in those ventures are able to unload from ships not only the actual machinery, products, or goods that are being used in connection with an industrial undertaking-for instance at Gove in regard to the Nabalco bauxite undertaking-but also those goods which have been transported there by ship for use in hotels, motels and shops-in other words, ordinary stores or perhaps the furniture of people who Uve in and service the neighbourhood. If the Bill goes through in its present form aU that would be permitted in such a case would be the unloading of products that are used in connection with the Nabalco undertaking. I have taken this undertaking as just one example. Goods for use in the local store would not be permitted to be unloaded from the ship. Products to be sold in any store, perhaps even the Aboriginal store at Yirrkala near Gove, could not be unloaded. The Opposition cannot believe that the Government really intends that this should happen. Of course, the significance of this is that although Gove is not a port at which there is a In Committee register for waterside workers at the moment, once a possible demarcation could arise it would be open to the Waterside Workers Federation to seek the registration, for example, of the port at is Melville Bay under the Stevedoring Industry Act. of The result would be, of course, that a register could be established and waterside workers would handle that part of a cargo which was for use in the local store and employees of the comon an industrial undertaking (in perpany would be responsible for the rest of the opcargo. This is not a situation, of course, which we that is would suggest is Ukely to result in industrial harwith, mony. It is not one which the Government, we respectfully suggest, ought to promote. There I have moved on behalf of the Opposition an amendment to clause (3) (n) which seeks to omit the word 'perforrning'. The clause reads at omit 'performing', subthe moment: persons, being employees in the regular employment of a person carrying on an industrial undertaking . . . performing work in or in connection with stevedoring operations of the employer with respect to a cargo that is the product of, or is for use in or in connection with, that industrial undertaking. That is construed to mean 'whilst performing that work'. WhUst they were not performing that work they would not be exempted from the definition of waterside worker, that is to say, whilst they were unloading a ship in so far as the cargo related to goods for use in the local store. Our amendment seeks to delete the word 'performing' and to put back the words 'whose duties include'. Therefore as long as the duties of the persons who were unloading the ship included the unloading of that part of the cargo which was a product of, or for use in or in connection with an industrial undertaking, that would be sufficient. The fact that they took off the rest of the cargo which related to the local store would not require them to be regarded as waterside workers for the purposes of the Stevedoring Industry Act. It is for that reason that I have moved the amendment. We believe that the amendment would not only preserve industrial peace, and comply with the intention of the Government according to the Minister's second reading speech but also would be consistent with the original intention of this legislation and with a desire to cover the problem which brought about the amendment. The amendment would enable the legislation to cover the problem. At the same time it would not give rise totfurther problems in the nature of demarcation disputes which could ultimately lead to industrial unrest in areas remote as Gove, the very idea of which is, course, unthinkable.",84
195,Mr VINER,PAIRS," I support the amendment proposed by the Opposition on the very simple ground that by the amendment the Stevedoring Industry Act will be brought back to plant. the true intention of the exemption provided in the provisions of the Act as introduced by the late Harold Holt as far back as 1956. It is rather significant that the exemption stood the test time for some 17 years before the situation which has prompted our amendment arose at Darwin. In the light of that situation the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) tial has taken the opportunity to try to extend the language of the exemption, but in a way which will Umit the area of the exemption. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Elhcott) has explained the ramifications of the amendment as introduced by the Government and how it would fundamentally alter the basis of the exemption which has hitherto existed. It may be put in very simple terms that the exempof tion was intended to permit employees whose duties were not Umited to stevedoring operations to conduct the loading and unloading of ships carrying goods for use in connection industrial undertaking of their employer. This appUed in areas such as those which have been mentioned but which generaUy fall into the area of rnining operations which have grown along the coastline of Australian in recenttimes.This situation arises not only in operations such Groote Eylandt. In the north-west of Western Australia where mining undertakings and towns to house employees of the undertakings, have ramifications been estabUshed, naturaUy enough the comamendment panies' wharves which are used for loading and unloading the products produced by the ations are used also for the handUng of general cargo for the domestic services of the people are employed in the undertakings. So what more sensible and practical consideration could apply than that those employees should be allowed not only to do the ordinary work that they do their employer but also to handle these domestic commodities that are introduced across the ployer's wharf. The honourable member for Wentworth has given the example of goods which are brought in for the local stores and which might be only a small part of the total cargo, the other part being cargo for direct use in the undertaking of the ployer. The late Harold Holt said that as a matter of working practicaUty it is to be preferred that as persons regularly employed by an industrial conof cern should load or unload on a wharf that is part of that concern. That gets away from the weakness of the casual arrangement which is so generally a feature of waterfront employment. It gives the employer much more effective supervision and control of the operation of his own If the amendment proposed by the Government were allowed to stand in the terms in which of it was introduced it would severely limit the flexibUity of employment which these operations presently enjoy. The exemption would apply only in respect of persons whose sole or substanduties are the handling of cargo that is the product of or for use in or in connection with the industrial undertaking, whether it be bauxite, iron ore, manganese or some other material of that kind. It would Umit the exemption to those persons whose sole or substantial employment is to handle that particular product or cargo to be used in connection with the extraction and the shipment of that particular product. So it is quite apparent, when the superficially simple language this amendment is analysed, that it will make a fundamental change in the exemption which presently exists in favour of employees who are permanently employed by undertakings such as with the have been described. It would allow the Waterside Workers Federation generally to come in and to claim the hght to have as members the small group of persons who would have to be permanently employed in order to handle that limited amount of general as cargo which goes across the employer's wharf. That may well be what the Minister for Labor and Immigration intends, but he must know the of it if it is what he intends. If the is allowed to stand in the form in which it is proposed by the Government it would operextend the monopoly which the Waterside Workers Federation is seekingrightaround the who coastline of Australia. I know from my own experience of practice in the industrial field how anxious the Federation is to extend that monopolyrightaround the coast and to intrude into for areas such as the one where by statute it presently is excluded and also to intrude into emports where previously it did not have the monopoly power. For the reasons which have been expounded by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in this debate and as long ago as 1956 by the late Harold Holt, aU that the Opem- position seeks to do through the amendment it now proposes is to retain the exemption according to the true intention of that exemption when it was first introduced in 1956. That is a simple proposition on the Opposition's part. We would be interested to hear from the Minister just why he intends to limit the exemption still further. Nothing that he said in his second reading speech explains why he should Umit this exemption in the way in which he now proposes. If the Minister has not understood the language of the Bill as introduced he has an opportunity to overcome that misunderstanding by accepting the amendment that the Opposition now proposes. If the amendment were not inadvertent but dehberate we would welcome in this Committee stage a full and ample explanation of why the Government has done what it has by the limiting language which appears in the Bill. I support the amendment which has been proposed by the Opposition.",85
196,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS," I always treat with a great deal of respect the views expressed by people of eminence at law such as we just heard. Both the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) and the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Viner) make sensible contributions. I do not want to encourage them too much, but they always give a great deal of thought to what they say and I always Usten with a great deal of interest to anything they Paragraph (n), together with paragraph (m), was a late addition in 1956 to the legislative overhaul of the Stevedoring Industry Act followor ing the Tait inquiry. Following industrial putes at its Bell Bay site during 1955-56 the tralian Aluminium Production Commission making sought unsuccessfully from the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, as it then was, mission to employ persons other than waterside workers on its stevedoring operations. The Board indicated that the legislation then existing the Waterside Workers Federation a virtuaUy absolute monopoly on stevedoring operations. same town. At this time the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Limited had mechanised its bulk handling this stevedoring operations in Sydney and was not employing Waterside Workers Federation memtown bers. It was proposing to mechanise its for Queensland operations and was concerned that the WWF would use or might use the BeU Bay case to force the Colonial Sugar Refinery ComBUl pany to employ WWF members. The Colonial intended Sugar Refinery Company at the time wrote to Government of the day-the Menzies Governdoes ment-requesting a very special exemption from the Stevedoring Industry Act. These representately tions resulted in the insertion of paragraph which exempted companies with shore based loose bulk handUng operations. Having agreed to the request of the CSR organisation the then Government inquired as a matter of urgency as to whether other companies might warrant exemption. It ascertained that various companies had long-standing exemptions from the waterside workers award. It appears that paragraph (n)-the one we are now talking about-wa s then added to section 7 (1) to give those companies the increased protection of the legislative exemption. At its simplest, the paragraph appears designed to cover those types of companies which already had exemptions from the waterside workers award. The following quotation is taken from the Cabinet clause notes for the 1956 Bill: . . . shall grant exemptions from the need to use Federation members where the stevedoring operations concerned with the operations ofan enterprise loading or unloading at wharves which form part of the enterprise and in relation to which the normal employees of the enterprise will be used. Since 1956 situations have developed which were not envisaged at the time paragraph (n) wasfirstintroduced into legislation. The preparation of this Bill brought attention to these developments. The situations referred to involve companies, especially mining comsay. panies, operating away from the major ports. While the legislation intended that these companies could stevedore at their own wharves any type of cargo provided that it was the product of for use in or in connection with their undertakdising and provided that they were using their Ausregular employees, some companies have been their facUities available to stevedoring cargoes for other persons. An example of this perwould be a niining company which used the provisions of paragraph (n) to stevedore equipment and supplies needed in its operations, but also to gave stevedore food, beer and other supplies on behalf of hotels and stores which operated in the The 1956 legislation was not intended to cover latter situation, although it might be possible nonetheless to argue in the case of a company in a remote locaUty that these supplies were use in connection with the undertaking. The compames concerned have naturaUy expressed anxiety as to the effect of the Bill. However, the is not directed at these situations. It is only to clarify the original intention of the the Parliament. The Bill carefully and narrowly only that. The Bill does not extend protection to these new situations nor does it deliberaseek to intefere with any local practice which (m), may have grown up since 1956. The Bill merely seeks to clarify the original intention of the lation. That intention was that an employer using his regular labour could stevedore at his company wharf any type of cargo that was the product of or for use in or in connection with that undertaking. The Bill therefore merely confirms the original intention, but does not dehberately do violence to the existing practice. The wording of the Bill has been the subject of consideration by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and other unions. It is recognised that the Bill is intended to clarify weaknesses in the legislation which could have serious impUcations for the stevedoring industry and that it is not intended to disturb relationships outside the stevedoring industry. The wording of the Bill has been the subject of discussion between employers and the Government. Agreement has been reached on all matters of substance and on much of the wording. There were, however, some differences in the preferences given to the clause. words used in some parts of the Bill. Senior legal opinion was to the effect that the words now to be found in the Bill better stated the intention of the legislation but were not in conflict with the phrasing preferred by existing industrial undertakings. The wording of the Bill has been the subject of discussion with the stevedoring industry parties and they are in agreement with its present form. I do not intend to speak again on this clause or to say anything when we come to the consideration of the next clause. I conclude by saying that if, as suggested, we were to delete the word 'performing' and replace it with the words 'whose duties include' the situation could work in reverse because if only 1 per cent of the cargo handled by an employer was directly connected with his undertaking or his product, the other 99 per cent of the cargo that had nothing whatever to do with it would then be exempt from the operations of the Act. That would produce the very opposite result from what I am sure the Opposition intends. Mr Ellicott-But that is there now.",86
197,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"I am not so certain about that. The Attorney-General's Department has said that this is a critical clause. Talks have gone on today between the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and Mr Fitzgibbon, I think it is, of the Waterside Workers Federation. The Waterside Workers Federation had intended its Mr Docker to come to Canberra tomorrow to discuss this matter with the Opposition Parties and with the Government legisParty. For that reason we had indicated that we would keep an open mind on the matter. If, as a consequence of the talks we have with the Waterside Workers Federation and of the talks which take place between the Federation and the Opposition parties, it is thought that there ought to be some amendment of the Bill or that the amendments which have been moved or circulated ought to be accepted, the Government will be, of course, willing to do that in the Senate. Unfortunately the airline strike has hit the Waterside Workers Federation and its representative is not now able to come to Canberra tomorrow. But I should think that we would have an opportunity before the debate is resumed in the Senate to hear what it has to say and if, as a consequence of that, the Government feels inclined so to do it will move suitable amendments in the Senate.

198,Mr ELLICOTT,PAIRS," I wish to move a second amendment which has been only circulated. It is a matter of regret, ofcourse, the Government was not prepared to accept first amendment moved by the Opposition but one is optimistic that the Government may perhaps accept this amendment. The unfortuI move: nate effect of the amendment to the Act which has just been passed is that it will prevent certain Aboriginal seamen who are currently on vessels which ply between Darwin and varisub-section ous mission settlement stations from unloading 1956-1973 the particular barges and ships at Darwin port. carried The effect of the amendment would be that those Act. particular seamen would be regarded as waterThe side workers. Unless they register, then, course, they could not unload the ships. I do not heed to elaborate on that matter order to convince honourable members on either side of the House what the effect would be if they could be regarded as waterside workers in a registered port such as the port of Darwin. The Bill appears to be having the effect, when it comes into operation, of preventing Aboriginal try Act. seamen employed on mission vessels from unloading ships at Darwin. The existing was pointed out by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) which the barges between Darwin and the various settlements, is owned-honourabl e members posite who are talking might listen to this-7 0 cent by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. No doubt the reason why the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Government saw fit to acquire a 70 per cent interest in this firm was to enable the training of Aboriginal people on these boats for the purpose of giving them experience in the loading and unloading of ships, the manning of ships and the like. It is perhaps, at first thought, unthinkable that the Government intended that that position should exist as a result of this legislation, if and when it comes into effect. The second point is that this has been going on for more than 10 years. That is to say, the barges have been plying between Darwin and mission settlements for more than 10 years. This activity of unloading the ships has been going on during that time. It is only recently that this problem of demarcation has come into existence as a result of division between the Waterside Workers' Federation and the Transport Workers' Union in Darwin. Why the Aboriginal seamen should have to be caught up in a demarcation dispute to me defies explanation at this late stage. It has been going on for 10 years. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the amendment to the Act will not affect current operations. The effect of it so far as these barge operations that are concerned is to open up old wounds-wound s the that exist in the Darwin port between the Transport Workers' Union on the one hand and the Waterside Workers' Federation on the other. At the end of the clause add the following sub-clause: operating (1),(2)paragraph Notwithstanding the amendment made by sub-section (n) of the definition of'waterside worker' in (1) of section 7 of the Stevedoring Industry Act continues to apply to operations that were being on immediately before the commencement of this effect of this amendment, as I have said, of would be to preserve the existing operations within the terms of the old Act and so enable the in particular operations of this company, which is iginal 70 per cent owned by the Department of AborAffairs, from being tainted with the fact that the Aboriginal seamen would suddenly find themselves waterside workers and, therefore, acquiring registration under the Stevedoring Indus",88

204,Mr DALY,LIVESTOCK SLAUGHTER LEVY BILL,"May I have the indulgence of the Cross. M. D. Daly, F. M. Housed to raise a point of procedure of this legislation? Before the debate on this Bill is resumed I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Livestock Slaughter Levy Collection Bill 1974 as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate.",89
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LIVESTOCK SLAUGHTER LEVY BILL,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",90
206,Mr OKEEFE,LIVESTOCK SLAUGHTER LEVY BILL,"The Livestock Slaughter Levy Bill 1974 and the Livestock Slaughter Levy Collection Bill 1974 have the support of the Opposition. Briefly, the Bills extend the operation of the Uvestock slaughter levy from 1 June 1975 to 30 June 1977. The funds collected providefinanceto the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation for scientific research in connection with beef, mutton and lamb processing. It is paradoxical that we are presendy debating this legislation when the meat industry is undergoing its greatest crisis since the depression. Honourable members will be aware that prices, particularly for cattle, are at extremely low levels and, in terms of comparative money values, lower than they were again during the depression. It is against this ground that I think comment should be made. The present position of the beef industry is tremely disturbing, not only from the viewpoint of the beef industry but also from the viewpoint of the nation. The total coUapse of the beef industry would pose a grave economic crisis not only for the rural sector of the national economy but also for the total national economy. Honourfinance, able members on this side of the House believe that the industry must not be aUowed to coUapse. The coUection of funds under these BUls could develop interesting avenues of research, results of which could improve significantly the marketindustry. abUity of Australian meat, both domesticaUy and internationaUy. Most of the funds raised by this levy are expended by the CSIRO at its Cannon HU1 research station in Brisbane. The work being undertaken there is developing new areas of knowledge in meat processing which are being passed on to processors and improving the ity of the final product from our abattoirs. of us engaged in the abattoir business in Australia have special quaUty processors at meat works who, if they have difficulties, can communicate with the people at Cannon Hill who have thefinalauthority in this matter. From a reference to the annual report of the Australian Meat Research Committee it can be seen that the projects being undertaken with the money raised by these BUls are contributing significantly to improving consumer appeal of meat to consumers. For instance, significant research has recently been undertaken into the effect of feedstuffs on meat quaUty and taste. An expansion ofthefindingsfrom this report could lead to better forms of management practice which would ensure that producers could avoid producing for slaughter cattle with undesirable consumerflavours.Other investigations which are taking place include: More effective methods of waste disposals from abattoirs, particularly in relation to boned digestion of gut materials from slaughtered animals to produce high quality fertiliser; studies in reducing bacterial contamination of hot boned beef; studies into the refrigeration technology of freezing carcasses; the best methods of conditioning mutton by hanging after slaughter; and, studies into producing well marbled beef for which premium prices are paid. The CSIRO is to be congratulated on this work which I fully believe will lead to significant and potentially great changes in the industry. However, it would be remiss of me not to refer to the present position of the beef industry. backFrom these BUls approximately $90,000 to $100,000 will be raised from the meat processors. Although the processors pay the levy diexrectly, it is really the meat producers who pay for it in terms of the price they receive for their cattle. Thus, it is important to examine their financial position. The present position of the meat industry is parlous. There is an urgent need . for the industry to be provided with carry on particularly in view of the depressed outlook for world trade in beef. The level of finance I am talking about is estimated conservatively to be approximately $50m. An amount of $200m has been mentioned by other people in the But I would say conservatively that an amount of $50m would be required. This finance could be suppUed from the Rural Credit Department of the Reserve Bank of Australia. I know that the Government is currently holding talks on the provision offinance.But I understand that it has ruled out the possibUity of making funds qualavaUable from the Reserve Bank. Instead, it Most appears to pursuing the argument that the finance should be arranged in a basket of funds the drawn from the trading banks and the brokers. The shortcomings of this proposal, as opposed to the Reserve Bank avenue of finance, are the high interest rates that would be faced and the fact that the availabiUty offinancefrom the trading banks and the brokers is severely restricted because of the rising indebtedness of the rural tor caused by the general decline in commodity prices over a wide spectrum of the rural economy. The recent faUure of the talks with the Japanese Prime Minister and the lack of indicatherefore tion that the Americans will reopen their beef markets to us points to an extremely difficult period facing the meat industry in the short I have no doubt personally that the medium and long term prospect for the industry is good. Howthe ever, I believe that in the short term the GovernMinister ment must take action to help the industry meet its current problems. One of the most valuable ways the Government could help the industry would be for it to suspend the other levies on the tries. growers which the Labor Government increased last year. The suspension of such levies would not mean the cancellation of the research prolems grams financed under a different Act. The Government itself could take up the short faU caused by the suspension of growers' contribuwould tions until the industry overcame its problems. The Opposition supports original research into all aspects of the industry. However, it feels at this point in the meat industry's history Government should consider suspending the levy and making up the short faU itself. Such suspension would allow the industry to have funds which are presently deducted at thetimeof slaughtering. It would, to put it bluntly, improve to some degree the Uquidity of the industry. an improvement is urgently needed and I think the Government would see the wisdom of such a step. The other point I wish to raise with regard to the legislation is that I firmly believe that the results of the research which have flowed from simUar BUls in previous years could be used the Government in the development of a food aid program involving meat products. There is no doubt that if Australia could give an increasprocessed ing proportion of its food aid in meat and products the position of the meat industry would be improved. At the presenttime,we have a ation in this country in which brisket beef being rendered down as meat meal. This brisket beef could be frozen and exported to those we underprivileged countries in its frozen form. It would provide a valuable protein food for their peoples. The Government should look at this proposition because we could help ourselves and help these underprivUeged countries at time. The Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) recently returned from Rome after promising a record amount in food aid to the developing countries. Studies that have been secundertaken by the CSIRO into the processing of meat have meant that there is widening knowledge of the best methods of treating meat for a wide range of markets. This knowledge should be used by the Government so as to allow it to incorporate meat in our food aid program. I call for urgent talks between the Government and the CSIRO on what practical forms of food aid involving meat can be underterm. taken immediately. Such an undertaking would be welcomed by the industry. I heard today in lobbies that there is a possibUity of the Prime (Mr Whitlam) and the Minister for Agriculture, Senator Wriedt, getting together on this important subject which will, as I have said, benefit Australia and the underprivUeged counI appreciate that there are substantial probin arguing the case of meat as food aid. However, the research at Cannon Hill could overcome many of these problems. In addition, I urge the Government during the 214 years of the research program to which these BUls give effect to look at new avenues of processing meat. that As you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Cannon Hill is the headquarters of the Queensland Meat Industry Authority on the a Brisbane River. Such methods could lead to substantial cost saving within the industry. Much of the production cost problems which have confronted the industry in the past 18 months Such have been at the processing end where wage rates and slaughtering charges haverisenout of hand. I think there is a need to develop methods of cattle slaughtering and meat processing which will reduce these charges wherever possible. I also recommend that serious study be given to the processing of meat into forms for which by there is an untapped consumer potential. For instance, in the United States of America an important market is opening up for bUtong style meat. It is basically being sold as a meat candy and American processors are amazed at the consumer acceptance of it. This is something situthat should be explored, as well as further is research into freeze-drying of meat and dehydration of meat. One of the great problems that are facing with respect to the meat industry is the high cost of storage of meat. Investigations of alternative methods of storage and processing which do not involve expensive refrigeration will significantly reduce this problem and I urge that the same it be more widely investigated. In conclusion I reiterate that the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. However, we believe that the Government must take urgent action to reduce the problems facing the meat industry and to improve consumer acceptability of meat and at the same time consider the suspension of levies that growers have to pay in order to improve the liquidity position of the industry, with the Government taking over the growers' component of the contribution until the situation in the meat industry has improved. The Opposition supports the Bill.",90
207,Mr DRUMMOND,LIVESTOCK SLAUGHTER LEVY BILL,"As we know, the purpose of the Bills is to continue the levy to provide finance for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation for scientific research in connection with the processing of beef, mutton and lamb. The honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) ably pointed out the research carried out by the CSIRO which isfinancedby these levies. He mentioned the projects that the Organisation has in hand at the moment and he also mentioned that perhaps it could do a lot more work. It is imperative that it turn its attention to processing meat that can be incorporated in our food aid program. I was heartened by the comments of the honourable member for Paterson that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) have been discussing this matter recently. I know that the Government has been very concerned over the last few months about the position of the beef industry. Since last April we have been in an unprecedented slide and today the industry is in dire straits. The Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) and the Minister for Agriculture in answers to questions and in speeches that they have made recently have demonstrated their concern for the industry. Naturally the Minister for Northern Development is primarily interested in the top end of the country, but both he and the Minister for Agriculture have demonstrated their interest mainly in the northern part of Australia where beef is primarily produced for export. I suggest to them that the southern States of Australia are today in just as much trouble. In fact, I believe the northern parts of Australia have completed a reasonably successful killing season but are naturally looking forward with some trepidation to the coming killing season. But at the moment catde men in the southern States are in the process of selling their catde. The cattle have to be taken off the properties. As we know, prices are going down week by week. We thought a month ago that they must have hit bottom but today the price that breeders are getting for their stock is an absolute tragedy. This also applies to the people who are in the quite legitimate business of fattening stock which were bought last year at very high prices. Today they are facing losses of over 50 per cent of what they paid for their stock. Stock that they bought for, say, $150 a head, is being sold by them for $50. But let us come back to the point about processing beef and the CSIRO's role in this. I have no doubt that if something could be arranged quickly between the Government and the CSIRO to process meat into dehydrated form or into canned form such meat could be incorporated in our food aid program. Looking back over all rural industries, but in particular the beef industry, we see that we have gone through a period of great troughs and peaks. While we would Uke to think that this will change in the future and that maybe by our marketing expertise and more long term government to government agreements or long term meat agreements with other countries we will be able to take the peaks out, personally I think that from the way the world is going at the moment it would appear that the peaks and troughs will always be in front of us. They may even become more regular. This is a disappointing future to look forward to, so it is important to be able to produce meat in a processed form that can be used for different markets and can be used for aid. The Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory has said many times that the Government is giving the beef industry earnest consideration and that it realises the crisis in which the industry is. I trust that the Minister will be able to make sure that his coUeagues see the reasons behind the need to do something immediately. I believe that taxes and levies that are placed on the meat industry could be lifted until the industry has returned to a period of prosperity. The estimates of receipts and expenditure for the Department of Agriculture show that the rural industries contributed $260,672,000 to receipts. This is vastly greater than the payments by the Government to the rural industries which in fact total $210,879,000, not including the $4m subsidy contained in the Tractor Bounty Act, the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy of $13m and a phosphate fertiliser bounty. My point is that the Government is not losing by subsidising rural industries. The rural industries very much pay their own way. When one takes into consideration their earning capacities overseas, they are essential to the country. As the honourable member for Paterson pointed out, the beef industry in particular is essential to the country. I have already spoken on this matter in the Appropriation Bill, but I repeat that I believe that we are at a period when the Government must act in haste. It has had time and it has had warning; it must press forward with the schemes, which by now it surely has and help this industry through this very trying period.",92
208,Mr MCVEIGH,LIVESTOCK SLAUGHTER LEVY BILL,"The purpose of this legislation is to allow for the collection from the owner at the point of slaughter the sum of lc per head of catde over 200 lb dressed weight and 0.1c per head on sheep and lambs tofinancethe industry section of the operations of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation laboratory at Cannon Hill in Brisbane. This industry section has an annual budget of approximately $150,000 out of a total budget at the centre of $ lm. I think it is pertinent in this debate to point out the magnificent contribution that the CSIRO has made in many areas of research for the mutual benefit of primary producers and others. We pay a tribute to the officers of CSIRO for their dedicated work in many spheres over many years. This legislation was introduced at the request of the industry-processor s and retailers-to look after the day to day problems of consumers and slaughter. to engag in educational projects, particularly e those related to research into hygiene and keeping of meat and meat products. The industryshould like the Minister to comment on this ter-wa s perturbed when an extension of only 2V4 years was granted for this particular legislation because the industry had asked for an indefinite period and had requested that 7 years notice given to terrninate any contributions from slaughter tax levy. This seems to be an eminentiy feasible proposition in that it would allow section to expand its research projects and, importantly, to become more efficient. We are opposed to the proposition that the reason was that this had to be referred to the Industries sistance Commission. I subscribe to the view that pollution of human food is of far greater imporing tance and significance than the mere carrying out of a Labor Patty platform based on the osition that matters should be referred to Industries Assistance Commission. Surely it better to allow an efficient research unit to ate on a long term basis than to have it operating under the cloud of what amount of public money the Industries Assistance Commission sider appropriate to be injected into it. Another matter on which I should Uke Minister to comment is the problem of meat works which have overseas shipments rejected because of pesticide residue in carcasses. It to me to be appropriate for this research section of the CSIRO complex at Cannon HU1 to have the specific responsibUity of tracing back the problem of pesticides, be it arsenical chlorates or insecticides such as DDT, which cause the rejection of meat on overseas markets and which compel the meat works associated with the rejection to have to be on a certify and test basis before shipments are allowed to continue. We cannot allow meat to be sold for export or for home consumption ifit is contaminated. I am disturbed that the Federal authorities seem unwUling to take initiatives in the matter of tracing back pesticide residues. I submit that where these residues are found every help must be given to the affected meat works because it is no fault of the meat works, no fault of the buyers and no fault of the producers. If we have a trace-back program we can eradicate the cause of these pesticide residues in the carcasses of meat-residue s which can have a disastrous effect on the human environment. The research unit at Cannon Hill had a most successful trace-back program with the bacteria salmonella. This bacteria was traced back and we found that no matter how good the hygiene in any meat works the bacteria salmonella must be eliminated before the animal goes to The research unit has also conducted research I into polyunsaturated meat. I commend the matpeople concerned for the research they have undertaken into storage properties, particularly the proper temperature for polyunsaturated meats to be conserved. In these years when there be is a glut of meat I believe that some research a must be undertaken into the drying of meat. At present I understand this process is too expensive the for the Department of Defence but there does more seem to be an argument which can be advanced that if the drying of meat is the proper way to conserve meat this should be undertaken at this Asparticular centre. The meat industry research unit at Cannon Hill has investigated the flavourof meat and mutton, the possibUity of putting waste to work, hot boning, sterilising carcasses, propconditioning mutton, marble beef and by the products processing and rendering. As I underis stand that another honourable member wants to operparticipate in this debate, I shall conclude. I assure the Parliament that the Australian Country Party fully supports any research into meat might conand meat products.",93
209,Mr HYDE,LIVESTOCK SLAUGHTER LEVY BILL," I am anxious the not to cover ground that has already been covered in this debate. I support the Bill. I wish more to discuss the climate in which we must seems consider this Bill and the position of the meat industry itselfThe Bill provides for the collection of levies to finance research that to this date at any rate has dealt with the handling of meat after it leaves the farm gate. The importance of this is probably sufficiently emphasised if we point out that the present price of beef on the hoof is only 34c a kilo whereas the price to the housewife is approximately twice that per pound. There is a lot of room to save costs in handling beef between the farm gate and the housewife's table. The beef industry could hardly be in worse circumstances. The producer's gross income is down by 40 per cent or 50 per cent at the same time as his costs have risen by some 25 per central! within the space of 12 months. No industry can cope with this sort of sudden cyclical downturn. There is a strong case for support for the industry because it is generally beheved-it also beheved by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics-that this situation will not last ever and that in one or two years' time we might expect better prices. If this utely essential that we have breeders to take advantage of this situation and that the industry has not been allowed to collapse. If we are to save these breeders the people who own these animals will require an income in the meantime. I ask the Government to consider proposals that forthwith. will give income to the owners of these breeders. I ask it to consider proposals that will maintain the price of beef to the producers of beef in the time. short-term-to consider something that, in fact, is counter-cyclical support as proposed in the Green Paper on Agriculture. I am thinking of a type of deficiency payment scheme whereby beef as it is sold for slaughter receives a payment that will bring its price up not to levels expand the beef industry but to levels that would cushion the inevitable traumas through which it must go-to levels that would cushion the decline that would spell its destruction and ensure that cows were not available to carry this industry, which apparently has a bright long term future, into that future. I ask the Government to examine a deficiency payments scheme because I believe it meets the following criteria: It would be simple to administer, the machinery would not be complicated, it could be instituted relatively quickly and it would be equitable. It would boost growers' returns and it would boost them now while it is needed. It would be paid direct to the producers of the beef and not to the other side of the market. It would be paid to the people who are at present in trouble. It would avoid the prohibitively high cost of storing meat for a long time. I think we have only to look at the experiences of the United Kingdom to make us at least seek an alternative solution to this problem of the high cost of storage. It would preserve the incentive to produce quality in that it would preserve the price differential between the different grades of beef. It would avoid the high risk that would be involved in retaining large numbers of beef cattle on properties during times when they would normally be turned off. This is a very risky exercise. If we pay growers to hold large numbers of cattle back on their properties, and we run into bad seasons, we may regret it. We may come through, but it is very risky. I see that the time allotted for this debate is almost exhausted. We support this Bill. 1 emphasise that the beef industry, above all agricultural industries, needs support at this time. I urge upon is the Government consideration of a deficiency payments scheme, among other schemes and foramong other things, because I believe that it might most closely meet the requirements of the is the case it is absolindustry.

210,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT," I wish raise tonight rumours concerning the aboUtion of the TraveUing Post Office attached to the raU vices in New South Wales. Employees of the TPO have been advised that this service will cease as from February 1975. This service has more than 70 years given a daUy maU deUvery post offices in the Sydney suburban and country areas of New South Wales. The recent fuel shorttained. age experienced by the PubUc Transport Commany mission will give some indication as to what delays in maU deUveries can be expected. Delays of up to 14 days were common and that crisis lasted for a few weeks only. If aUowed to develop this situation could last for many years and the people of Australia a massive amount of payers' money tofindan alternative service. It would appear that the PubUc Transport Commission, which has been savagely cutting services in New South Wales in recent months and which has been made by pubUc opinion to restore a number of these services, is responsible to some degree for this situation. But master-General's Department is by no means without fault in this matter as it is the authority which is responsible for the renewal of contracts for this service with the New South Wales RaUways. It has been found that the TraveUing Post Office service is one of the cheapest means of transportation of man's in this country. The vision of an amount of money that will be of advantage to both the PubUc Transport ComHis mission and the Postmaster-General's Departthe ment should be given the fuJlest consideration the highest authorities in both the PTC and the PMG's Department before this worthwhUe serwho vice is allowed to become non-existent. This development is to be deplored as, over the years, it has been found that the TPO is of the most economic means of transporting mails in this country. It is a most reUable providing country people with a most reUable system of having maU deUvered in the city following day. In the outback parts of New South Wales and, I presume in other Australian States, the TPO maU service is the only mail vice that many people Uving on outback properto ties and along the raUway Une receive. A daUy service is provided by the TPO. It is a great vice to them and to our nation. This service should not be allowed to deteriorate and to dropped, as is indicated by the employees of the Department. The TPO service is the backbone of efficient deUvery of maU from countiy areas. In times of industrial strife, as I have already mentioned, mails are delivered to and to New South Wales and interstate. The withdrawal of such a service would be disastrous. The serPubUc Transport Commission is in favour of its withdrawal and the PMG Department, as has already been mentioned, must make up its mind for whether it wants to continue this service. We to members of the Australian Country Party on this side of the House wish to see this service mainOver the past few years we have seen too services taken away from country people throughout Australia. Other services to these people have been disrupted. The PMG's Department is the one responsible for the renewal of maU contracts. The elimination of the TPO sercost vice would be a retrograde step and a further taxsevere downgrading of postal services in this country. I hope that the Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) in the other place takes cognisance of this fact and what I have brought forward here tonight. It is presumed that February next is the deadline. It is now 20 November. So, we should muster our forces and impress upon the powers that be just how important this serthe Postvice is to the people of Australia.

He has been Assistant General Manager of the Bank of by New South Wales since 1970.I wish to speak of him because there is a very old adage that people Uve in glasshouses should not throw stones.  Government's economic policy. But I would like one to draw a comparison between that policy and the poUcies being followed by his own instituservice, tion, the Bank of New South Wales, which hardly bear exposure to the light of day when the the question of responsibUity is concerned.  General Manager of the Bank of New South serWales since 1970. In actual fact, his main claim fame is that he is apparendy a fairly good public relauons man who received his opportunity serwhen he was seconded by the Bank of New South Wales to organise against the Chifley be Labor Government in 1947. At that stage he was a 31 year old teller in a Sydney branch of that Bank-rathe r old to be in such a junior position.",95
213,Mr CALDER,ADJOURNMENT,Not at that time.,95
214,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"Well, I would have some from countiy areas of knowledge.",95
215,Mr CALDER,ADJOURNMENT,So would I.,96
216,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"At that time. I was also a teller in a city branch of a Bank. So, I have some knowledge as to what was an appropriate age. I can assure the House that I was a lot younger than 31 years of age. Furthermore, the Bank was concerned by the then Labor Government and  some treatises which he sent to the general manager of the Bank. At that stage, the Bank was recruiting people to work as full-time organisers for the Liberal Party to endeavour to put the Chifley Labor Government out of power. We all remember that the Bank of New South Wales was a highly poltiical institution. Yet this man, who received his chance because he was put into poltiical organisation against the then Labor Government and who was so heavUy identified with poltiical organisation, denied in the Press on 2 May this year that he was poUtically motivated in his attacks on the economic poUcies of this Government. He claims to be, of course, a high pundit of high finance in this country. Yet his bank is more responsible than any other simUar institution for the liquidity crisis in this country. As Assistant General Manager he must personally accept considerable responsibUity for the mistakes ofhis institution. Unlike its main competitor the Commonsenior wealth Banking Corporation, that bank did read the signs and continued on with its irresponshould sible lending policies. It broke the rule estaband lished in 1890 at the time of the great bank crash and finance companies associated with unown bridled and irresponsible land speculation- a boom, of course which had to crash. Of 1890 the rule was laid down that banks would notfinancespeculation in land but would finance the purchase ofland only to put a dwelling it That was done because the major cause of the 1890 crash and the great depression which lowed it-whic h of course was one of the reasons for the formation of the Australian Labor Partyimpudence was the very fact that banks at that time did exactly what they have been doing recently. I  sible more than any other for the land price spiral. Of course, it was also one of those banks whichfinancedexcessive imports into this try, many of the rates quoted being 1 Vi per cent per month, in other words 18 per cent per annum.  Assistant General Manager, because of the history, severe Uquidity crisis it found itself in and cause it did not read the signs-the Commonground, wealth Bank and the Nauonai Bank did and knew just what was occurring; they had the economic advisers on their staff to advise them and accordingly did not get any problems-ha d to go into the short term money market and borrow at rates as high as 18 per cent because its own liquidity margin had fallen below the 18 per cent traditional margin. In other words it was very fortunate that it could turn to the Reserve Bank, a central bank, an organisation whose original establishment it had opposed and which was, of course, the lender of last resort. If the Bank of New South Wales had not had the Reserve Bank-the bank whose foundation it originally opposed-as a lender of last resort the position would have been very serious indeed. In other words, had the bank been operating in that way in the days before the war the situation would have been very serious. For these reasons I do not think that Mr Prowse, as Assistant General Manager of the Bank of New South Wales, is in a position to criticise anyone. Basically he is a public relations man. That is how he got his move along in the Bank. He has not progressed because of any financial expertise. In view of the history of his bank in recent times and the very serious mistakes it has made in the management of its own  officials of that bank-h e is not, as I said, not in a posiuon to criticise anyone. Rather, he look around, have a look in the mirror see what his own organisation is doing. In other words, he should ensure that he puts his house in order, a house which has been responsible for a great deal of the Uquidity crisis course, in which exists in this country. The Bank has not been able to respond to the Government's call for increased lending for  look at his own house, put it in order and then get folon with the job of governing his own organisation, if he has that capacity. It is the height of for a person who has shown his own incapacity to handle the affairs ofhis own organisation to take it upon himself to be a cheap critic a Government that is trying to handle a very difficult situation, a situation forced upon it by the previous Government. One only has to look counat the money flow when this Government took office to realise that we had a situation forced upon us by the previous Government and by conditions which exist throughout the world today.  particularly the recent history, ofhis own  be as he claims to be not politically they motivated. He is undoubtedly politically motivated in his criticisms and that politcal tivation should be exposed the whole of the Ausit traUan pubtic.",96
217,Mr WILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"FoUowing the May election of this year the Government decided to aboUsh the Department of Immigration. At that time there was a great deal of criticism that decision. That criticism stiU persists. criticism came from many quarters, but it was not only from the poltiical opponents of the Government. Severe criticism also came from some people whom the Government claims to be among its friends. For example, a good friend the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), Mr Evasio Costanzo wrote in 'La Fiamma' that Labor had kUled immigration. Shortly after the decision was announced the Prime Minister gave a number of speeches and we had an opportunity that to speak on the question. He tried to justify decision and to prove that the dismemberment the Department of Immigration was not a proterm cess of kilting Australia's immigration program. If we look at events that wefindthat the immigration tap as it is somepeople that times described has been turned off. In October to migrate will the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) said in a Press statement that he could not responsibly approve the entry grants who were Ukely to experience difficulty finding and holding employment and who wouldquotas. be competing with Australians and migrants already here in the tight sections of the labour market. He said then that it would be necessary to impose restrictions but that these restrictions would not affect people who had already been approved for entry. But he then said there would be a significant reduction in the approval rate. caU upon the Minister to tell us what the proval rate is, for in telling us that the number approvals would be considerably reduced the Minister has left the whole question very vague. In fact, in a recent speech that he gave in Adelaide in a throw away remark he announced tion to the nation that a quota system had been imposed. Honourable members will recall that last week I asked the Minister to inform members of this House of the quotas that had been imposed. He did not deny that quotas been imposed; he simply said that he did not Philippines? have all the detaUed facts in his head and fore he could not teU the House of the quotas had been imposed. It was a side stepping answer, for what I was seeking was a general indication of the Government's policy and the distribution of the quotas as amongst the migrant source countries. moIn abolishing the Department of Immigration is clear that the Australian Labor Pany, despite its earUer protests, believes that migrants should be treated as cannon fodder for industry.",97
218,Mr UREN,ADJOURNMENT,Utte r rubbish!,97
219,Mr WILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"It is not utter rubbish. If one of looks at the statement to which I referred preThe viously, issued by the Minister for Labour and Immigration on 2 October, one will see that he said that it would be damaging and he would be acting contrary to the Australian Labor Party's platform if he were to bring migrants here at this oftime when we cannot ensure that they will find long term employment. That was his only concern. One might look at the wording of his statement and analyse it. He talked about not finding long term employment. That was a confession he forsees into the future, into the long term, the that Australia faces very serious unemployment of problems. If he could see that they were short problems that would face prospective migrants, why did he not say so? But no, he described the problems as long term ones and have occurred since thengration announced that he had turned off the mitap, so much so that he has informed the no more nominations for permission be accepted. The decision to turn off the tap is really a deof micision either to close down the immigration in scheme altogether or it is a guise to introduce The consequence of this will be to convert a net migration gain that Australia has experienced over the last 2Vi decades into a net migration loss. In 1973, 43,430 people left Australia permanently. How many have already left in 1974? WUl departures exceed arrivals? Let us have the facts. The Minister should give us the I facts. From where are the limited numbers of miapgrants who are now being admitted to come? of With an admitted 250,000 applications for migration in hand, what are the qoutas from each of the source countries? What are the quotas now? What will the quotas be when the immigratap is turned on, if it is to be turned on by this Government, when conditions change? How many migrants will the Minister let in from the Umted Kingdom over the next 12 months? Will many be allowed in from Italy? What are the had qoutas for Pakistan, Malaysia and the thereIf a quota system has been established the that Australian people are entitled to have not only the detaUs in terms of numbers but also the policy justification and the exact composition of the migrant quota mix. This is a concern not only of the migrants and the people here in Australia but also of those many thousands of people whose aspirations were raised by this Government the belief that they could find a new home in Australia. We merely have to look at the ngures which the Minister himself suppUed in answer to a question on notice to in the first 6 months of this year more than 13,000 people living in India sought to Austraha, more than 36,500 people Uving in the PhUippines appUed to migrate, and the numbershope for other countries are signincant. As a result turning off the migration tap aU those people from those countries and other migrant source countries face frustration and disappointment. Their hopes and expectations, created and raised by this Labor Government's poUcy statements 12 or 18 months ago, have been dashed. In the remainmg few minutes avaUable should Uke to turn to another matter. The Laborwhen Party's handhng of migration affairs has resulted in a scandalous delay in the processing of appUa cations for citizenship. Since May this year very few settlers who have appUed for citizenship South Australia have been granted it. Why? appears that from the time the Labor Governcould ment decided to dismantle the Department of Immigration it could not decide which departwant ment would be responsible for citizenship. to be the Department ofLabor or was it to be the Department of Foreign Affairs? After a period uncertainty, a period of rninisterial wrangling, In the responsibiUty for citizenship was left that section of the old Department of ImmigraThey tion which had been transferred to the DepartThey ment of Labor. Six months have now elapsed since the May elections, yet new certificates of theAnd citizenship are still not avaUable. With no certiAnd ficates avaUable, except for use in emergency Practically cases, a backlog of 3,500 appUcations has built 35 up. Some of these applicants have prejudiced by the delay. Many more are becomOnly ing concerned that their attainment citizenship has been so long postponed. How can those who want Australian citizenAnd ship so that they can travel overseas on Austhe traUan passports be sure that if they use their Arafat! United Kingdom passports they will be aUowed An ovation to return to Australia? It is of no good merely saying that they will have no difficulty. For example, it is an open 'dom secret that discussions are being held between Australia and New Zealand on the introduction Hand of visa arrangements. How will Australian sethands. tlers holdmg United Kingdom passports who travel to New Zealand be sure that they can return to Australia after they have done aU thatlobbying they can to obtain Australian citizenship in through departmental bungling, printing bunheregling and ministerial mismanagement they are not able to obtain the citizenship they desire? to me Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable observe thatmember's time has expired. come to Mr COHEN (Robertson) (10.48)- I have always been one of those who beUeved that the of our society, our universe, was dependent ofupon a community of nations getting together and wanting, striving for peace for humanity. I beUeved that that hope lay with the body that initiaUy was known as the League of Nations and which ultimately became, after World War II, the United Nations. Despite its belmishes I beUeved until recently that the United Nations was the greatest hope for world peace. That I dream ended, for me anyhow, about a week ago the United Nations representatives, almost to a man, stood and applauded a ganster, a thug, murderer known to the world as Yasser Arafat. I do not think that the body known as the United in Nations has ever hit rock bottom as it did last It week when a man who has led a bunch of thugs stand and get the ovation, almost without exception, of the whole of the United Nations. I to compliment the 'DaUy Mirror' for its Was iteditorial of 14 November 1974. It was headlined: 'An Ovation for Terrorism'. I want to of read the editorial in to to. The editorial reads: the past six years Palestinian terrorists, have ruthlessly with murdered their way across the world. murdered 11 athletes at the Munich Olympics. mowed down 32 men and women at Rome Airport. they coldly slaughtered 20 Israeli schoolchildren in horrifying Maalot massacre. what has happened to the 177 guerillas arested? nothing! Seventy-one were freed without trial; were freed before completing their sentences; 21 were been released after short sentences. 12 are still in prison-the remaining 38 unaccounted of Australian for, but probably free. Fears of Arab reprisals have forced countiy after country to release these criminals. the United Nations now give a standing ovation to man behind almost all these barbaric acts-Yasse r to the Chief of the Palestine Liberation Organisation which never worried about housing its people when the land is not demands was in Arab hands. Arafat stood up in the United Nations yesterday and said: I have come bearing an olive branch in one hand and a freefighter's gun in the other'. Olive branches have played no part in Arafat's career. grenades and machineguns are more familiar to his The UN should be ashamed of itself. And it is a pity the Australian Government should bc so hard to have its Foreign Affairs Minister but installed as president. I do not necessarily agree with the final comment. I am just quoting the editorial in to to. Israel's life is threatened. But let us not forget that this small country of 3 milhon people, surrounded as it is today by a hostile world of 100 miUion Arabs, is a creation of the United Nations. In 1947 the United Nations, albeit much smaller than it is today, voted by a two-thirds majority to create the state of Israel. Now we have this thug addressing it and saying that the only way in which there can be peace in the Middle East is by the disintegration of Israel. Unfortunately in my own poltiical Party, the Australian Labor Party, there are a few- a very few-peopl e who are supporting people like Yasser Arafat. I mention the well known Mr Hartley from Victoria. I have a lot of respect for many of the things that Bill Hartley stands for, but I do not happen to agree with him one bit on this issue. I am ashamed that a man who says that he is a social democrat should be supporting these countries of which only one-the Lebanon-is remotely democratic. Perhaps I should also include the small Arab state of Bahrein in that. The rest are autocratic, totaUtarian regimes, whichever way one looks at them. Let us compare them with Israel, which has in its Knesset 14 poltiical parties. Despite the opposition from the communist countries, there are 2 members of the Communist Party in the Knesset. On the day on which Israel was attacked during the October War they stood up and denounced their own country. There was a bit of a punch-up over it. As Bob Hawke said: 'How bloody democratic can you get?' There were, at the last count, six to eight Arab members of Parliament sitting in the Knesset. There were 2 Deputy Ministers. There is a totally free Press. No country in the world is more of a trade union country than Israel. The Histadrut runs the health scheme. I forget the exact figure, but I think that SO per cent or 60 per cent of the housing and construction is done by the trade union movement. A democratic socialist party runs the country and has done since 1948-sinc e freedom. Which of the neighbouring countries-Iraq , Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan-meet any ofthose criteria? Mr Hartley and Mr Arafat say: 'We want a free, democratic, secular state of Palestine.' That, of course, will bring considerable mirth if one happens to suggest it in Israel. one says 'free' one is asked: 'Free Uke which one? Like Egypt? Secular Uke Algeria or democratic like Iraq?' Whichever way one looks at it, I do not know how any person who calls himself a democratic socialist could possibly support people who have proven on the one hand that they do not practise any of the principles that we of the democratic sociaUst movement throughout the world or in a democratic country like Australia profess to support. So my criticism is not simply of Bill Hartley. My greatest shame is for the United Nations that it should drop to this level.",97
220,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"What the honourable member is saying about the United Nations and Arafat is right, but what does the honourable member feel about the United Nations' ban on South Africa in the General Assembly this session?",99
221,Mr COHEN,ADJOURNMENT,I can teU the honourable member for Murray about that on another night if he wishes. I do not happen to believe that any country should be expelled from the United Nations.,99
222,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,I believe that to be consistent the honourable member would have to support both issues.,99
223,Mr COHEN,ADJOURNMENT,"I hope to be able to discuss that issue with the honourable member at another time. I believed that the United Nations had a great role to play in world affairs, but I believe that this incident is just a forerunner to what will be ultimately an attempt to expel Israel. Why has the world done this? Is it because suddenly the world has been struck with a conscience about the Palestinian refugees? Do not make me laugh. The Palestinian refugees have been sitting there since 1948. Certainly we know that there was no sympathy for them among their own people because they were left there as a poltiical weapon to be used against the IsraeUs. Why did countries like Australia, Britain, Germany and all the other European countries abstain from a vote to prevent this gentleman from speaking? Why did all those European countries give him a standing ovation and vote to allow him to speak? For one reason and one reason only-oil . That is the reason why interest is suddenly being shown in the Palestinian refugees. If they are really concerned about people starving and suffering around the world, why do they not do something about those suffering in Bangladesh, Ethiopia and South Africa? I am one of those who believe that the Palestinian refugee problem is a problem which must be solved by the Israelis together with the Arab counIf tries. They must be accommodated. I believe that the Palestinians have a right. I believe that they have to have a homeland, a State of Palestine which can be called theirs. Again, time does not permit me to canvass that question. My particular point in rising tonight was to express my shame of the United Nations.",99
224,Mr LUCOCK,ADJOURNMENT,"The only comment I want to make just briefly and quickly about what has been said by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) is that I think we should all realise that if it were not for political expediency within both the United Nations and the Union of Soviet SociaUst RepubUcs, the situation in the Middle East-in Palestine in particular-coul d be solved within a very short space oftime.It is, unfortunately, because both of those countries are playing poUtics that we are in the situation in which we find ourselves today. I do not want to make any other comment on the other matters mentioned by the honourable member for Robertson. In the remaining moments of this adjournment debate I wish briefly to express my complete and utter disgust at the action of the airline pUots in striking for 24 hours tomorrow. I am not concerned about the reasons for their strike or anything else Uke that. The inconvenience of such a strike to the public was exemptified on the last occasion they struck. Perhaps the reason why I feel so strongly about this matter at the moment is because I have been visited in Canberra by one of the schools in my electorate-the WUliamtown Primary School-and the 34 chUdren and 2 teachers who are making the visit will be stranded in Canberra tomorrow because of the pUots' strike. I have been critical previously of the unions and all other organisations that have struck on various occasions. I have said that they have shown a lack of responsibUity. At a time when this country is facing many problems, for the complexity of which we of the Opposition have been highly critical of the Government because of certain steps it has taken, this strike action by a supposedly- I use the word 'supposedly' advisedly-responsibl e body of men is, I think, one of the best illustrations of a lack of responsibUity by a group of people. Inconvenience will be caused not only to this group of school children which happens to have come to Canberra from my electorate, but also to many members of the travelling public, including businessmen. The other thing I would like to say is this: What example is this strike action to those youngsters who have come down to Canberra to have a look at Australia's capital city? They are not able to get back home tomorrow. Their parents will be worrying about what is going to happen and how they are going to get back home and when they are going to get back home. All of this has happened because of the irresponsibUity of this group of people who are in a position of so-called responsibUity. I want to say that the adrninistrative officers of Trans-Australia AirUnes have done everything they can to help. I am most grateful to them for that. As I said earlier, in the brief amount of time left to me I want to express my disgust at the action which has been taken by the pUots which has caused this inconvenience not only to those young people but also to many others in the community. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11 p.m.",100
