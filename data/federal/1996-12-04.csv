1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA",13
2,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"Yesterday the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) asked me a question, which he had first raised on 21 November, concerning an incident involving the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) which occurred during a division on 19 November. In raising the matter on 21 November, the honourable member asked if I would instruct the member for Cowper to apologise to the House for moving from one side of the House to the other after tellers were appointed for a division. The honourable member for Cowper on his own initiative unreservedly apologised to the House on the same day and I considered the matter closed. Yesterday, the honourable member for Hotham asked me if the Votes and Proceedings need to be altered. It is not unusual for members to be still moving around the chamber when tellers are appointed. Indeed, yesterday, when a division was called on an amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham, many members were still moving to seats after the chair had appointed the tellers. Whilst this is undesirable, it is not an infrequent occurrence. The honourable member for Cowper has unreservedly apologised to the House for moving late in the piece. As far as I am concerned, the matter is closed and I do not propose to make any alterations to the Votes and Proceedings.",13
3,Mr CREAN,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"On indulgence: if I understand what you have said, unless I had asked a further question yesterday, you would have considered the matter closed because the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) had apologised. That was something that had not been conveyed to me. Mr Reith-It is not an apology to you person all y .",13
4,Mr CREAN,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"If I can respond to yet another intemperate interjection from the leader of government business, the commitment that the Speaker made was to come back and report to the House on this matter. It is not sufficient, in my view, for the member for Cowper to simply come in here, make an apology and then for it to be assumed that the matter is closed. There is an obligation to come back and report to this House on what has been a clear movement by not just any member of the House but the person who is the Deputy Speaker of the House. It is all very well to say that people move around the place and that people are slow, but this is a circumstance on which I took a point of order on the night. It was a very tense evening because we were being denied the opportunity to move amendments on which there had been previous agreement that we should be allowed to move. I was attempting to get the call to suspend standing orders to put what we believed we had an undertaking to enable us to put. I took the point of order in the division. I took it immediately. Therefore, I make the distinction between this and the point you made to me yesterday in relation to the Costello incident that I should have raised it at the time. I might say on that point that I was conscious of the fact that I was being held away from the dispatch box, but I viewed the video after I left the place that night-and you might recall that we did not sit on the Wednesday because the President of the United States was here. But I took the opportunity at the first available instance to draw your attention to the video because I think it demonstrates what was a clear attempt to prevent me from getting to the dispatch box. The Tuesday night was a very difficult period. All I am saying is that we believe that agreements were breached. It is in those circumstances that we are entitled to pursue every tactic and every interest that we are capable of. When the point was made to the Deputy Speaker of the House, he said on the night that he was not in breach. Not only did I take a point of order that night in relation to this,  Standing order 202 is quite specific. It says: On the tellers being appointed, every Member within the seats allotted to Members shall vote and no Member may move from his or her place until the result of the division is announced. On the night when you asked the member for Cowper to reflect, he effectively said he was in the place at the right time. I accept that you were entitled on that night to accept his word, but I invited you to view the video. What is clear from the video is that, once the tellers were appointed, the angle shot of this chamber shows the member for Cowper moving from his seat in complete contravention of standing order 202. It may be that others who are new to this place and others who have been in this place and do not read the standing orders because they are difficult to comprehendMr Reith-You have trouble with them.",13
5,Mr CREAN,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"All of us have difficulty with them, but my point is not the Deputy Speaker, not the person who aspires to office in this place, not the second most important presiding officer in the chamber, not that person. So let us not have any silly quips from your side. These people put themselves up for office to uphold the standing orders of this place, to enforce the procedures. The simple fact of the matter is that what the member for Cowper did was in contravention of standing order 202. I do not believe that there is any question about that. I do not believe that a simple apology is sufficient, although I accept that that is important. He gave you wrong advice, in my view, on the night. Had he given you the correct advice on the night, the issue could have been corrected at the time in accordance with standing order 208. You could have recommitted the division or asked the member to return to his seat. The fact of the matter is that that time has passed; the vote has been taken. What now needs to be done, in my view, is have the Votes and Proceedings corrected to reflect the fact that the member for Cowper moved from where he was sitting and he should not have been able to do it. I argue this very strongly, because I think we have had difficult circumstances in this place over the last few weeks. I know that tensions have run high, but I think that we have an obligation, if in fact anything is to be taken by the lifting of the standards, the independence of rulings and all of those sorts of things, to enforce standing orders where there have been clear breaches of them. Mr Speaker, because the time has passed for correction understanding order 208, I would suggest to you that what needs to be reflected in the Votes and Proceedings is where the member for Cowper was sitting when the tellers were appointed. I would urge you to reflect on that point. It is all very well to say that we are not going to enter into video replays and all those sorts of things. The simple fact of the matter is these are matters of record now. There are times when everyone can have different interpretations. In the heat of the moment people say things and then, after they have reflected on them, realise they were wrong and come back into the House and say so. I acknowledge the fact that the member for Cowper did the right thing at an early opportunity, but at the time when we could have corrected this under 208, either because of wrong information to you or because there was uncertainty about precisely what had been involved, we accepted what had been said. I know of in what detailed form you have gone through what was at issue yesterday in relation to the correction of the Hansard record for the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I say you have to go through the same level of detail here and you have to, as a consequence of that, correct the record in terms of the vote. The member for Cowper was not entitled to move. You know he was not entitled to move. The standing orders say he was not entitled to move. But, most importantly, the member for Cowper knew he should not have moved. He is the Deputy Speaker of this House. He, second to you only, has the responsibility to uphold the standing orders in this place. The fact that he did not do it I think is a sad reflection, but he has apologised. What is now needed is for the votes to retlect where he sat and be therefore altered accordingly.",14
6,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, just to brietly respond to the remarks made by the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), and to add to the comments which you have made on this matter. I must say that I do think that the Manager of Opposition Business is attempting to make a mountain out of a molehill. The member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) acted entirely reasonably. The point was put that he apologised without reservation to the House. He could not have acted in a more appropriate way in accordance with the spirit of the forms and procedures of this House-unlike, I must say, one previous occasion when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) withdrew but failed to apologise, which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) reminded us of yesterday. But I do think just taking a common sense approach to this matter would lead us to the conclusion that the intent of the standing orders is that, when we have a division, a division is called, the bells are rung, people come into the chamber and everybody, as the standing orders basically say, has to take their seat so the tellers can work out who is on which side. Obviously, in that process we have people coming in late, they are not sure which side they are going to sit on and they are not sure what the division is about. Many a time we have seen people work out what is actually happening and finally take their seat in a proper way. This is human nature. This is a sort of practical, common sense outcome of the system we have. As you said, Mr Speaker, in your short statement-and a short statement, quite frankly, is all that is necessary to dispose of this matter, despite the long speech we have had from the member for Hotham: ... yesterday, when a division was called on an amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham, many members were still moving to seats after the chair had appointed the tellers. What you say is perfectly right, a fair retlection. Even only yesterday we had such an example. It is not a big thing. In fact, there nothing in this. To make a song and dance about it as the Manager of Opposition Business does just makes me wonder why he should do so. Mr Crean-It is in breach of the standing orders.",15
7,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"Okay; why didn't you get up yesterday and say that it is dreadful that all these experienced members on your side had not taken their seats at the time the tellers were appointed? Why didn't you say so? Because it would be an absolute absurdity for you to do so. Your claim that the member for Cowper is an experienced member, which he is-he is highly respected in the chamber for his experience, competence and the like-is not a strong point in support of your argument, because the reality is that the same could be said of a whole lot of people yesterday who were not seated at the point in time when the tellers were appointed. Quite frankly, what are you on about? Mr Crean-What are you on aboutdebasing the standards?",15
8,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"What I am on about is the most you could say is that there was an inadvertent delayed move for which an apology has been made and the Speaker has ruled on the matter. That is basically it. That is the end of the game. I do not need to delay the House but to simply reinforce our view of the matter: the Speaker's statement is a sensible, common sense approach to the issue. On that basis, we would expect that the common sense approach to the standing order will continue to be applied by the chair.",15
9,Mr FILING,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, if I can just make a small contribution from an independent perspective. I agree with the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). If I may say so, the House of Representatives Practice, on my reading of it, entirely supports your statement. In fact, the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), having apologised, probably was doing so in deference to the interests of the House. He perhaps has overreacted, in a sense. Quite clearly the House of Representatives Practice gives not only the precedent but also, is in my view, the theme of how a division should be counted or how divisions should be conducted, to the extent where on a couple of occasions the House has accepted members crossing after the appointment of tellers. As we all know, when there are errors in the counting of divisions, the errors are often corrected by agreement between, for instance, the whips of the respective parties or other interested parties to ensure that the Votes and Proceedings are in fact an accurate record of what took place in the chamber. I want to reflect on one aspect of this. Obviously the configuration of the House and the way in which divisions are conducted give rise often to difficulties in movement. Mr Speaker, you have obviously reflected on the point raised by not only the member for Hotham but also, I think, another member who felt that he was physically prevented from moving freely in the chamber. That is something of concern to me as a member. Mr Speaker, you were not present last night-the Deputy Speaker was-when I brought attention to the fact that the Chief Government Whip and the Leader of the House were moving around and speaking to members during a debate. I feel strongly that, in divisions in particular-given the size of the House and the fact that sometimes members come into the chamber at the very last minute, having arrived perhaps from the furthest point in the House, often the library or elsewhere-at times it is difficult to be able to ascertain how one ought to vote and to which side of the House one ought to go. I know that members of parties often walk in, look for their nearest friends or allies and them.",15
10,Mr CADMAN,MEMBER FOR COWPER,So do the Independents at times.,16
11,Mr FILING,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"I was just going to make that observation. The Chief Government Whip has assisted me by making the observation that, if you are exercising your conscience on every single motion that is before the House, then quite clearly-if you have just marched into the chamber at the very last instance he fore the bells have stopped ringing, having arrived from, say, the library committee, which is conducted right at the other end of the building-you need to be able to be in a position to ascertain exactly what the motion is that you are voting on. Sometimes that is impossible to ascertain. Clearly, if you are in the library committee or somewhere else, it is very difficult to know exactly what is being conducted in the chamber at that particular time. When I come into the chamber, I will often ask the clerks or whoever is at the clerks bench what exactly is the question before the House. That obviously takes some time, particularly if there are amendments available on the table for a member to make their mind up on and to exercise their vote according to their conscience.  you.",16
12,Mr FILING,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"The member for Sturt, in interjecting, betrays unfortunately an aspect of the partisan system that we have, where in fact many members unfortunately-and of course their constituents probably do not know this-walk in, look for their mate and do not have a clue what they are voting on. The worse case offenders unfortunately are on this side of the House-the members of the Labor Party. They are in fact committed in writing to doing that each and every time. I know the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) has most recently exercised his conscience to cross the floor and vote according to his conscience and the interests of his constituents. In conclusion, I agree with the Leader of the House: this is a mountain being made out join of a molehill. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Manager of Opposition Business is interested in somehow persecuting Deputy Speaker Nehl for what quite clearly is provided for in the standing orders and in the House of Representatives Practice-that is, obviously for him to be able to move to the position which he wants to be into represent the interests of his constituents and to vote freely in this chamber.  Speaker, on indulgenceMr Reith-Why are you seeking indulgence?  time. There are a few points that I would like to make. Firstly, it is important that one recognises that the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) has apologised to the House, and I thank him for that, and I am sure is interested in ensuring the good conduct of the House. Secondly, it is important that all members, no matter what rank in this place, at all times should assist you, Mr Speaker, with regard to fulfilling the standing orders or in the way we report our actions so that you can adequately rule on them. A lot has been said about how the events occurred and I just want to take up the remark by the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), that this was similar to members of parliament meandering into the House and assuming a seat. Of course the reality is, and I understand the video would show, that the issue arose in relation to the member for Cowper occupying one seat and then moving to another, which is a completely different issue from people arriving or meandering in late. Last but not least, the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has raised the issue of how the vote should be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. I, too, think that, whilst accepting unreservedly the apology of the member for Cowper, the vote should be altered to reflect what physically happened.",16
13,Mr NEHL,MEMBER FOR COWPER,I seek leave to make a personal explanation. Leave granted.,17
14,Mr NEHL,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"I have not any intention and will not enter into the debate on this matter. However, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), when he was speaking earlier, indicated that he believed that I had misled you, Mr Speaker, when you questioned me following the points of order on that night. Mr Speaker, I felt that it was incorrect for the member for Hotham to do that and I remind you that you said: I call on the honourable member for Cowper to restore himself to the position he was in when the division was called, if necessary. I said: Mr Speaker, when you said the ayes will pass to the right of the chair and the noes to the left, herewhich was the seat on that side. The video, which I have seen since I made my apology, clearly shows that at the start of the division and when the division was called I was sitting in that seat. I did move, as I said in my apology, to the left of the chair, and I moved back. But the member for Hotham did me an injustice when he implied that I had misled you.",17
15,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"I thank all members for their contribution. I recognise that we demand very high standards of our presiding officers, and the unreserved apology from the member for Cowper reflects his genuine concern to maintain those very high standards. I take very special note of the contribution from the member for Hotham, but I do now consider that we have reflected on this matter enough. I have ruled on the matter, and I consider the issue closed. The point that I should also make is that Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I have a",17
16,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"No, I have not finished. Mr Crean-All right.",17
17,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"The standing orders are dynamic, and we have procedures committees that evaluate from time to time aspects that require change, and you would all know that the conduct of divisions in this chamber is one of those areas that are very much under review at this moment. The honourable member for Hotham. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I take it then that, in terms of my request to youMr Reith-Hang on, what is this? Mr MCGauran-Is this on indulgence or a point of order? Mr Crean-It is on indulgenceMr MCGauran-Ask for it. Mr Crean-and I have the call from the Speaker. We get called for interjections on this side, Mr Speaker. I am entitled to make my point free of interjection. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order.",17
18,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"Order! The honourable I was member for Hotham will resume his seat. The minister. Mr Reith-My point of order is this: the member for Hotham rises to the dispatch box to seek the call. You give him the call, fair enough, that is the standing orders. That is how the system works. It is then incumbent on him to make a point of order, seek indulgence or in some way give a basis for his intervention. Mr Speaker, you have said that that is the end of the matter. It is absolutely absurd-we have had 25 minutes on this matter. It could not have been clearer. basis, I invite you, Mr SPEAKER - as you have said-to have the matter concluded and leave it at that.",17
19,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"The honourable member for Hotham, are you going to pursue the issue that I now consider closed? Mr Crean-Yes, I am.",18
20,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"Then resume your seat. Mr Crean-I move dissent from your ruling, Mr Speaker. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: there is no ruling. It is simply that Mr Leo MCLeay-What! He just saidMr Reith-No, I hear the words ofMr Crean-Point of order, Mr Speaker.",18
21,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"Order! I am listening to one point of order. The minister in on his feet. Mr Reith-I am putting my point of order. I hear the words that the Speaker has used, but the processes are that the Speaker is moving on to the next item of business. That is not a ruling in accordance with the standing orders. He is simply proceeding with the business of the House. If you wish to intervene and take this matter further-one can only surmise what the reasons might be for this obsession you have with this trivia, quite frankly-then the course of action open to you is to move a substantive motion, which suhstantive motion I can tell you now we will oppose. We are not in favour of a filibustering tactic from the opposition. We had it last night till after midnight. I can assure the Manager of Opposition Business we are prepared to be very reasonable and give people an opportunity to be heard, but we are not going to put up with a filibustering tactic from the opposition. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, on the point of order",18
22,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"Are you asking for a point of order as the member for Watson? Mr Leo MCLeay-No, as Deputy Manager of Opposition Business and the person who will second the dissent motion moved by the On that Manager of Opposition Business. Mr Reith-You haven't seconded it. It has not been received.",18
23,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"It has not been received. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, when the Manager of Opposition Business asked you whether you would have the Votes and Proceedings changed, you made some comments and at the end of your contribution-if you look at the Hansard and see the tape, and if my colleague over there can actually get his ears washed out and listen-you said you have ruled on that matter. That is what you said. You said you have ruled on that matter. You said at the end, 'I have ruled on this matter.' The Manager of Opposition Business",18
24,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"Order! I said, 'As far as I am concerned, the matter is closed and I do not propose to make any alterations to the Votes and Proceedings.' Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, we have already in the last few days had some quite considerable discussion on what is in the Hansard and what is not. When you or anyone else wants to read the Hansard of today, if the Hansard is not a fiction-like we are going to make the Votes and Proceedings if we do not proceed with this-then it will show that you said you have ruled on this matter. As soon as you say you have ruled on this matter, whatever the matter is, it is up to the opposition, or any other member if they so wish, to dissent from your ruling. That is what we intend to do. As soon as you said you had ruled on that matter, the Manager of Opposition Business stood in his place and started to speak. The leader of government business took a point of order. When he had completed his point of order, the manager stood again and said, 'I dissent from your ruling.' Your ruling was that the matter would not be changed in the Votes and Proceedings. Your ruling was on the matter that you had put before the House. We intend to dissent from that. If a person in this House has not got the right to dissent from the Speaker's ruling, there are no rights left for members here at all. This whole procedure is making a fiction of the Votes and Proceedings. Standing order 202 clearly provides that if this man was sitting where he is sitting now when the tellers were appointed, he is voting with us. That is the fact of the matter. Any look at television tape will show that. If we cannot dissent and have our say on this, then I do not know what we can do. Mr Ruddock-I agree with that-you don't know what you are doing. Mr Leo MCLeay-As the minister says, he agrees with that-we should not have the right to say anything here. It is a fundamental matter of what the parliament is about, not whether the minister could get his legislation up last night. My point of order, in conclusion, is that a member very clearly has the right to dissent from your ruling. the Hansard and a look at the video will show that you used the words, 'I have ruled.' We are dissenting from that ruling. If we cannot make that point, then this place is a farce and you are wrecking the joint. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a further point of order: the substantive matter has with in your statement. The words of your statement are hereMr Leo MCLeay-He added to it at the end-big mistake. Mr Reith-A copy of the statement is available for the member for Watson. These are your words, Mr Speaker, 'As far as I am concerned the matter is closed and I do not propose to make any alterations to the Votes and Proceedings.' Mr Leo MCLeay-He said he has ruled on it, afterwards. Mr Reith-That is not a ruling. It cannot be clearer. By no possible imagination could you conclude that that is a ruling. That is not a ruling. You therefore cannot move a dissent from a non-existent ruling. Therefore, the next step for the processes of this House is government business notice No.1, and I invite you to move accordingly. If the opposition are not happy with that, the only course of action available to them is a substantive motion. I can tell them for an absolute fact that we will not be having any substantive motionsmaybe some divisions, but not some substantive motions.",18
25,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"As I said earlier, it is my intention, in the light of the closure of our discussions on the points of order raised by the the member for Hotham, to call on government business of the day. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You have said that you had ruled on this matter. I had sought to move dissent from that ruling, and I am entitled to do that. You, in your statement in response to my question, have ruled on this point of order.",19
26,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"Resume your seat! As I reiterated to the honourable member for Watson, my concluding remarks were: As far as I am concerned, the matter is closed and I do not propose to make any alterations to the A reading of Votes and Proceedings. I now call on government business. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You have just read to the House what your statement was. After you read your statement, a fair amount of debate, been dealt on indulgence, took place.",19
27,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,You have no point of order. Mr Leo MCLeay-Don't say it did not take place because it did.,19
28,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"You have no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Leo MCLeay-That is the truth. You said, 'I rule on the matter,' and we are dissenting from your ruling. You are making a farce of this place.",19
29,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR COWPER,"There is no point of order. Resume your seat! Mr Leo MCLeay-You read the Hansard. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Watson has cast reflections on the chair as he departs. He should be required to withdraw and to apologise. Mr Leo MCLeay-1 would humbly and obsequiously apologise to you if in any way anything I said could have cast any aspersion on anything that you have done today. I do not know how much further I could withdraw. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",19
30,Mr ANDERSON,F ARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"Gwydir-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (l0.03 a.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The government announced the termination of the FHS scheme in the 1996-97 budget. The effect of the bill will be to prevent people who are not entitled to receive FHS payments on the cut-off date from obtaining FHS support. The cut-off date will be 28 days after this bill receives royal assent. For those people who are entitled to receive farm household support payments on the cutoff date, transitional provisions will permit them to continue to receive support until such time as they are no longer eligible. Permitting continued access to farm household support payments will require that the access be unbroken. Once a person becomes ineligible to receive farm household support payments, that person cannot be paid farm household support payments at a later date. Other aspects of the farm household support scheme remain unchanged. The operation of the drought relief payment, the DRP, administered under the Farm Household Support Act 1992, is unchanged by the termination of the farm household support scheme in all but one regard. Those former farm household support recipients who have transferred to the DRP and who are still receiving DRP support on the farm household support cut-off date will not be able to transfer back to farm household support after the cut-off date. This amendment should be considered in the context of the government's announcement on 4 November 1996 of an additional $81.5 million package of drought recovery assistance to help thousands of farmers to recover from drought. A major element of the package is the extension of drought relief payment support to 12 months for eligible farmers. Farmers in regions where drought exceptional circumstances were revoked in June 1996 will be able to apply for DRP support to help meet their day-today living expenses for a further six months to June 1997. Special assessment for Austudy by the exclusion of on-farm assets from the assets test will also continue, as will special access to health care cards, family payments and parenting allowance. Support also continues for farm families still in drought exceptional circumstances areas in Queensland and New South Wales. I am expecting a report soon from the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council on these areas. Farm families will be eligible for continued DRP support for a further 12 months after the date of revocation for their areas. Importantly, my colleague the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, has convened a special rural task force to investigate the impact of the social security assets test on farmers. The task force will look at how the assets test affects farmers who cannot sell their property due to market conditions, who stay on small or non-viable land holdings which cannot generate income beyond the age pension limit or who cannot subdivide and sell their land due to government restrictions. I commend the bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum, duly signed, to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Reith, and read a first time. Second Reading",20
31,Mr REITH,PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes an amendment to the Public Service Act 1922 (the act) to deal with a procedural flaw in the discipline provisions of the act. Currently, because of a procedural flaw, the act does not enable the bringing valid discipline charges against officers of Australian Public Service who have resumed duties in a department of the service after period of unattachment where the misconduct alleged took place when the officer was 'unattached officer' as defined in the act. The discipline provisions are set out division 6 of part III of the Public Service 1922 and seek to ensure that officers or one place. employees of the service who have committed misconduct can be dealt with in order to ensure efficiency in the workplace and to maintain the integrity of the service. Because of differences in the nature of the employment relationship, the procedure for disciplining unattached officers differs from that for disciplining officers occupying substantive positions. This bill proposes an amendment to the to ensure that disciplinary action can be taken against an officer whether or not a change his or her status has occurred since the time of the alleged misconduct. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory randum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA DELIVERY AGENCY BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read first time. Second Reading",21
32,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES,"Berowra-Minister for services Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (10.09 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Commonwealth Services Delivery Agencommitment cy Bill introduces a historic innovation to public administration in Australia with the establishment of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, which was announced as part of the 1996 budget. The establishment of the agency will be a major change in service delivery arrangements for the Commonwealth. Although it will initially encompass the full suite of income of security payments and services currently the provided by the Department of Social Security, together with a number of employment a and child-care services, it will have the potential to add to these over time. It will an provide an administrative framework for integrating access to Commonwealth services in by consolidating services so that, where Act possible, people can get the help they need in The government's objectives. in creating the agency are to provide a much better standard of service delivery to the community and to individuals; and to increase service delivery efficiency and effectiveness. The government wishes to shift the focus and direction of customer service from the mechanics of transaction and process to one which is centred on individuals and their needs. The act scope of the agency's activities will cover services to the retired, families, the unemin ployed, carers and widows, the short-term incapacitated and people with disabilities. It will be the public presence for some of the memomost sensitive social responsibilities of government. It makes sense to consolidate services so that, where possible, people can access them in one place. For example, unemployed people will only have to go to one agency office to seek income support rather than having to go to both DSS and CES offices a respectively as at present. In this way the agency will be a significant step to reducing the complexity of government for individuals and the community. The agency will deliver for a number of portfolios and integrate these into a common point of customer contact. The clear principle underlying the concept of the agency is the government's to put the needs of people for high quality service delivery above the boundaries of Commonwealth departments and agencies. The agency will be an organisation focused on, and specialising in, customer service. It will do this by simplifying and streamlining service delivery through an integrated and national network of offices. It will have a charter, including a guarantee to customers of certain standards of service. The current DSS network of regional offices, together with its teleservice centres, family service centres and retirement service centres, will go to the agency and form the core of its service outlets. It will also take on some offices that are now part of the CES network along with the student assistance centres. The agency will also provide a means for integrating the existing services for some groups needing specialist assistance and continue to recognise that the arrangements for these groups of clients require sensitive and careful consideration. The agency will be located in the social security portfolio, given that the largest component of its activities will be the administration of entitlements under social security legislation. In designing the framework for the agency, the government has taken into account the need for ministerial involvement to ensure accountability, sufficient flexibility allow greater capacity for innovation and improved customer service and the need to ensure a strong partnership between policy and process design and service delivery. The agency is a core part of government operations. All the mainstream legislation for the operation of Commonwealth departments and agencies will apply to this agency. It will be subject to the Audit Act, finance regulations and finance directions. This reflects the fact that the agency will not be a separate entity from the Commonwealth. The government considers that these scrutiny and accountability arrangements are central to the management structures for the agency given that it will be responsible for the day-today administration of large sums of public moneys. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. TRANS-TASMAN MUTUAL RECOGNITION BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr MCGauran, for Mr Moore, and read a first time. Second Reading",21
33,Mr MCGAURAN,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES,"On behalf of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill is to establish a scheme for the mutual recognition of regulatory standards for goods and occupations adopted in Australia and New Zealand. The principal aim of mutual recognition is to remove impediments to trans-Tasman trade in goods and the mobility of labour caused by regulatory differences among Australian jurisdictions and New Zealand. The bill implements the trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement, which was signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), premiers and chief ministers at the meeting of to the Council of Australian Governments held on 14 June 1996. The arrangement was subsequently signed by the Prime Minister of New Zealand on 9 July 1996. The arrangement is consistent with the government's election commitment to reduce the regulatory burden and compliance costs faced by business and to establish a protocol for the reciprocal recognition of professionals' standing in order to promote the objectives of the closer economic relations trade agreement with New Zealand. The scheme is a fine example of what can be achieved cooperatively by the Australian federation. The states and territories were equal partners in the development of the trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement and the related Australian legislation has been drafted by New South Wales. The government would like to acknowledge the positive contribution made by Australian heads of government in fostering and promoting this important development. The proposed scheme is based on the framework of the existing Australian mutual recognition agreement, signed by Australian heads of government in May 1992. Legislation implementing the agreement has been proclaimed by the Commonwealth and all states and territories. The Commonwealth legislation, the Mutual Recognition Act 1992, commenced in 1993. The practical benefits of the Australian mutual recognition scheme have included: greater choice for consumers; reduced compliance costs for manufacturers; economies of scale in production, leading to lower product costs; greater cooperation between regulatory authorities and the accelerated development of national standards where appropriate; greater discipline on individual jurisdictions contemplating the introduction of new standards and regulations; and increased movement of service providers and freedom for service providers to practise in jurisdictions in which they are not resident. At the time of signing the domestic Australian mutual recognition agreement, Australian heads of government agreed to review in due course with New Zealand the potential benefits of participation by New Zealand in a scheme implementing mutual recognition principles. Australian and New Zealand ministers subsequently agreed that the framework for mutual recognition reflected in the Australian Mutual Recognition Act 1992 should be the basis for a scheme implementing mutual recognition principles in New Zealand and Australian jurisdictions, with necessary changes to reflect the trans-Tasman nature of the scheme. The trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement was finalised after the release of a discussion paper in April 1995 by the Council of Australian Governments and the government of New Zealand. Input was sought from industry, standards setting bodies and the professions, and approximately 142 written submissions were received. The comments received during the consultation process have been taken into account in deciding upon the final lists of exemptions and exclusions from the scheme. Principles The trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement is a non-treaty instrument which requests and empowers the Commonwealth to pass an act to give effect to two simple principles of mutual recognition. The first is that a person registered to practise an occupation in Australia can seek automatic registration to practise an equivalent occupation in New Zealand and vice versa. A person will only need to gi ve notice, including evidence of home registration, to the relevant registration authority in the other jurisdiction to be entitled immediately to commence practice in an equivalent occupation in that jurisdiction. However, I stress that a person will only be entitled to practise an equivalent occupation. Equivalence means that the activities carried out by practitioners registered in each country must be substantially the same. This will be the case in most instances. However, if significant differences do exist between occupations, a registration authority may impose conditions on a person's registration in order to achieve equivalence. In essence, the scheme creates a situation similar to the regime in Australia for drivers licences, whereby individuals do not have to re-sit a driving test when they move from one state to another. It will apply to all registered occupations in Australia and New Zealand with the exception of medical practitioners. The second principle is that a good that can be legally sold in a participating Australian jurisdiction can be sold in New Zealand and vice versa, as long as it meets the regulatory requirements for sale in the jurisdiction in which it was manufactured or first imported. This means that goods which can be sold lawfully in one jurisdiction may be sold freely in another, even though the goods may not comply with all the details of regulatory standards in the second jurisdiction. Under mutual recognitIOn, producers in Australia will have to ensure that their products comply with the laws only in the place of production. If they do so, they will then be free to distribute and sell their products in New Zealand without being subjected to further testing or assessment of their product. Implementation mechanism The Commonwealth bill forms part of a larger legislative scheme that involves the enactment of bills by the states, the Commonwealth and New Zealand. The larger legislative scheme has an Australian component and a New Zealand component. The Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill 1996 of New Zealand is concerned with the New Zealand component of the legislative scheme. That bill was introduced into the parliament· of New Zealand on 18 July 1996. However, passage has been delayed by the New Zealand election. In drafting the New Zealand bill, every effort has been made to closely reflect the Australian legislation, whilst also recognising New Zealand's different legislative conventions. This approach is intended to minimise the potential for disputes to arise from differences in the interpretation of the legislation. The mechanism for implementing the Australian component of the scheme is similar to that used to implement the Australian mutual recognition scheme. To come into effect, the scheme requires at least one state to enact legislation referring the enactment of a Mutual Recognition Act to the Commonwealth parliament. New South Wales has agreed to do so, and the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition (New South Wales) Bill 1996 was passed by the New South Wales Parliament on 19 November 1996. The New South Wales Bill refers to the Commonwealth parliament, using the mechanism provided by Section 51 (xxxvii) of the Commonwealth constitution, the power to enact an act in the terms, or substantially in the terms, set out in the schedule to that bill. The additional powers of the Commonwealth will be limited. The states and territories are not granting extensive new powers to the Commonwealth to regulate goods and occupations. Rather, the Commonwealth is being empowered, to the extent to which such powers are not otherwise included in its legislative powers, to pass a single piece of legislation that will prevail over inconsistent state and territory legislation. Amendments to the Commonwealth act will require the unanimous agreement of participating Australian jurisdictions. The Commonwealth act will provide a comprehensive scheme for mutual recognition which will operate independently of other state laws and, therefore, will not require modification of those laws to enable its implementation. This is achieved through section 109 of the Commonwealth constitution, which provides that a Commonwealth act prevails over a state act to the extent of any inconsistency. The legislation will apply to all states that refer power to enact the Commonwealth act or request enactment of it, or adopt the Commonwealth act afterwards under section 51 (xxxvii) of the Commonwealth constitution. Operation of the scheme The focus of mutual recognition is on the regulation of goods at the point of sale and on entry by registered persons into equivalent occupations in another participating jurisdiction. Mutual recognition will not affect the ability of jurisdictions to regulate the operation of businesses or the conduct of persons registered in an occupation. It is also important to note that laws that regulate the manner in which goods are sold, such as laws restricting the sale of certain goods to minors, or the manner in which sellers conduct their businesses are explicitly exempted from mutual recognition. Moreover, the scheme will not affect laws relating to quarantine, endangered species, firearms and other prohibited or offensive weapons, fireworks, indecent material, ozone protection, agricultural and veterinary chemicals, and gaming machines. Nor will the scheme affect Australia's or New Zealand's international obligations, intellectual property laws, customs laws, taxation laws or tariffs. The scheme incorporates a temporary exemption mechanism, giving participating jurisdictions the right to ban unilaterally, for a total of 12 months, the sale of goods in their jurisdiction in, the interests of protecting the health and safety of persons or preventing, minimising or regulating environmental pollution. Before the temporary exemption expires, the ministerial council responsible for the affected good is required to determine whether a particular standard should apply to the good and, if so, the appropriate standard. A ministerial council determination can include whether to prohibit the sale of the good in question and requires the endorsement of heads of government. The scheme will also set in train so-called cooperation programs in a number of industry sectors. These will relate to therapeutic goods; hazardous substances, industrial chemicals and dangerous goods; road vehicles; electromagnetic compatibility and radio communications equipment; and gas appliance standards. Regulatory authorities in these areas will consider whether existing regulatory differences would be best addressed by either applying the mutual recognition principle to the affected goods, permanently exempting the goods from the operation of the scheme, or introducing harmonised standards for such goods. For occupations, the legislation is expressed to apply to individuals and occupations carried on by them. Registered practitioners wishing to practise in another jurisdiction will be able to notify the local registration authority of their intention to seek registration in an equivalent occupation there and provide the required evidence. The local registration authority then has one month to process the application and to make a decision on whether or not to grant registration. Pending registration, the practitioner is entitled, once the notice is made and all necessary information provided, to commence practice immediately in that occupation, subject to the payment of fees and compliance with various indemnity or insurance requirements in relation to that occupation. To avoid costly and lengthy appeals processes in the courts, the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal will hear appeals against decisions of Australian registration authorities, and a newly-created New Zealand tribunal will hear appeals against decisions of New Zealand registration authorities. The tribunals are required to cooperate to the maximum extent possible so as to ensure consistency in their determinations. Conclusion The trans-Tasman mutual recognition scheme builds on the mutually beneficial economic and trade framework which has developed under the Australia-New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement and is a logical extension of that agreement. It is also expected that the scheme will contribute to the development of the Asia-Pacific region by providing a possible model of cooperation with other economies in respect of product standards, including those in the South Pacific and APEC. The scheme reflects the high degree of confidence which exists between Australia and New Zealand in respect of each other's regulations, regulatory systems and decision making processes. It is expected to remove regulatory barriers to the movement of goods and service providers across the Tasman and to enhance the international competitiveness of Australian and New Zealand enterprises by encouraging innovation and reducing compliance costs. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA NA 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mrs Moylan, and read a first time. Second Reading",22
34,Mrs MOYLAN,AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 to implement provisions which will enable the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to focus its resources on issues which are of critical importance to its Australian and New Zealand stakeholders. Legislation which was before this House last December created the Australia New Zealand Food Authority and a joint food standards setting system for Australia and New Zealand. This authority and the unique system of Commonwealth, state, territory and New Zealand cooperation it supports will continue to protect the public health and safety of Australian and New Zealand consumers through: the development, establishment and management of the Australia New Zealand Food standards code; the development and implementation of the new hygiene standards for food processing, manufacturing and handling; and the development of improved and consistent national arrangements for surveillance and compliance. This bill will enhance the authority's ability to undertake these important tasks. The final report of the policy review published in May 1993 committed the authority to undertake a review of the food standards code in recognition that, before the creation of the authority, food standards had not been developed according to the objectives set out in section 10 of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991. The need for this review was supported by all stakeholders, and a timetable indicated that the review would be completed in March 1998. However, this time frame cannot be met because of a provision in the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 which requires the authority to accept all applications (which meet certain basic criteria). The authority is then obliged to commit resources to completing the assessments associated with each of these applications within 12 months, irrespective of the relative public or commercial importance of these applications. There are three main deficiencies within the current legislation which prevent the authority having the capacity to plan, manage or prioritise its workload: Firstly, the authority has no control over the number of applications which it is legally bound to handle at anyone time. As resources must be provided for the processing of each of those applications, the authority is placed in the invidious situation of either compromising the quality of the assessment of each application or breaching its statutory obligation to finalise applications within 12 months. Secondly, the authority is obliged to utilise available resources on a 'first come, first served' basis so preventing it from taking into account the relative importance or value of each application, according to the objectives set out under section 10 of the act. Thirdly, the authority's obligation to assess each application individually means that the authority is required to make variations to the code on a fragmented one by one basis in response to individual applications which generally only benefit a particular sector of the industry. This in tum prevents the authority from undertaking more comprehensive and thorough reviews of groupings of standards. These reviews of groupings of standards are urgently needed to make the code less prescriptive, easier to use and more consistent. The Commonwealth wishes to give an undertaking to the states and territories and to New Zealand that the authority will develop a joint Australia-New Zealand food standards code by 1 January 2000. The development of this joint code is a continuation of the review of the code begun in 1993, and it will result in a revised, simplified and much more effective set of food standards. This joint code is absolutely essential to the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australia's food industry. A failure to provide the joint code within the three-year time frame will erode the food industry's international reputation and could jeopardise its market opportunities in the region. To ensure that the joint code is in place by the year 2000, the authority is establishing a three-year standards review work program. This work program will set priorities for food standards review over the next three years and will be agreed to and supported by the food industry, the states, territories and New Zealand. Development of this work program will involve agreement from stakeholders as to which health and safety, consumer protection, industry and international harmonisation issues require priority over the next three years. A specific number of applications will be included in the work program, commensurate with the level of resources available to the authority. It is anticipated that these resources will be drawn from Commonwealth, New Zealand and industry sources. The applications will be selected for inclusion in the work program in consultation with the stakeholders. Criteria for selection will be based on the objectives set out in section 10 of the act. All applications accepted as part of this work program will be finalised within 12 months and there will be no charge to the applicant. Applications which cannot be accommodated within the work program because of resource limitations will still be accepted and processed within the 12-month time frame, but will be assessed on a cost recovery basis, that is, applicants will need to provide the authority with the resources required to process the application. Alternatively, assessment of the application will be delayed until the charges have been paid. Successful development of the joint Australia-New Zealand code hinges upon the amendments contained in this bill. In summary, this legislation will enable the authority to: ensure that the authority's resources are spent on assessing applications within the work program by allowing it to delay processing applications which are outside the work program until such time as any prescribed charges have been paid; assess applications which are within the work program at no charge to the applicant; enable the authority to prioritise and direct resources to its agreed work program and to the food standards matters which are of major public interest and commercial importance; and charge for its expertise by marketing its goods and services and to retain any fees and charges. The bill: permits regulations to set the amount of these charges and to waive, remit and refund charges in whole or in part; and specifically limits the level of the charge to recovering the authority's expenses in assessing an application. This bill will protect the authority's open and accountable processes which are admired around the world. The authority will still be required to assess applications within the 12month time limit provided that, for applications outside the work program, the prescribed charge is paid. Any person or body will still be able to apply to the authority for a variation or addition to the food standards code. This bill will enable the authority to develop, establish and manage a quality food standards code for Australia and New Zealand which will protect public health and safety and strengthen our food industry. I present the explanatory memorandum, and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Brereton) adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Report",25
35,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"Wakefield) (10.32 a.m.)On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the third report of the committee for 1996 relating to the development of operational facilities at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory. Ordered that the report be printed.",27
36,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report which I have tabled deals with the proposal sponsored by the Department of Defence for the construction of new facilities at RAAF Base Tindal to improve the operational effectiveness of the base. By way of background, RAAF Base Tindal forms part of a chain of defensive airfields across northern Australia and is vital to the air defence of the region. During the past decade, the Commonwealth has invested substantial funds on the base, which has produced a modem, well-designed operational facility. Tindal is the home base for a fighter squadron and supporting RAAF elements. Together with RAAF Base Darwin, it is used for operational training of elements of the Australian Defence Force, often in conjunction with regional air elements. The works examined by the committee included explosive ordnance aprons for maritime patrol and transport aircraft, alert facilities for fighter aircraft, operational and technical support facilities, and living accommodation for personnel during exercises and contingencies. When referred to the committee, the estimated outturn cost of the proposed work was $31.4 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed, subject to one qualification which I will address later. The committee found that a need exists to rectify a number of deficiencies which have impacted on the ability of the base to perform its assigned roles in a safe and flexible manner. In specific terms, there is a need to provide dispersed parking for four maritime patrol aircraft on individual explosive ordnance aprons and a secure facility from which aircraft operations can be managed; dispersed explosive ordnance loading and unloading aprons for C 130 transport aircraft; quick reaction alert facilities at the end of the primary runway, including the provision of sun protection, engineering and communication services; the general purpose movements apron to be enlarged to permit dedicated parking of wide-bodied aircraft and improved manoeuvring of aircraft; a new base command post from which the base commander can exercise command and control of base personnel during exercises and contingencies; and new accommodation for use by personnel deployed to RAAF Base Tindal during exercises and contingencies. The proposed works which the committee examined will rectify the deficiencies identified. The committee concluded that the extent of the proposed ordnance loading aprons can be justified on the basis of operational requirements, improved security and operational health and safety. The proposed squadron operations and technical support facility will considerably enhance the management of deployed maritime patrol aircraft, or other deployed aircraft, to RAAF Base Tindal. The siting and design of the quick reaction alert facilities enhance operational effectiveness by enabling fighter aircraft to remain ready for prolonged periods and for personnel to sustain longer duty periods. Extensions to the air movements apron will facilitate the parking and movement of widebodied aircraft. The proposed base command post will enable base command to direct defence of the airfield and facilities during exercises and contingencies. In relation to the proposed deployment accommodation, the committee has some concerns about the necessity for major expenditure on earth covering of deployment accommodation for noise attenuation at the sites identified in the proposal. Whilst the committee accepts the need for new deployment accommodation at RAAF Base Tindal, the significantly large proportion of the project budget allocated for this purpose and the, as yet, untested conditions under which the facilities would operate, require some caution to be exercised in approving the facilities as proposed. Therefore, the committee has recommended that a further evaluation of the cost and benefits of soil covered accommodation be undertaken and resubmitted to the committee before this component of the project is commenced. I commend the report to the House. NA 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from II September, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time.",27
37,Mr MEL HAM,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"The Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 implements yet another broken promise by the Howard government. In the budget, the government said that it would implement a $40 per hour fee for voluntary mediation and counselling provided by the Family Court. This fee, due to commence on I January 1997, is estimated to raise $0.835 million in 1996-97, rising to $1.9 million by 1998-99. This bill provides the mechanisms to implement that measure. It is important to note that this bill does not of itself introduce this fee. Rather, it amends the Family Law Act 1975 to permit the making of regulations that will allow the Family Court to charge the fees. It also allows for the making of regulations to provide exemptions from those fees. I understand that the proposed regulations will contain exemption provisions similar to those that apply to other fees in Commonwealth courts and tribunals. The concern that the Australian Labor Party has about the introduction of these fees is twofold. First, there are the access to justice implications of slugging families in crisis with a $40 fee for the provision of a service which, in fact, ultimately saves the government money because it helps to reduce the rate of divorce. Secondly, we are concerned at the longer term objectives underlying this bill. The 1995-96 annual report of the Family Court shows that the court's counselling and mediation service dealt with 31,147 counselling and 416 mediation cases last year. Almost 60 per cent of clients of the counselling service and 83 per cent of the mediation clients approached the service on a voluntary basis. In Senate estimates, it was revealed that 75 per cent of those cases were successfully resolved by the counselling and mediation service. Were it not for the provision of these services, one can only wonder how many more divorces we might have had. By comparison-and quite regrettably, might I say-there were 49,700 divorces in the last year alone. I do not want to suggest that any number of divorces is desirable, but clearly that number is too high. We need to find ways of reducing the number of divorces in this country. It is in this context that the imposing of cost recovery on this service is simply bad policy. Despite the fee waiver and refund provisions which will protect the poorest in our society, most Australians who access these services will have to incur this fee. This government prides themselves on representing mainstream Australia, ordinary Australians. They are going down the same path that the Fraser government did with the Australian Legal Aid Office. When they first came into office and by the time they left office, they had introduced so many hurdles that ordinary Australians did not qualify for legal aid. They turned the Australian Legal Aid Office into a referral service. What they are now doing with their attacks on the legal aid system in this country is basically withdrawing the opportunity of a vast number of ordinary mainstream Australians to access our court system. You now have to be either filthy rich in this country or terribly poor and, even if you are terribly poor, they are introducing hurdles all over the place. It is an absolute disgrace. They carryon with their rhetoric. You have to be a mind-reader now because you cannot believe what they say: their actions are in complete contradiction and complete opposition to their rhetoric. You have to be a mindreader now with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of this country-someone who prides himself on honesty and integrity in public office. You now have core promises and non-core promises. And that is what is happening here-this banner of access to justice. It is a denial of access to justice. To place a barrier on accessing a service that helps keep families together and reduces the number of cases in the Family Court is simply not good policy. Not only is there the very real personal pain and financial cost of divorce; our entire society suffers when families come asunder. This is the Prime Minister who prides himself on family values. This bill today does nothing to enhance family values. I note that the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), the Chairman of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, has suggested that all new couples should be given a voucher that would provide free marriage and relationship education. Why? Because, as he rightly notes, this will build and strengthen more successful relationships. Surely the process of helping keep families together is just as worthy of such a sentiment. Or does the government suggest that families in crisis should be treated any differently, that they should be punished in some way for the failings of their relationships? I suggest that they should not be punished in the way that this government proposes to punish them by this bill. The move to introduce these fees is also a clear breach of the government's election commitment to the Australian people. In its law and justice policy, the coalition promised to 'support and implement moves to increase counselling, conciliation and mediation options for the resolution of disputes'. A measure such as this one, which makes it harder for people to access mediation and counselling services hardly supports or increases the options that are available to Australian families in crisis. This is a govern the ment without compassion. This is a government that time will show is mean spirited and nasty. This is a mean-spirited and nasty bill. In his second reading speech on this bill, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) sought to defend the government's introduction of these fees on three bases. The first was by a reference to the need for fiscal consolidation-a problem that exists largely in this government's mind alone. The second was by claiming that the previous Labor government had foreshadowed that it might consider such a proposal in the 1995-96 budget statements. Indeed, the Portfolio Budget Statements for that year did state that the review of court and tribunal fees initiated by the previous government would examine the suitability of fee regimes for voluntary or optional services which a court might provide. However, what the Attorney-General failed to say was that the previous government, in light of that review, rejected the introduction of fees for these services. Finally, he argued that failing to impose these fees was a form of discrimination for people living in rural and regional Australia. This argument ignores the fact that the Family Court provides extensive mediation and counselling services in rural and regional centres either through permanent offices or via circuits. Upon closer examination the Attorney-General's rhetoric is not only hollow; it is hypocritical. If the government really cared about providing services to people in rural and regional centres, it would not have cut funding to the Family Court by $3.5 million in the last year. These cuts have led to the closure of the Mackay and Bendigo registries, the downgrading of the Launceston registry, the reduction of judicial circuits by 30 per cent and the reduction of registrar and counselling circuits by 50 per cent. Nor would the government have cut the provision of family skills training services that were to be opened under Labor's Justice Statement this financial year in the Richmond-Tweed area, central Murrumbidgee, Shepparton-Mooroopna, Bendigo, Ballarat, the Gold Coast, Wide Bay-Burnett or the Grenough River region. Where are the conservative members of the government representing those regions in this debate? They are on other side basically supporting measures that have meant the end of what I just read out. A Labor government would not have cut the adolescent and family mediation services that were to be provided this year and the next in Newcastle, the Clarence, Geelong, Whyalla and Preston. Where is the Lyons Forum in relation to this debate? Where are those sanctimonious members of this House who pride themselves on, and who go out and wear as a badge of honour, their concern for the family and family values? Where are they in this debate? Where do they stand on this bill? They support this bill which is against all the values that they espouse, which is against all the values that they say they represent. That is where I say to the electorate, 'Judge them not on their words but on their deeds, on their actions.' Over time, this government will unravel. It says one thing; it does another. Nor would a Labor government have cut the family mediation services which were to be opened in Gosford, Newcastle, Wollongong, the northern outer suburbs of Melbourne, Geelong, Bendigo, Ipswich, Wide Bay-Burnett, or Perth's south-eastern metropolitan area. For this government to call for fairer access to justice when it has cut $320 million from access to justice programs over the next four years is the height of hypocrisy. The introduction of these fees is the first step in a campaign to remove from. t-e Family Court. its ability to provide medIatIOn and counselhng services altogether. The Attorney-General has said that he would like to see mediation and counselling become the primary means of dispute resolution in Australia. The truth is that well before this government came along, Labor was well on its way to establishing that ideal as a reality. Only five per cent of Family Court cases are resolved by way of court imposed resolution. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the parties either reach an amicable solution or one or other loses either the desire or the means to continue putting up a fight. The reality of modern family law is that the court imposed solution is now the alternative dispute resolution mechanism. But in the last few weeks, public attention has been focused by the action of this Attorney-General on the role of mediation in our court system. The Attorney-General indicated his view on 2 October 1996 when he said: We would like to see a reduction in the volume of mediation and counselling services provided in the court and the transfer of those to the community. This was a view he did not derogate from in his more substantive speech to the National Press Club on 15 October 1996. I recognise that, in that speech, the Attorney-Gen.eral backed down somewhat from his prevIOus comments by committing himself to extensive consultations on this issue. Nonetheless, he went on to say: There is much to be said for the view that the Family Court should be freed up to concentrate .on its primary function, that is to hear and determme legal disputes in family law matters. This approach is at odds with the well recognised need to further integrate mediation into the court process. In his speech to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration to 24 September 1996, Chief Justice Brennan said: Mediation and arbitration will continue to be familiar and prominent features of th- system of dispute resolution in the future. There IS no r-a-on why, in the vast majority of cases, medl.atlOn should not be compulsory in the sense of being a condition of the right of any party to have the dispute brought to trial. But let it be court attached mediation. Either the mediator should be a court officer or a private mediator selected by the parties, by lot or by rotation. In either case, the fees should be a charge on public revenue. That was Chief Justice Brennan on 24 September 1996. It is worth repeating the last line, 'In either case, the fees should be a charge on public revenue.' In direct response to the Attorney-General's comments and in support of the approach suggested by the Chief Justice, Jenny Boland, Chair of the Family Law Council, said that the council had already advised the Attorney General that the court should retain its counselling services. Indeed, in a letter of advice to the Attorney-General, dated 30 June 1996, and annexed to the council's 1995-96 annual report, Ms Boland advised the Attorney General of the council's view on recommendation 7.26 of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues report entitled Funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia. It is this recommendation upon which the Attorney-General has based his view of the appropriateness of retaining couns-1ling and mediation services within the FamIly Court. Ms Boland said: If implemented, this recommendation would destroy the successful conciliation aspects of the court's operation, it would ham-er the sett-ement of matters particularly those mvolvmg children a!1d result in the loss of a significant degree of expertise within the court which has benefited the interests of children, as the legislation requires. The recommendation ignores the important role played by court counsellors, mediators and registrars and omits any reference to the extent to whi-h the conciliation services are integrated with the litigation process. It fails to differentiate between voluntary and court related counselling, each of which requires particular skills and knowledge which the court counsellors h-ve acqu-red and built over the two decades of their operatIOn. The Council believes that what is required is the provision of appropriate primary dispute resolution processes at both the community and court levels, rather than the either/or approach adopted by the JSC. Even Helen Disney, National Director of Relationships Australia, an organisation likely to benefit if the court's counselling and mediation services were to be privatised, recognised the fundamental flaw with the Attorney-General's suggested approach. She said: The best option is for the court to continue to have counselling and mediation services because of the need for those processes to be linked with the court's case management approach. The Family Court has also made similar criticisms in appendix 5 of its 1995-96 annual report and concluded its remarks by making an interesting point. We often talk in this place about the need to establish world best practice in the administration of our Public Service. It should be no different for our courts. Interestingly, the government of Singapore recently decided to review the use of alternative dispute resolution services attached to its courts. After studying alternative models in the United States, Europe and New Zealand, Singapore decided to adopt conciliation, counselling and mediation services based on those provided by the Family Court of Australia. Surely, if these services are good enough to export or are thought by others to be worthy of imitation, then we should retain them here in Australia. Instead, the government prefers to disregard the plethora of expert advice warning against its current approach. The primary object of any dispute resolution service must be to resolve disputes. We should put in place the best mechanisms available to enable ordinary Australians to sort their problems out for themselves. Counselling and mediation are an integral part of the Family Court and that service must be accessible to all. The opposition will be opposing the biIl before the House.",28
38,Mr TONY SMITH,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"Before I commence my speech on this Family Law Amendment Bill, I will make a few remarks on some aspects of the contribution of my honourable and learned friend the member for Banks (Mr Melham). It is fair to say-and I think the member will concede this-that problems in legal aid did not occur in the last nine months. They are problems that have been endemic and getting worse over a substantial number of years, particularly the last five years. A practical example of that is a case I was involved in last year for a woman who is now a constituent of mine. She had absolutely no money at all. She had been basically defrauded by her ex-husband on a property settlement in the Family Court on a consent order. She tried to get legal aid to bring the matter on when she found out about 12 months later that he had not disclosed a substantial benefit by way of a redundancy payment. Unable to get legal aid, she approached a firm of solicitors in my electorate. The solicitors acted in that matter free of charge. More than that, they actually paid her outlays in order to get to the court. When the decision was given, which was not a favourable one, the solicitors applied again for legal aid to appeal to the full court of the Family Court. That also was rejected. When the solicitor said to the person from legal aid, 'Five years ago aid would have been granted for something like this,' the comment he got was interesting. He was told, 'Five years ago? Even three years ago.' So the situation has become very serious. Ultimately, a favourable settlement was reached outside the court in that case, but again by dint of the fact that the solicitors were prepared to undertake the case free of charge, subject to the outcome. It is important to recognise that access to justice, as my friend has said, has become difficult because of a failure to discriminate properly in relation to cases. We have alI seen examples of legal aid being granted in some cases and mysteriously not being granted in other cases, without any rational explanation for those distinctions being made. It is that area of the legal aid system which could be cleaned up, at least to some degree, to enable a more equitable distribution of funding. The problem of funding distribution is very relevant here because the opposition takes the attitude that this is not a good measure, notwithstanding the fact that the measure is trying to discriminate between those who can afford and those who cannot afford. Those who cannot afford to pay the fee will not have to pay a fee, but those who can afford to pay will have to pay. That reflects what is already going on outside of the court in private consultation, relationships advice, assistance and counselling. The 1994-95 annual report of the Family Court tells us that people who had not even filed proceedings in the Family Court were coming to the court and using its free system. Fifty per cent of court counselling servicesthese are provided free of charge and on a non-discriminatory basis by way of incomewere utilised by people who did not even go to court. In a tight budgetary situation where we have to provide for those in most need, that is quite inequitable. To expect people to use outside services and pay the fees for thoseas long as they can afford them-and, at the same time, to ignore an abuse of the free system of the Family Court is not a proper way to arrange the distribution of limited funds in an area like that. That is what it gets back to and why I align it very much to what has happened in legal aid, because of the case I mentioned and many other cases I have seen where inequitable grants of legal aid have been made. The role of the legal profession in this area also needs to be looked at because it is true that over the years many very unmeritorious cases were funded by legal aid in circumstances where one would question, very seriously, whether the practitioner recommending grants of legal aid had a conflict of duty and interest. Again, this is an area that, overall, the government must look at in the context of providing a regime for better access to justice. I believe that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs may, in time, look at that. A Senate committee is looking at legal aid but, ultimately, there are other avenues that could well be tapped into to provide greater equity in apportioning the legal aid cake through a different and more realistic system and in conjunction with the legal profession. The bill will effectively amend the Family Law Act to provide for regulations to be made by the Governor-in-Council for people using the counselling and mediation services of the Family Court. It has been said, and I think this is in the report, that the annual cost of running the Family Court is $100 million a year. That is an extraordinarily large amount of money. As I have said, the bill amounts to charging a fee for people who can afford it and clears up that anachronism whereby the community based sector provides services for a fee on a user-pays according to income basis but the Family Court does not provide that degree of quite reasonable discrimination. I emphasise this again because it will be stressed that we are taking away from people in a situation of great trauma-as has been said by the member for Banks-an opportunity for them to try to repair their lives. That is not correct in the case of people who cannot afford to pay. They will still have that opportunity for recourse through the system as it stands. It should be remembered that on 15 October 1996 the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) made these statements to the National Press Club: Most people would prefer to deal with the whole process of separation and associated agreements over children and property outside of the court environment. He went on to say: There is much to be said for the view that the Family Court should be enabled to focus its expertise on its primary functions; that is, to hear and determine legal disputes in family law matters. There have been a number of responses to that statement. Indeed, the Family Court submission, dated November 1996, to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which is inquiring into aspects of family services, said: However, the Family Court is and should be much more than a courtroom. It then goes on to say: The court, on the other hand, sees its role as attempting to divert people away from its courtrooms. Further, it says: The court would be most concerned if it came to be seen only as a place of last resort, as the Attorney-General suggests. This would create an atmosphere of fear and confrontation among Family Court clients redolent of the divorce lists of the Supreme Court of pre-Family Law Act days. This was the very thing that the Family Law Act and the Family Court were set up to overcome. To see the primary function of the court as the hearing and determination of legal disputes in family law matters is to look at such disputes through an extremely narrow prism which fails to recognise the interaction of that function with the court's conciliation and mediation activities. The Chief Justice of the Family Court also made some comments which, with the greatest respect to him, were somewhat extravagant. In relation to those comments, the Sydney Morning Herald of 15 October 1996 reported: The proposals of the Attorney to revamp family law would 'literally tear the heart out of the court' having regard to the fact that it could lose control of mediation and counselling. It seems to me, with respect, that those sorts of criticisms are quite unhelpful in the debate. In my view, to suggest that the Family Court is and should be much more than a courtroom is to risk the court being pilloried as everything but a court. Primarily the Family Court is set up with a jurisdiction to hear and determine-'hear and determine' being very important words in a legal sense. With the greatest respect to those who think otherwise: for the court to be getting away from that primary function, as it has done, misconceives its function. It is very important for the Family Court to hold the respect of the community, and particularly of the litigants and the practitioners whom the court hears from time to time. So, as part of that particular process, it is important for the court to be seen as judicially active-that is, acting judicially, hearing and determining cases of disputed facts, making decisions and not being afraid to make hard decisions when the necessity arises. In that whole process the role of the legal profession is also paramount. The fact of the matter is that the court will risk losing the respect of the community if the court gets into these wider esoteric areas of, 'Let's feel good; let's not be seen to be imposing decisions that are hard,' and all of these areas. I say that because there is a perception amongst some legal practitioners that the Family Court does not have the same degree of respect as some of the other courts in the structure, such as the Supreme Court and the Federal Court. So, in my view, that respect must be re-engendered not only in the wider community but also amongst the profession by the court sticking to its tasks. It must not, by words or actions, thereby force settlements on people. This is something that we have to be very careful of in talking about mediation and even arbitration. The court is there to perform a function and there are people who, no matter what you say to them, will not settle cases; they want a decision from the court. When the court reminds litigants at the start of a hearing in some cases about considering the matter carefully, having regard for costs and so forth-as it frequently does, and rightly so-nobody really objects, as I have said. But if the court fails to hear a case, by delay or otherwise, forcing litigants to get into a comer and rough out a settlement that is going to make everybody unhappy, then the standing of the court is reduced. I am concerned that these other functions that the court talks about trying to attribute to itself are diminishing that standing overaIl and taking away that notion of being in court. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you would remember that only a few years ago, when the Family Court started, there were no robesthere were no wigs and gowns. But three or four years ago the Family Court took back the wigs and gowns. That was not something that the government imposed; it was something that the Family Court wanted to give it a status, to make it look more like a court in many respects so that the people who appeared before that court would give it the due respect that it deserved. So in that atmosphere, which was something that was promulgated by practitioners and judges of that court, it is important that we do not get away to this esoteric suggestion of, 'It's more than a court; its role is something wider,' and so forth. It really gets down to the fact that people must have respect for the court. It will have that respect by making reasonable decisions in a timely fashion-not having inordinate delays in judgments-and, from time to time, by imposing orders for costs for frivolous and vexatious applications, that are frequently made before it. There has been a real reluctance for the Family Court to exercise that power. I think that is a shame because, overall, that is a very important power in determining the progress of litigation through the courts. For example, if people are never going to be visited with the sanction of an order for costs, the court is open to be greatly abused. But that order for costs is always a factor that can be used to stop that. Therefore, in the context of this particular bill, in relation to the time that is being spent in the Family Court and the expenditure of resources on things other than hearing and determining cases, it is important for the situation to be re-evaluated so that we get back to the court focusing more on judicial problems rather than on the non-judicial ones to which I have referred. I wish to give a very quick example. A constituent came to see me recently. His son had separated from his wife and there was a young child involved. The child was about 18 months old. They went to the court seeking interim custody. The case they made out was that the child was not being well looked after. An independent witness saw the child crawling around the floor and eating dirty crusts of bread. You would think that case would be a very important one for a court to hear and detersenator mine, even on an interim basis. But those people could not get before that credit issue heard and determined. It was decided on the papers. The judicial registrar decided that case on the papers and found that, on the papers, there was a dispute. On the papers, he or she was not prepared to make a ruling on interim custody and that was the end of the matter. I am informed that people cannot get to the court in all but exceptional circumstances on interim custody. Likewise, I was told recently that you cannot get to court for access over Christmas. So those matters are of great concern. People must be able to access the court, because the interests of children are paramount. Overall, I support this particular measure. I say to the Family Court people who are saying that this will cause a tearing system that it will not. In reality, it will the court focus more on what it is there to and that is to decide matters on a hearing determined basis and to decide the issues of credit, as it was set up to do.",32
39,Mrs CROSIO,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"On 23 February this year, which was roughly eight days before the election, the then shadow minister for justice and the shadow Attorney-General, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), released a press release which trumpeted as its headline 'Law and justice for us all'. How very thoughtful of her. In what passes now for entertaining reading, the senator portrayed herself as the harbinger of a brave new world of justice for Australians, a world which would magically materialise under a Howard government. She spoke of people's alienation from the legal system due to the high costs associated with justice and the inability of Australians to access the law. The coalition, according to the senator, was going to redress the inequities of the Australian legal system which had supposedly piled up under Labor. The senator then spoke of the coalition offering support for families under the law. She waxed lyrical about strengthening, streamlining and stocktaking the legal system-buzz words indicating reforms which were supposedly to benefit us all. Finally, the promised that a coalition when it came into government would act speedily on a judge to have its commitments. The coalition has acted speedily, all right. Since coming to power on 2 March, the member for Tangney (Mr Williams)-quickly crowned Attorney-General and Minister for Justice in place of Senator Vanstone; as we all know, she has moved on to bigger and better things-has attacked the Australian legal system on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) with a speed and ferocity that I would not have expected from a man who appears, on face value, to be such a very languid type of soul. Aware as we are of the commitments given by Senator Vanstone, on behalf of the coalition before the election, towards improving Australia's legal system, the actions of the out of the Attorney-General-the member for make Tangney-and the Prime Minister are hypodo, critical in the extreme. In just nine months and they have challenged the concept of free and accessible legal aid in this country for the financially disadvantaged, and as such have plunged the country's legal fraternity into a justifiable panic. The Attorney-General's budget measures will reduce access to justice even further by raising charges and cutting funding across his entire portfolio, in particubasis lar by increasing fees for the use of federal courts and tribunals. None of these actions will improve Australians' access to the legal system, nor will they make the system fairer as the coalition had promised in the lead-up to the election. They are, in fact, a ferocious attack on the justice system in this country, an attack which will have dire consequences for all of us. What we have seen from the coalition as it has tinkered with our legal system since coming to power in March is indicative of what we have seen from the coalition across the board in its approach to government. To say it is all over the place is to put it very mildly. To say it is handling things with all the elan and effortless grace of a bunch of rabbits dosed high on myxomatosis is to come closer to the mark. The shopping list of fees which the government intends to hike, or impose for the first time on our federal courts and tribunals, will drastically alter the shape of our delicately balanced legal system. They will act as a significant barrier for ordinary Australians to access our justice system. The Howard election catch cry was 'For all of us'; but from these and other measures that have now appeared before this House it is now clear that it should have been 'For all of us who can afford to pay'. Unfortunately for Australians, the opposition has only one opportunity to oppose the increase and imposition of fees for federal courts and tribunals which were brought about by this year's budget, and this is it. It relates to the imposition of fees for voluntary counselling and mediation in the Family Court. These fees cannot be implemented without amendment to the Family Law Act, hence our presence here today in debating the Family Law Amendment Bill. Most of the other increases will be carried out through the amendment of regulations to the High Court act, to the Federal Court act, to the Family Court act and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. The Family Law Act 1975 has always provided for counselling, either on a voluntary or as ordered by the court. It is a free service aimed at assisting parties to resolve disputes and to adjust to separation. As to those cases where children are involved, counselling aims to focus on the best interests of the child. Mediation-which, unlike the counselling services offered by the Family Court, is always exercised on a voluntary basis-does not directly suggest solutions to parties, but it works towards an agreed settlement. For parties who have to maintain a level of contact after divorce, who have to preserve some semblance of a relationship-for example, when children are involved-counselling and mediation offer a far less destructive option than progressing towards unnecessary and often bruising litigation. Litigation, of course, almost always worsens relations between parties. If children are involved, it almost certainly has a detrimental effect on them. According to the court's annual report of 1995-96, the counselling service dealt with over 32,000 cases, an increase of 7,800 cases from the previous year. Obviously it is popular and it does its job. Now this government is happy to challenge the effectiveness of the service, to challenge its accessibility, by sponsoring this bill today. If it is passed in its present form, it will allow for a change of regulations to impose fees of $40 an hour for the privilege of receiving the voluntary counselling and mediation servi .. :S offered by the court. As the Access to Justice Advisory Committee-chaired by the eminent QC Mr Ronald Sackville-found in its report to the former government in 1993, 'Clearly, the level of court and tribunal fees is an access to justice issue.' As Sir Anthony Mason, the former Chief Justice of Australia, stated: ... equality of access to the courts is vital to a democracy that takes pride in its system of justice and in the ordered settlement of disputes. The combined message from both of these honourable gentlemen is quite clear: once you restrict access to justice-in this case through fees-you are threatening one of the very tenets of our democracy. With a $40-an-hour charge, the government is effectively robbing the financially disadvantaged in our community of the opportunity to receive what we know is an extremely valuable counselling service. Let me illustrate this point further. Senator Vanstone, when speaking on these fee increases in the Senate on 9 October this year, said most individual litigants come from middle income groups; therefore, I assume in the uncomplicated logic of the good senator, making exorbitant charges somehow excusable. If just for the sake of argument we assume the senator is right and that it is okay for middle income earners to pay these fee hikes, the fact is that when you are dealing with as many divorce cases as Australia experiences every year you are still looking at a very large minority of people who come from financially disadvantaged backgrounds who will find the Family Court fees beyond them. In 1995, 43,47l cases were granted by the Family Court. Of these cases, the court granted 14,369 a remission of fees. Remission is based on the fact that the applicants are either on means tested legal aid or have demonstrated to the court their economic hardship. So, even with those figures, in nearly a third of all divorce cases-close to 15,000 in 1995-at least one of the parties is on a low income. At the very least, you are looking at approximately 15,000 financially underprivileged people a year who will have to pay $40 an hour for voluntary counselling and mediation in the Family Court, along with all the other fees. Here are 15,000 people who stand to have their basic right of unimpeded access to justice prevented. Be it 15,000 people or a single person, it does not matter. If this right to justice is attacked, then that is an attack upon the very foundations of our society, an attack upon one of the very tenets which we believe is necessary for our society to function fairly and freely. The fact that the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General are willing to endanger access to justice in Australia and, in tum, part of the very fabric of our nation, all in the cause of narrow-minded financial gain, beggars the imagination. Not wanting to think the worse of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, the only conclusion that I can come to is that they have failed to address themselves to some very fundamental questions in their desire to fill the government's coffers. What social costs are they willing to pay to bring about their version of economic prosperity? How much of a social gamble are they ready to take to achieve their economic goals? What good is their making savings, often of a very negligible nature, when a person's basic rights to justice are cut adrift at the same time? These are the questions which they have quite obviously failed to ask themselves. The alternative is too awful to contemplate. I would hate to believe that the results of their actions were considered by both of them and yet judged to be insufficient as to significantly alter the direction in which they were intent on heading. In order for the Family Court or for any federal court or tribunal to work effectively, there are instances where the imposition of fees is necessary. Fees for federal courts and tribunals were increased by the former government on 1 January 1996 in line with the then CPI. The problem we had to face was getting the right balance so that the community's access to justice remained unimpeded by exorbitant legal costs and court fees-a balance, I am proud to say, that I think we maintained. The notion of installing an uneven userpays system across the board was as abhorrent to us as it should have been to the present government. What did the present Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Gerard Brennan, have to say about the practice of user pays as applied to our nation's judicial system? He said: With respect, that profoundly mistakes the constitutional function of the judicial power of the state which, as I have said, is to apply the rule of law in resolving disputes and thereby preserving the peace, order and good government of society. I would like to tum to the Access to Justice Advisory Committee report where it reads: We consider that there should be some court fees, even if simply in recognition of the need to fund an expensive social service and the difficulty of doing so with one less source of revenue. However, we strongly believe that even though it is only particular individuals who are engaged in litigation, the whole community may be classified as users of the court system. This is because everyone benefits from having disputes resolved in an orderly manner ... This is the balance that Labor aimed at reaching. In tum, we were negligent neither in our financial responsibilities towards the courts nor in delivering to the Australian people the level of justice that they expected to receive. But what we have here now is a situation where the fees to be imposed reach such heights, despite the Attorney-General's recent backdowns, that the access to justice mentioned by Mr Sackville and Sir Anthony Mason, as I described earlier, will be gravely threatened. When considered with all the other cutbacks to the justice budget, I think the situation becomes even more serious. In relation to the Family Court we have a two per cent reduction in running costs of the court, worth $1.2 million, thanks to the two per cent increase in savings demanded through the efficiency dividend. We have another cut to the court's running costs of $2 million in order to meet the government's election commitments. The court has also seen $1.65 million worth of programs disappear-programs that were promised by the previous Labor government's Justice Statement and which the coalition promised to maintain. Obviously, that was not a core promise. The court has also had to bear its share of the Attorney-General's portfolio savings imposts of over half a million dollars. Now let us look at the charges. There is a new $150 fee-revised down, thankfully, from $250-for applications for matters other than divorce in the Family Court. But, if you want to file for divorce, you will have to pay almost $150 extra for the pri vilege, the costs now having risen from $368 to $500. Then there is the new fee for setting down a matter for a full hearing in the Family Court-$300 to be exact, revised down from the government's original target of $400. There were 56,052 Family Court files opened in the period between July 1994 and June 1995. Each file would deal with a minimum of two people. So you are looking easily at over 100,000 people becoming directly involved with the court over this period. That is an awful lot of Australians. More importantly, that is an awful lot of Australian families, many of whom we know will be far from having the finances and who come from very disadvantaged backgrounds. How ironic is it that the court which impacts upon the lives of such an enormous number of Australians has been hit so hard by the Howard government's first budget? It makes a mockery of the Prime Minister's repeated assertions about the importance of Australian families to him and his government. On the one hand, we had the Prime Minister and his platitudes about the family providing the best welfare support system yet devised and how 'protecting the family is the key to maintaining social cohesion and economic stability in the future'. But then he is not against placing the Family Court-an institution which, hopefully, helps families during periods of breakdown and great stress--out of the reach of thousands upon thousands of people who would benefit from its services via this outrageous increase of fees. Another problem with the introduction of an unbalanced fee system in the Family Court is that, because of the proposed fees that will apply to each application sought in the court, it would more than likely have the effect of encouraging people to apply for everything at once rather than pausing and giving further consideration and perhaps coming back later to make a separate application. So instead of, for example, simply applying for a property settlement, parties to the marriage may be tempted to include all issues, such as spousal maintenance, custody, guardianship and access, in one application. Quite obviously, if that happens, the opportunity for problems to be created where previously there were none is going to be enormous. The coalition inherited a legal system which worked better than just all right. To use the phrase made popular by the Prime Minister, it was 'better than the curate's egg, better than just good in part'. Where there were errors, where the system was inadequate, we had in place $160 million in the shape of Labor's Justice Statement-money which the Liberal Party, in its law and justice policy, promised to match and extend to improve the situation even further. I believe that the government's failing to meet their commitments is one thing but to deliberately go out of the way to make the system most unfair, taking justice even further from the grasp of ordinary Australians, is another thing altogether. The government have shown a capacity to rethink their decisions on this issue. I would hope that they would revisit this question once again. Hopefully, they will realise then that fee increases of this magnitude will be introduced to the detriment of us all-not just the legal system, but our whole society. If the government continue in this direction, they will justifiably wear our condemnation and bear the full consequences of their actions. I certainly oppose this bill before the House.",35
40,Mrs WEST,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"In response to the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), let us look historically at the development of the injustices-not just the sacred legal justice system but the injustices perpetrated by the legal system that are not fair, equitable or reasonable to the victims caught in the difficulties of family breakdown. Do not forget that it is the Australian taxpayer at large who is supporting a burgeoning bill of $100 million to run the Family Court. With respect to Justice Brennan, he does not have to balance the government budget. There is no such thing as a free service. Someone has to pay. In this case, a user-pays service is one practical way of recovering costs for those taxpayer-funded services. (Quorum formed) If, as the previous speaker stated, there are over 100,000 people accessing the Family Court, this is even more of a reason why this particular legislation has to be approved. I support this Family Law Amendment Bill 1996, as this issue is one of the most pressing concerns for a number of constituents in Bowman. What has evolved over a vast number of years is a bureaucratic system that vainly attempts to administer family breakdown and attempts to redress financial concerns for, in many cases, warring family units. Of all the issues confronting me as a new member, this single issue is a continual weeping sore. Month after month the list grows longer of fathers and mothers who come to me in an effort to resolve the difficulties they face daily, weekly and monthly with an idea of resolution of their conflict with either their ex-partner, their solicitor, the CSA or the Family Court. No other issue creates the kind of emotional and financial turmoil that, at this point, seems to have no end. Family breakdown is a critical point in, unfortunately, all too many families in all areas across Australia today. People going through family breakdown currently have access to either the Family Court Counselling Service and the Family Court mediation section, private counsellors and mediators or a wide range of community agencies-many of which are funded by the government. The purpose of these services is to act as the first port of call in the early process of negotiating a breakdown in relationships. What this bill puts in place is a recovery of fees for services rendered. It brings into line cost recovery for services currently provided or accessed at the Family Law Court. The Family Law Amendment Bill will serve two functions. Firstly, it has been designed to remove an inequity in the provision of voluntary counselling and mediation services. Secondly, funds raised from the imposition of a fee for this service will both help to reduce the horrendous budget deficit this government inherited upon coming to power in March and provide much needed additional funds for the Family Court counselling and mediation services. In an effort to reduce the $8 billion deficit, this government has taken steps to ensure that the burden is spread evenly across the community. We have done this with sensible reductions in outlays and modest increases in user charges where those who can pay do so. The government introduced a number of measures in the budget which are designed to reduce the budget deficit and to provide a much more efficient court system. Some of these changes include a reduction of $2 million to running costs. Increased fees for filing of divorce and cuts to programs initiated by the former government in its poorly devised Justice Statement will amount to a saving of over $1.5 million. In the case of counselling and mediation services, the government is saying that those who seek the service from the Family Court should pay the same as those who use the community sector. Before I delve too deeply into the whys and wherefores of this measure, let me give a brief background of the Family Court. The Family Court of Australia was set up under the Family Law Act 1975. This act was responsible for the concept of no-fault divorce, which emphasised the preference for resolving disputes with conciliation rather than litigation. From all reports, this was a sound concept. The court's 1994-95 annual report stated that only five per cent of all divorce cases for that year were litigated. The report also appeared to justify the fact that the service provided by the Family Court is free to all those who utilise it. In fact, service has become so popular and successful that, in the 1994-95 financial year, the number of cases dealt with by the counselling service rose by 7,800 to a total of 32,378 cases. Almost 50 per cent of the counselling was voluntary and held before either party had filed for divorce. It is also interesting to note that the majority of this counselling was used for the settlement of property and maintenance disputes rather than for reconciliation. It would seem timely to remind those present that the cost of keeping the Family Court running is now well in excess of $100 million per year. It is also worth pointing out that none of the 64,000-odd people who access the court service contributed to the running costs of the court. Does this seem fair? The government funds both the Family Court and the community sector to provide the counselling and mediation service, but only those accessing the community sector have to pay. I would point out, however, that those who cannot afford to pay are exempt from the fees. The demand for counselling has been so great that it is not possible for all to have access to the Family Court's free service. More often than not, it is those in rural and remote locations who are forced to pay for the service due to this demand. This is a most inequitable system, affecting the sector of the community which seems to be asked to pay time and time again. Why should one sector have an advantage over another purely on the basis of geography? Before the members opposite start bleating about how the government is placing more burdens on the already overtaxed public, I would remind them that these changes had been flagged by the former administration. This was indicated in the former Attorney General's Portfolio Budget Statements for 1995-96. Also, when the previous government commissioned a review of fees and charges in Commonwealth courts, charges for counselling and mediation services as provided by the Family Court were part of those proposals. In introducing this bill, the government has set in place a number of provisions that the ensure that, when imposed, the fee will be paid only by those who seek voluntary counselling and mediation. This means that, if a couple has not sought any form of counselling prior to going to court and the judge subsequently orders them to do so, they cannot be charged for that service. The bill also allows regulations to be made that exempt certain people from paying fees and services. How fair can you get? These include people who hold health care entitlement cards from the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, those on legal aid, prisoners, those in receipt of Austudy or Abstudy and those who, in the view of the court, would suffer financial hardship as a result of having to pay a fee. Not only the Family Court will provide a free service under these guidelines. Community based services will also provide free counselling and mediation services for those who are unable to pay. As with anything, there will always be those who think they can beat the system. In the case of voluntary counselling and mediation, it has been suggested that couples will elect to postpone counselling until after the initial paperwork is done. They would then rely on the judge or registrar to order the couple to seek counselling. The court may order a couple to seek counselling if issues between the couple could impact on the care, welfare or development of a child under the age of 18. With almost 60 per cent of all divorces in 1995-96 involving children, this could leave open the way for half of all divorce parties to avoid paying a fee. This would be an extreme measure for a couple to take to save what would be a rather paltry fee. It also relies on the judge or registrar to order the counselling. Also, if people seek counselling and mediation as a valuable process, they will seek it prior to filing an application with the courts. This is most important in this whole process. There are obviously a large number of people who see counselling and mediation services as worthwhile; otherwise, no-one would choose to go to community based services for which they always pay. It should be pointed out that section 19B(1) of the act provides that the court can, with the consent of the parties, order mediation. I repeat that it would be with the consent of the parties. This means that, if both parties consent to mediation, they are in effect choosing voluntary counselling or mediation and would therefore be required to pay. Again, I stress that this bill has been proposed to redress the current inequities, not to discourage couples from seeking counselling services; it is quite the contrary. The government is totally committed to encouraging the use of conciliation and mediation rather than litigation. Section 14 of the act sets out the objectives in relation to dispute resolution. The object of this part is to encourage people to use primary dispute resolution mechanisms, such as counselling, mediation, arbitration or any other means of conciliation or reconciliation. This is to resolve matters in which a court order might otherwise be made under this act, provided the mechanisms are appropriate in the circumstances and proper procedures are followed. It is also to ensure that people have access to counselling to improve relationships covered by this act and to help them adjust to court orders made under it. The government also believes that there should be greater reliance on the prevention of disputes and alternative methods of dispute resolution rather than on court actions. The government is providing more money for marriage education to try to give people the necessary skills to better deal with conflicts in the marriage situation. While not actually part of this bill, it is nonetheless an important initiative of this government. Since being elected, I have been amazed by the number of people in child support cases that have presented in my electorate office of Bowman. During the campaign, I had many such people come to me in frustration and with a lack of support from the former member and a lack of commitment by the former government to sort out the Child Support Agency. Since March, I have had a constant stream of both men and women coming through the door. The men are almost exclusively upset with the way that they have been treated by the system either in relation to payments or access, while the women are upset over non-payment by former partners. In almost all cases, it is the system that is at fault and not the individuals. I cannot help thinking that, had these people had access to better counselling prior to getting married, these problems may never have arisen. Once problems surface in a marriage, it would be ideal if reconciliation were possible. However, for those who are unable to resolve their differences, it is vital that they seek immediate counselling and mediation to ensure that these problems are not compounded. The breakdown of marriage is possibly the most emotionally draining and depressing period of a person's life. Being able to access professional counselling and mediation services can sometimes mean the difference between an amicable separation and one in which all those concerned suffer. As I mentioned earlier, almost 60 per cent of divorces involve children under the age of 18. These people in particular require early intervention. With the increasing demands on the system, many of these people will either miss out on counselling altogether or receive counselling too late. The introduction of this bill will reduce pressure on the Family Court by providing additional funds for the service. It is important to remember that this amendment does not impose any charges. Any charges would have to be made by regulation. The bill provides power for the Governor General in Council to make regulations, which would then provide for fees to be charged. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams), in his second reading speech, said that if a fee equivalent to the one charged by the community based sector were imposed it would be a fee of about $40 per hour. On current figures, this would amount to $835,000 in revenue in the 1996-97 financial year. This would increase to almost $2 million in the full financial year. As I said earlier, these funds will have a twofold purpose. Firstly, they will provide a much needed boost to the current system and reduce some of the pressure. Secondly, they will help overall budget deficit reduction. Why the former government was set to impose the fee is unclear. This government's motives are crystal clear. We inherited a massive deficit. Without wishing to repeat myself, we have set about reducing the deficit in the fairest possible way. It is never a desirable task imposing a fee on the already overburdened taxpayer. However, it is equally undesirable to have one section of the community pay for a service that others are getting for free. The government has put in place a number of strategies to assist families, pensioners, businesses and many others. We have dismantled a virtual plethora of inefficient programs put in place by the former government and replaced them with more workable and efficient models. This amendment is simply another initiative of the Howard coalition government to provide a more equitable system for all Australians. It is for these reasons that I commend this bill to the House.  listened with great interest to the member for Bowman (Mrs West). I noted her attack on the former member for Bowman, and the allegation that he did nothing about the child support scheme. Let me just place on the record that, when the former member for Bowman was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, he was responsible for introducing the review office. It is true that there are criticisms of that function. However, it is infinitely better than taking a dispute about an assessment by the Child Support Agency to the Family Court. In fact, that proved to be an impossibility. So I can't agree with the honourable member for Bowman that Con Sciacca, the former member, was indifferent. He was responsible for a very important reform; a reform that one would hope would go further. I think it is true that in family law issuesincluding the Family Court and issues surrounding child support-there is a great deal of common concern between members on different sides of the House. That is why I found the member for Bowman's contribution a little pathetic. I want to acknowledge and recognise that concern. I really do believe that we have got a long way to go in reform. In the last parliament it was my privilege to chair the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, which reviewed the child support scheme. I have always been critical of the fact that there remain 110 recommendations by the committee unresponded to by the former government. Having said that, there has not been a scintilla of progress by the present government in responding to that report. All members on both sides of the House have much to gain by the government putting the bit between its teeth and making a meaningful and purposeful response to that report. I also need to place on the record that it is matter of history that the Chief Justice of the Family Court and I had a noteable disagreement. All but one of the members of the opposition who were on the committee asked me to bow down to the pressure exerted on me by the Chief Justice and resign my position as chairman of that committee. It is something that I declined to do. I have to ask: why was it that the Chief Justice took such umbrage to a speech that I made? I said that I believed that the Family Court was failing Australians. I said it was a litigation superhighway; it remains so today. I find it pathetic when people in this House get up and say, 'Only five per cent of cases end up actually going through the court process.' It takes no account of the money that both sides to the argument are spending on their legal fees. It takes no account of the fact that they get financially exhausted by the process. They use all their available money. They use bankcard. They will go into debt. It is only then that they drop out of the process. The five per cent represents those who are not financially exhausted. It is not a success rate. I want to say a couple of things about mediation. Last week I went to the opening of Unifam in the electorate of the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly). I thank her for that, and for the way she graciously acknowledged my presence there. I am a great supporter of other methods of dispute resolution-mediation, counselling, arbitration. But, if we want to see how successful we are being in family law, there are some simple tests that we need to apply. At the moment this government-and, historically, governments-is content to throw $100 million at dead marriages and relationships. I can't understand Why. I believe profoundly in the benefit of counselling. The simple test is this: we ought to have a system of family law that allows the overwhelming majority of people to separate with dignity, with a concern for their children, and to get on with their new lives. That is a simple test. That is what the original Murphy reforms were all about. It is about time that we, on both sides of the House, admitted that is not happening. I talked about $100 million. It costs $100 million a year to run the Family Court. In terms of counselling, we need to spend money further up the relationship tree. The more money we can spend while people are still in a marriage, still in a relationship, the better the prospects are that we will strengthen that relationship. But, should it fail, there is a higher probability that that failure will not be accompanied by so much trauma, anguish and anger-however you would like to describe it. That is not happening. I would welcome a lot of things: pre-marriage education-I think it is great, but it is not the total solution-and marriage contracts, which I think are great. They actually ought to have a time line so that parties revisit them to reassess their needs, what they are getting out of the relationship and what they are looking for in the future-anything that gets the couples talking. I have said on a number of occasions that I think we have some real male taboos to overcome in society, that is, that we will talk about everything in our relationship other than its failure. To be seen to be going to counselling while still in a marriage or a relationship is still a male taboo. I regret that. We need to be encouraging processes that overcome that-anything that allows us to understand that a relationship is a dynamic thing that changes over time. People need to meet that change and, above all, to be communicating. I am horrified that we are now talking about insisting on fees for service, for example, in mediation. There are going to be a lot of people in my constituency who, having a service at Penrith designed to cover people from Auburn to over the mountainsLithgow, Orange, Bathurst-will find it really an impossible mission. The fee for service is going to stop them. Of course, mediation is not an appropriate mechanism for everyone to resolve their differences. In fact, it is probably a very good middle-class approach to resolving differences because the role of the mediator is to facilitate a decision amongst people with equal power or an equal opportunity to contribute, to come to grips with the problems that they are having. In my electorate, people would like to see a service that is stillborn as far as the Attorney-General's Department is concerned-and may they hang their heads in shame-and that is, arbitration. They want to be able to take their concerns, the areas of their dispute, to a neutral person and have them decide. Some will want mediation, but overwhelmingly they will want arbitration. It is for that reason, when we were looking at the funding and administration of the Family Court, that there were some suggestions of a no-frills family tribunal, much like the Consumer Complaints Tribunal in the states where people can take the issues that are dividing them to such a tribunal and have a decision arbitrated and there is not a problem of access or a problem of equity. The honourable member for Bowman is making a virtue of the fact that we are charging for this service. I would be interested to hear from the department, in the summing up process on this bill, whether they could tell me how many people they estimate will not be able to take advantage of the service because they are putting a fee on it. We talked about a no-frills family tribunal. Indeed, it was the current Attorney-General (Mr Williams) who coined the phrase 'the commission of the family'. Underlining both things was that we want to return the Family Court to a proper court where those who want to slug it out-those who have the family silver to pay for it-can actually slug it out, solicitor to solicitor, barrister to barrister, to QC. There will always be those cases that need to go to the court. But, as much as possible, we need to take the other services out of the court. I am not one who says that the Family Court should not have access to counselling services. I invite the advisers at the table to go to New Zealand, as I did, and have a look at the family court there. They do not have one counsellor as an officer of the court. You might be impressed by their court houses, by the way, because they operate out of district courts, not these mausoleums, these hugely expensive buildings that we put up in capital cities, believing that it is somehow appropriate for families to settle their differences in these things. They do it out of district courts, but they have the money to requisition whatever counselling services they require. They requisition it and they are very happy with it. The New Zealand government believes that it is worthwhile spending taxpayers' money on reconciliation counselling-that is, counselling is available not only to these dead corpses of marriages and relationships but when there is still some hope of reconciling the parties. A goodly percentage of their counselling money goes on reconciliation counselling. What does the Attorney-General have to say about that? Aren't we interested in keeping families together? Sure, we have to deal with the instances where they break down, but why can't we be spending some of our money on reconciliation counselling? Indeed, ever since the Family Court was established, it has had a responsibility to provide reconciliation counselling. Will the Attorney-General tell the House and tell the people of Australia just how much reconciliation counselling the Family Court has done? If he does not bother to respond, let me tell you it is zero. People wander around this place and in this place talking about greater efficiency in the court and how successful and wonderful it is. I do not think it is wonderful. I think it is an area that requires a great deal of reform. I think the honourable member for Bowman said a lot of things to test the patience of members on this side. But saying that the QC government went to the last election seeking to distinguish itself from parties on this side of the House, as the real champion of families, and then to come into this House and say, 'We're happy with the situation; we're providing you with a bill which will for the first time allow the Family Court to charge for voluntary counselling and mediation because of the budget deficit' - that this is somehow good for Australia-beggars the imagination. We have no idea what individuals pay to the legal profession on their legal costs. I have gone around Australia and been staggered at the amounts of money ordinary people pay for these services. But what is the outcome for those who have the courage to take the step themselves to seek voluntary counselling and voluntary mediation and are told, 'You have to pay a fee, estimated at $40 per hour'? Will we here in this House in 12 months time be able to report a significant drop off in the percentage of those who arc seeking voluntary counselling and voluntary mediation? I think it behoves the Attorney-General and his department to at least give us some indication about whether or not they believe the percentage of people seeking voluntary counselling and voluntary mediation will change for the balance of this year, next year and each year hereafter. I believe that it will, that people will be turned off at the very time that we should be trying to encourage people in the marriage, in the relationship-when the relationship has collapsed-to voluntarily seek assistance. The more they do things on a voluntary basis, the less likely it will be that things get out of hand. We should be encouraging it: it is the role of the government to be facilitating it. I have asked the Attorney-General some questions on notice, and I have had some very bland responses. I say to the Attorney-General that there ought to be greater accountability for this $100 million. If you want to save $2 million, why don't you look at the $100 million that you are throwing each and every year at the Family Court? Why can't we be taking more of that money and putting it into mediation, counselling and arbitration? That is where the savings will come. At the moment, we do not give people a choice. The more people are given a choice about whether they go with their daggers drawn with their solicitors and barristers or whether they resolve their differences amicably with dignity and in an uncostly way, I think people will automatically make the latter choice. I will quickly say something about legal aid. I am appalled at what the department and the Attorney are doing to legal aid. They have said that the Commonwealth money that is in the system must now be spent on exclusively federal matters. It is no longer the case that people will be able to be represented for some of the most serious criminal offences. I find that appalling. Most of the money, of course, is going to go into family law. Again, if I return to the no-frills tribunal, commission of the family approach, you will find that, rather than cases having to be represented in the Family Court and legal aid being spent, in fact legal aid would be saved. There would be significant savings to the legal aid budget if we provided people with a real choice. In other words, people could get off the litigation superhighway, get into their cars, make a left-hand or right-hand tum and try another approach-whether it is a combination of counselling, mediation or arbitration. That is why I am a supporter of the commission of the family. Last but not least, I refer to a remark made by my good friend the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). She said that Australians today-although I believe that it was true of yesterday-do not believe that they have access to the justice system. They are being priced out of it. Whether it is in family law or any other aspect of the law, ordinary men and women are being priced out of it. It is no good talking about legal rights. A right is only a meaningful right if you are able to exercise it. In this day and age, if you do not have the financial wherewithal, you cannot exercise it. Therefore, you do not have the right. There are a lot of issues of human rights in Australia that I am concerned about. My second greatest concern is people's inability to exercise their rights before the law-none more so than in family law, I regret to say. I do not agree with the proposition that fees should be charged. (Time expired)",39
41,Mr HARDGRAVE,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"I am pleased to follow the member for  contribution to be one from the heart, if not one from the head and, I suspect, based on his last few comments, one also from the hip pocket. As the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has already advised the House, the purpose of the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 is to enable the Family Court to charge fees for the use of its voluntary counselling and mediation services. This will even up the current situation where Commonwealth funded, community based organisations charge a fee for their counselling services while the Family Court services are free of charge. It does not make sense; it is an imbalance; it is certainly not a fair arrangement. It is not fair geography should be the deciding factor as to whether or not a person pays for counselling either. This clearly discriminates against people living in rural or isolated areas. While I would not describe anyone who has to use these particular services as lucky, it is certainly the case people able to access the Family Court services have an advantage over those who cannot. When one considers the cost of running the Family Court is now over $100 million per year-as the member for Chifley said, '$100 million per year thrown at family breakdowns'-I do not see how anyone can argue against the introduction of some modest fees for its voluntary counselling services. It is a responsible measure. It is based on the user-pays principle and on this basis it is quite fair. I am also sure general taxpayers will support this measure because it will reduce expenditure of their taxation dollars in an area which not all taxpayers access. It is estimated the fee will generate approximately $1. 7 million in revenue in a full year. So a modest part of the overall budget; nevertheless, it is a contribution from the individuals who access the services of the Family Court. This bill will be amending the Family Law Act 1975 to authorise the Governor General in Council to make appropriate regulations for the introduction of these fees for these particular services provided by the Family Court. Of course, as is the case with community based counselling services, if a person cannot afford to pay, they will not be charged for counselling. I think this is an important point to emphasise because it seems to have been glossed over by several of the contributions on the other side. Essentially, if you cannot afford to pay for the fee, if you can produce what would have to be very obvious proof of your inability to afford these fees, then there are measures contained within this bill to ensure you will not pay those fees. I think this adds a deal of the equity, which the member for Chifley was talking about in his contribution, back into the equation. It is also important to note fees will not be payable should the court itself order or direct counselling-which means, quite simply, if in the opinion of the hearing process and the deliberation of the Family Court counselling is ordered, the participants involved in counselling are not going to pay. So here is another equity measure-another, if you like, boosting of the proposition against what the member for Chifley and some others have had to say. I am speaking on this bill because, quite simply, marriage breakdowns and the consequences of it would have to be, by my estimate and the estimate of staff in my electoral office, the single largest pressing social issue in my electorate. When one considers matters such as unemployment, the general economy, the economic well-being of the nation and other factors which seem to hog the headlines in the newspapers-and perhaps would create the perception they are far more pressing-it is the consequences of marriage breakdowns which have preoccupied, in a category sense, perhaps the biggest amount of time in my short time as the member for Moreton. It is one of the reasons, I submit, the it is previous government lost the 2 March election. I make this bold claim-perhaps in some people's minds it is bold-simply based on getting around and talking and listening to victims of the system prior to the 2 March election. I talked to people who were from blended families, where a partner from a broken marriage had got together with someone else from a broken marriage. The male, invariably being the non-custodial parent from the previous marriage and, quite rightly, financing the ongoing activities of the children from his first marriage often are unable to necessarily support fully the new relationship. I do not like to suggest it is always males but invariably, as you would imagine, it generally is. The hurt generated by this particular situation cannot be underestimated. It is not a case of typecasting males out of a broken relationship as those who begrudgingly contribute to the well-being of their children from the broken relationship. It is certainly not fair at all. It is not fair to suggest they are the only ones who carry the burden. Their broader family and their friends also carry the burden of the stress and the strain. To have grown men-men who have been miners, successful salesmen, labourers, men from all walks of life--come to you and in some cases cry to you and to members of my staff about the particular hurt they are carrying on a daily basis is a very sobering experience and one I will not forget. It is important to note, in Queensland alone, 200 families a week separate-lO,OOO families a year; not necessarily always marriages, but certainly significant relationships. This is an amazing figure estimated and compiled by groups who are in the business of trying to hold together the lives of some of the people involved in marriage breakdowns. There is no doubt, as you know, the children suffer through all of this. Whilst the subject of the Child Support Agency will be a matter to come before the House later on in this parliament, it is certainlegislation ly worth noting in my contribution today, from what I can see, the Child Support Agency has fast become in a lot of ways the custodial parent's revenge agency where, essentially, males are put through the wringer by the system. I know the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West), in her contribution, made similar observations and I certainly endorse those comments, those observations. It is quite telling to see grown people being put through all sorts of hell by a system set up by legislation we pass in this place. It is very important, when matters such as this bill come before the House, there is free and wide-ranging debate and discussion on the issue. The member for Chifley endorsed many of the comments I have just made by his observations as someone who was in charge of the review of the Child Support Agency in the 37th Parliament. By the member for Chiefly'S observations, 110 recommendations were unresponded to by the former government which in itself endorses my observation: a lot of what happened on 2 March comes back to the underground word which was out about how bad matters were in relation to marriage breakdowns and the handling of the debris by the previous government. The member for Chifley suggested there has not been a scintilla of change since 2 March. I do not dispute the fact: on the surface there has not been the change so many of my constituents would like to see. I know for a fact I have urged the former minister in charge of this particular area, Senator Short, and most recently, Senator Rod Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, to work on this matterand I know they are. I am not the only one pressuring them. A few of us have pinned them down on a couple of occasions and told them very bluntly about what we are seeing and hearing in our own electorate. It is our job to do so. These ministers have worked on this matter and I know Senator Kemp will continue to work on this matter. Results of their work will come before this place in the form of legislation which has already been forecast. I am not 100 per cent sure whether the will address the real hurt in the short term. When the matter does come before this place, it is important for us to all look seriously at it. We need to put human faces and human situations to the matters we discuss in order to emphasise the matters which may need improving, to highlight the matters which may not be fully disclosed and to work on getting a good and sensible outcome. The cost of raising children does not necessarily rise in accordance with a rise in income, which is essentially the CSA's formula. We need to know exactly what it does cost to raise children. I make this important submission partly because a lot of non-custodial parents are robbed of the opportunity to be generous. I am not talking about people who have white-collar jobs; I am talking about people who work down the mines. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) will be making a contribution on this bill later. As a former miner, no doubt he will be able to speak about some of those matters. But I have spoken with people who work in the coal mines out beyond Ipswich, to the west of my electorate. They are on $80,000 to $90,000 a year. They are being forced by the system to contribute large chunks of money because of the Child Support Agency formula and, if they want to save up and buy something additional for their children from the former marriage, they find themselves unable to do so. The resulting frustration leads them to start to retreat from the work force. In this country today we are finding people withdrawing from the workplace, although they have the capacity to contribute to their own personal well-being and the well-being of society. As figures suggest, the proportion of unemployed amongst non-custodial parents is roughly twice the national average. For a wide-ranging number of reasons, the bill before us today is very important, even though it creates additional costs for some participants involved in family law matters. Whilst both people in a relationship which dissolves carry a great burden, the burdens added through this bill are really very small compared with their overall burdens. It is a form of user-pays which, from my observations, seems fair. I think the greatest burdens are being carried by non-custodial parents, particularly men who find they are not very good at sharing their problems. The honourable member for Chifley put it rather well when he said there are those who find it very difficult to expose themselves to their society when their relationships fail. When things are going well, they are okay; when things are not going well, they arc not okay. We have seen some fairly horrible examples of how, when pressures have built up, silent retreat has changed into anger and depression. Unfortunately, on occasions, we have seen violence and other activities coming out of non-custodial parents' frustrations. None of us want to see more of such things. Sensitive as these matters are and horrible as they are, in a purer sense, we must be very cognisant of the very real hurt out there in community-the suffering of children and the suffering of society in general-and of the pressure on a wide range of community groups which are in the business of trying to pick up the pieces. Nevertheless, they are charging for some of their activities, while at the same time-until this legislation is passed-the Family Court is not. Through this legislation we are asking for a small contribution to the cost of counselling services of the Family Court. The member for Chifley commented on the member for Bowman's quite fair contribution on the need to prevent rather than cure marriage breakdowns. This government is doing something positive about helping people entering relationships. It is very good to understand some of the responsibilities they have in a relationship and not just simply to look through rose-coloured glasses at the benefits which may come. I went through premarital training prior to my marriage 13 years ago and I believe it helped my wife and I understand a little bit about some of the pressures to come. But circumstances can change. Tougher financial pressures, hopes and dreams dashed, aspirations unrealised-they all place pressures on any relationship. While I gladly support this government's initiative in doing something positive about assisting and encouraging people to find out a little bit about themselves, their contributions and their responsibilities in any relationship-as a form of prevention rather than cure-I am also realistic enough to acknowledge things can change. Prevention, unless there is ready and constant inoculation, may actually do nothing to cure the possible consequences. I guess one of the other consequences is the advent of children. Many people married in the last 10 or 15 years are having children far later. Children are a pleasure, but they can also be a pressure on any relationship. They can signal a change to working arrangements. Generally, it is the woman in the relationship who will retire from the paid work force, only to work longer and harder hours for far smaller amounts of remuneration. Others of course try to struggle through the nightmare the of child-care arrangements to maintain career paths and to help keep ends meeting. There are a lot of pressures out there. I praise the church and community groups which are attempting to make the difference by assisting marriages before they start, maintaining marriages whilst they are going and preventing marriages from ending. I support the bill on the basis it is quite fair and reasonable we should ask those who want to access counselling services through the Family Court to make a contribution. The bill will amend the regulation making power set out in section 125(1)(c) to allow regulations to be made to impose fees for voluntary counselling and mediation services provided by the court. As I said before, those matters which are referred by the court---counselling which is directed-will not be subject to these fees. Those who are unable to pay the fees because of financial difficulties will have a mechanism to get out of paying those fees. But I think it is quite fair and reasonable those who can afford counselling in the community based sector but choose not to use it and voluntarily seek access to counselling through the Family Court should be prepared to pay for it. The $100 million plus a year allocated to the Family Court can be offset in a small way which is fair and equitable for all those who are accessing the services. In addition, this bill extends the power to grant proposed mediation counselling services exemptions from fees. The exemption provisions which currently apply to other fees payable in the court will apply to any fees imposed in relation to these voluntary counselling and mediation services. All up, this bill is well thought through, modest in its application and fair in its effect. In the overall scheme of things, given the real pain, the real pressure, the real hurt and the real cost felt by people involved in the horrible experience of marital breakdown, it is quite modest indeed. A few dollars here will make a big difference as far as the budget is concerned. For those reasons, I support this bill.",45
42,Mr CAMPBELL,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"I have been a member of this House for a long time. Successive governments have brought legislation into this House when they have wanted to appear to be doing something but really did not have the courage to do what had to be done. This is such a piece of legislation. I further note that the most sanctimonious contributions have predictably come from the lawyers. The Family Court is an abomination in Australia. It has become a burden on the people of Australia and with it, of course, the Child Support Agency, which is contingent upon the Family Court. It is a very expensive court-the most expensive in Australia. It is a court that encourages litigation. I heard one of the previous speakers say that only five per cent of cases finally end up in the court system. That is because people are driven financially bankrupt; they are totally broken by the actions of their lawyers. This, I believe, must be attended to. The Child Support Agency is wreaking havoc in the community. The previous speaker, the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave), did touch on some very true points. Had they not been garnished with so much sanctimony, they would have had more credibility. I know of cases in my own electorate where people have been driven out of very well paid employment and onto the dole simply because they were better off financially than they were by meeting the commitments imposed on them by legislation. It seems to me some things ought to be very readily done. Custodial parents must be made accountable; there is no accountability at the moment whatsoever. I believe the percentages paid should be based on circumstances at the time of the breakdown of the marriage. I also believe that payments should be related to the real costs of raising children. Quite clearly, caring for a young child does not cost anything near what an older child costs. I think there is room for staggering the costs or putting the money in trust so that the custodial parent must spend it on the child. The custodial parent's own financial position should be taken into account because, in many cases, they are doing very well through other income. The non-custodial parent, particularly if remarried and trying to raise another family, is under enormous economic pressure. There is simply no equity in the system. I also think we have to look very carefully at access because I know this causes enormous angst in the community. What is the government's response to this? The government's response is to raise a charge for conciliation by the court. People in country areas have had to pay this anyway. Free court services have not been available to country people in most cases, so this is not going to be anything new to them. Frankly, I do not think the courts are well equipped to provide conciliation. Some of the private agencies that are funded by the government do it better. What we should be looking at is improving the situation. That could best be done, in my view, by the total abolition of the Family Court. But, if we insist on maintaining it, it should be maintained as a branch of the Supreme Court-in fact, as a branch of the District Court with the Supreme Court as an appeal mechanism. Magistrates should be able to act as registrars. Magistrates should be able to make orders nisi and they should be compelled to take evidence so that, if there is litigation-and people wanting to litigate should be given 28 days-the evidence would be there in documented form. These things should be sorted out much more in the community, where the breakdowns occur. In particular, the burdens should be lifted from people in country areas, where there are often no lawyers. These people must seek legal advice in a nearby town which may be miles from where the court is held. In tum, town agents and barristers are briefed and, by the time the matter goes to court, it bears very little relevance to the real issues. Let's face it: magistrates today are enormously underworked, yet they are as qualified as anyone in the Family Court and they should be able to attend to the problems where they occur. Under this system, we would get quick and fair resolution. The only people who would be using litigation would be the very rich. If they were to spend their money in that way, I would have no objection. But let's face it: Australia is the third litigious country in the world. In fact we are third after the states of California and Texas and higher than the average of the United States, which we are often told has an appalling record in this area. It is a growing problem in Australia and it must be tackled. To suggest that this small amount is going to make a difference to the government's budgetary problems is absurd nonsense when the government is not prepared to tackle the very high cost of the Family Court. I would be prepared to accept the very high cost if the court were working, but clearly it is not. If one looks at the incidence of suicide, I think one will find a very close relationship between actions in the Family Court and suicides-often murder-suicides. Quite clearly the court is not considered by the great majority of people to be providing any form of justice. It seems to me that, since one can get married without a battery of lawyers or a judge, one should be able to get divorced the same way. If there is amicable agreement in the break-up, it seems to me that there does not need to be any more than a registration of the agreement. In most states, certainly in Queensland, clerks of the courts are all as equally qualified as magistrates or judges. They should be perfectly capable of registering those decisions, which should then of course be binding. The arbitration act specifically excludes lawyers for a very good reason. Arbitration should be in respect of property rights. If you have arbitration in these areas, there is absolutely no need for the presence of lawyers. If these matters are heard in a local court, the magistrate should be able to call the accountants or perhaps the school teachers of the parties. For instance, if there have been suggestions of child abuse, the magistrate should get out there and talk to the children. Magistrates should be made to earn their substantial money. You would get a substantial increase in real benefit to the community if this course were followed. In New South Wales there is a long standing organisation which actually pre-dates local government in New South Wales. I think it is most called the lands board. It deals with arguments relating to land and land tenure, and it seems to work extremely well indeed. In relation to marriage, it seems to me that an organisation such as this could be emulated. The contribution in this House by the  He is an excellent member and in this particular debate he brings unparalleled insight and knowledge. I believe his contribution to this debate is significant and, while I would perhaps go further than what the member for Chifley said, this House should acknowledge the always responsible contribution that he makes to debate. I joined in the debate only because of the strong views that I have on the clear failure of the Family Court. When Justice Murphy set up this court, he was looking for a way to simplify things. I believe that was his agenda. It has been sadly perverted. It has been turned into a monstrosity which is a millstone around the neck of Australia and it is going to become an even bigger burden. Nothing that the government has done in this bill will alter that fact. When people eventually go to court, they want a real court. They do not want to sit around in a very expensive forum with people lounging around. When people talk to the court, they should stand. The Family Court should observe all the forms of other courts. I therefore think we should give serious consideration to abandoning the Family Court altogether and making it merely a branch of the District Court, with appeals going to the Supreme Court. There is no need for the edifice. It is growing and it will continue to grow. The government talks about a two per cent efficiency contribution from the court. It would make much more sense to abolish the system and save far more money. When we are talking about family breakdown, it does seem rather parsimonious of the government, to say the least-I was looking for a more offensive word, but it has eluded me-to talk about saving the very small amount of money that we are talking about here when it clearly is going to put additional pressure on people already under a lot of stress. It must be remembered that one of the great problems in a marriage break-up is that there is never enough money to go around. Why should we therefore be in a situation where that money which is available is gobbled up by the legal fraternity? There is absolutely no doubt in my view that in many cases there should not be the need for legal representation, unless both parties agree or unless the court thinks that it would lead to a shortening of proceedings. The case I have outlined obviously needs some refinement, but it does offer a way back for the government if it wants to get back to a system where the courts really do provide justice for the community. In the present system, justice is clearly becoming something available for either the very rich or the very poor.",49
43,Mr WAKELIN,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise briefly today to speak on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996, which relates to raising the fees for some counselling and mediation services. Apparently the community based sector does charge fees, and this legislation would be bringing the Family Court into line with that process. It is an all too rare occasion when we in this place fundamentally agree on the basic points concerning the Family Court. The child support scheme, of course, becomes part of that discussion very quickly afterwards. I will touch on the comments of the mem Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has really given a great plaudit to that gentleman and his effort, and I fully endorse that. His contribution in the 37th Parliament, and again in this parliament, on this issue is in that leadership role which we need to have on an issue such as this. Any member of parliament who has been touched by the tragedy of murder or suicide will never forget the look in a mother's face or a grandfather's face and the despair that is felt. It is something that certainly will stay with me all of my life. I will be as careful as I possibly can be on this issue because these matters that I am thinking of are still before the courts. It is an overwhelming sense of frustration. It is not for me to stand here today and blame one party or the other or one institution or the other. It is simply to provide the personal evidence that these events do occur and indicate the abysmal failure of our system to cope. We know the general statistics in these matters. We know of the rate of family breakdown and marriage breakdown. We know the record of the child support scheme and the Child Support Agency, which is well documented. We know the debate so well brought into this place again by the member for Chifley about the Family Court and the expenditure of $100 million worth of taxpayers' money. I do not intend to revisit that but just say that the matter that compelled me to rise in my place today is that overwhelming sense which arises from dealing with a constituent who has been so severely touched by these very traumatic issues. I will highlight issues relating to the- child support scheme. The member for Chifley rightly said that it is for government to facilitate this scheme. I do not agree with the member for Chifley about $40 an hour being a particular issue when you consider the huge costs-touched on by the member for Kalgoorlie and the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave)-in the overall legal process, and particularly when you consider the ongoing costs of the Child Support Agency programs that are compulsorily acquired from people's incomes. I remind the House that, at the time of the parliamentary inquiry into the Child Support Agency, the agency's case load-these statistics are somewhat old now-had risen from 23,000 to 275,218 in May 1994. It was increasing at that point at the rate of 7,000 per month. We have heard the member for Moreton talk about the statistics in Queensland alone. The Ombudsman has been consistently critical since 1989-90. On 5 December 1994, the amount outstanding to the Australian Tax Office was $481 million. What I am saying is that the $100 million, and up to $200 million, that this bill directly deals with pales into insignificance when you look at those sorts of numbers and that sort of impact. As the member for Kalgoorlie rightly said, it does not take into account the huge legal fees which are part of the cost that people become drawn into. I will put on the record, in the opportunity that I have here today, some of the things that might help the situation. The member for Chifley quite rightly said that we have to move much further up the relationship tree to be able to address this situation over the longer term, particularly when we recognise that up to a half of marriages will break down and that, on the evidence currently available, that number may well increase up to the turn of the century. So we are really getting to a situation where I think just about everybody would agree that prevention is far better than cure. I believe that we can start at the pre-marriage stage, and the member for Chifley has covered that point. When we come to the adversarial nature of the child support scheme, we should be able to set in train some processes which enable that process to be less adversarial. This compulsory requirement to just access someone's incomeleading many people, as has been well stated before, onto the unemployment queue-surely will not produce the best outcome for everybody. The most interesting thing to me in the evolution of this child support scheme has been that it is the women of the second relationship, or the subsequent relationship, who are the ones who see it as the most unjust. The children of some of these prior relationships, subsequently becoming the responsibility of subsequent relationships, can fall completely between the child support scheme and DSS. In actual fact, under our current system there are children who do not get help from either the child support scheme or DSS. That is how appalling this situation has become. To move to the child support scheme and the administration of the act itself, the child support scheme is in the Australian Taxation Office, whose role is essentially to line up once a year and get people's money from them-or once a week or once a month. To be collecting money from people at one of the most difficult times in their lives, I think, only adds to the problem. Coupled with that is an issue that has shown the fallibility of government and administration of these institutions. I have one constituent who was assured that she would be paid back-payment on the child support scheme, guaranteed by the child support scheme it would be 30 days, on a process known as a tax block on her ex's tax return, and 12 months later we are still getting legal opinion about the capacity of that agency, whether it has acted appropriately. That is how the systems are letting us down. In conclusion, I endorse most of the comments made by the member for Chifley, the member for Kalgoorlie and the member for Moreton. I have taken this opportunity under the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 to air some of my grievances, my concerns, because this thing is far bigger than any partisan argument. I believe the time has come for this country to address these issues in a fundamental way. We have to start at the beginning of the relationship, pre-marriage, the administration of our institutions, of the act itself, and the fundamental addressing by the whole community of an issue which is one of the most important matters in this country, that is, the raising of the family and the institution of marriage, which, I still believe, is the foundation of civilised life as we know it in Australia.",51
44,Ms MACKLIN,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"I am opposing the amendments proposed in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996, which give effect to the budget decision to levy fees for counselling and mediation services provided in the Family Court. I am opposing this bill on four main grounds: firstly, because it represents yet another threat to vulnerable people, as the previous speaker, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), said, people who are at a very vulnerable stage in their lives. It imposes fees for voluntary counselling and mediation services previously provided free of charge by the Family Court. This may well mean that people in greatest need of counselling and those who would most benefit will not seek it. We are told that the fee will be $40 an hour. Many of those opposite are saying this is not such a great sum. I know for many of my constituents it is a very considerable sum, especially as counselling may extend over several sessions and the people involved will already be facing many expenses that come with the end of a marriage. They will also be facing a considerable range of new fees for other services provided through the Family Court, and I will touch on those a bit later. We are advised that the fees will be waived for those who cannot afford to pay. But, as far as I can see, the bill provides no details of how this group is to be defined. The Australian Council of Social Service claims that the hardship provisions in fact are very restricted. In my own electorate of Jagajaga, for example, these changes are expected to have a significant adverse effect on low income people who are seeking counselling or mediation. I have an excellent service in the West Heidelberg Community Legal Service, which at the moment refers many of its low income clients to services provided by the Family Court. They expect that fewer people will now avail themselves of this service and that as a result many people will be left with much more unsatisfactory maintenance or property settlements than might otherwise have been the case. The government's sole purpose in levying these fees is to raise revenue, and not very much at that. It is going to have a significant impact on some people who are in pretty desperate circumstances while the government expects to raise about $2 million from these charges over the first full year of operation. This $2 million will have a very long-term impact and have much more significant costs as far as individuals are concerned. In fact, it will be the case that the long-term costs of these policies in terms of pressures on families and individuals will far outweigh these meagre short-term savings. I would have to say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is a typical example of this government's short-term approach to policy development, which does not go beyond this year's budget bottom line. I also oppose this bill because I think that the premises on which it is based are false. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has said in a recent press release that one aim of the charges is to encourage people to use counselling and mediation services that are provided in the community. These services are already oversubscribed, so the end result, of course, will be that fewer people in total will gain access to services, regardless of where they are provided. This point has been well made by Liz Curran from the Federation of Community Legal Centres, who said: The mooted changes to the court's counselling and mediation roles will eventually lead to greater expense and greater family breakdown. Why reduce court based services when the community support network isn't there to be able to cope with the increased demand. The Attorney-General went on to say that the government's approach to family law 'will encourage people to resolve their disputes through mediation and counselling rather than embarking on costly court proceedings'. In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker, the reverse will be the case because most voluntary counselling through the Family Court is aimed at property and maintenance settlement rather than reconciliation. That being the case, the amendments cannot fulfil the government's objectives. The third reason for opposing the bill is that I see this as part of a concerted attempt to continue to weaken and undermine the Family Court. The last budget outlined a number of have cost-cutting, revenue raising measures the government intends to impose upon the Family Court, besides those charges that referred to in this bill. Let us have a all of those charges: a two per cent efficiency dividend, a cut in running costs, portfolio savings and cuts to programs initiated by the Labor government through its Justice Statement. Then come the real costs for people seeking divorce: a $250 fee for applications other than divorce such as maintenance, property or custody; a $400 fee for setting down a matter for full hearing in the Family Court; and an increase of $92 in the fee for filing for divorce, that is, up from $368 to $460. Some counselling registries have already been closed as a result of these cost-cutting measures and others are expected to do so. My final ground for opposing this bill is that, in my view, it is unworkable. Lawyers may well be able to bypass the charges by postponing counselling until after a divorce is filed and relying on judges or registrars to order counselling, in which case the charge will not apply. Where a child is involved, court may also order counselling to discuss the care, welfare and development of the cast child. In these cases, charges will also waived. If judges believe that free counselling services are essential to fulfilling one of court's basic aims, that is, solving disputes conciliation and mediation rather than tion, they can be expected to order counselling in each of the circumstances outlined above and possibly in others. This would effectively ensure that all counselling is directed rather than voluntary, and therefore not subject to charges. Recent comments by Justice Alistair Nicholson, the Chief Justice of the Family Court, provide some indication of judges' thinking on all of these changes. In an interview, he commented on these proposed changes in the following way: For 20 years we have been engaged in a particular type of crisis counselling in this Court in which we have a lot of expertise . . . The reality is that theythat is, community based legal centresquite different services ... Ours is a particuwhich larly specialised form of counselling. The court's success in reducing the trauma of are separation has been severely undervalued. look at Proposed changes would see divorce in Australia become a more confrontational and a share of legalistic process. All of the speakers on this bill have sought to make sure that divorce in this country does not become a more confrontational and legalistic process. I do not think there is anybody in this chamber who would think that such a thing would be a good change for Australia. Nevertheless, these charges will, in fact, lead to more confrontation and more legalism because, of course, the services in the community are not available and people just do not have $40 a pop to pay for counselling services that might assist them before things become more confrontational. This bill is punitive in intention and, in my view, flawed in concept. It will not achieve its objectives and the Labor Party will oppose it.",53
45,Mr MAREK,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"Capricornia) (1.12 p.m.)This debate on the Family Law Amendment a Bill 1996 provides a great opportunity not only to talk about the unfair financial burden onto Australian taxpayers that has contribe buted to the massive $8 billion deficit but also to look at the draconian Child Support the Act that continues to drive parents into by extreme poverty, ill-health and sometimes litigaviolence, murder and suicide. The way the system operates is that it gives no compassion to those hurting and in this time of need. This bill will allow regulations to be made prescribing fees to be charged only for the voluntary counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Law Court. At present those using the services often make no contribution to the running costs of the court. The running costs, at present, of the Family Law Court are in excess of $100 million per year. The issue of making those who can afford to pay for the provision of these services do so was actively considered by the previous Labor government, as indicated in the Attorney-General's Portfolio Budget Statements of 1995-96. With that in mind, it seems absolutely ludicrous that the Australian Labor Party should come out against this when they were the ones who were originally looking at it in the first place. The cost of taking a case to the Family Law Court is enormous and well out of the reach of everyday Australians. Costs of $15,000plus are crippling, and place undue pressure on all parties where there is enough tension already. Money is a constant problem throughout separation and divorce. It is a total menace and it seems to cause the greatest amount of problem and heartache. However, the introduction of fees and charges for voluntary counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Law Court will be a cheaper and a more effective way to solve most of the issues rather than have them go through the court. But, if we are to introduce fees and charges, I would like to see the level and quality of service improve relative to the costs. The main reason why community based services charge fees as opposed to the current free service provided by the Family Law Court is that they offer a far superior service. If we are going to charge the same as the community based sector, let us ensure that we provide the same quality service. At the moment the Family Court advises people to sort out their problems between themselves and come to an agreement but it fails to support the completion of these forms. To make the process smoother for everyone the Family Court representative must be a trained counsellor and must have adequate legal knowledge. The representative must be able to decide on custody and other related matters if both parties cannot come to an agreement. Also, the representative must remain the couple's contact should any further dispute arise. The Family Law Act does not recognise the child support system unless it is incorporated in the Family Court decision. The family law and child support systems should be restructured into one department. This would assist both the custodial and the non-custodial parent, especially in relation to access. It is unfair for someone who loves their child or children to be refused access, especially when he or she pays to bring up the children. The non-custodial parent must have the right to see his or her children. However, I am aware that a considerable number of non-custodial parents cannot see their children because the custodial parent will not inform them of where they live and the department will not provide that information to the non-custodial parent. By the same token the act allows a non-custodial parent to have access to their child despite the parent making no effort to maintain the child. This is laughable. A direct link between departments would stop many of the problems that are currently tearing families apart. Recently, at the National Party federal conference, I put forward a motion that was moved, seconded and carried. The motion was to the effect that 'recognising the current social and financial circumstances affecting both rural and suburban families, the conference calls on the federal National Party to explore the needs of men and women and their dependants regarding access to the use of support and information services with a view to establishing a men's referral and information centre similar to the women's health centres that currently operate throughout the country'. The government has a minister who reports to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the status of women. Therefore I ask: why don't we have a man to report to the Prime Minister on the status of men? Who is looking after the status or the interests of men? The answer is no-one. The Child Support Act is in need of major changes and it is my intention to move a private member's bill in the early part of year aimed at bringing about some of these most necessary changes. Many people in my electorate have made representations to about this matter as I have been striving these changes since approximately September 1995. I believe there needs to be a change the Child Support Act by having the child support deductions calculated from the net income instead of the gross income of an individual's salary or wage, no change to the percentage, no lowering of the cut-off point and a varying of the pension component. For example, with the child support system approximately $8,700 is taken out of the wage before the percentage is applied. If you are the wage range of $0 to $25,000 then the $8,700 would probably be okay. Between bill in. $25,000 and $35,000 we could lift that pension amount, the $8,700, to between $12,000 and $15,000 and then apply the percentage. Between $35,000 and $50,000 we could have a different pension amount that might be in the vicinity of $15,000 to $18,000. These are ideas that have been passed on other members and people out there who are genuinely concerned about the system. I forward to seeing what will eventuate in the coming years.",54
46,Mr ABBOTT,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (1.20 p.m.)-This bill, the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996, is a most interesting one. The purpose of the bill is to ensure that people who are using legal services pay an approprithat ate amount of money for the services which playing field. are provided to them. It is very important that people do not take services for granted. Obviously it is very important that we give people what they are entitled to as citizens, but it is also important that we have a proper and appropriate regime of cost recovery, and that is exactly what this bill is designed achieve. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, this government is very determined to ensure costs are recovered as appropriate from the users of various government services. This bill is part of that general approach. As you know, we in Australia have taken too much next for granted in times past. We have been inclined to think that money grew on trees; we have been inclined to think that we could me endlessly go on providing ourselves with for Rolls Royce services even though we could only afford Holden motor cars. So this very to important bilI is a crucial part of the government's general philosophical approach. - I suppose what we really need to focus on is the cost of running the Family Court, which has increased in recent years and now exceeds $100 million a year. These fee increases under the bill must be seen in the context of the deficit crisis which we inherited from the previous government. The public purse can no in longer continue to shoulder such an extensive burden, and that is why we have brought this The proposal to charge a fee equivalent to that charged by the community based counselling services for services provided by the Family Court is justifiable on equity grounds. There are currently fees for these services in the community based sector. There are serby vices provided by such groups as Relationships Australia, Centacare and the like which look have traditionally charged fees for very similar services to those offered by the Family Court. It is not equitable that some can get a service for free while others have to pay. Let me say that the services provided by people like Centacare, Relationships Australia and others are very much appreciated. That, I main suppose, is why we do not want the Family Court to be driving them out, as it were, and is why we are putting them all on a level Those who cannot afford it will, of course, as is right and proper, be exempt. The current provisions relating to waiver of fees for people in possession of cards entitling them to Commonwealth health benefits, those in receipt of legal aid and those who will otherto wise suffer hardship will continue to apply. At the moment some 40 per cent of all fees are waived by the Family Court and there is that no reason why that should not continue. The demand for counselling mediation is such that it is not possible for all to have access to the Family Court services. In these circumstances, it is inequitable that a service is provided for a fee to some, often residents of rural and remote locations, but others, purely on the basis of geography, receive a similar service for free. I am delighted to make this contribution to the bill and I look forward to hearing the particularly incisive and enlightening contribution from the next speaker, my friend and colleague the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper).",56
47,Mr SLIPPER,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, for filling in for the absent member for Calare (Mr Andren), who was the next speaker on the speakers' list. I have been listening to this debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 very carefully and very closely, and I must say that as always I am absolutely shocked by the hypocrisy of those opposite. I have listened to the contribution made by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and, indeed, that made by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), and it is really amazing to hear them make the statements that they have, particularly in view of the fact that there were proposals to consider charging fees for counselling and mediation services in the Family Court in the portfolio budget papers of the former government for 1995-96. The proposal was also considered as part of the review of fees and charges in Commonwealth courts and tribunals commissioned by the former Labor government. These proposals were included as possibilities under the former government, so it is amazing to hear the honourable member for Prospect say that this is a ferocious attack on the justice system of Australia, that the increase in fees will drastically alter the balanced legal system in this country, and so on. She and her colleagues would have us forget that they left us with an inheritance of a budget deficit of $10.3 billion. Labor speaker after Labor speaker has come into the House and said, in relation to this bill and to so many other bills, that the government must somehow continue to fund services that the economy can no longer afford. It is obvious that members opposite have not learned one lesson from the events of 2 March which saw them tossed from office when the Howard government was elected to be the most effective government this country has seen in a very long time. The purpose of the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996, as stated in the Bills Digest, is: To allow the Governor General to make regulations imposing fees for voluntary counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Court of Australia. This is a budget measure, and no doubt the Labor Party is seeking to continue to gut the budget by opposing this particular legislation. Obviously, the Labor Party will try to dredge up a majority in the other place to knock back this very sensible proposal-a proposal which was considered by the former government. It is entirely reasonable in a democracy that we pay for government services. The userpays approach is a very sensible means of cost recovery. The Family Court was set up in 1975 as part of a proposal to do away with the fault provisions of divorce and to bring in no-fault divorce. The Family Court has attracted, quite appropriately, its share of criticism during the 21 years since it was established. Ideologically, I am opposed to special courts for special purposes. I believe that, wherever possible, the ordinary courts of the land ought to have the carriage of litigation concerning matters relating to the broad sphere of human activities. It would not really be a bad idea if, as a government, we looked at the future of the Family Court with a view to considering whether it would be better if responsibility for family law matters were finely returned to the state supreme courts. That is not the subject of this particular legislation, but it is interesting to note that, over the period of existence of the Family Court, the cost of running the Family Court has now increased, with annual costs now exceeding $100 million. It is fair enough that those who use the service should pay for the service, bearing in mind that the government has put in place a safety net so that the people who are not able to afford the charges provided for in this bill will be exempted from them. It is obvious that we cannot quarantine the area of family law and the Family Court from the need to rein in the $10.3 billion deficit left to us by our predecessors. The public purse simply cannot be expected to put these charges on the bankcard. At present, many people undertaking counselling services already go to private counselling services and pay for those services. Some residents in rural and remote parts of Australia do not have access to the counselling services of the Family Court. They have, therefore, found it necessary to resort to private or local counselling services, and they have had to pay fees for those services. However, people in many urban centres have been able to access the Family Court counselling services because they live in areas of high population density. I believe that it is entirely inappropriate rural and regional Australians should be disadvantaged because of their remoteness. The services provided by Relationships Australia, Centacare and others have been very similar to those provided by the Family Court, but in many cases they have actually been a better service. They have charged fees. Charges will now be able to be imposed by the Family Court for some counselling services and I believe that is appropriate. If people have the choice of going to Family Court counselling services or going to private counselling services, this might encourage more to go to private counselling services. In my experience as a legal practitioner, the quality of counselling given by private counselling services has been infinitely superior to the bureaucratic, cumbersome, unsympathetic way in which clients have been treated by the Family Court of Australia. I have acted for people whose marriages ought to be saved and who needed counselling to prevent a divorce. I have seen them go off to the Family Court, and the attitude of the Family Court seems to be, 'Well, you may as well get divorced. There's no future in this relationship.' But I have seen that many of the private counselling services have indeed been able to help people save marriages; and, by saving marriages, have helped maintain the social infrastructure of our nation. The honourable member for Banks said that this bill is a denial of access to justice. Even the honourable member for Banks could not believe that. He has said that families will suffer from this bill. He has said that this government, time will show, is mean spirited and nasty. He has also said that this bill is against all values that we espouse, that is, against our values supporting Australian families. Opposition members have entirely missed the point. They have chosen to avoid the reality of the situation, because our bill provides that those who cannot afford to pay will be exempt. The current provisions relating to waiver of fees for people on income support, in receipt of legal aid and those who will otherwise suffer hardship will continue to apply. At the present time some 40 per cent of all fees are waived by the Family Court, and so it is not unreasonable to expect that that there will be a similar percentage of people who will be relieved of fees imposed by Family Court counselling services. The demand for counselling and mediation is such that it is not possible for everyone to have access to these Family Court services. I have pointed out that many people, for geographic reasons, do not have access and it is simply inequitable that a free service should be applicable to some and yet not to others because of where they live. It should also be noted that the power to levy fees only relates to those services used on a voluntary basis. If the Family Court orders or directs that counselling take place, no fee will be payable. Those opposite have expelled a great deal of hot air during the debate on this bill. They have ignored the fact that it is their own ineptitude over 13 years of government which has made this belt-tightening exercise necessary. They have forgotten that the former Deputy Prime Minister, now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), told us that the budget was in surplus prior to the election, when in reality there was a $10.3 billion deficit. We did not inherit the problem that this country has in relation to debt and the economy, but we do accept the responsibility to fix it. Yet it is interesting that, despite the fact that we seek to fix the problem, at every opportunity the opposition seeks to prevent our doing so. No doubt in the other place they will endeavour to gather together a majority to blow yet another hole in the budget. We believe that this is not an appropriate way to go. The government supports very strongly the principle that there should be greater reliance on prevention of disputes arising and on alternative dispute resolution rather than on court actions, and we are providing more money for marriage education to try and give people the necessary skills to deal better with conflicts in marriages. In addition, we are maintaining the expansion of the community mediation programs to assist people to resolve disputes at the local level without the need the courts. I think that that is very important to note as well. The thing that really came across to me as I listened to this debate was the monumental hypocrisy of Labor members. They come forward and they mouth platitudes. They come forward and they criticise us. They come forward and suggest that they have the answers, forgetting that they were in government for most of the last 13 years. They do not admit that, in government, they were proposing to consider charging fees for counselling and mediation services in the Family Court. The former Minister for Justice, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), is now sitting at the table. He would have to admit that in the portfolio budget papers of his government for 1995-96 the proposal incorporated in the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 was indeed being considered by that government. If you listen to them, you would think that they were holier than thou. You would think that they were purer than the driven snow. You would think that they would not entertain charging for counselling services. Yet the fine print of their own portfolio budget papers for the last financial year makes it clear that they were considering a bill very similar to the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996. In fact, had the people of Australia not comprehensively rejected the Labor Party on 2 March, it is not unrealistic to assume that we could well have been debating in the parliament today a family law amendment bill 1996 in identical terms to the bill currently before the chamber. The difference, though, would have been that the shadow minister at the table would have been the minister who had given the second reading speech. I think Australians want honesty in politics. We all know how the former Prime Minister was prepared to lie and rob and cheat his way to win the election in 1993. We all know how he was prepared to do anything and say anything to crawl back into office. We find that those same characteristics seem to have survived the election. We find that members for like the honourable member for Prospect and the honourable member for Banks are, in fact, coming forward and criticising us for bringing in a bill which their own party would have brought into this place had they been returned on 2 March.",57

But the point I was making is that the former government, the Australian Labor Party government, which was led by Paul Keating, was prepared to lie and rob and cheat its way into office. Those two members who spoke were members of that government and the hypocrisy they expressed is outrageous.",59
52,Mr KERR,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, these occasions when there are few members in the House are normally attended with a great deal of tolerance. But, having asked the member to withdraw, you are aware that the withdrawal should be unconditional. Repeating tions that they, by some inference, were party to lying is simply not",59
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"The member for Fisher has withdrawn the inference directrunning ed at specific members. But, generically, like comments about the former government have been made. In fact, yesterday, during question time, I did hear similar comments coming from the opposition side as well. The member for Fisher has withdrawn any specific reference to individual members. Is that correct?",60
54,Mr SLIPPER,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"I certainly have, Mr Deputy Speaker.",60
55,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,I warn the member for Fisher to direct his comments to the bill being debated.,60
56,Mr SLIPPER,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"I am, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have withdrawn those comments if, in fact, they were deemed to relate to the members. I referred to. The former government, prior to the election, in its own budget portfolio papers, had proposals to consider charging fees for counselling and mediation services. Those papers were for the year 1995-96. This government has brought in the Family Law Amendment Bill. We are seeking to impose these charges on the people who can afford them. The honourable member for Banks, the honourable member for Prospect and others have come into the parliament and pilloried us for supporting this legislation when, had they been re-elected as the government on 2 March, the shadow minister at the table could well have been sponsoring a similar piece of legislation. We would have been debating a very similar bill, but the shadow minister would have been sitting where the honourable member for Wentworth e Mr Andrew Thomson) is now, and he would have been a strong proponent of this bill. The opposition is being hypocritical. The opposition is playing politics. The opposition is ignoring the fact that this country had a $10.3 billion deficit which this government has to fix. The opposition is irrelevant, and the people of Australia will reject its hypocWilliams). risy and will recognise that these people are making statements purely for political purposes. Clearly they are not interested in the suggesgood government of this country. The cost of running the Family Court has ballooned to an amount in excess of $100 million a year. If we are to be a government the economy of this country responsibly, then we must rein in costs. Clearly, those who use the services of the Family Court must make some contribution towards the cost of meeting that $100 million. It ought to be remembered that there is a safety net and that those who cannot afford those expenses will be exempt. That is a very important safeguard for those disadvantaged Australians who need the benefits of the Family Court services but who cannot afford to pay for them. It ought to be recognised that in many parts of Australia, including in some parts of your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, constituents are simply not able, for geographic reasons, to access the currently free counselling and mediation services of the Family Court. Many of your constituents and many of my constituents currently have to pay for counselling and mediation services like those provided by excellent bodies such as Relationships Australia and Centacare. People in rural and regional Australia ought not to be disadvantaged. If they are unable to access the free Family Court counselling services, why should people in the urban metropolis be able to do so? This bill is about good economic management. It is about some cost recovery so that those who use a service pay for it. It is about geographic equity. It is about rejecting the hypocrisy of the honourable member for Banks, the honourable member for Prospect and every speaker who has spoken on this bill on that side of the House. I believe that Australians will support this bill, and I am confident that this House, when called upon to vote on this bill, will give its overwhelming endorsement to the very sensible proposals being brought forward by the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice (Mr",60
57,Mr ANDREN,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"I wish to draw your attention to the government's proposal to introduce fees for people who voluntarily seek counselling for the resolution of family law disputes. My concerns with this proposal are many. The proposal appears to be in direct conflict with the government's much flaunted commitment to families and to alternative dispute resolution in family law disputes. The consequences of such a proposal upon the people of my electorate, when combined with the government's cuts to legal aid, the imposition of court fees for ancillary relief, and the increase in hearings fees, are likely to be severe. I fear the impact that this proposal will have on vulnerable groups in Australian society such as women and the children who so often are caught in the middle of family law disputes. In 1995, children were involved in 59 per cent of cases, so we are perhaps talking about 100,000 children who are affected each year. I am concerned about the impact these changes will have upon the lower to middle income earning families of our society who do not qualify for legal aid but for whom the expense of the government's proposal may cause additional pain. I am concerned that, instead of keeping family law matters out of the courts and saving money-as the proposal intends as far as I can see-the likely result may be that more cases will actually end up in the courts. This could cost the parties and the Australian taxpayers more money and increase the already substantial delays facing parties in Family Court. I am concerned at the government's proposal to outsource the counselling function of the Family Court. This move risks a drop in the expert standard of service that the Family Court provides for its clients. Furthermore, I am alarmed by the prospect of private organisations having to deal with the violent cases which are very much part of family law and which the Family Court is well set up to deal with. I am also concerned about the government's plan to regulate these private counselling bodies through an Attorney General's agency which sounds something like the Child Support Agency. With this proposal the government hopes to save a mere $2.7 million over the next year and a half. To me, such an amount represents a drop in the ocean when compared to some of the other cost-cutting measures the government is undertaking. After extensive discussions with legal practitioners in my electorate, with representatives from the Family Court, the law society, the Law Council of Australia and with legal aid representatives, I am convinced that the impact that this proposal will have on the poor and middle income families in my electorate and Australia generally, on women, on children and ultimately on society as a whole, far outweighs the government's need to save another couple of million dollars. My words today may well be drowned out by the cacophony of the preoccupation of this House with amendments dealing with proposals involving much more money, but not many of them will impact on as many people's lives as this one. This bill is not just about money, it is about lives and about how best to help people to get on with their lives after marital breakdowns. Since 1975, 890,000 couples in Australia have been divorced. In 1995, 63,000 couples were divorced, and the numbers are increasing every year. Of these 63,000 couples, some 32,000 couples voluntarily sought the assistance of the counselling arm of the Family Court. These types of figures suggest that increasingly the Family Court is playing a part in the the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians. It is patently clear to me that the field of family law cannot be considered simply in monetary terms. Indeed, the workings of the Family Court cannot be considered in the same light as other courts. The Family Court has a special role in society, dealing as it dOl:s with the most delicate relationships-those between family members. The effectiveness of the Family Court's operation should not, within reason, be judged in monetary terms, as the government is doing, but in terms of outcomes. In 1995,95 per cent of the disputes with which the Family Court dealt were settled outside the courtroom: From all accounts, the Family Court makes an important contribution to our society. I do not argue that its operations are flawless. I do, however, assert that this proposal cannot be justified on the basis of saving a paltry $800,000 this financial year and $l.9 million in the 1996-97 financial year. The inserted section I 25(ca) will allow fees to be payable in respect of the use of the counselling or mediation facilities of the Family Court in situations other than where a court orders a person to attend the counselling or mediation. I welcome section 125(1)(d), exempting certain categories of people from having to pay fees for voluntary counselling: people who hold a health care entitlement, those on legal aid, prisoners, those in receipt of Austudy or Abstudy and those whom the Family Court registrar finds would suffer financial hardship if they had to pay the fee. But this safety net just does not go far enough. There are thousands outside these criteria who will be severely penalised, especially with cuts to legal aid and tighter qualification criteria. For those paying the fee, it will be payable in cash and its administration will be the responsibility of the Family Court. In a further move which will deter parties from taking their matters to court, the government has also introduced application fees of $250 for ancillary relief applications and $400 for setting down a matter for a full hearing. Thus, whatever avenue the parties choose to take, they will be forced to pay. The government's ultimate plan appears to be the removal of the counselling function from the Family Court altogether. The counselling and mediation role will be gradually out sourced to private counselling services, which would be managed by an agency, as I have suggested, like the Child Support Agency. With this amendment the government aims to open the door for counselling fees to be charged at an initial rate of $40 an hour from I January next year for all parties who voluntarily seek counselling. Through this measure the government aims to save $800,000 this financial year and $l.9 million in the next. However a partner unable to resolve satisfactorily a spousal maintenance case because of the cost of accessing the Family Court or its revised counselling arrangements may well become a greater cost on the taxpayer than the savings achieved in denying him or her such access. They will then most likely be on the queue for public housing, more Medicare funded medical services and so on. It will be a far greater cost than the mediated settlement they sought to avoid. Let me now move on to the government's commitment to families, alternative dispute resolution and children. It is no secret the government prides itself on its commitment to families. For example, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) recently claimed: The family is the core social unit in our society. For generations the family has endured as the primary and most effective provider of assistance and support for people of all ages and from all backgrounds. The coalition is absolutely committed to ensuring that the needs of families remain at the centre of public policy. One of our highest priorities as a government is to relieve the financial pressure on low and middle income families bringing up children. Furthermore, in his recent address to the 7th Annual Family Conference the Attorney General (Mr Williams) claimed: The welfare of Australian families is a key area of concern to the federal government . .. as the family is the primary social unit which binds and underpins our society. No-one has any argument with that. He went on to say that with the proposed amendments and others the Family Court's 'emphasis is now squarely on fulfilling the rights of the children involved and on the responsibilities of both parents towards those children'. In relation to its purported attitude towards alternative dispute resolution in the Family Court the government claimed in its election campaign that if elected it would, among others things 'support and implement moves to increase counselling, conciliation and mediation options in the resolution of disputes'. The obvious question raised by the proposed amendment when viewed in light of these comments is: how well do these amendments sit with the government's stated commitments to families, to alternative dispute resolution in the Family Court, and to the interests of children? To answer this question I have considered the impact upon the community which I represent of the combination of the proposed amendments, the legal aid cuts and the increases in Family Court fees. In 1995 in Orange and Bathurst alone the Family Court counselled 200 couples who sought help from the service voluntarily. These figures provide an indication of the number of families who will be affected by the proposed changes. The figure is significant given that the combined population of Orange and Bathurst is only about 65,000. People in my electorate seeking counselling must travel to the Family Court in Parramatta or Dubbo unless the court decides to visit the country centres because of demand. After talking to regional solicitors it appears that it is common practice for solicitors to advise their clients to seek counselling as a first step because resolutions reached by mutual agreement are seen by all parties involved as preferable to a decision imposed by a court. At the moment the parties involved in voluntary counselling in my electorate must already pay for their travel, accommodation and child-care expenses if they are to attend counselling in Parramatta or Dubbo. With the proposed changes they will, on top of these expenses, be asked to fork out $40 an hour for however many hours of counselling they undertake and with no guarantee that a resolution will be reached. Furthermore, I cannot see these people being in the best mood to negotiate because of this additional cost. With scenarios like these it is easy to see why regional solicitors fear that this proposal will actually force many of their clients to go to court as a first step because of the greater certainty of an outcome and the prospect that counselling might be ordered free of charge. It is unquestionable that the legal fraternity is very concerned about the possibility of fees being introduced for voluntary counselling both at the local and national levels. This is significant because if anything, with these changes, they stand to get more work. The proposed changes, combined with the cut to funding in legal aid, appear to contradict the government's stated commitment to families. If the proposed fee is introduced, the government would save only $800,000 this financial year. This figure represents only one small drop in the fiscal ocean. What this House must decide is whether it is worth saving this relatively small amount of money, when the impact of this proposal, combined with existing cuts to legal aid, could be catastrophic for lower middle income Australian families, the children caught up in these disputes and, ultimately, Australian society as a whole. From all accounts, the counselling arm of the Family Court, as it stands, is the most fruitful and least financially and psychologically damaging avenue to follow if parties to a marital dispute want to avoid litigation. I agree with Michael Tausigg, the Chairman of the Law Council of Australia's family law section, who claims: The Family Court cannot be considered in the same light as other courts. There can be no user-pays principle because the Family Court has a special role in society. And I agree with another legal practitioner, with whom I spoke, who said, 'The proposed changes are like reforming the medical industry so that patients are asked to hop up on the surgery table and perform their own frontal lobotomies. ' The Family Court is the court with which most Australians have contact. Family law is a unique area of the law, dealing as it does with very delicate relationships which the government itself has recognised as being fundamental to the fabric of Australian society. If any court is to set an example of how the law is trying to keep pace with the changes in our society it must be the Family Court. Since 1975, as I said, there have been 890,000 divorces in Australia. Last year there were 63,000. These figures speak for themselves. What the government has to recognise is that dysfunctional families, while not fitting the government's ideal of the intact family, are nevertheless families. Indeed, they are families in the most dire need of the government's support rather than having the government heap extra financial burdens on them. . The Family Court counselling service currently provides a service which is considered expert and effective by legal practitioners. The consensus among those practitioners appears to be that the counselling roles of the court cannot be separated from its litigious ones, because they are part and parcel of an innovative legal package aimed at settling highly sensitive matters out of court. Removing the counselling arm of the Family Court by outsourcing to private firms risks a drop in standards, problems with security, and an increase in litigation which will in tum increase the cost of the dispute resolution process to the government and ultimately to the taxpayers. But the social cost to society is what I am really concerned about. One quote from a legal practitioner in my electorate sums up the feeling of practitioners very well. He said: Any move by the government that deters or impedes people in any way from seeking counselling is a negative step and should be avoided at all costs. In the scheme of things, $1.9 million is peanuts. Is it really worth all of the heartache it could potentially cause families and especially women and children? In my mind the proposal we are debating here today is best described as regressive. It represents a backward step which flies in the face of the outstanding work the Family Court performs in resolving disputes out of court. It is short-sighted and simplistic. It is indirectly draconian in that it forces participants' hands by making them either pay for counselling or pay at least $250 to go to court and get an order that counselling should be provided free. In this sense, it represents a catch-22 situation. No matter which way the parties choose to go, they will be forced to pay. The government, however, seems to be basing its proposal on the risky gamble that people will choose to attend counselling rather than go to court to resolve their disputes. My sources, people who work in the system, tell me that it is unlikely to be the case. On the contrary, it is more likely that the more cash-strapped people in the community will choose to go to court immediately rather than risk having to fork out for counselling, knowing that if it fails they will still have to go to court anyway. On the other hand, couples may not even attempt to resolve their dispute legally because of the cost of delays. If this is the case, one can wonder where the children caught up in these disputes will be left. This is especially the case for country areas like the one I represent, where to attend a Family Court for counselling or for a hearing is also highly likely to involve many hours travel and associated costs. If the government were serious about its commitment to families, if it were serious about keeping family law disputes out of courts, if it were serious about protecting the interests of women and children in these matters, if it were serious about minimising the damage caused to Australian society by family law disputes, and if it cared about people more than it cared about money in this case, then it would not be proposing such an amendment.",60

60,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that he received a letter from Premier Court on 7 November which said in its opening paragraph: Further to our conversation this morning, I am writing to confirm the matters that we discussed as they relate to Commonwealth funding of some initiatives in the lead-up to the forthcoming state election. Can he also confirm another paragraph in the letter which reads: As we discussed, the state government is pursuing a very ambitious salinity action program which will be announced on Monday morning, 11 November. A Commonwealth contribution of $30 million per annum from the 1997-98 financial year for the next 10 years would greatly assist this visionary initiaLeader tive. I understand that any Commonwealth allocation will be contingent upon the partial sale of Telstra. Why did the Prime Minister agree to provide a total of $300 million to Western Australia over the next 10 years when the total allocation for vegetation-associated initiatives under the Natural Heritage Trust is $318 million over five years? Is it the case that the Commonwealth's commitment is a hollow one, similar to many of the coalition commitments prior to 2 March, and amounts to a blatant example of Liberal Party chicanery in the lead-up to the Western Australian poll on 14 December? Is it not now simply this point: that the government's $1 billion Telstra trust fund is simply a Liberal Party election slush fund?",64
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Some days you really strike it lucky. You have got a Western Australian Leader of the Opposition dumping on his own state's future. That is basically what he is doing. The answer to the Leader of the Opposition is yes, I did receive such a letter. The answer to the rest of the question is that many of the assumptions made by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this matter are completely erroneous. So, far from the Natural Heritage Trust being appropriately described in the words used by the Leader of the Opposition, let me take advantage of the opportunity the leader presents me with by saying that the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia is the greatest capital investment in Australia's environmental future ever. That is what it is. Once again, the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates not only an indifference to the interests of Western Australia. It is a long pattern. No wonder the Labor Party's stocks in Western Australia have been driven down so low. Time and time again the Labor Party demonstrates an absolute disinterest in the future of Western Australia. When he was interviewed on television at the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition said something to the effect, 'I would have to acknowledge that the Labor Party carries a few problems in Western Australia.' They certainly do carry a lot of problems. What the of the Opposition is trying to do today is to denigrate an attempt by the federal government to help Western Australia. That is what he is trying to do. In the process, he is demonstrating not only a great deal of total misrepresentation but also a complete misunderstanding of the purpose of the Natural Heritage Trust. The Natural Heritage Trust will help the environment of Australia. You are against the Natural Heritage Trust. You are voting against the greatest initiative ever for Australia's environment. I want not only the people of Western Australia but the people of all of the states of Australia to understand that it was the Liberal and National parties that proposed to invest $1 billion in the future of Australia's environment. It is the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats who are voting to strike that down. Every environmentalist who will come knocking on our doors in the future, if that legislation is defeated, asking, 'Why haven't you done more for the environment?' my answer, and I hope the answer of every member on this side of the parliament, will be, 'Why don't you go around and demand of Mr Beazley an explanation as to why he dumped on Australia's environmental future?'",65

65,Mr EOIN CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the commitment of this government to small business as the engine room of growth and jobs, particularly for Australia's youth. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House how the government has started the rejuvenation of small business?",65
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As honourable members will be aware, one of the major commitments made by the government parties in the election campaign was to assist small business. I am delighted, in answering this question, to start by recording some of the reaction yesterday to the announcement made by the Treasurer that the capital gains tax rollover relief provision announced in the budget would be further liberalised. If I can paraphrase the words of Mr Robert Bastion from the Council of Small Business Organisations. He said: It is absolutely fabulous, an excellent gesture to small business. It gives a psychological lift which far exceeds the $50 million input by the government. But it gets even better. Let me quote the words of Mr Kurt Rendall of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Listen to these words very carefully. He said: The decision highlighted the difference between the coalition government and its predecessor. These guys have a really good understanding of small business. That highlights the difference. It is not surprising that people such as Mr Bastion and Mr Rendall should express those views because not only was the announcement made by the Treasurer a marvellous demonstration of the sensitivity of the coalition government to the interests of small business, but it follows a series of decisions taken by this government since the election to help small business. We honoured our commitment to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor, which has eased the cash flow problems of small business by about $180 million a year. We met our commitment to get rid of the unfair dismissal laws. Now that the workplace relations bill has gone through the Senate, from 1 January the stupid, job-destroying unfair dismissal law of Laurie Brereton will be a relic of industrial relations history. Of all the damage that you crowd opposite in your 13 years in government did to small business, none was worse than the burden you placed on small business by that ridiculous law. Even the only Labor Premier in Australia, Bob Carr, said that it was a bad law and it was destroying the jobs of young Australians. Your former leader, the former Prime Minister, right on the death bed of the election, said that if the thing was causing a problem, even he would have a look at it. It was a miserable pay-off to Jennie George for the help you got from the unions in the 1993 election. You know that and you deserve all the calumny that has descended upon you as a result of that particular measure. But the decisions taken by the coalition go much further than that. There are the great benefits to small business that will flow from the other provisions of the workplace relations bill. Then there was the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, chaired by Mr Charlie Bell, which has made a very large number of recommendations. I promised, on behalf of the government, that we would give a consolidated response to those recommendations by the middle of February. They are designed to assist our goal of reducing by 50 per cent the red tape burden on small business during our first three years in government. On top of that, we have maintained a very strong anti-inflationary economic policy. Under our administration interest rates have fallen on several occasions, and that has been of great benefit to small business. Overall, I can report, as this parliamentary year draws to an end, that of the many commitments that were made by the coalition in the lead-up to the last election, none was more important than our commitment to small business and none has been more comprehensively honoured by this government over the last nine months than the promises we made to the small businesses of Australia. Economy",66
67,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer recall the Prime Minister saying last year: The main economic challenge facing Australia, if we are to make lasting inroads into unemployment, is to achieve and sustain growth of 4-5 per cent over the rest of the decade and beyond. How can the government pretend to be meeting that challenge, as stated by the Prime Minister last year, when today's national accounts figures show trend growth falling to just two per cent annually? And, if you may prefer to focus-being an opportunist, you no doubt will--on the seasonally adjusted data, when of the 3.S per cent growth that has occurred in the last four quarters, 2.9 per cent of it was attributable to the Labor government, leaving just 0.9 per cent in six months attributable to you? And when, even if this quarter's O.S per cent were to be sustained for the next three quarters, growth for this financial year would still be well under your budget forecast and not nearly enough to make any significant impact on unemployment using your own leader's benchmark?",66
68,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Holt reminds me of a diver who does triple backward somersaults with twists and ends up with a bellyflop. He stands up here and he goes through permutation after combination which essentially reveal one thing-his ignorance. The reason you have made the most inglorious debut in the House of Representatives since recorded history began in relation to senators is the way you carry on at the dispatch box like that. Much to your extreme regret, what do we find in the national accounts today? We find that growth for the September quarter was O.S per cent and growth for the year was 3.S per cent. This was the ignoramus who was out saying that the economy was flatter than the Nullarbor Plain. We achieved O.S per cent growth for the September quarter and 3.S per cent growth for the year. He is an absolute ignoramus. I thought I had seen and heard it all until this morning. Yesterday all of Australia was looking at a high dollar and the implications it might have in relation to interest rates. Even the Leader of the Opposition was talking about the effect that a strong dollar should have in relation to easing monetary policy. We had this genius from Holt who walked into Parliament House this morning and said he thought there should be an interest rate cut because the dollar was falling. That is what he said this morning. His quote this morning was that he thought that, because the dollar had got down to 78c or 79c, there is a strong case for a far greater interest rate cut. The whole world goes one way and Gareth goes the other. 'Garenomics' it is called. I thought ignorance had bounds until I heard the statement this morning that, with the dollar sitting on 7Sc or 79c, there is a strong case for a far greater interest rate cut. If the dollar comes back to SOc during the day, what do you think we should do now? Should we put rates up because it has gone to SOc? We have the Bill and Ben show. We have Bill here talking about a strong economy and rate cuts and we have Ben talking about a flat economy and rate cuts. We have an opposition which has no position and all we get is somebody who walks to the dispatch box with prepared questions, trying to do triple somersaults with double twists and landing, as he always does, in one big bellyflop. Economy",67
69,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer elaborate further to the House on the performance of investment, manufacturing and exports as revealed in the last September quarter national accounts? Are these latest growth figures in line with the budget forecasts?",67
70,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Richmond for a sensible question on the economy and the national accounts. The September quarter national accounts showed a O.S per cent growth for the quarter and a 3.S per cent growth for the year to the September quarter of 1996. The solid growth in the Australian economy was led by investment, with a contribution from manufacturing and a contribution from exports. I have already reported to the House that the capital expenditure survey indicated that, between the same time last year and this year, investment expectations for 1996-97 had risen 19 per cent. For the quarter we saw solid growth in investment of around eight per cent in both equipment and construction and 10.5 per cent growth in relation to construction. This confirms businesses' confidence in the underlying strength of the economy. It was also particularly pleasing to see growth of 2.4 per cent in the manufacturing sector over that quarter. I have already noted in relation to a number of factors that the sector of the Australian economy which is particularly sensitive to imports and import competition would have found difficulties, but to see, in relation to manufacturing, solid growth in that area is also welcomed by the government. We also saw a contribution coming out of exports in relation to the national accounts figures-a net contribution of 1.2 per cent over the quarter. This is growth in the areas where you would want to see solid growthin relation to investment and in relation to exports. That is where you would want to see growth in the Australian economy, because it is investment that will lead to growth, investment that will contribute to exports. The only other feature that should be mentioned in relation to the national accounts which were released today is that the national accounts clearly highlight Australia's status as a low inflation country. Mr Latham-We can afford a bigger wage increase than $8 a week.",67
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Werriwa!,68
72,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to the measure of gross national expenditure, it showed an implicit price deflator of 1.9 per cent over the year. This has two immediate implications other than the implication that it has had for monetary policy, and we have already seen two official easings under this government over the last several months. It has two other implications. The first is for those who save. Where inflation is low, they know that their savings will not be eaten up by the declining value of money. Low inflation is good for savers, including self-funded retirees. The second area, of course, is in relation to wages. Mr Latham-Eight dollars a week.",68
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Werriwa!,68
74,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have said in this House on numerous occasions, it is no longer necessary for wages to chase prices in the Australian economy, because in a low inflation economy people can rest assured that their wages do not have to chase prices to maintain their purchasing power. This is solid growth. This is growth which is thoroughly consistent with the forecast of 3.5 per cent growth that was put in the budget. This is led by investment. With a low inflation environment, with already reduced official interest rates, that augurs well for continued investment in 1997. Shipbuilding",68
75,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Following your meeting, Prime Minister, with Australian shipbuilders-together with calls by the Premier of Western Australia to reverse the axing of the ships bounty and the threatened backbench revolt on your side over the bounty-will you now reverse your decision to axe the bounty so that jobs in the shipbuilding industry, particularly in Tasmania and Western Australia, can be secured?",68
76,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have nothing to add to what has already been said by the government on this matter. High Speed Train Service,68
77,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of proposals for a high speed train service between Sydney and Canberra? Can the Prime Minister advise the House of the Commonwealth's attitude to such proposals?,68
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, can I say that the Commonwealth government is very strongly committed to a positive, private sector oriented economic future for Canberra and the surrounding region. We are very keen to examine constructively private sector proposals that can strengthen the economic infrastructure of the ACT and lay the basis of new investment opportunities. In this context, I can say that I am aware of a number of proposals that have heen tlo:!ted recently regarding the provision of a high speed train service between Sydney and Canberra. These proposals include the speed rail project and trans-rapid international. I want to announce to the House today that I am writing to the Premier of New South Wales and to the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory to indicate that the Commonwealth has decided to proceed with a joint Commonwealth-New South WalesACT approach to the investigation of options to provide a commercially viable high speed train service. We will establish a competitive tender process and seek expressions of interest from interested parties. The Commonwealth will participate in a joint project control group with New South Wales and the ACT to oversight the tender process. Any future Commonwealth involvement in the project will be on the basis of no net cost to the taxpayer and the project demonstrating its commercial viability. This positive initiative for the national capital is in addition to the recent budget initiative to finance planning of the National Museum in Canberra and the provision by the Federal Airports Corporation of $1 million to examine the feasibility of upgrading Canberra airport to international status. I say to the honourable member for Eden Monaro that the federal government does remain very strongly committed to a soundly based economic future based on growing private sector involvement for the Australian Capital Territory. We are, of course, very strongly committed, as I have announced, to an examination of the feasibility of speed rail projects on the basis and in the terms that I have announced. I look forward to the results of that examination and the responses of interested parties. NA",68
79,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the Republic of Ireland Joint Committee on the Family. I notice that they are accompanied by Ambassador Richard O'Brien. On behalf of the House, I extend to you a very warm welcome. It is a delight to see you here. May you enjoy your stay with us. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Industry: Research and Development",69
80,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Is the minister aware of a call by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, for the government to develop a definitive industry policy and a firm commitment to research and development? Is it not a fact, Minister, that the budget has cut almost $4 billion from industry assistance over the next four years, with a 27 per cent cut to industrial research and development in this year alone? Will the minister heed the call of the Victorian Premier and seek to have these job destroying cuts reversed?",69
81,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question asked by the honourable member for Hotham just reflects on his continuing defence of rorts within the syndicated system of R&D, because the Labor Party still does not address the problems in R&D. The Labor Party made eight changes to the R&D system and still allowed the system to get away with financial manipulation. You did not even manage to fix it. This government has come up to the blocks and has addressed the question of syndicated R&D. We have introduced a START program of grants and interest subsidisation of $520 million over four years, which is an excellent start to research and development. We have maintained the tax concession for profitable companies. Overall, the government spends $3Y2 billion on research and development in Australia. It is a very great contribution to the private sector. I would hope that the Labor Party will support our amendments in the Senate to get rid of the rorts in syndication and support the new program in research and development. Research and development is the key to the future, along with innovation. This is the program that the government will be pursuing in the future. European Union",69
82,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, having in mind that there are a few members of the Irish Dail in the parliament and Ireland is a member of the European Union, whether he could advise the House of the merit or otherwise of press media speculation regarding the negotiation of a framework agreement with the European Union? Are there any outstanding issues in these negotiations? If so, would he advise us of their nature and the progress and resolution of them?",69
83,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the right honourable member for New England for his question. I am glad that he, as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, is showing such an interest in the evolving relationship between Australia and Europe and, in particular, the European Union. There is no doubt that this is a very strong relationship and one that is growing the time. In that context, we have been discussing, as was the previous government, with the European Commission the possibility of signing a framework agreement for cooperation between Australia and the European Community. We had hoped to conclude this agreement by the end of this year, but there still remain three outstanding issues. The first relates to the article on agriculture, which obviously is a matter of fundamental importance to us in our dealings with the European Union. The commission have put forward words that we still would wish to see changed. For example, they have not agreed to Australia's market access proposals. The European Commission proposal on geographical indicators of traditional origin goes much further than our World Trade Organisation obligations and would impose an extra burden on Australian producers. So we are working to have that article changed. Secondly, there is a proposal in the draft text put forward by the European Commission on government procurement. The Australian government is unable to commit itself to the proposal of the commission as it relates to constitutional power of the states, and so we have made that perfectly clear. Thirdly, there has been, and still remains, disagreement between the Australian government and the European Commission on the proposed articles on human rights.",70
84,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why?,70
85,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of which faction in the socialist Left is the honourable member for Calwell the leader? Which faction is it? It a faction of two; it is you and your brother. He, on behalf of himself and his brother in the socialist Left faction No.3 of the Australpolitical Ian Labor Party Victorian branch, asks why. I will explain to the House why. I am very happy to explain to the House why. This proposed article allows the European Commission to suspend unilaterally the framework agreement between Australia and the European Commission if they happen to object to any subjectively defined human rights policies of the Australian government. all A human rights article of that kind does not belong to a trade and economic cooperation agreement. I discussed this matter on the telephone with Sir Leon Brittan last week when I was in Manila. I have also discussed it-since he is present in the House todaywith Ambassador O'Brien of Ireland. These are differences. We have made our position absolutely clear. I will be discussing these matters further with Sir Leon Brittan when I am in Brussels at the end of January. As far as the human rights issue is concerned, this has nothing to do with the Australian government's commitment to human rights.",70
86,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,70
87,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will come to the Labor Party in a minute. I am surprised that you are interjecting, because those who are interjecting do not know very much about the Labor Party's history on this issue. But we will come to that. There is a lot of interjecting from the Labor Party. Their record deserves to be heard, and it will be heard. But before we get to you, let me say that this is not an issue about the Australian government's commitment to human rights. It is about the the appropriateness of operative articles of this kind in the wrong type of agreement. This is not the view alone of the Australian government; this is also the view of the New Zealand government. And we have been speaking closely with the New Zealand government about this matter. It is utterly fatuous for the Labor Party or anybody else to suggest that Australia is not committed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsof course we are. Indeed, let this be underis stood for the record: the Australian government has proposed the inclusion of human rights in a second document with the EU-the declaration currently sitting before the Irish presidency. Of course we do cooperate with the European Union and the commission on human rights questions. The Australian government's position is perfectly clear. We are going to ensure that our national interest is protected and that we do not sign agreements that can be unilaterally repudiated by some subjective standard of another party. Of course we are not going to. We obviously will continue to stand up for Australia's interests in this process, as we would, of course, have expected the Labor Party to do had they remained in government. European Union",70
88,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and also concerns the Australian-European Union Trade and Investment Framework Agreement. Does the minister recall rising in this House on 9 May this year describing the agreement as 'symbolic' and confidently predicting that it would be signed before the end of this year? Now that it has been twice postponed, will he accept that the continued failure to sign it is only exacerbating Australia's trade deficit with the EU and, in the process, costing jobs in Australia?",71
89,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Obviously I do not accept that. But I left the bit on the Labor Party for that question because I could see him getting ready. He walked over to his so-called leader, and he whispered something in his ear. It was, 'Oh, can I ask the next question and attack him on the framework agreement?' 'Oh yes, all right. You go ahead, Laurie.' So I thought, 'I'll put off the bit about the Labor Party.' But we'll come to it. Remember when you were in government? It was not 10 years ago. It was nine months ago you were in government. And what were you doing on this issue? We inherited this from you, like we inherited the Howe Leather problem. You create the problems and then we have to try to sort them out. There is one person in this House who knows this, and that is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He knows this; oh no, two. The member for Canberra knows this too. Remember last year when you were in government? Your ambassador in Brussels-your then ambassador because he has retired since-was expressing concerns to the European Commission about these human rights provisions. Remember that? Oh yes, you do remember that. But you come back into the House now and you pretend that this is something you are deeply concerned about. You take their side, do you? You take their side, as you would expect. What is the Leader of the Opposition's position on these things? Is it the old position of nine months ago or is it the new position today? You know what they say of the Leader of the Opposition: they follow him, but they only follow him out of curiosity. Let me make one other point. On 12 September, this issue became an issue as a result of a report by the ABC from Brussels. What did the Labor Party do? They decided they would make an issue of it on that day-not taking Australia's side, not barracking for Australia. You are always on the other side. You never stick up for Australia. You flabby, weak people! Why don't you stand up for Australia for a change? How about being on our side? It is about time you did. Mr Speaker, what happened-you need to hear this",71
90,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,71
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left!,71
92,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, you should shut them up so they can hear it as well. On 12 September, the shadow minister for trade-the shadow minister for trade is the member for Perth",71
93,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,71
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! You are beginning as a group to sorely test my patience.,71
95,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,As you have indeed tested the nation's patience.,71
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Be warned!,71
97,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On 12 September, the Labor Party's spokesman on trade, who is the member for Perth, contacted my office and asked if my department would provide him with a briefing on this issue. That is a fair request and, of course, it was a request that I acceded to. But let me make this point: before the briefing was provided-so before the member for Perth knew about the framework agreement-he held a doorstop and he said, 'We'd sign it today.' We'd sign it today! He asked for a briefing, hadn't had the briefing, held a doorstop and said, 'We'd sign it today.' You don't even know what is in it. He does not even know, but he would sign it. If I could borrow his chequebook I would enjoy it because he would sign it today as well. The simple fact is",71
98,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the minister is misleading the House. The Labor Party knew what was in that document because",72
99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order? Resume your seat!,72
100,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We contacted the member for Perth from the parliamentary delegation,72
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat!,72
102,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So that's nonsense what you are saying. Mr MCGauran-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the member for Calwell accused the minister of misleading the House without a substantive motion. That needs to be withdrawn.",72
103,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I didn't say he did it deliberately. I withdraw.,72
104,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not have much more to say about the Labor Party on this issue. But if you think you told the European Commission that you would sign up for that text before the election,72
105,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,72
106,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did you? Did you tell them that? No. You told them that? There is no record of you telling them that. But why don't I be generous? Of course you agreed to the idea of negotiating a framework agreement, but you had already expressed your concerns to them.",72
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my point of order goes to relevance. Is it relevant to ask us questions in the course of an answer? Given that he has asked us a question, the answer to the question is that we said yes, we would accept that clause, as every other country which has signed an agreement with the EU since 1992 has done.",72
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We are not debating the issue. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is rapidly reaching the conclusion to a very detailed response.,72
109,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer back to what the spokesman said. He said, 'We'd sign it today.' They were his words. So you would sign away the question on agriculture, would you? You would sign away the states' responsibilities on things like government procurement? You would allow them to have a treaty with Australia where they could unilaterally abrogate the treaty?",72
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the fact of the matter is that he is supposed to be answering questions in this place, but he persists in questioning us. The point I make again is that we had no difficulty with this clause and we made that clear to the Europeans.",72
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,72
112,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that it is an embarrassment to you that your hypocrisy is exposed. If you had made that clear to the Europeans, why did you have the ambassador in Brussels expressing concern about this human rights provision? Why did you do that? Who was running the show?",72
113,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, a point of order.",72
114,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, this is just entering into a debate.",72
115,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My point of order, Mr Speaker, is this: the foreign minister is asking us questions again, which is disorderly. He said, 'Who was in charge of the situation?' The foreign minister, not the ambassador.",72
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister has concluded his answer. Defence,72
117,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Has the minister seen reports today claiming that the Australian Defence Force would no longer focus simply on defending continental Australia but would project force into north-east Asia if the current review were adopted by the government? Further, has the minister also seen claims that this would amount to the biggest shift in strategic thinking since the Vietnam War?",72
118,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about Tasmania?,73
119,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Get the member for Lyons to look after that. I thank the member for Aston for his question. I have seen the report in the Canberra Times. The only thing in that report on the front page of the Canberra Times that is not speculative is that I instructed the department to produce a strategic review. I did that within the early weeks of coming to government. It would be very surprising if I had not done so, for obvious reasons. One of the further reasons is, of course, that the defence white paper in 1994 did not come to grips with the impact of the end of the Cold War on our security and how Australia should respond to those changes. Like past strategic reviews, this review is classified. The government will not discuss the contents of the review but I can say that the review, like those before it, is about Australia's defence and security interests in the broad. It would be absurd, obviously, for it to focus on anything else. We will consider what form of public statement we will make, if any, in due course. In the story on the front page, which is written by Mr MCPhedran, he links three quite unconnected elements and says that the focus of the strategic review is on force projection into north Asia, which is an absurd proposition as a basis for our defence policy. He links this to next year's Tandem Thrust exercise, the planning for which, as honourable members opposite will know, began during the life of the last government. So it is hardly a new policy. Mr Bevis-Oh, good! That is not what you said after",73
120,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You did it and we took the credit for it.,73
121,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is almost as honest as you.,73
122,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We need a bit of honesty every now and then. He links this to a past revelation of his that we are acquiring cruise missiles for the submarines. I know that the Leader of the Opposition has some thoughts on this matter, but it has not been considered by the government. Like so much of Mr MCPhedran's reporting, it is wildly speculative and utterly worthless and I have to say, in as much as he does that, that article and that reporting do mischief to our standing with other countries in the region. Shipbuilding",73
123,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Is the minister aware that the Europeans have refused to reduce their shipbuilding bounty, currently running at over eight per cent, because of intransigence on the part of the Americans, which means that we are clearly at a great disadvantage in Australia? I ask the minister: what was his reason for refusing to meet with the industry when they sought an urgent meeting with him? Under these circumstances, doesn'the think it is irresponsible for his leader to have nothing further to say on the matter?",73
124,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the member for Kalgoorlie must have his information incorrect because I met with one of the shipbuilders only last week. It is worth pointing out, while I am here, in relation to the ship bounty, that when the Labor Party introduced this particular bounty, the minister at the time said: There will be opportunities for the government to offer assistance during the nurturing phase but, of course, taking shipbuilding, for example, government involvement there will be temporary. As a consequence of that, the scheme was set up to expire on 30 June 1997. There was no indication from the previous government that they would extend it. This government, when it made the decision to halt the ship bounty on 20 August, took into consideration this particular commitment. No ship could be built between 21 August 1996 and 30 June 1997. It is a physical impossibility. Mr Crean-What about after that, you goose?",73
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Hotham is running very close to the wind. British Pensions,73
126,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, representing the Minister for Social Security. Is there any financial impact on people currently in receipt of British pensions as a result of the United Kingdom non-indexation of pensions? What is the government's attitude to these pensioners?",73
127,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members would be aware that the United Kingdom does not index its pensions to former residents who live in Australia, and it does the same in relation to most other Commonwealth countries. This contrasts with the United Kingdom's approach to places like the United States of America, European Union countries and the Philippines. The outcome, of course, is that people who have contributed to their pensions in the United Kingdom and worked all their lives there do not receive any increase in their pension if they come to Australia under family reunion provisions. Under all the agreements that we have with other countries, they do index pensions for their expatriates, as we do for Australians who live overseas. British pensioners are clearly disadvantaged if they come to Australia, with the average UK pension paid to Australia now being less then $40 a week. This is a policy that the United Kingdom government knows has significant implications for Australia and the Australian taxpayer. The government has a firm commitment to look after our elderly residents. This is demonstrated by our topping up of pensions of former UK residents, and I want to make it quite clear to the House that this is a policy that will continue. The fact of non-indexation of British pensions, however, does cost Australian taxpayers $80 million a year and we have to contribute very significantly to the cost of their health care and other expenses. The issue has been raised by successive ministers on behalf of Australia. It is one area in which we would have thought there would be a bipartisan approach to dealing with this issue.",74
128,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Except when you threaten not to.,74
129,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that the Minister for Social Security recently put a new option to the UK government following the failure of previous options. That proposal was quite clear. It was that we would secure indexation for prospective migrants from the UK-that is what we were seeking from them-and at the same time we would guarantee to continue to top up pensions for existing residents in Australia who had come from the United Kingdom. That was the clear and unambiguous proposal. But, as we have seen from the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition by the interjection that he just made, they are not happy enough with that approach. They want to be able to try to project into the minds of people who have migrated from the United Kingdom a fear that, in some way, their pensions might be taken away from them or, at least, that any increase might be taken away from them. The Leader of the Opposition, in something that I see is called 'Kim Beazley's pensioner update'-this is a document dated December 1996-says: People receiving a British pension face a serious poverty trap following a threat by the Howard government to stop topping up their pensions. Then he goes on and says: If this threat is carried out, many British pensioners will face an immediate drop in income and others will gradually slide into a poverty trap as the real value of their pensions fall. This is a measure of those who are exploiting the vulnerability of pensioners in relation to their income security. This is not an area that ought to be trivialised in this way and you, as the Leader of the Opposition, have a much higher responsibility to uphold decent values in relation to these matters than anybody else. Industry Review",74
130,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the minister for industry-and please give us an answer.,74
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Calwell will address the minister appropriately.,74
132,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer to the review of government assistance for industry which the minister announced last week. Is the minister aware of concerns by the Executive Director of the Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association, Mr Alex Gosman, that the review would be used as an excuse for further cuts to industry assistance? Minister, will you now guarantee to the House that your review will not lead to further cuts to industry assistance?",74
133,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As with any new government, we looked at the whole range of assistance programs that are before the nation at the moment and we have sought Mr Mortimer to take a thorough review of all those programs to see what their relevance is. It is not designed to cut or add to. It is purely an information seeking review. I am quite confident that Mr Mortimer will come back with a very adequate report.",75
134,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Can the minister assure the House that the review has not been so constructed that its outcome is predetermined so that it will not in fact result in further cuts to industry assistance?",75
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question falls outside the guidelines. War Graves,75
136,Mr MCDOUGALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The minister would be aware of the reality that our proud but ageing veterans community is reducing in numbers each year. As the government has undertaken to maintain in perpetuity the graves of those veterans entitled to official commemoration, what plans have been put in place to meet the ongoing maintenance requirements of the graves?",75
137,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Griffith for his question. As a result of a budget initiative, the Australian War Graves Commission issued a notice in the paper about tendering out some of the responsibility for maintenance of war grave sites. Currently, the Commonwealth has responsibility for over 200,000 Australian war grave sites, and this is growing annually at the rate of about 6,000 per annum. For the benefit of the members of the House, the Australian War Graves Commission has three types of cemeteries that it looks after. There are the Australian war graves cemeteries, the gardens of remembrance and those graves that are placed in civilian cemeteries. I advise the House that we set demanding standards for the maintenance of these war grave sites and there will be no diminishing of our responsibility as a government or any lessening of our commitment to the veterans of our nation. Let me get the record straight for members on the other side of the House. The Australian War Graves Commission have traditionally used contractors for some of their activities, whether it is in the horticultural range or whether it is for growing new plants or whether it is for some of the maintenance of war graves around Australia. This principle is merely an extension of what has been going on for a long time. This is additional spending to ensure that those war graves that are located in civilian cemeteries are maintained to the standard that we see in our Australian war graves cemeteries and in those gardens of remembrance. Mr Allan Morris-How much are you saving?",75
138,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no new saving, in answer to the interjection from the other side. We estimate that this is an additional $180,000 of Commonwealth expenditure to ensure that we maintain in perpetuity the war graves of our veterans. I would urge the shadow minister, in future, before he goes to the press making cheap political points out of this, to ring my office and get the facts, because the article attributed to him in the Courier-Mail is just preying on the most vulnerable people in our community. It is a tacky attack on our veteran community. He ought in future to ring my office and get the facts. This is in line with the same tacky approach that he used in relation to sales tax and the scaremongering campaign that he ran in relation to the TPI veterans of this nation. This initiative will ensure that the war graves of Australians, wherever they are located in this nation, are maintained in the highest standards, based on the principles that this Commonwealth government gave to those veterans, which date back to the First World War. Importation of Cooked Chicken Meat",75
139,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. No doubt the minister is aware that the people he called 'immature reactionaries', representatives of the chicken industry, are in Canberra this week and are indeed in this place today to fight his determination to support the importation of cooked chicken meat into this country. Minister, what action is the government taking to ensure that Australian consumers and up to 50,000 Australian jobs will not be threatened by potentially diseased chicken imports?",76
140,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It was fairly predictable. A little while ago, we had the shadow minister for resources come in here and launch an MPI on me attacking me over chicken meat. The only problem was that he had forgotten that a little while before, up in the Main Committee, he had been saying that he supported the process. Now, of course, we have the farmers' friend from the Hunter Valley, their one rural representative, who, a little while ago, in about May, made the observation that we now had a perfect opportunity to, as he put it in this instance, renege on our obligations under GAIT. But I discovered that he has recently commented in an august journal known as the Quirindi Advocate that a number of people have asked him why the government would even consider the application to import chicken meat. He forgot to mention, of course, that it was his government, or the opposition-in government-of which he is now a part, that considered it and checked off on this. He went on to say-and this is very interesting-that' Australia is a member of the World Trade Organisation and that membership brings certain obligations'. I must say he writes rather better than his father. He says: We can't insist that other nations accept exports while at the same time denying them the opportunity to access our own markets. Mr Fitzgibbon-Are you going to read all of it?",76
141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hunter has asked the question.,76
142,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is the member who just asked the question. He said: There exists no doubt that trade liberalisation delivers massive benefits to Australia and it is important that as a nation we continue to press for access to Asia's growing market. Mr Lee-Read the rest of it.,76
143,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No need to. I will file it if you like, and then you can read it. Mr Kelvin Thomson-On a point of order, pursuant to standing order 321: the minister has been quoting from a document. I ask that he table the document.",76
144,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I just offered to. I would be quite happy to do that. Just to make a couple of other points, your question really goes to the heart of whether or not we are concerned about looking after food safety and hygiene for Australia. Well, of course we are. We maintain a very conservative quarantine arrangement in this country and we will not be diluting it in any way, shape or form, to wit, we have found a substantial amount of extra money to reinforce the northern area quarantine strategy in this country, we are about to release the Nairn review into quarantine in this country and this government will do nothing to lower Australia's quarantine standards. It is very important to make that point. We will not be backing away. I should make the point that of course the people with the greatest interest in this are Australia's farmers. They, like us, supported your push in government for a set of stable and predictable trade access rules and they did so for very good reasons. They know, for example, that under these rules we can access a lot of markets that we have not accessed before. We do not hear the upside of what has been put in place: 70-odd new Australian products into 38 new markets last year, mainly in Asia. That is part of the upside, worth a great deal our of money, and probably that is why Australia's farm leaders in the last couple of weeks have been saying some strong things about how, for example, Australia exports five times as much as it imports and so stands to benefit by supporting science based quarantine and inspection principles. That is from the New South Wales Farmers Association. Don MCGauchie from the NFF says: We cannot refuse to import products simply because of the financial effect it may have on Australian industries, but it is essential to have a high quality inspection service and assessment based on manageable risk to ensure that products which do enter Australia do not place our industries in jeopardy. In this instance, as my predecessor on the other side duly noted, the science had been checked off by such august bodies as the Bureau of Resource Sciences, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory and a whole range of other people, including the state veterinary offices and the Commonwealth veterinary office. Under those circumstances, the Australian people can rest assured that the country's most capable scientific groupings have confirmed that the health security of the Australian consumer has been safeguarded in this case. South-East Fishery",76
145,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. On 29 October it was announced that a working group had been established to recommend adjustment options for the southeast fishery, which is the major supplier of fish to the Melbourne and Sydney fish markets. Could the minister inform the House of the conclusions reached by the working group about the management of the fishery?",77
146,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I am aware of the strong interest that she and the member for Eden-Monaro have in the south-east fishery and in its management problems. Since 1992, the south-east fishery has been managed by a system of output controls called individual transferable quotas. The fact is that the previous government totally and absolutely mishandled the transition to quotas and did nothing to fix its mistakes. Mr Crean-Rubbish!",77
147,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is quite true. The result was endless wrangling, litigation, uncertainty and, I would have to say, a fair degree of gross injustice. During the election campaign, I gave a commitment that the coalition would seek to resolve the endless wrangling in the south-east fishery by mediation, not by litigation. To meet this commitment, my colleague Senator Parer appointed a small working group headed by Mr David Trebeck to recommend adjustment options. The report that working group has prepared is nothing short of an utter indictment of the previous government and of the way they handled this issue. it makes it clear that they hopelessly mishandled the introduction of the quota system and that the formula they used meant some operators suffered a massive reduction in the value of their fishing entitlements. They deceived people about the amount of quota they would be allocatedsome people got less than half of what they had been told that they could expect. It just happens, of course, that the honourable member for Hotham, Mr Crean, was the then minister who handled the introduction of that quota system. In 1991 the industry urged him to delay introducing that system in view of the extreme haste and the uncertainty that had been involved. The chairman-designate of AFMA also urged the member for Hotham to slow down. But he would not listen. He went ahead with the quota allocation anyway, with absolutely disastrous results. The new management plan started collapsing from the day he put it in place. Seven weeks after the new plan took effect, the member for Hotham had to write to the AFMA chairman asking him to review the plan. Seven weeks after he had put it in place! And since 1992 there have been at least eight internal or public reviews into various aspects of the fishery. The honourable member for Rankin, Mr Beddall, was the minister responsible for fisheries from the beginning of 1994 until the fall of Labor. In 1993 and 1994 a Senate committee, the Chairman of AFMA and the South-East Trawl Management Advisory Committee, SETMAC, all advised the government to establish some sort of adjustment program for the fisheries. The member for Rankin's only response was to say that he was examining the issue. That went on for two years, and he was still examining the issue when Labor was thrown out. The working group has recommended: firstly, that AFMA dequota three of the quota species in the south-east fishery-ocean perch, silver trevally and John Dory, which a bycatch species could not have been includagainst ed in the ITQ scheme originally; secondly, that financial assistance be provided to fishing operators whose entitlements were reduced in value as a result of the transition from boat units to quotas; and, thirdly, that buy-out scheme be introduced involving the purchase of up to 50 permits. This would reduce the fishing effort in the area by about 30 per cent and would increase the sustainam ability and the efficiency of the fishery. think that is a very good outcome indeed. We AIDS Week. are cleaning up an appalling mess left behind by the previous minister and the previous administration. The SEF working group has produced an important and thought provoking report. It has consulted extensively with affected fishing operators. The government will make a decision on its recommendations in the new year after it has received comments from AFMA and the industry. Aged Care Funding",77
148,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed most to the Minister for Family Services. I wonder if the minister recalls a report in the West Australian on 31 August which quoted the Prime Minister, in response to questions about the funding of aged care, as saying: ... is it fair and reasonable to say to that person you should borrow some money against that (house) and if it is not paid before you die, it will be paid out of your estate. Does the minister share the Prime Minister's view? Is this not the same as a death duty?",78
149,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have addressed this question in this place before. The coalition has never-I repeat, never-supported death taxes and it does not now.",78
150,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can I add to that answer hy simply pointing out that I do repeat that. The circumstances do not fit a death duty; they fit the repayment of a debt. NA,78
151,Ms JEANES,AIDS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the 16 minister aware that Sunday, 1 December was World AIDS Day? Is the minister aware that as Australia is a recognised leader in the fight AIDS? Can the minister inform the House what Australia is doing to help those the afflicted with HIV and AIDS in our region and to halt the spread of the disease?",78
152,Mr DOWNER,AIDS,"I thank the honourable a member for Kingston for her question. I know she has a great interest in efforts the Australian government is making in these matters. As the member suggested in her question, yes, I aware that Sunday was World AIDS I Day-and I understand that this is World Australia, as a recognised leader in the HIV-AIDS prevention and care area, is right now helping developing countries faced with the devastating consequences of HIV and AIDS. Worldwide, some 22Y2 million people are infected, 90 per cent of them in developing countries. Nearly 50 per cent of new the infections are occurring in women, and 400,000 of the newly infected are children. Although the absolute numbers of people infected are highest in sub-Saharan Africa, the alarming trends are in the spread of the disease in South and South-East Asia. I am keen to see Australia involved in a coordinated regional response to help stop the spread of this disease. I have suggested a regional HIV-AIDS ministerial meeting be held next year to discuss strategies to tackle this pandemic. As a key focus of Australia's health aid programs, assistance to HIV-AIDS activities has climbed to over $14 million a year. Spending on HIV-AIDS activities has been maintained in our aid budget in a very difficult budgetary environment. I am sure the honourable member would be interested in two or three examples of where we have been spending that money. In Papua New Guinea, Australians are working with the PNG Department of Health to develop and implement a national action plan on HIVAIDS. In the Pacific, AusAID is the major financial contributor to the South Pacific Commission's program. In relation to Thailand, the Albion Street Centre in Sydney is helping a Bangkok hospital improve the care of people living with AIDS. In Africa we are supporting a wide range of activities, including a Salvation Army project in Tanzania which provides condoms and AIDS education to street girls and also helps them to find alternative employment. Australia is well placed to continue developing countries deal with the pandemic, especially with the considerable expertise we have in this country-in community organisations, in affected communities, amongst health professionals, in academic organisations and of course in government departments. I am delighted that the federal government is playing such an important role on the international stage in fighting this dreadful pandemIC. Nursing Homes",78
153,Mrs CROSIO,AIDS,"I address my question to the Minister for Family Services. It relates to the government's decision in the budget to impose a new means test on nursing home benefits for older Australians. Isn't it the Minister, that that decision to force these pensioners to pay up to $34 more a day means that a pensioner earning between $70 and $85 a week above the pension-free area will actually lose 104c in the dollar for every dollar earned? Is it fair, Minister, that these pensioners have to pay this rate of tax?",79
154,Mrs MOYLAN,AIDS,"As I have said many times in this House, the Labor Party, when they were in government, when they were in power, presided over a nursing home sector that was in a deplorable state of affairs, which cannot be sustained into the future. What we have done is to introduce a reform package in aged care that is sustainable into the future and that is based on the principle of asking those who can afford to pay a little more toward their care to do so. That is the basis of our package. I would like to highlight that the system over which the Labor Party presided when they were in government did introduce an entry contribution into hostels and, on top of that, it introduced variable fees in hostels. What this meant was a totally open-ended system of fees where there were no controls on proprietors, who could take every single dollar a person earned over and above the pension. That is the harsh measure over which those opposite presided for a decade. It was a totally deregulated system. It grabbed every single dollar a person earned over the pension. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves to assist for the system you put in place. European Union",79
155,Mr FORREST,AIDS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The grain growers of my electorate of Mallee have taken an active interest in your recent visit to the European Union, Minister, and particularly your discussions regarding grain subsidies. Would you please report to the parliament on how progress is proceeding in reform of the common agricultural policy and the nature of your discussions with the European Union?",79
156,Mr ANDERSON,AIDS,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that he has case, been very concerned about the impact of the subsidies by the Europeans and the Americans on international grain prices and has raised the matter very often in this place. It is of concern. It costs Australian wheat producers and grain producers in general a lot of money, and it costs the national economy a lot of money. I had the opportunity in Rome to meet with the US Secretary for Agriculture, Dan Glickman, who made it plain to me that he is very keen to avoid the re-emergence or the opening up again of the use of the export enhancement program for wheat sales from the US, that he feels that at this stage there is no pressure on him to do so and that he is very hopeful that the Europeans are of a like mind. We have seen in recent times the use of some subsidies by the Europeans. It is ironic that only a few months ago they were taxing exports because they did not want exports and now they are back into subsidising them again. But there does seem to be a willingness to acknowledge that it is in nobody's interest to open the whole thing up again and to initiate another trade war. I was interested to note that Minister Borchert from Germany acknowledges, as does Commissioner Franz Fischler, that there is a need for reform of the CAP and that both of them feel that over time real reform can be effective and that they will move down the road, as I understand the case to be, of decoupling. I made the point-in response to their concerns that agriculture in Europe is about more than farm production, it is a multi value thing; they are concerned about preserving the environment and keeping people in rural areas, for example-that it is their business whether they support them but, in so doing, they ought to seek to do so in ways that do not impact on our values, viability, environmental aspects and the rural population aspects and concerns that we have about farmers and rural communities in this country. That point seemed to be well made. We have not made as much progress yet as we would like to make, but it is trending in the right direction. I note with great relief that wheat prices have picked up somewhat in the last week and the slide of recent times seems to be turning around. As I just commented a little while ago to the Treasurer, it looks as though it is worth an extra $200 million or $300 million to the external account as well.",79

Mr GARETH EV ANS- Mr Speaker, you will recall that the Treasurer claimed in question time today that I had said in a doorstop interview this morning that the dollar's fall to 78c or 79c overnight was reason for an interest rate cut. ly nothing of the kind, as will be revealed by reference not only to the transcript but also to anyone's tape of that doorstop interview. What I said rather was that, even with the dollar back to 78c or 79c, there was still a case for a cut. If I might read into the Hansard the full quote stating the opposition's position, I said: . . . we take the view that even with the dollar sitting at 78-79 cents there was a strong case for a greater interest rate cutMr Costello-'For a greater interest rate cut.' Mr GARETH EV ANS-Yes, than last time; a greater interest rate cut than was achieved by the Reserve Bank last timesimply because of the extreme sluggishness in the economy and the need to generate some life combined with the fact that inflation manifestly was very much under control ... The case for an interest rate cut was very much strengthened with the Australian dollar climbing into the stratosphere over the last week but nonetheless even with the dollar back to earth the case is still strong. Mr Speaker, the Treasurer misled the House and he ought to be made to apologise.",80

In the program, 1,024 school groups were previewed to visit the Parliamentary Education Office. I notice, by doing some calculations, that of those 1,024 groups only 15 came from Western Australia. Mr Speaker, I wonder whether you would inquire as to whether or not there are any substantial disincentives for Western Australian schools to participate in the program, given the nature of the subsidy, and whether the 1.5 per cent proportion comprising the Western Australian school groups in this program is a reflection of fair and equitable access to the program.",82

197,Dr NELSON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In making this personal explanation, it is firstly necessary for me to advise the House that Mr Bob Dent was the first person to be euthanased under the Northern Territory's legislation. Mr Rod Dent is his son. Dr Philip Nitschke is the chief medical protagonist in the Northern Territory who is pushing for euthanasia. On the front page of today's Sydney Morning Herald is a story which relates to some views expressed by Mr Rod Dent as to his position on euthanasia. Included in that story is the following quote: Mr Dent told Dr Nitschke in a with his consent by Herald journalist, Ms Gay Alcorn. that he had talks with Mr Andrews, Finance Minister, Mr Fahey, and Liberal backbencher, Dr Brendan Nelson-all anti-euthanasiaand was ordered to attend the press conference. The facts are that, up until March this year, Visits I had met Mr Rod Dent on three occasions. On one of those three occasions, he addressed a Liberal Party branch in my own electorate. I had not seen nor heard from Mr Dent until he attracted publicity following the tragic death of his father in the Northern Territory. On 23 November, he approached me at the New South Wales Liberal Party state council meeting and asked me whether I would facilitate his speaking to the Senate committee when it considered the Andrews bill should it pass through the House of Representatives. I agreed to do this, having expressed sympathies to him about the death of his father, and chose not to raise the issue of euthanasia, knowing his view was quite opposite to my own. He then went on to tell me that he intended to tell the Senate committee that he would be opposing the Northern Territory's legislation and supporting the Andrews bill. He said this on the basis that his father had had no choice but to have euthanasia because of the inadequacies, as he saw it, of palliative care services in the Northern Territory.",82

What you have just said was not my understanding of the standing orders, but I take your advice and will say that inadvertently they have created a false impression this chamber on two occasions with regard comments made by my colleagues.

Mr Dent was the secretary of the local branch of the Liberal Party. When he indicated to me after his father's death that he was the son of that person, he spoke to me about his views concerning the question of euthanasia. I encouraged him at all times to take the view that he felt that he believed in. He indicated to me that he had on changed his mind on that subject only last Friday and that he wished to make a public is statement on that. I made it abundantly clear that he should speak always according to his wish conscience, whether any member of the Party, myself included, agreed with that view or not.

Mr Speaker, my point of order is that it is appropriate for people to ask questions about various matters within your jurisdiction and, obviously, members are also interested in the forms and processes of the House and the application of convention. But it is not appropriate, by interrogation, for the Manager of Opposition Business to be running some debate against you. It is too smart a tactic by half to ask a simple question to be followed by a series of other questions for him to make a point that he wants to make. If he has a problem, instead of disguising it as questions, he ought to put his proposition and it ought to be dealt with in a more open way.",85

Opposition members-What is your point of order?

264,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, in light of the fact that you have just told me that you are required, in response to a point of order understanding order 99, to make a ruling on that point of order, how is that consistent with the view that, if you go away from the House to consider the position with an intention to come back, you are not required to come back on that same point of order and make a ruling? It seems to me that your answer to my second question is inconsistent with that of the first. I ask you to reflect upon that and indicate to me whether there is a requirement understanding order 99, where I take a point of order or any member of the House takes a point of order, for you to make a ruling on that point of order.",86

275,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have taken the question on notice. I am going to reflect on it and I will advise the House. Mr Leo MCLeay-When a member is required to withdraw a matter, he is required to withdraw unequivocally. The member for O'Connor withdrew in deference to you.

277,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I did. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, my point of order again is that the reading of the Hansard will clearly show that the member for O'Connor withdrew his remarks with equivocation. He said, quite clearly, 'I withdraw in deference to you.' The standing orders and the practices of this House require that he shall just say, 'I withdraw,' not in deference to you, me or anybody else. It not matter whether he tells a fib about it; you should get him to withdraw.",87

In those circumstances, you have drawn attention to the disorderliness of the House, but nothing is more likely to prompt people to be unsatisfied and angry about the conduct of this than if remarks that they make in one context are quoted against them when their meaning is being distorted.

This is not a genuine question. This is an attempt to raise a point of order after the event in the disguise of a question. On that it is inappropriate for the member to put that question to you.

289,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The ongoing anxiety being caused to elderly Australians, including thousands of veterans, from the revelation by the government that they will either have to sell their family homes or pay additional weekly fees to obtain entry to nursing homes. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",88
290,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Jagajaga) (3.46 p.m.)The whole parliament and, through the media, the whole country are starting to see how flawed and wrong the government's proposed changes to nursing home funding are. It is an inhumane policy. That is the policy we are being offered from this government. It is a policy that is now being questioned by every conceivable interest and representative group involved in aged care in this country. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) continues to show that she absolutely does not understand the difference between a nursing home and a hostel, and that is a very substantial point. It is the difference between these two things that needs to be understood. People choose to go and live in hostels. They live in them. Many of them do so quite independently for many years. People have time to plan to go to a hostel. There are many other choices. They could have more help in their own home, for example. Of course, for going to a nursing home is quite different. There is no choice. It is not a market. It is a place where elderly people go when they cannot look after themselves any more, and neither can their family. More than 60 per cent of these people are admitted to nursing homes direct from hospitals. They cannot negotiate in a market. That is a callous joke this government is making at the expense of elderly people. The minister says she can offer an ironclad guarantee that no-one in this so-called market will be forced to sell their family home to get into a nursing home. There is no evidence at all in any of the material that we have received from her department-off the back of a truck, of course-that she can deliver on this guarantee. We have a government report from her department which shows that 63 per cent of residents of nursing homes have a saleable asset-the family home. The department has made its estimates about how much it will raise for nursing homes on the basis that all of these people will sell their family home. If they do not sell the family home, there will be no money for nursing homes. We know for sure the government will not provide it. This government has taken $500 million out of nursing homes in this budget. So the minister cannot have it both ways. Either the nursing homes get the $130 million because people sell their family homes or there is nothing at all for nursing homes. There is no other pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. The same departmental paper makes it clear that they expect three-quarters of new residents to nursing homes in the next year-in the year that this starts operating-to pay an entry contribution. They estimate that, on average, that will be $26,000. The department's estimates are based on people selling their homes. Most of them do not have any other assets. The second document that we have comes from the funding and implementation issues working group, set up by the minister to advise on the implementation of this dreadful policy. It is in this document that we see the dreadful horror of this government's intentions slowly unravel. The working party say that they want access to nursing homes to be on the basis of care needs, but they say in their document to the minister that no specific regulation is going to be needed to make sure that this happens. They do not think there is any need to regulate this issue, which would have to be the most important issue facing older people going into nursing homes. This is naive in the extreme. This government wants fees to be set by market forces. The minister must be the only person in the country who does not know that those who have more money will get in before those who have less money. I am sure she knows how market forces work. Real estate, after all, works that way. The highest bidder buys the house. This government is not proposing any regulation that would prevent a nursing home taking the elderly person with the most money. As a nursing home proprietor in Adelaide said to me recently, they will have no choice. They will have to get the entry contributions to survive. Take the following example which this nursing home in Adelaide put to me. If a person comes along with $80,000 to pay to get in-and the minister says it is quite possible that this will be the fee charged-and somebody else comes along with $10,000 and has the same care needs, and they both have to get into that nursing home, who is the minister kidding about who will get in first? Of course it will be the person with more money. The minister is the only person in Australia who does not think this is what is going to happen. All the elderly people in Australia know this. All the nursing home owners know that this is the case. This is very bad policy. It is the first time that we will be seeing people getting access to nursing home care on the basis of how much they have to pay. It is un-Australian. Many nursing homes are run by people who see their mission as caring for the frail and sick. They do not want to take people with money ahead of those who need care but have no money. However, they are saying to me that they know they will have to do that because otherwise they will not be able to maintain their nursing home. They are questioning their whole mission in caring for the frail and sick. The second issue in this working party report is that there will be no controls on the level of entry contributions. At the moment, the average fee calculated by the department is going to be $26,000. But, as the minister and her government know, the great thing about market forces, as this report confirms, is that the sellers will charge whatever the market will bear. As this report makes clear, there will be no regulations on how much they can charge. We had a call in my office yesterday from a concerned nurse in a nursing home. He was concerned because the nursing home where he works has decided that it will charge an entry contribution of $60,000. It has decided this on the basis of the home values in its local area. On the basis of this figure, the nursing home has calculated that it will get an extra income of between $5 million and $6 million. He called this a transfer of care from the needy to the greedy. This is a process in which the minister is culpable. Another idea which we have heard about this week in the parliament is this notion of periodic payments. This new element of choice for elderly Australians, as we have tried to demonstrate in the parliament this week, is a farce. We have had another call from an elderly person saying, 'I have a house that I could rent.' The minister's adviser is quoted as saying this morning that the elderly will not have to sell the family home as they could rent it. Let us look at the figures. If the house is worth $150 per week in rent, as this pensioner's is, let us look at whether they will be able to rent out the house rather than sell it. A pensioner will lose 50c of every dollar earned above the income free zone. Tax then has to be paid on the rent. With the government's new means tested additional nursing home fee, 25c in the dollar will be paid as a result of that nursing home fee. This person can only earn $82 per week. The periodic payment estimated by the industry is $105 per week. Of course, these older people will not be able to rent their homes. They will have to sell their homes. The third issue, which was also revealed in the parliament yesterday, concerns second entry contributions. The minister has admitted in this place that some people will have to pay twice. She claims: Very few residents will need to consider the payment of a second entry contribution. I suggest to the minister that no-one would like to consider the prospect of paying a second entry contribution. I certainly know it is the case in nursing homes in my electorate that older people are very concerned about having to pay two different entry contributions. The next issue involves carers. This is another very serious matter. It is only someone who has been in the same home and caring for the elderly person for five years who will not have the home sold out from under them. What about the daughter who moves in with the elderly dad to keep him company after her mum has died? He can be well, and she does not have to care for him. She is not getting the carer's pension. He could later have a stroke and need to go to a nursing home. Where does the daughter go when the family home is sold from under her to make sure that her dad gets into a decent nursing home? This legislation will have a devastating impact on families. It will cause intergenerational strains and conflicts like !lothing we have ever seen before. The minister says that there will be some prudential arrangements. But let us look at the working party report. There is absolutely no indication in that working party report that the industry has been able to come to any agreement about what these prudential arrangements will be. It is absolutely imperative that we see this whole sorry package at least capped off with decent prudential arrangements. We look forward to seeing those very shortly from the minister, given that the industry cannot come to any agreement. This is a very awful and unfair plan. It will mean, without question, that we will have a two-tiered nursing home system in this country. Elderly Australians knew nothing about this before the election. They had no idea that they would be paying these entry contributions, that they would have to sell their homes to get into a nursing home, that they would be paying an additional means tested fee once they got into the nursing home, that they would lose their dental program and that they would have to pay more for pharmaceuticals and home and community care. They did not know any of these things. They were not told about them. When one has discussions with older people around the country, one realises that they are quite horrified. They had no idea that this government, which previously had been seen to be sympathetic to the needs of older Australians, could do this. They look to me and say, 'How could the government have done such a thing?' That is the question. I was in Adelaide recently talking to a group of elderly citizens. One lady was particularly concerned. She was going blind and realised that sooner or later she would have to go to a nursing home. What she was most concerned about, as most elderly people are, was not herself. She was not thinking of herself and what would happen to her in the nursing home. She was thinking of what was going to happen to her husband, who she felt would not have sufficient funds left to live once they had paid the up-front fee. This story has been told to me over and over again. So many people are concerned by the changes that this government has introduced. They are concerned partly because the government is not able to answer any of their questions. They have no idea what the pruthe dential arrangements will be and whether money will be kept in a safe place. They no idea how much they will be paying. it be $26,000 or, as the minister admitted this week, $80,000? We have no idea what it will policies. be. Is it any surprise that elderly Australians are very concerned about what is going to happen to them? People had no idea that this government was going to introduce such callous changes. It is going to get the message loud and clear from older people around this country that they see these changes as callous. They do not believe, because they are not naive, as the minister seems to be naive, that people with money will not take precedence over those without. Of course that will happen. If we down the path of market forces-which what this government wants to do-then there will be no choice either for the individual for the nursing home. It will be the case that those with money get access to nursing homes ahead of those who do not have money. Every older person around Australia knows that. They are afraid of it. They are afraid what this government is doing to nursing policy home care. There is not a person in this country who ever chooses to go into a nursing home; they only ever go there when they need to. This is very bad policy. As I have said, it is un-Australian. We believe in fair access health services. We believe in fair access nursing home care. It is time threw this policy out the door and started again.",88
291,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in this matter of public importance because this shadow some, minister has taken an unfinished discussion paper-it is still under consideration by the community, that is, the industry, the health on professionals, the consumer groups and the unions-and is now trying to package it up and pass it off as government policy. She is scaremongering with misinformation and gross exaggeration. It is, in my view, the most callous act that I have seen in this parliament since I came into this place. It is callous in extreme to go out there and deliberately their frighten and scare off some of the most have vulnerable citizens in this country with Will misinformation, exaggerationMs Macklin-They are frightened of your",91
292,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I listened to you pretty much in silence. You could do me the courtesy of the same. You are callous and your party is callous in the extreme to go out there frightening and scaring people. It is interesting to note that you must have at least one friend left in the industry. You managed to pick up a paper that is under discussion. It is incomplete. It is still being discussed by the industry. I think that shows a great deal of callousness and lack of caring. It demonstrates go a greater interest in purely playing politics is than getting out there and having some concern about what is happening to older or Australians in this country. It masks the fact that this party over there, while they were in government for well over a decade, had no answer to this problem. It masks the policy vacuum that they lived in. of That was very evident when they put their out. Here it is. I have it here to table in the House today during this speech. This was the extent of the Labor Party's policy on innovation and aged care and community care when they came up to the last election. Here it is: one page, eight paragraphs, just a little to over 200 words. That is the extent of their to concern about aged care in this country. I the government table that document. We inherited a nursing home sector in a deplorable condition. We have to take the to fix it in a fair and decent way. We will fix it, and we will do it in a way that is fair to all Australians. We will ask of course, to make a small contribution towards their own care. That is not unreasonable. It is the only way, given the enormity of the task, the enormity of the mess that we have been left, that we can fix the problem that confronts us and all Australians in the community today. The Labor Party have had, you could say, a conversion on the road to irrelevance. For 13 years they allowed the nursing home sector to go into decline. For 13 years the Labor government were content to neglect the circumstances of the frail and elderly in our nursing homes. They were content to make them into second-class citizens. They were content to preside over a two-tiered system that saw anyone who went into a hostel in good salubrious accommodation but saw those in nursing homes condemned to buildings that were falling down around their ears, that were firetraps and that were in a deplorable and disgraceful condition. You did nothing about it. You were the senior adviser to this government during that time. You did nothing to fix that problem.",91

294,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Labor legacy to older Australians and future residents of nursing homes condemned them to inferior standards of accommodation which I doubt any of the out of touch silvertails sitting on that the House would have any idea about today.

She comes in here day in, day out carping and whingeing about what we are doing, but they did nothing in government to solve the problem. They continue to do nothing. Her answer to the problems today is to continue to do nothing, to sit on her hands. The Labor Party have no credible policy alternatives. For the entire period that she was the Labor government's senior social policy adviser, she countenanced this decline. She was the architect of this - ystem that is in decline. Even after Professor Gregory highlighted in 1993 the need to provide $130 million a year to rebuild the capital base of the nursing home sector, the Labor government failed to make provision for the viability of the future of the sector. They ran down the capital that they were providing to build up the stocks. They had no alternatives. This report was yet another example of where the previous Labor government undertook an industry review, only to then shelve the results, to sit on them. They accuse us of not knowing where we are going. We know absolutely where we are going. We are going to put prudential arrangements into place. We are discussing those with consumer and industry groups. They had no prudential arrangements in place. There are no prudential arrangements in place in the system that they designed. It is open to abuse. The previous Labor government allowed the critical assessment of the needs of the aged side of care sector just to gather dust on the shelves-they did nothing about it-such was the commitment to aged care by the former minister, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). Labor had no commitment to correct the parlous state of nursing homes in this country. That was a gross dereliction of duty, a failure to honour a duty of care to our older citizens. It was a clear and unequivocal statement by the Keating Labor government that it was quite happy to condemn older people as second-class citizens. The Labor opposition, led in this instance by the shadow minister, is determined to undermine the delivery of a high quality aged care service in high quality modem facilities, for purely selfish political reasons and a callous disregard for the truth. There are no sound policy options underpinning Labor's opposition to the government's reform package. It is simply crass, secondclass politics from an out of touch and irrelevant opposition. The government's aged care structural reform package is a light on the horizon. It is a light on this hill for elderly Australians. A comparison of the policies of this government and the Labor opposition is revealing. I have already tabled their commitment to policy-eight paragraphs. They were able to fill less than one page with their policy. The elderly in our communities need to understand very clearly that the concern of the Labor Party for the aged in our community is new found. We need to ask the shadow minister: where was the Labor Party's commitment to the aged in the lead-up to the 2 March election? The sum total, as I said, was eight paragraphs. We also need to examine the Labor Party's specific commitments to address the capital crisis in nursing homes and to improve the standard of accommodation. There were none. They were running down their capital program and they had put into place no alternatives to provide it. I would like to quote from Labor's policy document, but there is not one word about the capital crisis in nursing homes that I can quote from. Mr Ronaldson-What, no policies?",92
298,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Not one word. They have eight paragraphs of policy and, when I examined that policy to see what they were going to do about the capital crisis that was outlined by Professor Gregory in 1993, there was not one solitary word about how they were going to fix that problem. It is the ultimate policyfree zone, I suggest. By comparison, this government have presented a detailed policy agenda for the aged and the important complementary issue of carers, healthy seniors and community care. There are a number of issues that I would like to reiterate for the benefit of members opposite because they do not seem to comprehend, or do not want to comprehend, my answers to questions in question time. Entry contributions are not compulsory. The government will not be setting the level of entry contributions, just the same as they did not it in the hostel sector when they were in government. Ms Macklin-That is right. Exactly. Eighty grand.",93
299,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You did not set any limits. For the financially disadvantaged, they will not have to pay an entry contribution, but this government will pay a higher level of subsidy for the financially disadvantaged to ensure that they are not denied places in a nursing home. There will be no additional government impost or surcharge on pensioners, unlike some of the policies that Labor implemented and which we will fix such as the variable fee charging policy where a proprietor could grab every dollar and leave the person with a pittance, regardless of the standard and type of care they were receiving. The policy that the opposition presided over while they were in government was a disgraceful policy. We will ensure that there is no additional impost or surcharge on pensioners. There will be very strong prudential arrangements to protect the assets of residents. No person will be forced to sell their home to fund an entry contribution. No-one will be denied access to care because they cannot make an entry contribution. Ms Macklin-Where is the guarantee?",93
300,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Will you stop your carping and whingeing? That's all you have ever done since you came into this place and it would be a good idea if you came up with something decent to say. Talk about something constructive that will help the elderly in this country. No person will be denied access to care because they cannot make an entry contribution. Access to nursing homes and hostel places will continue to be based on the degree of frailty, not the ability to make an entry contribution. Not every nursing home will be eligible to charge entry contributions. There will be flexibility and choice offered to individuals in how they decide to pay their entry contribution, if that is the arrangement that is in place. Our policy is an integrated package that focuses on the needs of the elderly throughout the community; it does not just focus on one set type of care. Underpinning our policy is the concept of ageing in place, not leaving elderly or older frail people in a situation where they have to be moved from one facility to another. If they enter hostel accommodation and they become increasingly frail, our policy is such that the funding will follow the degree of mental and physical frailty of the individual rather than moving them out of one section across the tarmac to another, just because of the inefficiencies and the inadequacy of the former government's policy. We are determined to provide a sustainable future for aged care in Australia-not making these decisions for short-term political expediency but making them in a responsible way so that they are sustainable in the long term, that they are good policies for this country and its people. I do not resile from the objective, nor do I apologise for the fact that it mean substantial change to the current delivery of aged care services. It will mean a lot of talking and working out with both community industry groups and consumer groups. I make no apologies for that either. Importantly, unlike the Labor Party when it was in government, I am implementing the government's aged care reforms in a spirit of consultation and cooperation with all sectors of the community. We will act where Labor failed, we will work with the industry where Labor failed, we will implement policies that provide a viable future where Labor failed and, importantly, we will not allow a further erosion of the capacity of the aged care sector to meet the demands of an ageing population. We do not support the continuation of Labor's discriminatory two-tiered system that has resulted in a marked distinction between the quality and the viability of hostels and nursing homes. Under this government's aged care policies, all Australians will be treated equally. The government makes no apologies for making these changes. They have been long overdue. The industry and consumer groups have been calling out for the changes for well over a decade, and we have taken up those calls. As I say, to take unfinished discussion papers that are still under consideration by community groups and to package them and pass them off as government policy is scaremongering. Putting out misinformation is callous in the extreme-as I said, the most callous act I have seen since I entered this place. The fact is that we have taken the hard policy development decisions to ensure a decent and sustainable policy of care for the frail aged. We inherited a nursing home sector that was in a deplorable condition and we will, indeed, take the responsibility to fix that. If it means a bit of difficulty in working through the detail, so be it. We have put forward a very clear blueprint to ensure that everybody knows what our intentions are. We have given a very good guide. We make no apology for working through the detail with the community sectors. As I said, we inherited a nursing home will sector in a deplorable condition. We will take the responsibility to fix it in a fair and decent way and we will continue to go about that work. This opposition ought to be condemned for its callousness in spreading misinformation, exaggerating details and in scaring the most vulnerable citizens in our country. It is a disgrace.",93
301,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Cunningham) (4.16 p.m.)When the Australian Labor Party comes into this chamber and endeavours to defend the rights of the aged and the veterans community in this country, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) says that we are scaremongering. She says that we are heartless, uncaring and do not have a commitment to aged care. Not once did the Australian Labor Party' in government, in one hit, cut $500 miIIion out of aged care in one budget. The government has done so and she stands condemned in this place for participating in that. My role in this discussion of a matter of public importance in the chamber today is to talk about the effect that this vicious policy of the government is having on the veterans community of this country. In 1995 there was a seminal report on the special aged care needs of the veteran community published by the previous government-that is, by a Labor government. The introduction to that report stated: The Taskforce acknowledged that veterans have made a special contribution to Australia which needs to be recognised in a tangible way. Historically, veterans have been treated by the Commonwealth Government as a special group, with the provisions of special benefits, income support, health care and compensation. The special status of the veteran community ought to be recognised as a 'special community of interest' in aged care planning as veterans reach the final years of their lives and require access to a wide range of aged care services. That task force report for the veteran community was followed up by a formal budget and policy response for the veterans alone worth $50 million. The policy was applauded by the RSL at the time as being a model response to the needs of the veteran community and was accepted, indeed, by the coalition. All tiers of federal government would recognise the special status of veterans, I am sure. God knows, we get the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), and many others, going around with their hands on their hearts, standing in this place and talking about the special place of the veterans community. I have actually paid tribute to this minister as I have gone around to RSL clubs and conferences and said that, in the main, he has done a pretty good job in quarantining the veterans community from the viciousness of the budget cuts led by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). But what he has not been able to stop is the cross-portfolio cuts. What he has not been able to stop is the attack in the home and community care area, the attack on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and, of course, dare I say, aged care, being led by the Minister for Family Services, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), and certainly being trundled along by the Treasurer. It is interesting that, with the advent of this Howard government budget for 1996-97, the idea has been shot to pieces that the veterans community can look forward to some form of security. There is no acknowledgment, for example, of the ripping out of the heart of the veterans community considerations. There is no acknowledgment of the special status of veterans when it comes to the $26,000 nursing home entry fee, many of whom would have to sell their family homes to pay, as my colleague has already pointed out. Not even TPI veterans will be spared this impost. Yet, as the minister said in her contribution, this is a small amount. She says for veterans and for people in the low end of the economic scale that this is a small amount. She also pointed at me and called me an 'out of touch silvertail'. The sort of attitude being expressed by your ministerial colleagues clearly shows who are the silvertails. Yesterday, in the Senate, Senator Alston said that everyone has enough money to buy shares, when he was talking about the disposable income levels of the average family. Tum it up, Minister! There is no acknowledgment of the special status of veterans when it comes to the recently announced nursing home monthly fee that many will have to pay. There is no acknowledgment of the special status of veterans when it comes to the pharmaceutical co-payment, as I have said. There is no acknowledgment of the special status of veterans when it comes to the new income testing of recurrent subsidies in hostels and nursing homes and, for a single veteran, that could be as high as $238 a week. Deny that! Where is the Minister for Veterans' Affairs? He should be in here to deny that as well. There is no acknowledgment of the special status of veterans when it comes to the new user charges for the home and community care program. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has consistently refused to acknowledge or even comment on these betrayals of the veterans community. No mention was made of this in any of the glossy Department of Veterans' Affairs budget documentation. When asked about it in the parliament the other day, he hid behind this minister who is in the chamber at the moment. The other day, in this place, I asked him about this whole question of $26,000 and having to sell the family home, and what did the Minister for Veterans' Affairs say? He said, 'Obviously the shadow minister for veterans' affairs has not been listening to the Minister for Family Services. I endorse the statements of the Minister for Family Services. We are working together on this issue.' So the veterans community knows that he is working very closely with the Minister for Family Services. If they work any more closely together, these two are going to be candidates to take over from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) and probably, dare I say, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). The coalition pointed the finger at the Labor Party and its minister's contribution. She tabled a policy which was supposed to represent what the Labor Party stood for. The Labor Party had been in government for 13 years and had delivered not only for the veterans community but also for aged care. The coalition's pre-election promise to the veteran community was explicit and unambiguous. It stated the coalition would, and I quote the minister, 'maintain all existing veterans' entitlements'. The reality is that it is so far removed from that promise as to be almost laughable. The veterans' affairs Portfolio Budget Statements, for example, list savings over the next four years of $280 million. On 18 September the Minister for Veterans' Affairs said in this place: The veterans' affairs 1996 budget package honours key election promises to the veteran community. It provides for simpler and more flexible entitlements. It is fair, with better access to services and more assistance to help veterans help themselves. Help themselves into a nursing home if they can afford it, he should have said. How is it fair that a totally and permanently incapacitated veteran-a person who laid down their life for Australia in its hour of need and suffered debilitating injuries as a result-now, under this government, has to pay $26,000 to get into a nursing home? The TPI veteran may also have to sell his home to pay the fee. If not, he may have to pay an additional fee of around $15 a day. If this TPI veteran moves to another nursing home, he will have to pay it again. It is interesting that this minister stands up in this place in question time and talks about hostel care and nursing home care as if it were one and the same. Don't you understand the difference? Don't you understand that the type of care is totally different? Hostel careyou have a choice to go into it to get some care. Nursing home care-there is not much choice. If you are a veteran and you are faced with the prospect, you and your ministerial colleague come along and say, '$26,000 minimum up-front-sell the family home or rent the family home.' That is typical coming from a former real estate agent, 'If you can't sell it, rent it.' That was the comment made by the minister today and reported in the paper. You are going to find these people left out in the cold. The shadow minister in her contribution quoted Mike Seccombe from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of a couple of days ago. The article, headed 'Liberals spare the greedy', states: Let's not forget the way the Government has turned market forces loose on the nursing home industry. Family Services Minister Judi Moylan continued to sound entirely unconvincingaccording to the galleryas she denied elderly peopleincluding veteranswould have to sell their homes to pay the entry fees. The article is dead right about this. You might reckon we have not quite got it right over here, but there are a few people around this place who clearly can see through the facade that you, Minister, put up. You parade yourself as caring and sharing with your bleeding heart on your sleeve and then you slug them for $26,000. You say, 'If you cannot sell your home to get'into a nursing home, rent it out to somebody and I'll do the deal.' This is an uncaring, unsympathetic government. When it comes to veterans, when it comes to people who are aged and in need of care, you have no idea. When it comes to the minister and her mate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs who says that he is working very closely with her, neither of them can come up with a credible policy option between them-slashing money out of the nursing home system, slashing money out of aged care generally. They stand condemned. (Time expired)",94
302,Mrs SULLIVAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Moncrieft) (4.26 p.m.)When it comes to participating at this stage of the debate on this matter of public importance it is almost a case of an embarrassment of riches. I do not know where to start on the rubbish that has been talked about on the other side. But I think I will start with one the last things that was said because it was also one of the first things that was said. It was a mistake or error or something very strange indeed that was said by both the shadow minister for aged, family and community services, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). We are told in this place first of all by the member for Jagajaga that hostel living is something you choose to do. It is an alternative form of accommodation. I find this absolutely breathtaking. Anybody who has any experience of trying to get somebody into a hostel lately knows that they go through a mile of red tape. Nobody gets into a hostel without an assessment by the aged care assessment team. You have to go through the bureaucracy. You have to be assessed. No hostel on the Gold Coast will take you unless those forms are filled in and an assessment of what the needs are for the person who is applying has been undertaken. A hostel is not cluster housing. A hostel is a place where elderly people go for very particular support and care-not of the intensity of a nursing home, agreed, but you do not get into a hostel without that assessment. You are living in cloud-cuckoo-land if you think it is any other way. I do not know what has been worse in the opposition's contribution to this debate today-the shameless scare tactics, misrepresentations and heap of untruths that it has used, or the hypocrisy that it has applied throughout its arguments. I am just aghast at the untruths that have been told in here. I hate to think what is being said outside by the member for Jagajaga in her conversations with those hostel supervisors. We are not hearing it and there is not the opportunity to correct it. In due time nursing homes and hostels will all know the truth and you will be shown up for what a disgraceful individual you are. I cannot think of anything worse than the tactics that are being run in this House-and obviously outside-in relation to the elderly in our community. I cannot think of anything worse. Elderly people feel some vulnerability of about their future, and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has very carefully constructed everything she has done and said so far in this issue on behalf of the government to reassure, to open up all the possible options and to give all possible support-and we have the shadow minister, very clearly, going outside and telling untruths. By the way, I was just a little intrigued when I knew that the MPI referred to veterans. I have a fairly high proportion of elderly people in· my electorate. The number of veterans in Australia is declining. In my electorate they are increasing. That tells you something. I am getting a higher concentration of veterans than most other people in their electorates, and that is a trend. Not one veteran has come to me on this subject-not one-and I am constantly in contact with major veterans' organisations. I had contact as recently as one week ago. I would think some veterans will come to me in the next few days or few weeks as this garbage is pedalled through the veteran community. At least I now know what to be ready for. I know the sorts of things that I can tell them, and I will tell them very bluntly. In fact I might even get in first. Ms Macklin-What will you tell them?",96
303,Mrs SULLIV AN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will tell them about the nonsense that has been talked here today. I can only assume that this reference was included because the shadow minister for veterans' affairs is so lowly rated in his area and has got so little to say and so little to attack the government on in relation to what we have done in veterans' affairs that he has to hang his hat on this other MPI being run by the member for Jagajaga. There is no MPI of substance he could bring up by himself. Let us just get on to the hypocrisy side of it. The ALP's policy on hostels is parallel to what this government has done in relation to nursing homes. Every time that issue is raised, the shadow minister for the aged, family and community services veers away from it. She pretends she has not heard and just ignores it. There is no difference in principle between what we are doing in terms of entry contributions into nursing homes and what Labor did in relation to hostels. It is exactly the same. The shadow minister opened up with an example of some fee which she says is being proposed in a nursing home that she knows something about. I am indebted to the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) for providing me with a letter today in which he refers to a nursing home in his electorate, a major aged care facility, where the board is going to take a recommendation that no entry contribution be charged. Ms Macklin-Where will they get the money from?",97
304,Mrs SULLIVAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am sure you will go up there and hear all the good news and be very happy for the aged people in Port Macquarie. You will go there with a smile on your face and you will come out with joy in your heart, because the aged people are being well looked after. That is typical of what is going to happen Australia wide. You are going to get everything from zero right through to whatever the upper figure is. The point is elderly people are going to have choice, and it is going to be tied into the institution. Most importantly, something is going to be done about nursing homes in Australia. There was no ambiguity about the promises that we made when we went into the election in relation to that. I have heard this babble from over there about what is going on in my electorate. For 12 years I have been in here complaining about what the Labor government has been doing in the area of aged care, particularly as it applies in my electorate, one of the major areas in need of aged care in Australia. I have been saying for a long time that what is wrong with the aged care area is the rigidity between hostels and nursing homes. I have been saying how difficult it has been to move down from a nursing home to a hostel; I have been saying how inflexible the system has been. I have been saying for a long time that we have not had enough beds provided in nursing homes. We have had hostels virtually having to fill the role of nursing homes because of the dearth of nursing home beds, particularly in my electorate. I have also been saying that I lament the lack of encouragement for people to go into the industry and to do anything about it once they are in there. I go into nursing homes where the care is excellent but the poor old souls are in rooms with three or four others. Mrs Moylan-Sometimes eight.",98
305,Mrs SULLIVAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Sometimes eight, as the minister says. That is what has happened under Labor in the last 12 years. That is what old people have been able to look forward to. I have seen people go in who have been quite clear and happy in their minds. Because there is no choice, they have been put into a bed in a room with a person that they should not be near, and within six months they are mental wrecks. The people who went in with clear heads become mental wrecks because the nursing homes have no choice. I can also tell the House, as I did last year, that the Gold Coast Hospital, the major public hospital in my electorate, has empty beds in it. We have waiting lists years long for certain types of surgery, and it has empty beds-it has no shortage of beds-because at any given time, between 35 and 40 geriatric cases are occupying beds in that hospital because there is nowhere else for them to go. Geriatric cases are very heavy on resources for hospitals. They should not be in hospitals. They are much more demanding of resources than the average hospital patient. The hospitals want nothing more than an opening up of resources and some encouragement of nursing homes so those geriatric cases can go to where they will be more appropriately cared for and those other people-the battlers; the people the Labor Party bleats about, but does not really want to know about--can get the medical care they need from the hospital. That is the reality of all these years of Labor government. The reality is that we have had a running down of nursing homes. This government has taken the parallel of the Labor Party's policy in relation to hostels and is giving us hope that something will get better. It needs to be remembered that nursing homes are not hospitals. Finally, the Labor Party's record in the area of dementia care will be a blot on the record of aged care in this country for many a long day. It will be only through encouragement to upgrade facilities and to get resources into facilities that the really dependent and frail aged will have some hope of security. I contrast that with the disgusting scare tactics that have gone on day after day in this place-they have fooled one or two peopleand the insistence on ignoring the facts that the minister has given. The Labor Party stands condemned. (Time expired)",98
306,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The discussion is concluded. VOTES AND PROCEEDINGS: RECORD NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional,99
307,Mr CREAN,OF DIVISION,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Hotham from moving the following motion forthwith: That the House orders that the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives for Tuesday, 19 November 1996 be amended in respect of the division on the motion to suspend standing and sessional orders--closure of question moved by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, in which the Member for Cowper is recorded as purportedly voting with the ""Ayes"", for the following reasons: (1) Standing Order 202 clearly indicates that, after tellers have been appointed for a division, no Member may move from his or her place until the result of the division is announced. (2) The fact that the Member for Cowper moved from the area to the left of the Chair (voting with the ""Noes"") to the area to the right of the Chair (voting with the ""Ayes"") after tellers were appointed is clearly made out by: (a) the video tape record of the division in question; (b) observation of those in the Chamber at the time, including the Members for Hotham and Chifley, who raised points of order immediately; (c) the Member for Cowper's unreserved apology for the incident on 21 November 1996; (d) the Speaker's comment on 4 December 1996 that ""The honourable Member for Cowper has unreservedly apologised to the House for moving late in the piece"". (3) The fact that the Member for Cowper has unreservedly apologised does not bring the matter to a close as: (a) the Member for Hotham has, on a number of occasions, asked for the provisions of standing order 202 to be enforced, and for an apology; only one aspect of the request has been met; and (b) the admission of liability constituted by the apology leaves the question of standing order 202 and the record of proceedings undetermined. (4) The House expects exemplary behaviour in observance of the requirements of the standing and sessional orders by the Member for Cowper, who, as the Deputy Speaker, is a senior office-holder and consequently whose actions should be accurately recorded. Orders (5) The Votes and Proceedings constitute the official record of proceedings of the House, and, if not amended to reflect events, they will remain as an inaccurate record of what occurred in the House on Tuesday, 19 November 1996. (6) At a time of professions of increased parliamentary probity, it is blatantly incongruous for the official record to be left to remain at variance with events in the House.

309,Mr SHARP,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. I take great pleasure in introducing the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996. As outlined in my second reading speech covering the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996, this bill is an essential component of the dangerous goods regulatory package which has been developed by the National Road Transport Commission and key stakeholders under the intergovernmental road transport agreements. This bill proposes a number of administrati ve amendments to the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995. These amendments have been identified over the last 18 months during extensive consultation with Commonwealth agencies, state and territory dangerous goods regulators and key industry groups on the dangerous goods regulatory package. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",102
310,Mr LATHAM,HANSARD REPORT,"I move: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would preclude the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) from moving the following motion forthwith: That the House agrees that the Hansard debate should record, as per the Hansard log book and advice of the Chief Hansard Reporter, that the correct interjection of the member for Werriwa in debate on 5 November 1996 at page 6349 was, 'It's not your role to speak for the Aboriginal people.' It is very important for the House to suspend BILL 1996 standing orders so that this matter can be corrected and the House can understand the Speaker's disgusting role in the whole affair.

312,Mr SHARP,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. I take great pleasure in introducing a package of two bills which form part of the national road transport reform program being undertaken cooperatively by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. The Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 is necessary to facilitate the adoption of a nationally uniform regulatory regime for the registration of heavy vehicles. The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996, which I dealt with earlier, is an essential component of the dangerous goods regulatory package designed to facilitate the adoption of a nationally uniform regulatory regime for transport of dangerous goods by road. Both bills that we have introduced this afternoon are essential components of the regime of reformed road transport law being developed by Commonwealth, state and territory governments and the National Road Transport Commission under long standing intergovernmental agreements. The objectives of national road transport reform are to produce improvements in road safety and transport efficiency, as well as reductions in the cost of administering road transport. The efficiency of Australia's road transport system has in the past been undermined by inconsistent or contradictory road regulations determined by each of the states and territories, and this has impeded Australia's economic development. Accordingly, in January 1992 the National Road Transport Commission was established following agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories to develop nationally uniform or consistent regulations relating to the construction and use of heavy vehicles. One of the priority areas set out in the so called heavy vehicles agreement was the development of a national heavy vehicle registration scheme. The commission's role was subsequently expanded by a second agreement relating to light vehicles. This agreement, among other things, required the commission, as a matter of priority, to develop and maintain national standards and associated codes of practice in relation to the transport of dangerous goods. The government strongly supports national road transport reform, as a significant component of transport micro-economic reform. A nationally uniform or consistent regime for road transport regulation, rather than separate, inconsistent state and territory regulation for the road transport industry, will deliver substantial benefits to the industry, its users and the wider community and economy. It will remove the frustration, delay, inefficiencies and costs associated with differences in regulatory frameworks. The national registration scheme to be established by the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 is the first step towards removing the problems associated with the lack of national uniformity in the registration of heavy vehicles. The bill will establish the broad regulatory framework for the scheme. The registration package will improve transport efficiency, enhance national uniformity, and reduce administrative costs, particularly for transport operators. The aim has been generally to retain the best features of existing practices and preserve flexibility for jurisdictions to appropriately manage local issues. While the bill contains a number of substantive provisions relating to the powers of registration authorities, the security of personal or commercially sensitive information and the review of decisions, it is intended that the administrative detail of the scheme will be contained in the regulations to be made under the proposed act. The regulations will also set out the obligations of registration authorities and registered operators of heavy vehicles. The registration reforms were developed by the National Road Transport Commission in close consultation with the road transport industry and vehicle registration authorities in all states and territories. Wide consultation was also undertaken with enforcement agencies and authorities responsible for the administration of third party insurance and stamp duty legislation. The proposed legislation requires compliance with existing state and territory laws in these areas. Comments received through these consultative processes have assisted the commission in refining its final proposals. The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996, which I dealt with earlier today, assists the development of the new national regulatory regime for the land transport of dangerous goods. The new regime contains three key components: the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act which was passed through this parliament in 1995 and which provides the broad legislative framework; the proposed Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Regulations which define the powers and duties of people involved in the transport of dangerous goods; and the sixth edition of the Australian Dangerous Goods Code which comprises the technical requirements forming the basis of the duties that are set out in the proposed regulations as well as several non-mandatory guidelines. The aim of the dangerous goods amendment bill is to amend the act to ensure that the proposed regulations and code can be appropriately administered, once made. The Ministerial Council for Road Transport voted unanimously in favour of the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 and the associated regulations. On passage of the bill, it is intended that the regulations will commence by proclamation on a date approved by the ministerial council. Ministerial council also voted unanimously in favour of the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996. The associated regulations are currently being sidered by state and territory regulatory authorities. Both bills have also received the support of industry and other major stakeholders. The measures in the heavy vehicles registrastance. tion bill will have negligible impact on Commonwealth revenues or expenditure, but will impact on the states and territories. The costs of implementing the scheme will fall mainly on registration authorities, $12.4 million in net present value terms, while recurring benefits will accrue to those same registration authorities, $) 0 million, vehicle operators, $14 million, and enforcement agencies, $1.5 million. The light vehicles agreement signed by heads of government requires the National Road Transport Commission to demonstrate significant net benefits before including light vehicles in the scheme. Due to the high implementation costs which would be incurred by registration authorities, and the low estimated benefits of only $3.5 million annually-that is, 30c per vehicle-the commission recommended that the legislation not be extended to all vehicles at this time. The measures in the dangerous goods amendment bill have no impact on Commonwealth revenues or expenditure. Both bills have widespread support and I urge states and territories to act speedily to adopt the reforms underpinned by the legislative package, once enacted by the Commonwealth. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned. NA BILL (No.2) 1996 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.52 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) con1996 contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Most of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals in this House. I will briefly outline the changes of subThe Customs Tariff Act 1995 reenacted legislation contained in the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and incorporates about 350 tariff classification amendments recommended by the World Customs Organisation, WCO, to which Australia is a contracting party. The overall aim of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 was to maintain levels of tariff assistance which would have been in existence on I July 1996 in the previous act. Schedule 1 of this bill contains amendments which were made to ensure the correctness of detail in the new Customs Tariff Act before it became operative on 1 July 1996. Most of the changes are of an editorial nature correcting format and spelling anomalies. The more substantive changes are: the rates of duty for beer, spirits, tobacco products and certain petroleum products are the subject of half-yearly adjustments in line with movements in the consumer price index, CPI. The rates of duty for these goods increased on 1 February 1996. Those increased rates of duty are being included in the new legislation. This is necessary to establish the correct commencement duty levels for future CPI duty adjustments; in the 1995 Spring sittings the tariff treatment of topped crude oil was amended in the Customs Tariff Act 1987 but has not been incorporated in the new act. The same provisions are legislated in this act; one of the WCO changes amended the definition of newsprint. The initial interpretation of the meaning of the change was incorrect. In consultation with industry representatives, a new tariff structure for newsprint has been agreed and is included in this amendment. The new structure will preserve existing rates of duty; and there are minor drafting changes to vehicle alarm systems and passenger motor vehicle components of heading eighty four nineteen. Schedule two of this bill is operative from 15 July 1996. Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No.1) 1996-act 32 of 1996-contained consequential changes as a result of amendments to the tariff concession system. Item 19 in part (ii) of schedule 4 allows the concessional entry of goods which have been sent overseas for repair that cannot be carried out in Australia. The amendments contained in act 32 would have meant that importers would have paid duty on the value of the exported articles in addition to that on the repair cost. Administrative procedures were implemented to ensure that customs duty was only collected on the repair cost of the re-imported goods. This amendment gives legal effect to the administrative action taken on 15 July 1996. Schedule 3 of this bill is operative from 1 September 1996. On 20 August 1996, my colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, announced a reduction of 0.75 cents per litre on the duty on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene. The duty reductions stem from the overrecovery during 1995-96 of the aviation industry's contribution to the operating costs of the civil aviation safety authority. The industry contribution is collected by the Commonwealth through a levy included in the customs and excise duty on aviation fuels. This reduction will deliver savings of more than $13 million to the industry in 1996-97. This is consistent with the government's commitment to fair and equitable safety regulation cost recovery arrangements. The other changes contained in this bill are of an administrative nature and have no duty implications. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",104
313,Mr WILLIAMS,HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 implements a number of significant and important changes to the administration, functions and procedures of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. These reforms will enhance the promotion and protection of human rights of all Australians and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the commission. This government remains committed to the promotion and protection of human rights. The government is concerned that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has the administrative structure to ensure that it provides timely services, in the most effective and efficient manner, to all parties under the legislation it administers. This bill is the first step towards reform of the administration of the commission and the streamlining of its structure. Over the coming months, the government will be examining further reforms to the structure of the commission. The first major reform which will be implemented by this bill is this government's response to the High Court's decision in Brandy v. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1995) 127 ALR I, which is referred to as the Brandy case. In the Brandy case the enforcement mechanism in the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which commenced operation in 1993 and by which the determinations made by HREOC became enforceable as orders of the Federal Court upon registration, was found to be unconstitutional. This decision also affected the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Privacy Act. As a result of the decision, an interim scheme was introduced by the previous government which reinstated the scheme existing prior to the 1993 amendments. Under the interim scheme, except where the respondent is a Commonwealth agency, determinations made by HREOC are unenforceable and the complainant must go the Federal Court for an enforceable remedy. Therefore, unless the complaint is against the Commonwealth, the parties face the possibility of two hearings of their dispute--{)ne before the commission and one before the Federal Court-before obtaining a binding decision. This bill provides that all complaints of unlawful discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, SDA, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, DDA, and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, RDA, and complaints of breaches of human rights and of discrimination in employment under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, the HREOC Act, will be made to the commission under the HREOC Act. The main procedural steps under the scheme would be: (a) a complaint alleging unlawful discrimination under the RDA, SDA and DDA would be lodged with the commission; (b) upon acceptance of a complaint-that is, a decision by the commission that the matter is within jurisdiction-the president would inquire into the complaint and attempt conciliation; (c) if a matter is not accepted as a complaint, review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act of that rejection would be available; (d) at any stage after acceptance, the president will be able to terminate a complaint on specified grounds, for example, on the ground that there is no reasonable prospect of the matter being settled by conciliation; (e) if the president terminates a complaint, the president must notify the complainants in writing of that decision and of the reasons for that decision; (f) once a complaint has been terminated by the president and a notice has been given by the president, a complainant will have 28 days, or such further time as the court allows, to commence proceedings in the Federal Court should they want to do so; (g) at the time proceedings are brought before the court or at any subsequent stage, any commissioner except the Privacy Commissioner could, with leave of the court, intervene as amicus curiae and make submissions on such matters of law or policy as the commissioner thinks fit; and (h) the Federal Court will have jurisdiction in relation to the complaints and be able to make all appropriate orders, including interim injunctions where these are necessary, as the case requires. The court will have the power to delegate some but not all of its powers to judicial registrars. I will briefly outline the main differences between this proposed scheme and the interim scheme now in place. First, the bill introduces uniform procedures for handling complaints under the three anti-discrimination acts based primarily on the procedures in the most recent of the human rights acts, the DDA. Second, all inquiry and conciliation functions will be matters for the president and not the individual commissioners. Third, there will be no inquiry or hearing of unconciliated or unconciliable complaints by the commission as happens currently. Under the new scheme, once a complaint is accepted by the commission and forwarded to the president, the complainant will be able to access the Federal Court as soon as the complaint is formally terminated by the president, unless the termination is made at the request of the complainant. Finally, the commissioners other than the Privacy Commissioner are to be removed from their current role of attempting conciliation, which the bill will confer on the presiresponsibility, dent and are to be given a function of amicus curiae to argue the policy imperatives of their legislation before the Federal Court, but are subject to obtaining the leave of that court. The bill does not alter the interim scheme introduced by the previous government to the extent that this applies to the enforcement mechanism under the Privacy Act. Although the Privacy Commissioner is a member of the commission, there is a separate complaints mechanism under the Privacy Act. As part of the government's commitment to the development of a co-regulatory approach to privacy protection within the private sector, the government will be examining the complaints mechanism under the Privacy Act and the relationship between the Privacy Commissioner and the commission. The Privacy Commissioner will not be conferred an amicus curiae role as under this bill this role is in relation to complaints of sex, race and disability discrimination and, unlike the other commissioners, the Privacy Commissioner still has a conciliation of complaints function. The bill also introduces a number of important access and equity reforms. The court will be able to adopt informal procedures as it will not be bound by technicalities or legal forms. Special registry procedures will be established for human rights matters. The court will be able to make rules of court which delegate any of its powers to judicial registrars apart from the power of granting interim injunctions. 'Any' in this proposed section may include all. In addition, where there is hardship, either party to a proceeding will be able to apply to the Attorney-General for financial assistance for the proceedings. Another access and equity initiative is the requirement for the commission to assist complainants in completing the necessary forms to commence proceedings in the Federal Court. In addition, the president will be able to prepare a report for the court on a terminated complaint and may give a copy of the report to a commissioner or the parties. The second major reform made by this bill will be to clarify the lines of management facilitating timely decision making by providing for the better administration of the commission. The president is to become the chief executive officer, CEO, of the commission. These functions are currently conferred on the commission itself. The president will also become responsible for all complaint handling under the Commonwealth's anti-discrimination and human rights legislation. In addition, the implementation of cooperative arrangements with the states and territories, where these exist, will be carried out by the president. The amendments made by this bill are complex. This is because the different procedural provisions of three schemes have been amended to introduce a single complaint handling stream and a uniform procedure into the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. In making these changes, the government has taken steps to ensure that the new procedures represent best practice. The bill removes some quasi-judicial functions from the commission and the commissioners. The bill maintains the commission's role in conciliation, as this step in the process has proved most effective and, indeed, most complaints do not proceed past this stage. The bill also more clearly delineates the commission's function of impartially attempting to conciliate complaints from the commissioners' advocacy role for the protection of human rights. These, together with the new management structure of the commission, are important and timely reforms. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",107
314,Mr WILLIAMS,CRIMES AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This is a portfolio bill which contains a number of minor policy and technical amendments to portfolio legislation. I will deal the proposed amendments in the order in which they appear in the bill. The first is amendments to correct anomalies in relation to the cancellation of employer-funded superannuation benefits. It is proposed to amend part VA of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 to deal with the situation where the manner of sentencing for multiple offences produces a result which fails to trigger the cancelling of employer-funded superannuation provisions where policy indicates that they should be triggered. Both acts provide for cancellation of employer-funded superannuation benefits where a person is convicted of a corruption offence and sentenced to more than 12 months imprisonment. Where a person has committed multiple offences, the court may impose a sentence in such a way that the sentences are cumulative, partly cumulative or concurrent. For example, a person could be convicted of two counts of fraud and be sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for each count, with three months of the sentence on the second count to be cumulative to the sentence on the first count. That means the head sentence is 15 months. Similarly, a court might impose a single sentence which exceeds 12 months in relation to multiple offences instead of imposing a sentence for each offence, any of which would not exceed 12 months. In the example I just mentioned, the court may order a single sentence of 15 months for both offences. In both those examples, the individual terms of imprisonment do not exceed 12 months, and therefore a superannuation order may not be made against the person. The proposed amendments make a technical amendment to align part VA of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 with current sentencing practice. A superannuation order may be made if the single sentence in respect of multiple corruption offences or the aggregate of sentences in respect of multiple corruption offences exceeds 12 months. Further amendments to the Australian with Federal Police Act 1979 and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 are proposed to exclude sentences that are an alternative to full-time incarceration from the scope of sentences that cancel employerfunded superannuation benefits. The effect of those amendments is that a superannuation order may not be made against a person who is convicted of a corruption offence and receives a sentence under subsection 20AB of the Crimes Act-for example, periodic detention-even if the sentence is for a period longer than 12 months. The Crimes Act 1914 is to be amended to increase the value of a penalty unit. In 1992 it was decided that all pecuniary penalty provisions in Commonwealth legislation were to be expressed in penalty units to enable penalties to be adjusted from time to time. The penalty unit approach allows the real level of fines to be maintained on a uniform basis. The legislation was designed in such terms that, by amendment of section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914, the value of the penalty units applicable to an offence under any Commonwealth act or regulation could be varied to reflect current money value. Since the enactment of the provision, inflation has diminished the value of penalties. According to figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the change in the consumer price index numbers between June 1992 and September 1995 is calculated at approximately 9.6 per cent. The penalty unit will be increased from $100 to $110. The Customs Act 1901 is to be amended to permit cost recovery in relation to storage and maintenance of confiscated narcotic-related goods. The amendment is aimed at enabling the Commonwealth to recover out-of-pocket expenses it incurs in relation to the transportation and storage of narcotic-related goods that are condemned and placed in commercial storage facilities prior to the goods being transferred to the Official Trustee for disposal. Narcotic-related goods are, generally speaking, vehicles or vessels used in drug traffickmg. The amendment will allow the Commonwealth to recover its costs just as the Official Trustee recovers similar costs under the Customs Act. The amendment does not extend to full cost recovery for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will not be entitled to recover its expenses such as the salary of staff, nor is it entitled to recover expenses that are an ordinary incident of its operation. Ordinary everyday running costs such as office expenses and telephone or facsimile charges are not recoverable. Rather, it is the extraordinary costs such as the costs of transportation of narcotic-related goods to a place of storage and the actual storage charges that will be recoverable. The Extradition Act 1988 is to be amended in two minor ways to correct deficiencies in present provisions. The first amendment will make it clear that, if a person makes an application for bail on the merits and fails, the person is not able to make a further application unless there is evidence of a change in circumstances that might justify bail being granted. Currently, where a magistrate remands a person in custody after the person has made an application for bail, the person is not entitled to apply to any other magistrate for release on bail during that remand. That would be unfair if the person's circumstances change such that bail would be justified but the original magistrate is no longer available, for example, if the original magistrate has resigned or retired. The amendment will overcome this deficiency while still achieving the purpose of restricting 'magistrateshopping' . The second amendment to the Extradition Act deals with the appropriate procedure following the arrest of persons who are believed to have escaped from custody. The amendment will make it clear that the appropriate action following arrest is to take the person before a magistrate for testing of the arresting police officer's belief that the has escaped from custody. The magistrate will be required to be satisfied that the person has escaped from custody authorised by the act before issuing a warrant authorising return to custody. Currently, a person who has been arrested by a police officer without warrant, when the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has escaped from custody, can simply be returned to custody. Several minor and technical amendments are made to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. The first relates to applications for variation of restraining orders, and extensions of time. The Proceeds of Crime Act allows a court to restrain property of defendants charged with serious offences. The property that remains restrained six months after conviction is forfeited automatically to the Commonwealth. A person may apply to the court to have the restraining order varied to release any or all of the property from the restraining order, but that application must be listed, heard and decided before the end of six months after conviction. Because many defendants await the outcome of the trial before applying for a variation of restraining orders, applications need to be heard and determined within six months and that often places considerable pressure on court lists. The amendments are designed to alleviate that pressure. Where an application for a variation of a restraining order is made within the statutory six-month period, the amendments will stay the forfeiture of restrained property until that application has been judicially determined. Another amendment to the Proceeds of Crime Act relates to creating a defence of reasonable corporate precaution. Under the Proceeds of Crime Act a body corporate is vicariously liable for the criminal conduct of its directors, servants or agents. Other Commonwealth legislation establishes liability similarly but at the same time provides a defence of reasonable corporate precautionfor example, subsection 65(2) of the Ozone Protection Act 1989, a provision which is used as a model for this proposed amendment. The proposed amendment prevents the criminal conduct of directors, servants or agents person from being imputed to a body corporate where the body corporate can demonstrate that it took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct of its directors, servants and agents. The final act amended by schedule 1 of the bill is the Witness Protection Act 1994. The integrity of the national witness protection program established under the Witness Protection Act is of paramount consideration, not only for the witnesses on the program but also for the Australian Federal Police members who carry out the protection. Accordingly, section 22 of the Witness Protection Act creates various offences relating to unauthorised disclosure about the program or witnesses. Subsection 22(2) of the Witness Protection Act makes it an offence for a person who is or who has been a Commonwealth participant on the program or a person who has been assessed for placement to make certain disclosures, unless authorised to do so by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The Ombudsman may investigate complaints about the program either on the complaint of a person or on her own initiative under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. The proposed amendment to subsection 22(2) will enable a Commonwealth participant, a former participant or a person who has undergone assessment to make disclosures, without obtaining the consent of the Commissioner, when making a complaint to the Ombudsman under either the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 or the Ombudsman Act 1976. Schedule 2 of the bill removes the requirement in several Commonwealth acts to obtain consent to prosecute. The bill provides for the repeal of certain provisions requiring the consent of a minister before a prosecution can be instituted against a person suspected of a Commonwealth offence. Those provisions were originally enacted for the purpose of deterring private prosecutions brought in inappropriate circumstances, particularly for offences which related to national security or international treaty obligations. However, since establishing the office of Lhe Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions the retention of those provisions is difficult to justify. That is particularly so now that the Director of Public Prosecutions has the power to take over and discontinue a private prosecution brought in relation to a Commonwealth offence. Once the consent provisions which appear in the bill are repealed the director will have the task of instituting proceedings for the relevant offences. In relation to those offences it is appropriate that an independent office holder have the power to decide whether to prosecute. The bill does not affect consent provisions which relate to sensitive issues of national security or international treaty obligations. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned. NA REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",110
315,Mr WILLIAMS,FINANCIAL TRANSACTION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The principal object of these amendments is to give effect to several recommendations of Checking the Cash : A Report on the Effectiveness of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, the FTR Act, by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, 1993. Honourable members will recall that the principal act was part of the Commonwealth's package of legislation, developed following the Costigan Royal Commission into the Painters and Dockers Union, to combat organised crime. It erects barriers in Australia's financial sector to discourage use of the sector by criminals and allows the provision of financial intelligence to law enforcement and revenue agencies. It plays a major role as an intelligence tool, able to expose the illicit movement of money, particularly cash, and to facilitate the following of the money trail, both back to its source to identify the financiers and organisers of criminal enterprises, and outwards to locate the proceeds of crime, which may then be available for confiscation under the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, another component of the anti-organised-crime package. Austrac is the agency constituted under the FIR Act to receive, analyse and distribute to law enforcement and revenue agencies information received from the cash dealers covered by the legislation. The recommendations of the Senate committee which were accepted by the government and to which these amendments give effect are: Recommendation 12-state and territory revenue authorities to be allowed access to FIR information; Recommendation IS-an expanded definition of 'transaction' to include, for the purpose of the reporting of suspicious transactions, preliminary negotiations which do not proceed to a concluded transaction; Recommendation 16-suspect transaction report information to be inadmissible in court proceedings; Recommendation 18-to increase the reporting threshold for imported and exported currency and to define the point at which currency is considered to have been exported; Recommendation 19-to require bullion sellers to identify customers. The other main features of the bill are: it establishes a regime of reporting of significant transactions by solicitors; it consolidates Austrac's existing powers of inspection, that is, powers to access and examine the records and record keeping systems of persons required to keep records under the act; it updates the penalty provisions of the act in accordance with current drafting practices, and aligns the quantum and expression of penalties with those in other Commonwealth statutes; it updates other specific provisions that contain superseded terminology or are otherwise in need of modernising; and, finally, it makes minor technical amendments to correct minor drafting errors. As honourable members will have noticed, many of the proposed amendments are of a legislative maintenance or housekeeping nature, of little effect other than to improve the useability or increase the clarity of the principal act. I will speak in detail only about those proposed amendments which have a significant impact on the policy of the legislation. First, let me mention the background to the proposal that state and territory revenue authorities should have access to FIR information, leading to the proposed amendment of subsection 27(1) by item 52 of schedule 1. The value of FIR information was brought home to states and territories in the course of the National Crime Authority task force known as Operation Quit, which involved the cooperation of the state and territory revenue authorities. That was a task force established in 1990 following a preliminary investigation into suspect transaction reports which ultimately uncovered massive tobacco licence fee fraud covering several jurisdictions. The recoveries by the affected jurisdictions as a result of the task force were at least $10 million up to $20 million. When the task force was wound up, the state and territory revenue authorities ceased to have access to FIR information. Understandably reluctant to give up a source of intelligence of such proven value in protecting the revenue, they made submissions to the senate standing committee seeking regular access. The committee was persuaded that their continued access was both reasonable and in the public interest. Its only reservation was the concern that the privacy safeguards of the Privacy Act 1988, central to the Commonwealth legislation, would not apply to the state and territory revenue authorities. As honourable members may know, there is no equivalent state or territory privacy legislation which would apply. The proposed amendment deals with the privacy concerns by requiring a revenue authority of a state or territory to undertake that it will comply with the information privacy principles set out in section 14 of the Privacy Act before the director of Austrac may authorise it to have access to FIR information. That would appear to place the revenue agencies on a similar footing to Commonwealth agencies which are subject to the Privacy Act. Failure to abide by the undertaking could result in loss of access to the FTR information. Item 16 of schedule 1 amends section 3 by inserting subsection (7), adopting the committee's recommendation to make it clear that a 'transaction' includes a proposal or negotiations for a transaction, in order to include negotiations terminated before completion. 'Transaction' is not defined in the principal act and simply has its normal meanmg. In some situations suspicion may actually arise only from the fact that the person did not complete the transactions, and that may occur upon learning of a requirement of the act. There is a clear investigative advantage in permitting as wide a range as possible of suspicious activity to be brought within the ambit of the act. Item 30 of schedule 1 amends section 16 of the act to make it clear that certain material in relation to suspect transaction reports is admissible in any legal proceeding other than prosecutions under sections 29 or 30 for offences involving a cash dealer's giving false and misleading or incomplete information in relation to obligations under the act. In the course of consultation in developing this proposal, its purpose has sometimes been misunderstood. It is not possible for the defence of an accused person to be unfairly impaired by the proposal. Indeed, it is likely that the type of material covered by the provision would normally be held inadmissible in any event, failing to pass the test of relevance or on grounds of public interest immunity. Suspect transaction reports, the information contained in them, or information about whether such a report was prepared can never be evidence as to whether or not a person committed a particular offence or whether an investigation was properly carried out. That material or information is purely intelligence, a possible trigger for an investigation to obtain admissible evidence to prove a particular offence. However, from time to time attempts have been made by defence counsel to subpoena such material and the appropriate officer of a cash dealer, usually a bank teller. Because of the nature of the material, the purpose of such a subpoena can only be a form of fishing expedition, perhaps to discredit the teller in some way or to confuse the jury about the significance of the material. Because such attempts have occurred, tellers are nervous about being subjected to hostile cross-examination, and for several years financial sector unions have sought protection for their members. There is undoubtedly potential for any successful attempt to cross examine a teller in an aggressive or humiliating way to permeate rapidly throughout the industry. The effectiveness of the highly valued suspect transaction reports depends almost entirely on the willingness of front-line bank officers to observe the behaviour of clients and the nature of their transactions. If a person's behaviour or transaction arouses suspicion that a taxation offence or a serious criminal offence may be involved, the teller not files a report under section 16 of the FIR Act. If tellers become intimidated, it is likely that they will cease to form relevant suspicions and an invaluable source of criminal intelligence will dry up at its source. However, I must emphasise that the admissibility of potentially relevant evidence that may be given by officers of financial institutions will not be affected. Tellers, or any other officer if appropriate, may be called to give evidence, and be cross-examined on it, as to the identity of a defendant or the fact that a transaction occurred. The final major amendment which I propose is contained in new section 15A of the principal act, item 26 of schedule 1 of the bill. That is not an amendment which was recommended by the Senate committee. I have decided that the Financial Transaction Reports Act should be amended to require solicitors to report to Austrac all transactions with their clients of $10,000 or more in cash, that is, in currency. They would also be required to include in the report particulars of the client's identity as known to them. Over a decade ago, in 1984, the Costigan commission, the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, reported that some solicitors had let their trust accounts and perhaps their strong rooms be used as a means of parking and laundering illegally obtained funds. The commission noted that, and I quote its report: There is no doubt on a great deal of the evidence before me that certain solicitors have allowed trust account, if not their strong rooms, to be employed as repositories for monies, the source of which, on any rational view, could only be illegal enterprises. The commission's report goes on to say, 'By depositing monies with such solicitors, some hope or expectation is held that law enforcement agencies will have difficulty in locating the funds and in seeking explanations for them.' More recently, in 1991, the National Crime Authority undertook a study into money laundering in Australia. It found that solicitors had often played a part in money laundering operations by assisting in the purchase of property in a way that disguised the source of the funds or the identity of the owner, for instance, the use of false names or 'nominee companies' and through trusts. The NCA found that solicitors also assisted money launderers by placing cash proceeds in trust accounts, for instance, before settlement of property purchases, or for sending overseas-by wire transfer---or for returning to the criminal in the form of a loan. Another technique the NCA reported was used by solicitors was the arranging of false loans with other parties on behalf of criminals. The loans were repaid with the proceeds of criminal activities. Honourable members may also recall that evidence presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in 1993 indicated that solicitors in some areas of Australia-in particular, suburban practices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Gold Coast-are handling significant amounts of cash on behalf of clients. The present exclusion of solicitors from the reporting provisions of the FIR Act could represent a loophole capable of being exploited by criminals seeking to evade those provisions for the purpose of evading tax or laundering the proceeds of crime. The purpose of the anti-organised crime legislation was to create an environment hostile to the successful commission of crime, especially those crimes, such as drug offences, which generate large quantities of cash that needs to be laundered and which are likely to their be associated with organised criminal enterprises. Any identified loophole which assists those seeking secretly to move or launder cash must be closed to maintain the integrity of the system. I should make it quite clear that solicitors would not be subject to all the requirements which apply to cash dealers under the FIR Act. They will not have to carry out the client identification requirements that apply to account opening. They will not be required to report suspect transactions, international funds transfer instructions or maintain the same record keeping systems as cash dealers. Their obligations will be limited to reporting cash transactions of $10,000 or more, providing particulars of the client's identity as known to them and, if requested, providing access to records and record keeping systems to authorised Austrac officers. The obligations are not onerous. Solicitors who never receive cash of $10,000 or more from a client will have no obligations. There will be no impact on such a practice at all, apart from the requirement to submit records from time to time for the inspection of Austrac officials performing their compliance monitoring functions. Those monitoring powers are set out in proposed new section 27D in item 59 of schedule 1. Proposed section 27E lays down the conditions which apply to an authorised Austrac officer, including the giving of written notice and confining the inspection to business hours. The solicitor is obliged to comply with the notice. Failure or refusal to comply with the notice, or to comply with the reporting requirements of section 15A, constitutes an offence, which attracts a penalty of two years imprisonment-as contained in subsection 28(3). The remammg provisions of the bill improve the effectiveness of the principal act but do not introduce new policy or make any substantial changes. The opportunity is taken to insert a new part VIA in the act-item 59 of schedule I-to consolidate the inspection powers of staff of Austrac. There is no substantive change to the powers. The bill inserts a new part IlIA-item 49 of schedule I-dealing with bullion sellers. The amendments require any person who is in the business of selling bullion to identify their customers in the same way as a financial institution identifies its customers who open or operate accounts. The amendments also rectify some technical problems with the definition of 'bullion dealers' whereby some were able to escape the operation of the act, hence the alteration in concept from a bullion dealer to a bullion seller. The remainder of the bill makes technical amendments to update the penalty and offence provisions, eradicate superseded terminology and correct minor drafting errors. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned. NA BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",112
316,Mr MILES,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.33 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill forms part of a package of three bills to give effect to the government's 1996 budget decision regarding retirement savings accounts. Retirement savings accounts, or RSAs for short, have a central role to play in the government's strategy for increasing choice and competition in the superannuation sector. Choice gives employees greater scope to control the management of their superannuation savings. Increased competition will raise the standard of service delivery throughout the industry. It will also facilitate greater product innovation and diversity and place downward pressure on fees and charges. This bill allows banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies to provide superannuation without a trust structure in the form of retirement savings accounts from 1 July 1997. Superannuation has traditionally been provided through a trust structure. However, the trust structure is less relevant in the case of prudentially supervised institutions-that is, banks, non-bank financial institutions and life insurance companies. The government's RSA reforms will enable these prudentially supervised institutions to provide superannuation directly off their balance sheet. This will facilitate a more cost efficient delivery of superannuation without compromising the security of member benefits. RSAs will be a simple, low cost, low risk product. In particular, they will be required to be 'capital guaranteed'. This means, in effect, that the account balance and any accumulated earnings or interest cannot be reduced by negative investment returns or downward adjustments to the value of investments underlying the policy. The accounts into which a member andlor an employer on the member's behalf will be able to make contributions will be fully portable. They will be owned and controlled by the member and will be subject to the retirement income standards applying to other superannuation products, including preservation and disclosure rules. Disclosure rules for RSAs will be simplified, however, in recognition of their capital guaranteed nature. Employees will also be able to transfer amounts out of RSAs at any time, although RSA providers may require notice of not more than 12 months to minimise liquidity risks and ensure orderly administration arrangements. The low cost, low risk nature of RSAs will be particularly attractive to certain sections of the community. RSAs should be especially suited to people with small amounts of superannuation, such as itinerant and casual workers-those wishing to amalgamate several small superannuation accounts, and those nearing retirement who wish to minimise the market risk on their superannuation savings. Fees should be low and the accounts will be subject to the 'member protection' rules which apply to superannuation accounts with less than $1,000. RSAs should also be particularly beneficial to women with interrupted working lives who may need a flexible, low cost and easily accessible product for the receipt of irregular contributions. RSA providers will benefit from being able to offer a cost efficient delivery of superanformer nuation and the ability to use more explicitly the institution's name in marketing superannuation as well as from enhanced customer relationships through the provision of onestop shop services, for example, through branch networks. Regulation of RSAs will have two elements: prudential supervision for institutional soundness of the RSA provider, and functional supervision for compliance with retirement income and other superannuation standards. There will be no duplication of prudential supervision, which will be carried out under existing regulatory frameworks, for example, by the Reserve Bank of Australia, in the case of banks, and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission and state supervisory authorities, in the case of building societies and credit unions. Functional supervision of RSAs and RSA providers will be undertaken by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, which will regulate compliance with retirement income standards. These standards ensure that RSAs are maintained for genuine retirement purposes and provide for a well-informed membership. This bill is closely modelled on relevant provisions in the regulatory regime currently in place for superannuation entities under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. This will ensure that the treatment of RSAs in relation to the superannuation standards is as consistent as possible with that applying to existing superannuation products. Industry associations representing prospective RSA providers and the consumer movement were closely consulted on this bill. There will be extensive consultation in the development of the regulations covering disclosure rules for RSAs, member protection, preservation and other matters, to ensure neutrality between RSAs and broadly equivalent products offered by public offer superannuation funds. It is intended that the date of effect of the bill will be 1 July 1997. In closing, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of the former member for Bradfield, Mr David Connolly, in the development of the concept of RSAs, and the Assistant Treasurer, Senator the Hon. Jim Short, in implementing this election commitment. Both of these people have contributed very significantly to the development of RSAs coming forward into this parliament. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Mr Martin Ferguson-In moving the adjournment, I would merely point out to the House that this bill represents the payback to the banks for the huge donations they made to the Liberal Party's election campaign in the lead-up to the recent election.",116

318,Mr MILES,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.40 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Retirement Savings Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996, together with the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1996 and the Retirement Savings Accounts Supervisory Levy Bill 1996, gives effect to the government's 1996 budget initiative to allow banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies to provide superannuation without a trust structure in the form of retirement savings accounts, RSAs. This bill makes consequential amendments to a number of acts to ensure that the retirement savings accounts are subject to the same rules which currently apply to other superannuation products, such as those offered by superannuation funds and approved deposit funds. These include: putting in place a concessional taxation regime for RSAs that is broadly equivalent to the current taxation treatment of other superannuation entities; allowing employers to make superannuation guarantee contributions to RSAs; enabling the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to deal with complaints concerning RSAs; enabling RSAs to be used as a rollover vehicle for preserved superannuation benefits; ensuring that a bankrupt person's RSA account balance is given the same protection from creditors as other superannuation assets; and providing a mechanism for the calculation and collection of the RSA supervisory levy. These amendments are to commence at the same time as the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1996, which is intended to be 1 July 1997.

319,Mr MILES,RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.43 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Retirement Savings Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996, together with the Retirement Savings Accounts Bill 1996 and the Retirement Savings Accounts (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996, gives effect to the government's 1996 budget decision to allow banks, building societies, credit unions and life insurance companies to provide superannuation without a trust structure in the form of retirement savings accounts, RSAs. This bill provides for an annual retirement - savings accounts supervisory levy to be paid by entities providing RSAs. The levy will recover the costs of supervision by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in monitoring the compliance of RSA providers and RSAs with retirement income and other superannuation standards. The bill also provides a statutory upper limit, which is the maximum level at which the supervisory levy can be set, and which will be indexed in line with the consumer price index. The upper limit is distinct from the actual levy, which is set by regulation and can therefore be disallowed by parliament. The actual levy will take into account the actual costs incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in functionally supervising RSAs and their providers. Costs to be recovered include costs related to the initial application and approval process and ongoing supervisory costs. The date of effect of the bill will be the same day that the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1996 takes effect, which is intended to be 1 July 1997. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned.

320,Mr MILES,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.45 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill establishes a new body, the Productivity Commission, by merging the functions of the Industry Commission, IC; the Economic Planning Advisory Commission, EPAC; and the Bureau of Industry Economics, BIE. The bill sets out the functions, powers and policy guidelines of the Productivity Commission and its composition and procedures. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his headland speech 'A Competitive Australia', on 18 July 1995, foreshadowed the establishment of the Productivity Commission as an election commitment. The Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996, shortly to be introduced, provides for the repeal of the Industry Commission Act 1989 and the Economic Planning Advisory Council Act 1983 and for transitional matters and consequential amendments to other legislation. The government wants greater public scrutiny and understanding of the factors driving Australia's productivity performance. Improving productivity means obtaining a better return from our resources, our people and our capital. We must find ways of using them all in a more creative, efficient and wealth producing fashion. We must also find ways of using our capital in a smarter, more intelligent, more modem fashion. Unless we boost productivity as a nation, our incomes and living standards will fall further, relative to our major competitors. The Productivity Commission will be the government's principal advisory body on all aspects of micro-economic reform. It will continue to pursue the current functions of the IC, EPAC and BIE, but it will also have a broader charter. It will continue to have open and transparent consultative processes which engage industry and community groups in informed debate on important public policy making. Sound policy development must be based on a full appreciation of the facts. A primary role of the Productivity Commission will be to identify impediments to improve productivity in particular sectors. It will also have due regard to the important relationships between improved use of resources in one sector and the rest of the economy. It is only with this sort of information and economywide focus that governments can make sensible and considered choices as to future policy--choices that will ensure better and more sustained growth prospects for all Australians. The Productivity Commission will have a particular focus on areas which impact on Australia's international competitiveness. Its research will include identifying best international practice in major industries and disseminating the results. The Productivity Commission will also have the authority to examine labour market practices retarding productivity. Labour is a key input in the economy and its productivity growth is vital to sustaining increases in living standards. Liberating our labour market remains the greatest single economic and attitudinal change to be achieved if the important goals of a more productive and competitive Australia are to be realised. If it is good enough to expose to public scrutiny arrangements working to the benefit of corporations and to the potential detriment of consumers, it is good enough to expose restrictive labour market practices-also potentially working to the detriment of consumers-to the same scrutiny. Hence the Productivity Commission will be given a work program to identify restrictive work practices and significant labour market arrangements which add to the cost of doing business. The Productivity Commission will not just focus on areas of Commonwealth responsibility. The states and territories have an important role in the consideration of industry and productivity matters. The states have responsibilities in many sectors of the economy-for example, intrastate transport, port authorities, and electricity generation-which can impact significantly upon the efficiency and competitiveness of industry. The Productivity Commission will review areas of state and territory responsibilities. In recent years there has been increased cooperation between the Industry Commission and the states and territories, and the government wishes to see this continue with the new Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission will focus its attention on all sectors of the economy, including the service sector. Moreover, it will have capacity to examine the efficiency of resource use within government through conducting program evaluations. The establishment of the Productivity Commission will allow for efficiencies in the economic inquiry work of the government. Budgetary cost savings of $5 million are expected in 199798, $6.15 million in 1998-99, $6.15 million in 1999-2000, and $5 million in 2000-01. I now turn to the main features of the bill. The bill proposes that the commencement date of the act be from the royal assent to the Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Act 1996. The bill establishes the functions of the Productivity Commission. The principal functions are to: hold inquiries and report about matters relating to industry and productivity that referred to it by the minister; provide secretariat services and research services to government bodies, as directed by the minister; from 1 July 1997, receive and investigate complaints about the implementation of competitive neutrality arrangements in relation to Commonwealth government businesses and business activities and report to the minister on its investigations; provide advice to the minister about matters relating to industry and productivity as requested by the minister; undertake on its own initiative research about matters relating to industry and productivity; and promote public understanding on matters relating to industry and productivity. The bill sets out the general policy guidelines for carrying out the Productivity Commission functions, which require it to have regard to the desire of the Commonwealth government to: improve the overall economic performance of the economy through higher productivity in the public and private sectors in order to achieve higher living standards for all members of the Australian community; facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes; reduce the regulation of industry (including _ regulation by the states, territories and local government) where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of the Commonwealth government; recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community that are likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Productivity Commission; and recognise the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the Productivity Commission. The bill provides for flexibility and a range of working methods in the performance of the are commission's functions. This will enable the Productivity Commission to mix and match its resources to its wide range of tasks consistent with enhancing its own productivity. In particular, the bill provides that the Productivity Commission is not required to act in a formal manner and may hold public seminars, conduct workshops and establish working groups and task forces. There are no standing provisions requiring public hearings for the purposes of an inquiry, specifying the duration of inquiries or requiring the preparation of draft reports. These procedures are best determined in light of each reference to the Productivity Commission. In referring a matter to the Productivity Commission, the minister will be able to require it to hold public hearings, publish a draft report or develop options. However, in the case of public inquiries it is expected that the Productivity Commission will usually produce a draft report, therefore facilitating community debate, and will usually present a range of options in its recommendations to the government. As indicated before, the Productivity Commission will do much more than conduct inquiries. The bill permits the minister to direct the Productivity Commission to provide secretariat services and research services to government bodies. For example, the Industry Commission currently provides secretariat services and research services to the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, to undertake performance monitoring of government trading enterprises and government service provision. The bill will allow this type of arrangement to be formalised. The minister can request advice from the Productivity Commission about matters relating to industry and productivity. Unlike inquiries, when the minister requests advice from the Productivity Commission, there is no facility for the commission to conduct public hearings or publish its advice to the minister. However, the minister may publish the advice provided in any way he or she thinks fit. The commission will be empowered to conduct research projects, which will be more narrowly focused compared with inquiries and be of shorter duration. While internally initiated research projects would be determined by the Productivity Commission, in setting topics it would be expected to be mindful of the views of the Commonwealth and state governments, business, and welfare groups. A common theme would be the factors underlying productivity growth. A particular aspect of the Productivity Commission's research will be assessing the performance, including thorough benchmarking, of economic infrastructure such as ports and rail and of government services to business such as business licensing. Other ministers will be able to seek the minister's approval for the Productivity Commission to conduct inquiries or research into topics which fall within their portfolios. The bill provides that the Productivity Commission may, with the minister's written agreement, and subject to any specific conditions set by the minister, provide research services to a person or body other than a government body. The Office of Regulation Review will be maintained as a separate unit within the Productivity Commission. The Office of Regulation Review will provide advice to the government and to COAG, undertake research on regulatory standard setting, and contribute to the legislation review program. The Office of Regulation Review is an important complement to the other activities of the Productivity Commission. The bill also details the competitive neutrality complaints mechanism to be operated by the Productivity Commission. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced on 27 June 1996, when releasing the Commonwealth's statement on competitive neutrality policy, competitive neutrality requires that significant public sector businesses and business activities not have any advantages over their private sector rivals simply by virtue of their being government owned. The complaints mechanism provides for the Productivity Commission to investigate situations where Commonwealth government business activities may not have had their advantages removed in accordance with the requirements of the policy statement or where other Commonwealth government businesses should have their advantages resulting from government ownership removed. The complaints mechanism arrangements will commence from 1 July 1997. The Productivity Commission will consist of a chairman and between four and 11 commissioners. The positions of chairman and commissioners are statutory appointments by the Governor General, for terms no longer than five years, though appointees are eligible for reappointment. While the position of the chairman is a full-time appointment, other commissioners may be appointed on either a full-time or a part-time basis. The commission will also have flexibility to hire specialist personnel to support particualso lar tasks. The Productivity Commission is given wide discretion into how inquiries are to be conducted. The Productivity Commission is to provide written reports on all inquiries to the minister, with the bill requiring that he or she table each report within 25 sitting days of receipt, unless the Productivity Commission recommends a delay in tabling the report for a specific period. In that case, the report is to be tabled within 25 sitting days after the end of that period. The Productivity Commission is also required to prepare an annual report as soon as practicable after the end of the financial year and to table it within 15 sitting days of its receipt by the minister. The government sees the annual report as an important component of the Productivity Commission's role in increasing community understanding of issues concerning productivity and structural change. With the broader charter of the Productivity Commission, its annual report will continue and expand the benefits that have flowed from the Industry Commission's and EPAC's annual reports. To conclude, the Productivity Commission's economy-wide perspective, its broad charter, public inquiry process and research functions will play a key role in promoting policies at both the government and business levels to improve the competitiveness and dynamism of Australian industry. The bill provides for an effective and broad-ranging institution to serve the needs of parliament, the people and government.

322,Mr WILLIAMS,FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL,"in reply-I rise to sum up on the debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996 that took place this morning. It generated significant interest among members on both sides of the House, but I observed that most of the comments that were made in the debate on the second reading tackled broader issues than the bill itself deals with. Most members looked at Family Court issues in general or Child Support Agency issues, and in some cases reference was made to legal aid. Most of the comments made, while significant, were not pertinent to the proposal in the bill. There were some other comments made not directly relevant to the bill which I think should be referred to. On 15 October, I made a speech at the National Press Club entitled 'Future directions in family law'. In the course of that speech, I addressed the subject of possible changes to the primary dispute resolution infrastructure in the family services area. I made the point on that occasion that there had been a good deal of rather misinformed speculation and comment in the media in the weeks prior to that speech on the government's intentions. Unfortunately, that misinformation and speculation have been continued in the speeches delivered this morning. I think I should very briefly indicate the background to the government's proposals, which I outlined in some detail in that speech. For primary dispute resolution services in the family area, people going through family breakdown currently have access to the Family Court counselling service and the Family Court mediation service in some registries. They have access to private counsellors or mediators and they have access to a wide range of community agencies, many of which are funded by the government. The court offers a range of services to assist couples to resolve their separation disputes without having to go to litigation, and also to assist those who are actually engaged in Family Court litigation. Nearly all of these non-judicial services are provided in-house by employed counsellors, mediators or by registrars. The approved community based services are provided by community organisations under contract to the government through the family services program in my department. Among other services, these organisations provide marriage and relationship education, marriage and child counselling, and family and child mediation. The organisations which provide those services include Relationships Australia, Centacare and the various organisations which come under the umbrella of Family Services Australia. Looking at the three sources-the Family Court, the private arena and the community organisations-it is relevant to ask whether the services are provided in the most efficient and effective way, particularly given that the Commonwealth is, in one way or another, involved in the financing of some part of all of them. In relation to private mediators or counsellors, this may be through the legal aid programs or even community legal centre programs. The current principal sources of the services are the Family Court and the community organisations, however. This dual stream seems to have a number of potential defects. First, there is no sary connection or coordination between the two streams, although some liaison does occur from time to time. Secondly, given that it is government policy to encourage people to resolve their domestic disputes without resort to litigation and without resort to the Family Court, there is something of a contradiction between encouraging people to resolve their family law problems outside the courts on the one hand, while at the same time keeping a major source of counselling, including voluntary counselling, within the Family Court. Most people, I think, would prefer to deal with the whole process of separation and associated agreements over children, property and maintenance outside the court environment. There is an increasing interest in the community in alternative dispute resolution methods such as counselling and mediation. The difficulties, from a policy point of view, of having these two streams, uncoordinated as they are, are compounded by a further factor which is that the Family Court services are provided, in all cases, free, whereas the community organisations, in order to survive, are obliged to invite participants to pay a fee. This immediately directs people away from community organisations towards the litigious environment where an adversarial or confrontational attitude may quickly develop. The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, in its report on the funding and administration of the Family Court delivered at the end of 1995, noted that the court's counselling service has played a significant role in the achievements of the Family Court to date. The low rate of cases that proceed to a defended hearing, quoted by a number of speakers this morning, is often quoted in this context. The joint select committee, however, did recommend that there should be an encouragement to parties to pursue resolution of their disputes outside the court and in the community. The resolution of those disputes, naturally, puts a focus on the community organisations. The JSC's recommendations have been under consideration by the government and three major objectives have been identified. Firstly, as a matter of policy, parties should neces- be encouraged to resolve their problems themselves. Secondly, the method of resolution should be kept simple and made easy to find and, from a taxpayers' point of view, there should be value for money. The system should be efficient and effective. On that basis, the government is currently giving consideration to what reforms might be effected in the direction of encouraging people to use community organisations rather than court located mediation and counselling services. We have in mind that there will be a lengthy consultation process involving all stakeholders, that nothing will happen quickly, but that the policy of encouraging people to deal with their problems in the community is one that should be pursued as the ultimate goal. It is against that background that some of the criticisms of the bill can be answered. The speakers on the opposition side made a number of points which, I think, misunderstand the nature of what is sought to be achieved. First of all, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) all made a point which was, in substance, to the effect that the imposition within the Family Court for voluntary mediation counselling services blocks access to justice and especially access to counselling which could save marriages and preserve families and keep them intact. These claims ignore the broad community usage of community sector counselling where fees are already paid. People who cannot afford to pay in the community organisations are not required to pay, or are invited to pay at a much lower rate than people who can afford to pay. In the Family Court there is a waiver of fees and charges for a range of people including those on legal aid, those who are recipients of income support of some kind such as social security recipients with a health benefits card, or those who can otherwise demonstrate hardship. The Family Court reports that between 30 and 40 per cent of litigants in that court have fees waived. It would be expected that the same number would have their fees waived in respect of voluntary mediation or counselling. People now using the Family Court service include many people who, in fact, could afford to payor make some contribution. They would still be able to use counselling with the fees that are proposed, given that the fees proposed are modest. My department has made an assessment of the fees paid by community organisations. They have a variety gf forms in different community organisations, but in all cases there is a waiver for those who are unable to pay, with, in effect, a sliding scale up to those who can afford to pay a top fee. The top fee, on average, is about $40 an hour, which is what is proposed to be effected under this bill. The government is committed to improving and extending access to counselling and mediation, including by looking at the best balance between court annexed and community based mediation, as I have attempted to explain. By introducing fees in the Family Court, the government is removing the present inequity whereby court services are provided free. Community organisation services are not provided freely and, instead of having their disputes resolved in the community, people of fees are encouraged to go to court. A second criticism offered by the member for Prospect is to the effect that the court provides an excellent service which people will be discouraged from using, going into litigation instead. That is completely wrong. Litigation also involves charges and people are not likely to be encouraged to pay litigation charges which would exceed those for mediation or counselling because of the difference. Those who will not be paying fees because they are on legal aid, or otherwise can demonstrate hardship or impecuniosity, will not be affected either way. The fees likely to be charged, as I have already indicated, will be comparable to those charged in the community sector and they are modest. They will still be vastly less expensive than litigation, except for the indigent litigant who is on legal aid or otherwise has all fees paid and does not have to pay court fees. People should be encouraged to prefer to use the less traumatic and less destructive methods of dispute resolution. Another point made by the member for Banks and the member for Prospect is that the government is breaking an election promise to increase options for counselling and mediation. I completely reject that attempted criticism. The government is committed to the promotion and encouragement of counselling and mediation in family law matters. That is why we are looking to achieve the right services with the broadest possible access in the fairest and most efficient way, encouraging people to use the community services instead of the current distortion es people to use the court because it is freeor to keep people out of the court system and the litigation process. The member for Banks attempted another criticism. In substance, he alleged that the imposition of fees is anti-family and contrary to the family values policies of the government. The government is committed to the health and well-being of Australian families and to giving families the best possible chance of stable and satisfying relationships. That is why we have doubled the resources we put into marriage education to give people the skills to deal with charges and conflicts in their relationships. That is also why we want to ensure that we are not encouraging people to go into the legal system when they have relationship problems. The inequity between the free court service as against the community service could be contributing to that. In addition, the government is taking other steps to give people better access across Australia to the whole range of family services such as counselling and mediation. The member for Jagajaga asserted that the bill does not provide for waiver or exemption of fees. The fees for counselling and mediation will be subject to the same waiver and exemption provisions as other court fees. As I have indicated, people on legal aid, people on income support from government and people who can otherwise demonstrate hardship will not pay fees. As I have said, the Family Court, applying its existing waiver and exemption provisions, currently waives or exempts 40 per cent of users from other fees. The waiver and exemption provisions will be . provided for in the regulations that set the fees. On another point, relevant to the distinction between the community and the court system, I mention that a number of speakers referred to the fact that the Family Court statistics indicate that 95 per cent of cases are resolved without a final hearing before a judge. That is not to say that there has not been a hearing or even quite a number of hearings, but the final resolution of the dispute does not have to go before a judge but is dealt with in some that encourag- other way. It is interesting that, although the mediation and counselling services in the community organisations have not been subjected to the same analysis as the Family Court statistics, an evaluation of mediation in a particular area was undertaken and demonstrated that in excess of 70 per cent of mediations were successful. In other words, people within the community were in 70 per cent of cases able to resolve their problems themselves without having to contemplate going to the Family Court either for alternative dispute resolutions such as mediation or counselling or for litigation. That 95 per cent figure is pretty good. If you can achieve a 75 per cent success rate before you even get to the court, it is much better. The member for Bowman (Mrs West) raised another question. The suggestion is that, instead of having voluntary counselling before filing for divorce, family court litigants may elect to postpone counselling until after filing and then rely on a judge or registrar to make the necessary order or directive. The fees that we seek to impose will relate only to voluntary counselling. They will not relate to counselling that is ordered by the court. Clearly, if people wish to avoid paying fees, they could choose not to go to counselling prior to filing and then wait for the court to order counselling under the power in the act. The government does not see this as a loophole. If parties see counselling as a valuable process, they will continue to choose to use it prior to filing any applicati.on. After all, people presently choose to go to community based counselling services and they pay for those services. If there are unresolved issues between the parties about children, counselling would seem appropriate. Litigation is very expensive, and there is a paucity of money for legal aid to support Family Court litigation. Relationships Australia has, at least in one of its outlets, found that people who go to the community organisations seeking counselling when their relationship becomes rocky can usually be assisted. As I said, for mediation, there was a 70 per cent success rate. For counselling, I am not sure of the figures, but I suspect that it would be reasonably high as well. The counselling, it found, could be effectively completed in six sessions of one hour. That would cost the community, if it were not paid for, in broad terms roughly $240 on the scheme proposed; $240 to prevent a divorce may be saving thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to the community. I do not think that the criticisms offered by the opposition to this bill have any weight at all. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Williams) read a third time. NA NA (REGISTRATION CHARGES) BILL Cognate bill: NA NA (REGISTRA TION OF PROVIDERS AND FINANCIAL REGULATION) AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 October, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the bill be now read a second time.  p.m.)-These two complementary pieces of legislation, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Bill and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill (No.2), seek to levy a charge to partially recover the costs associated with maintaining a register of providers of education services to overseas students. One of the bills actually levies the charge; the other bill puts in place relevant administrative arrangements to administer the charge. As far as the opposition is concerned, these bills are completely uncontroversial. We have no objection at all to introducing an element of cost recovery here. In fact, when we discussed these bills in the Labor Party caucus, the only concern anybody had was why the government is not going for full cost recovery. The financial impact is fairly slight. In a full year, I think it recovers about $1 million, which, as I said, is about half of the cost of operating a register. The establishment of this register, for which this legislation seeks to recover part of the costs, obviously was part of an overall package of measures that was introduced several years ago in response to some fairly significant problems that emerged in regard to the education services industry . We did have, as honourable members will recall, a situation where quite a large number of these providers of courses collapsed and the Commonwealth ended up haying to bear the burden of reimbursing the students who had paid fees upfront. The consequential financial impact 1996 flowing from that, I think, was very considerable. It was something in the order of $50 million, I seem to recall, and the whole industry got rather a bad name as a result of that. There were some disreputable providers. This whole growth industry of provision of education services to overseas students, which is now economically very significant, generates about $1.9 billion worth of export revenue a year. The basis of that is the reputation and standing of Australian education providers. It is not a problem with those providers that are part of the formal education and training sectors, that is, the schools, the universities and the technical colleges. The problem arose in regard to those that were not part of that framework, particularly the providers of English language courses. So, in order to address the damage that was done as a result of the events of a few years ago, legislation was passed by the parliament to institute a regulatory regime which was designed to provide some element of quality control in regard to these providers. That led to the introduction of the so-called ESOS Act, the Education Services for Overseas Students Act, which has operated for a number of years and has been amended a couple of times, I think. There has just been a major review done of the operation of the ESOS Act. That review found virtual unanimity from the Commonwealth government, the state governments, the various industry providers and the other stakeholders in the whole area. The current approach was essentially the right to say, a cooperative regulatory scheme involving Commonwealth, states and industry. There was really no significant opposition to that from any quarter. That original piece of legislation has had its sunset date extended for a further period as a result of legislation forthwith. that was considered by the parliament a couple of months ago. What we are seeing here is of course an element of cost recovery in regard to the costs associated with operating that regulatory scheme. There is no problem with any of that. The opposition will be supporting these two pieces of legislation.",122
323,Mr ZAMMIT,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"The bills before the House are the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Bill 1996 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Registration) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996. I am very conscious of the fact that we are only three minutes away from adjournment, so I will keep my comments limited to the next three minutes. It is good to see that the opposition is not opposing, and in fact supporting, the passage of these bills. I am surprised that it was not dealt with in the Main Committee but",127
324,Mr ZAMMIT,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"Well, it's your choice. The bills will impose a very small charge on the providers of courses to overseas students for their registration on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, otherwise known as CRICOS. The register of course is a very important part of the framework for maintaining the quality and integrity of the education exports currently worth approximately $2 billion-$1.9 billion-in export income to Australia. That is a very important part of our export industry. Whilst no industry welcomes increased government charges, earlier this year the education exports industry unanimously endorsed this registration in the course of an independent review of the principal act. So it is a very non-controversial bill. The amendment is non-controversial. Of course, we comone, that is mend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

326,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"The Western Suburbs Community Youth Support Scheme is a community based labour market provider like many others that all members would be familiar with. It runs a skillshare program for the unemployed, together with training programs for particular industries. enjoys tax exemption. It receives about $1.3 million of its $1.5 million income from various government payments. It helps unemployed people gain necessary skills for future employment. However, there are some startling features about the way it has operated this year. Western Suburbs CYSS has a grand total of just six members-the president, the vicepresident, the treasurer, the secretary and only two other members. By itself that is a matter of concern, albeit technical. What is of greater concern is the fact that earlier this year those six people decided to change the organisation's constitution to permit the payment of honoraria to office holders and members as determined by the members. That is, the six people decided to pay four of their number money from the organisation's income. Unlike any other community labour market operator that I know or, for that matter, any other community based tax-exempt service group, it decided that the vice-president, the secretary and the treasurer would be paid an annual fee of $4,800 paid quarterly and that the chairperson would be paid an annual fee of $12,000 paid quarterly. This is public money. It has gone to a community based, tax-exempt organisation that seeks donations from the community. It has not been paid to Western Suburbs CYSS for them to take up to $30,000 off the top for themselves. The even more amazing thing about this questionable behaviour is that one of the six members is the local state member, Denver Beanland, who is also the Attorney-General of Queensland, the state's First Law Officer. Whilst he did not personally receive these payments, he supported the change to the constitution earlier this year that allowed these payments to occur. So, too, did local Brisbane City Councillor June O'Connell. We have the First Law Officer of Queensland and a Brisbane City Council councillor supporting the payment of thousands of dollars to people on what used to be a voluntary organisation. The skillshare sponsors handbook says, 'Board members cannot be It paid for being on the board.' How could the first law officer of Queensland allow-much less support-these payments being made? Payments to the office holders has been made as payment to their companies, not to them as individuals. The first payments were made in July for the quarter ending 30 June, but they do not appear in the annual accounts for the last year, although provision is there for a range of accruals. Why is it not disclosed in the annual accounts? If the organisation wants to operate like a private company, it should be registered as such. But those involved cannot have it both ways-enjoying the benefits of a voluntary tax-exempt community association when it suits and behaving like a private for profit company at other times. In the last week, Western Suburbs CYSS has taken steps to correct these matters. Three new members are in the process of joining. Importantly, the members who received the payments are currently considering refunding that money. I believe it will be refunded. All this raises important questions of accountability as the Howard government closes every CES office in Australia over the next eight months. It follows the revelation earlier this week that a CES area manager has expressed concern about staff attempting to establish private companies to tender for labour market funds as employment placement enterprises. He had to remind the staff that that was illegal. As more and more of these labour market dollars are distributed to companies and registered organisations and as more and more cuts are made to DEETYA staff, who will ensure the management information systems and accountability mechanisms are in place? If a local community, including the First Law Officer of Queensland, can make such an error of judgment, what will happen in other parts of Australia as local committees each deal with millions of dollars? It is not good enough that the money can be channelled through trading enterprises other than skillshare. Irrespective of which operating account the money comes from, the inescapable fact is that nearly all the money has come from the government. Minister Vanstone needs to assure the parliament and the people that, in its ideologically driven haste to cut the Public Service and close down the CES, it will not invite taxpayers' dollars to fill the pockets of committee members, private companies or those just looking for a quick dollar rather than helping the unemployed. Youth Education",128
327,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight it is my privilege to read speeches written by two young ladies from my electorate of Lilley in Brisbane. They are visiting Canberra and are in the gallery tonight. Kylie Pert is a student at the Banyo State High School and Helen Barry is a student at the Sandgate and Districts State High School. Kylie and Helen have both completed year 11 and were chosen to come with me to Canberra on their merits and interest in politics. I wish to express my thanks to Ansett Australia, which very generously provided the airfares for both the girls. Each student has written a short speech on their views of education for youth in Australia. I would like to read these. Kylie says: It is a major concern to me and to many students that the importance of youth and youth on occasions, misunderstood. I have been fortunate enough to come to Canberra this week and express these concerns on behalf of my peers. The most relevant is education, however, other issues discussed by students are: Unemployment; . Multiculturalism; and . Immigration as well as gaining an awareness and understanding of Australian politics. Students feel more teachers are needed or that the allocation of teachers needs reviewing. Even in Brisbanea cityas a result of the lack of teachers, it is necessary to be taught more subjects using the School of Distance Education. To give some examples I refer to Accounting, Economics, French and Modem History. This type of education is difficult and without the guidance of a teacher, the results are normally below the capability of the students and this in tum can consequently affect the future employment prospects. I believe that parliamentarians have a responsibility to take a stronger interest in youth. They should make students aware of the importance of education. They should talk to them so that they become aware of young people's problems and concerns. Parliamentarians should encourage students to set goals which will assist them when the time arrives to tackle the outside world. After all, the youth of today are the future and potential of the nation. We, the students have to come to terms with the complex issues of today to ensure we eventually make the right decisions for tomorrow. The current Parliament is making decisions today which will affect us tomorrow. Therefore we would like them to be fully aware of the youth of today, of our concerns and expectations. We the students feel it is important that we have an education which will allow us to make Australia a country of which we are all extremely proud. Helen says: Over the past few days, I have been able to witness first hand the inner workings of our government. Consequently, I have been exposed to a great deal of information of which previously my knowledge was limited, and feel very fortunate to have been provided with such a unique opportunity that too issues are, few Australians experience. An issue which is of particular concern, is that of the lack of knowledge Australian youth possesses regarding the structure and role of Australian government and foreign affairs. Although this does not require as urgent attention as many other issues in Australian society, I consider it necessary that Australian youth be better educated on our government system. Expanding the knowledge of government and foreign affairs is essential for a number of reasons. Eventually, Australian youth are going to be faced with the task of voting in elections and referendums, and in order to make an educated decision on the issues concerned, a basic knowledge of our political system is critical. One such issue which we will inevitably be asked to express our opinion on, is the republic issue. In my opinion, without an understanding of how the existing government system works, we cannot possibly be expected to make a worthwhile comparison among the two systems, and hence our responses will simply be misinformed opinions. In addition to this, an understanding of government and foreign affairs would be of immeasurable value for youth when deciding on employment opportunities. An increase in the knowledge of foreign trade policies, taxes and the role of government would undoubtedly lead to a greater success regarding small business initiative. As I reflect on the benefits to be gained from a knowledge of the Australian political system, it becomes evident that the government must ensure such education occurs. Throughout primary school, we are taught the fundamentals of our political system in social studies. However, when we enter high school very few courses are aimed at developing such a knowledge, and there is limited encouragement for further independent study of government. Therefore, it would give me great pleasure to see the government take affirmative action to introduce some form of compulsory political studies into the curriculum of high school students, ideally during years eight and nine. For example, as I have only one more year of high school to complete, I am personally keen to learn of the government's efforts to reduce unemployment, and their role in the recent increase in tertiary fees. Although as a student I am constantly bombarded with statements that ""my opinions must be heard, as I am the future of Australia"", I feel that efforts to prepare youth for this role are not always sufficient. Hence, in order to achieve this, I would like to see more parliamentarians offer students the same opportunity which I have been fortunate to experience. Notices of Motion  Speaker, I know I am speaking on the adjournment debate, so I apologise that this may very much sound like a grievance. I have probably had more notices of motion on the Notice Paper than any other member of the opposition, and I have to report that I have had zero luck, a duck, as far as the Selection Committee is concerned. It did not matter whether the issue was the Ombudsman, East Timor or Lebanon, not one notice of motion was picked up. It is a matter of disappointment for me. Even when I have seconded a motion from the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) or the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), I have still not been given a guernsey. I know that in this House people have talked about higher standards for the House. It is true that the Speaker is prisoner of the standing orders provided to him or her. I have not been remiss in proposing changes to the standing orders. I must say it is the condition of opposition that leads me to have such an interest. I have proposed-it is not an original proposition; in fact, it is former Senator Jessop's proposition-that the House should have a staffing and appropriations committee. I have not been permitted to debate that proposition. I have moved a notice of motion concerning a standing order for a better question time by limiting the time spent in asking and answering questions. When this was first tried in the Senate under the previous government, there was much resistance in the Senate by government ministers of the day. But most now conclude that it in fact assists question time. I have not been allowed to put that proposition to this House. My last notice of motion would allow a new form of private members statementindeed, 20 per side per week-called members electoral statements. I hope Mr Speaker will understand my frustration that we are in the penultimate week of the sittings, the penultimate week this year for me being in opposition, and not one of these issues have been selected by the Selection Committee as being worthy of discussion in this House. r still am an eternal optimist. I sincerely hope that the leader of government business, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith)-this really rests with him-might pick up at least some of the suggestions I have made. People talk about higher standards in this House. I must confess that I really love to describe myself as a parliamentarian who respects this House and the forms of the House, but it is up to the Leader of the House to determine whether or not anyone of these initiatives is taken up. I note the number of government members who are in the House tonight. Had the notice of motion for private members constituency statements been allowed, each and every one of you would have got up this week. You would have been in the Main Committee this week making not a five-minute contribution but a three-minute contribution. It is true that the opposition does not have the numbers. It does not have the numbers in the House; it does not have the numbers on the Selection Committee. But I say to government members opposite: you indeed do have the numbers, very magnificently. If we want to improve standards in the House, then the Speaker needs to be assisted. As far as oppositions are concerned, we need to make more than empty statements. We have to indicate what our intention ought to be should we be-and hopefully soon-returned to government. But, in the meantime, it is in your hands. You may think that a staffing and appropriations committee would do nothing. You may think question time is fine and there should be no changes. But you would have a lot to gain if the proposition about additional private members time in constituency statements were advanced. We have made no progress this year. I sincerely hope that we will make some progress next year. Again I say that the Speaker is a prisoner of the standing orders which this House provides him. (Time expired) Essay Competition Benson, Miss T.",129
328,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Recently I invited high school students in my electorate to submit essays for a competition. The essays had to encompass the writing of some words that involved an Australian flavour. The competition was won by Makayla Cameron of Ferny Hills. Makayla is a year 12 student at Ferny Grove High, a high school that has been the alma mater of such sporting icons as Tracey Wickham and a current Olympian, Sharon Cripps. Extracts from Makayla's essay, entitled 'Advance Australia Fair', display an insight beyond her years. Makayla rejects any suggestion that Waltzing Matilda should be the new national anthem. She said: How could a song about a thief (a swagman who stole a sheep) who commits suicide (by drowning himself instead of facing responsibility), truly represent the spirit of Australia? She in fact praises the Australian identity. She says: We don't need to find our identity, it's already in the hearts of every True Blue Aussie. It simply needs to be resurrected and practised. She offers a recipe for harmony and peaceful relations. She says: Australia needs to focus on the concept of creating a harmonious community, a nation which can live together in peace in a balance between freedom and responsibility, instead of being obsessed with the idea of individual rights and demands. She makes a number of other adroit and mature observations. She says: Children need to be taught discipline, respect, responsibility, pride, dignity and patriotism ... This must begin with wise, just, honest and accountable governments who legislate with care and fairness. She finally endorses the retention of Advance Australia Fair as our national anthem. She says: What other purpose should every Australian citizen have but to . Advance Australia Fair'? Makayla has now finished her secondary school and plans to embark on a computer and business career. She hopes to have a musical career and then, ultimately, a political career. What she has seen in Canberra on her short stay down here has not caused her to change her mind. I wonder at that at times; but overall she is very enthusiastic about that. Also in Canberra along with Makayla is Miss Tanya Benson. They are both sitting in the gallery. Tanya attends Pin- Rivers High School and has just completed year 11. She is down here for her outstanding community service. She won the 1996 Miss Pine Rivers title, which was assessed on the basis of her personality, charm, grace and intelligence. She represented the Pine Rivers Bears Junior Rugby League Club, which is a dynamic young club in the electorate, and she has attended numerous functions involving the Pine Rivers Bears. In fact she has helped to raise the profile of the Bears to such a degree that I hope very soon their clubhouse will be finished and functioning and serving as a great focal point for the development of young footballers in the area, as well as developing the sort of community spirit which, by her selfless endeavours, she is trying to foster. She also raised significant funds for community benefit along the way. She has occupied the position of Miss Pine Rivers for just over six months. She has enjoyed it immensely and I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that, from my observations of her and my trips around the electorate, she is a remarkable young woman whom I admire greatly. She is a woman of great poise, maturity and insight and she has done the area of Dickson credit. She will be finishing year 11 very shortly and will be finishing high school next year. She has also participated in musicals such as Annie, which was run by the school, and is tutoring year 9 in maths. She also has her drivers licence. She hopes to pursue a career in business and hospitality. It is a great ure to have these young women down here in Canberra to show them our system and parliament. They are a great credit both to themselves and to the community. Kangaroo Exports Illegal Fauna Exports",131
329,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"What I am raising tonight is a matter of grave concern to me. When I left high school I got a job catching animals for zoos. It was a very interesting occupation and I think it was very valuable to Australia. In 1958, the last year in which the company I worked for operated, the company exported something like 7,500 kangaroos, mainly to the United States, for the price of £125 each. In 1958 it was a lot of money and it was good money for Australia. Due to the insistence of the RSPCA in New South Wales and Victoria, the government took steps to ban that export, effective as from 1 January 1960. In the same year, the kangaroo meat export business boomed. Seven pence a pound was the going price for exports to Germany of kangaroo meat for human consumption. It was sold as Australian venison. Unfortunately, that industry was abused. When the maggots hatched out, the Germans stopped that import. I want to talk about the effect of that. The silly legislation banning that export led to enormous cruelty involving the export of animals. It did not stop the export of animals; it simply drove it underground. The company I worked for regularly had trappers out on the fields legally trapping certain birds. Rare species were clearly avoided. Those trappers in the field took great steps to make sure there was no illegal trapping. Of course, once the ban was imposed the field was left wide open to illegal trappers. There is some evidence of the enormous cruelty and loss of life involved in the export of fauna. There can be no doubt that it happened. I would like to give the House the benefit of some figures involving the United States. The red-bearded dragon-pogona vitticepswhich is local to the Eyre Peninsula area, was not known to the United States until 1992. It pleaswas then worth $10,000. The price today is down to $1-0, and they have learnt to bring in techniques that will undoubtedly make the price go lower. The knob-tailed geckonephrurus-is another one. It was not in the United States until 10 years ago. Now they have mutations there and are in fact exporting them. None of these was exported to America legally. The United States is now the biggest exporter of the python molarus, which is a Burmese python. So the CITIES legislation has really counted for nothing. Birds are no different, of course. The cacatua roseicapilla, better known here as the galah, is fetching substantial prices in the United States. Raymond Hoser wrote a book called Smuggled. He has just recently written the sequel, Smuggled 2, which contains a foreword from the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan). The book raises very great concerns about the obvious corruption involving the authorities in this business in Australia, principally the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. The allegations in this book are so serious that I believe they do need to be thoroughly investigated. Recently, the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service, and a couple of other people- Mr Victor Bates and Mr Vacik-tried in the Supreme Court of New South Wales to get an injunction to stop the distribution of the book. Judge Levine refused to do that. He said there was no inference at all that allegations were unsubstantiated, and in fact gave costs favouring Mr Hoser. The interesting thing is that, when I have spoken to journalists about Mr Hoser, many of them have said, 'Do not touch him, this man has got a criminal record.' It is not hard to get a criminal record when you are dealing with crooks, as exists in some of these ments. In most states of Australia, we have allowed these people entry to people's homes without warrants. Of course it is abused. Mr Hoser is now once more being subjected to another appeal as there is judge swapping. This is such a serious matter that it ought to be investigated. I have no faith whatsoever in royal commissions or the political system. I believe it should be thoroughly investigated by a parliamentary committee. This is the only body which I can see would actually get to the bottom of the allegations in the book. The book has substance. It is readable. It is very credible. After all, it has a foreword written by the minister. If we do not investigate the book, it would be an indictment of all of us. (Time expired) Paper Products",132
330,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to inform this House of the display of paper products that took place today, which was very important for everyone in this building. In speaking this evening, I am not out to advertise a particular product, but I do want to draw attention to a situation that many in the House would not be aware of. In fact, they may have been unwittingly using imported paper and therefore contributing to our foreign debt. I am an environmentally conscious person and fully aware that the use of paper is essential and, moreover, that the members and senators of this parliament use vast quantities of it-dare I say it, perhaps far too much. However, it is with pleasure that, along with the member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent), I was involved in organising the display of stationery manufactured by Australian Paper. This display was held to draw the attention of members and senators to the quality products available in this country. I must confess to a little self-interest here. As the member for Gilmore, I was proud that those involved in the display were workers from my own electorate, specifically from Nowra. Not only are they workers from the mill but they also playa role in its marketing and have an excellent rapport with the management. Much of the stationery which was departon display is manufactured from recycled fibre. I was very proud indeed to have promoted a range of quality products that would allow us as members, and those in Senate, to purchase Australian made paper that will generate economic growth with due regard for the environment. I would like to outline a little about the display and the environmental advantages of the products that were on display. The display of Australian made paper took place today in a Senate committee room, and it provided a comprehensive range of office paper, including copy paper with 80 per cent and 100 per cent recycled content. Indeed, I would like to outline more fully the environmental significance of the paper available. There has been some debate about pre-consumer waste paper and post-consumer waste paper. An important fact to remember is that waste paper is paper that has been removed from its point of production for a subsequent use. It has either been used or been the residual of a further process, like cut-offs from printing, or rejected as unsatisfactory for quality deficiencies. If such paper is not returned to a paper making plant for recycling, it must be disposed of as garbage, such as burning or putting it into landfill. As a result, recycled paper is paper made from waste paper that would otherwise have been rubbish. It is therefore truly recycled waste. I would like to draw the attention of members of the House and the Senate to the possibility that they, like me, were unknowingly using imported paper when they would have preferred to use a quality Australian product. Naturally, I am not about to advocate the use of inferior product simply because it is Australian, but in the case of the display I urged politicians from all persuasions to look at the Australian product and to make their own judgment. To use a hackneyed cliche, we need to put our money where our mouth is when buying our own products when and where they are available. I know politicians from all sides have serious concerns about regional unemployment and depressed economies in these areas. If we can make even the slightest contribution to our local economies, then as politicians we must endeavour to do so. I have therefore decided to use Australian paper because of its quality, environmental sensitivity and general competitiveness. I would hazard a guess that the majority of parliamentarians who attended the display today will choose to do so as well, particularly after speaking with the actual workers who made the paper.",133

But as this, a matter where the decision is an individual appropriate that I wrote back to my constituents, also briefly saying why.

Always, when we address issues to do with framework for controversial matters which about which many people have concerns, one is that it is better to have legislative safeguards exercised at the discretion, in this instance, indicate how prevalent the practice I have to say that, if your view is that euthanasia it happens is not a satisfactory argument for you recognise-and some people do so more unequivocally the legitimacy of the argument for active voluntary transparent scheme with strong safeguards arrangements to continue.

The second point is the issue of equity allowed me, to deal with this issue in the as in other debates-that, where we maintain our society, the wealthy and the powerful get who do not have the influence or the financial exercise are disadvantaged. The argument has my concern because I do not have The third point goes to the question of certainty, not simply gain access to active voluntary views of the doctor by whom they are being and the transfer from doctors to patients of matter. I want to take some time to speak briefly about briefly initially. As I said at that time, paramount, but it is a significant subsidiary right of the Commonwealth to determine the form that, and to set the parameters within which the the right of the Commonwealth to legislate in constitution. But I think that it is not appropriate having given legislative authority to a territorial has been transferred and to say, 'We gave you you have done it.' I have never been a great advocate of states of territory rights. I have always been one with stick in one's throat, however, to find many enthusiastically supporting this piece of legislation could not act in that way with regard to their support the Commonwealth doing so if it could. I do not intend to take the opposite tack Commonwealth to override states where it has to do so with regard to the territory. But the legislation does have implications I am concerned about the uncertainty created such as the Medical Treatment Act 1994 of the bill are wrong and that it is being poorly pursued. To sum up, I would like to refer to some then Senator Peter Baume, now Professor Memorial Lecture, referred to the need for good who require it, and acknowledged that it is say: MAIN COMMITTEE 7751 points that have particularly convinced me that therefore oppose this bill. The first point goes principle of liberal democracy that, as far to the individual to determine his or her of access. I do not have time, in the 10 minutes way I would like to, but I am concerned-in this, the facade that something does not happen in access to proper medical assistance, whilst those capacity to get access to this properly illegal been put eloquently by others; I simply reiterate time to go into it in detail. so that people can know their rights and euthanasia through good fortune because of the treated. The fourth point concerns empowerment the power to make decisions with regard to this the territory rights issue to which I referred I do not regard the territory rights question as matter in dealing with this bill. I recognise the of self-government, to legislate directly for territories govern themselves. I also recognise any matter in the territory as specified in the and not good practice for the Commonwealth, parliament, to seek to micro-manage what the power to do this, but we don't like the way rights, any more than I am now an advocate a greater concern about people's rights. It does of the greatest advocates of states rights so when they know that the Commonwealth states and almost certainly they would not I find that hypocritical in the extreme, but myself and, having recognised the right of the the constitutional right to do so, deny its right in the territories beyond its immediate intention. and the implications for other areas of policy, ACT. My concern is that the objectives of the comments made by a former Liberal senator, the Peter Baume, who, in a recent Lionel Murphy quality palliative care to be available to all not available at the present time. He went on to NA 7752 The capacity to control symptoms, called palliative palliative care will not help everyone.

I certainly would never have wanted, nor poured out their heart and their love and their where they feel that they are a burden and better off. They may be able to hand on assets they may have. They might feel that because family around them, the best thing for them therefore pass on. I think that that is a pressure as they come to that phase of life should thinking. That is one of the reasons for which Andrews. The second point is that the legalisation of clear prohibition of intentional killing, which talk about civil rights in our western traditions fundamental to that is that there should be no the question as to whether by having the right as a concept. I have not explored that philosophically working through that issue, that if you do bring to die, you are also taking away from it the concept which we need to explore a little more.

However, as dying, it is impossible for anyone, including determine artificially the balance of factors Once you try to legalise these things, you would you weigh up and what should be done and how diversity of emotions, of love and compassion, people.

I do not agree some of the views expressed by the honourable that we can say-because we produce a piece of we are talking about the question chosen to wheel around a very significant issue. this parliament and, if opposed to euthanasia, which says that we are going to ensure that no in Australia.' That is what this bill should be achieve what those who are advocates against those who might be pro-euthanasia believe it is those territories that have been identified under to anybody else. I think that if we are going discriminatory law against Australians. the detail that worry me, but in the time you have the great detail. If you are going to look at the about some of the exemptions. If you are looking at the extent to which a person, for example, is Because of the difficulties we have with AIDS understand people saying, 'I won't have a blood a person can be required to have certain types as far as I am concerned, in all children not being immunisation of children. I think that is a very at the extent to which, in public health, of those ambivalent issues. We all know that, surgery we have an obligation-providing we are ourselves-to sign a form which says that so on, can be provided to us. The same applies who is unable to give that authorisation. accident they have to be treated under the patient. As faras I am concerned, that has passed, I do not want it in any way to prejudice as one who has been associated in a number have been withdrawn, and where they have when you lay down the sorts of laws that apply I certainly do not want any individual to be NA Wednesday, 4 December 1996 denied the right to say, at a time when a support, that that life support should be withdrawn. I have read clause 2 as it appears in each problem at all. All it says is that the Legislative not exercise that power, does that mean that power? In other words, clause 1 is saying euthanasia, as it is defined, but clause 2 provides if the territories have not, in fact, applied or provide medical or surgical measures, et cetera, way going to be impeded? I am equally quite concerned that in the application section, we are doing something been, to my legal mind, bad law. That is, you doing it as far as the law itself is concerned; of the Terminally III Act 1993. So you are applying law. My worry, being absolutely opposed to euthanasia, It is applied in the wrong way. We should discussing it. I am genuinely very concerned they think they are. I think voting for it, as against euthanasia. Rather, you are voting on confess that, having looked at it, I am still give my support to it, even though I am totally I would like it withdrawn and redrafted-and that effect. Debate (on motion by Mr MCArthur) adjourned. MAIN COMMITTEE 7789 person is brain dead and is on some form of life of the schedules. It does not really address the Assembly shall have 'power to'. If they do clause 1 is going to in any way inhibit that that there is to be no power with respect to the power. But if you do not exercise it and a broad ranging law which allows them to withhold does that mean that existing right is in any particular application, as it is defined in the that seems to me to be something that has always are providing it subjectively. You are not really you are treating it as a particular case-the Rights this law in a general sense to a particular is that this is a bad piece of legislation. not be discussing it in the manner we are now that, by voting for it, people are not doing as it stands now, is not doing as they think-voting an entirely different criteria. For that reason I in my own mind very doubtful about whether I will against euthanasia. The legislation is such that I have half a mind to move an amendment to Main Committee adjourned at 6.30 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Noise Monitoring Stations (Question No. 646) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: (1) What functions are performed by the six noise monitoring stations installed around Tullamarine and Essendon airports in 1993. (2) How many readings are the stations taking each month. (3) How many actions have been taken against airlines for exceeding noise or other restrictions, based on records from the six monitoring stations. (4) What is the cost of maintaining the six stations. (5) Are there any plans to upgrade or replace the stations. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Airservices Australia, which operates the Noise and Flight Path Monitoring System (NFPMS) installed at Australia's major airports, advises that: (1) The six noise monitoring terminals (NMTs) located around Tullamarine and Essendon Airports supply noise data to the NFPMS installed at Tullamarine Airport. The noise data includes aircraft noise from both Tullamarine and Essendon aircraft operations. The information collected by the system is used to: (i) determine the contribution of aircraft to overall noise exposure; (ii) detect occurrences of excessive noise levels from aircraft operations; (iii) assess the effects of operational and administrative procedures for noise control and compliance with these procedures; (iv) assist in planning of airspace usage; (v) validate noise forecasts and forecasting techniques; (vi) assist relevant authorities in land-use planning for developments on areas in the vicinity of an airport; . (vii) provide reports to, and responses to questIOns from, Government, Members of Parliament, NA industry organisations, Federal Airports Corporation, community groups and individuals; (viii) assist in answering noise complaints about aircraft operations from the general public. The system also has connections to the secondary surveillance radar at each airport to acquire flight track information on aircraft operating into and out of the airport. (2) The six NMTs around Tullamarine and Essendon Airports recorded 16,758 aircraft noise events in the quarter July to September 1996 (July: 5,235; August: 5,830; September: 5,693). A noise event occurs when the noise level exceeds a threshold level for a set time period. The threshold level is set to exceed the background noise level and the time period is usually set at 5 seconds. An aircraft noise event occurs when the recorded noise event is correlated with aircraft movement times and radar tracks of aircraft operating in the vicinity. (3) None. Noise emission from individual aircraft is controlled through aircraft type certification under the Air Navigation (Aircraft Noise) Regulations. (4) The approximate annual cost of maintenance of the six NMTs, including depreciation, is $110,000. The total cost of operating the NFPMS around Tullamarine and Essendon Airports, including maintenance and running costs, is approximately $250,000 per annum. (5) There are no plans to upgrade the NMTs in the near future. There are, however, plans to upgrade the software used by the computers which process the radar data and correlate noise events with aircraft movements. Ministerial Overseas Visits (Question No. 740) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 18 September 1996: Has the Minister undertaken any ministerial overseas visits; if so, (a) how many visits have been undertaken, (b) what was the duration of each visit and (c) which countries were' visited. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) I have undertaken two overseas visits. (b) five days and three days. (c) New Zealand and Indonesia. (Question No. 809) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 10 October 1996: (1) Is he able to provide details of air freight into and out of each airport in Australia including (a) tonnage, (b) type and value, (c) percentages, both tonnage and value and (d) the amount exported in the freight compartments of international passenger aircraft. (2) How many international passenger aircraft fly into and out of Australia each week and which airports are used. (3) What is the average amount of freight space (a) available and (b) used on these aircraft throughout each season. Airport Tonnes Adelaide Exports - perishables - non-perishables Imports - perishables - non-perishables Brisbane Exports - perishables 25,753 - non-perishables Imports - perishables - non-perishables 14,032 Cairns Exports - perishables - non-perishables Imports - perishables - non-perishables (4) Is he able to say what are the approximate freight rate charges per kilogram on passenger aircraft flying to the major destinations in Asia, North America and Europe. Air Freight (5) What is the average number of dedicated air freight planes that fly out of Australia each week through each season. (6) What is the freight capacity of these aircraft. (7) From which airports do they fly. (8) To which destinations do they fly and what are their average rates of charge per kilogram for each major destination. (9) Do these aircraft carry a different mix of goods to that carried on passenger aircraft. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On the basis of available data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, details of air freight into and out of the major air freight centres in Australia for the year ending 30 June 1996 are as follows: Tonnage Value % of total % of total Australian perish- Australian perishable & non-perish- able & non-perable ishable exports/imports $,000 exports/imports (tonnes) ($,000) 6,425 4.35 62,017 5.83 3,591 2.49 219,601 1.36 326 l.86 5,819 2.51 4,638 2.03 615,515 2.63 17.43 144,082 13.53 9,000 6.23 485,020 3.00 1,916 10.92 15,881 6.85 6.13 865,758 3.70 4,516 3.06 34,320 3.22 2,120 l.47 52,012 0.32 139 0.79 1,003 0.43 439 0.19 64,570 0.28 Airport Tonnes exportslimports Darwin Exports - perishables 1,386 - non-perishables 622 Imports - perishables 4 - non-perishables 500 Hobart Exports - perishables 0 - non-perishables 6 Imports - perishables 2 - non-perishables 113 Melbourne Exports - perishables 34,807 - non-perishables 47,549 Imports - perishables 4,986 - non-perishables 75,804 Perth Exports - perishables 21,640 - non-perishables 5,222 Imports - perishables 787 - non-perishables 9,048 Sydney Exports - perishables 53,247 - non-perishables 76,285 Imports - perishables 9,402 - non-perishables 124,455 NA Exports - perishables 147,774 - non-perishables 144,395 Imports - perishables 17,562 - non-perishables 229,029 Tonnage Value % of total % of total Australian perish- Australian perishable & non-perish- able & non-perable ishable $,000 exports/imports (tonnes) ($,000) 0.94 3,138 0.29 0.43 136,749 0.85 53 0.02 0.22 86,295 0.37 0 17 491 41 0.02 0.05 4,851 0.02 23.55 292,671 27.49 32.93 4,501,189 27.85 28.40 81,759 35.29 33.10 6,165,835 26.39 14.64 198,822 18.67 3.62 4,749,636 29.39 4.49 9,482 4.09 3.94 862,178 3.69 36.03 329,596 30.96 52.83 6,017,016 37.23 53.54 117,643 50.78 54.34 14,702,296 62.92 1,064,663 16,161,714 231,681 23,367,298 At present, around 90 per cent of air freight transported to and from Australia on scheduled services is carried in the freight compartments of international passenger aircraft. Airport Adelaide Brisbane Broome Cairns Christmas Island Darwin Hobart Melbourne Perth Port Hedland Sydney NA (3) It is not possible to give a definite figure the amount of freight capacity provided on passenger services from season to season as this will depend on the number of services and aircraft type used. The estimated freight capacity available on passenger services in October 1996 was 8100 tonnes per week. The estimated capacity available on passenger services in December 1995 was 7700 tonnes per week. The corresponding figure in December 1996 will be higher than this due to the increase in passenger services this year. This estimate of freight capacity available is an approximation only as the actual amount of freight capacity available will be affected by a number of factors such as the length of ger load and the prevailing weather conditions. In addition, the estimate is available capacity measured by weight. This takes no account of the volume that may be carried. If the goods transported are low weight per unit then an aircraft may reach its capacity in terms of volume before its weight limit is reached. The average amount of export freight carried in international passenger aircraft in December 1995 was approximately 6,500 tones per week. The average amount of export freight carried in international passenger aircraft in June 1996 was approximately 5,400 tones per week. These figures were derived by assuming that 90 per cent of air freight exports were transported on international passenger aircraft. (4) A sample of freight tariffs published in The Air Cargo Tariff for October 1996 (a publication of (2) The number of international passenger aircraft flying into and out of Australia each week varies in accordance with the airlines' planning and scheduling requirements. As a reliable estimate, the following details as at 30 June 1996 are provided: No. of international passenger aircraft landing/departing 14 157 2 81 2 21 1 132 77 1 383 871 on the International Air Transport Association which lists worldwide air cargo tariffs) for a number of destinations are reproduced below. However, generally market rates paid by exporters are actually lower to these destinations, depending on space availability. Sydney-Singapore: (minimum 1,000 kg) = $ 1.45 per kg Sydney-Hong Kong: (minimum 1,000 kg) = $1.85 per kg Sydney-Bangkok: (minimum 1,000 kg) = $1.75 per kg Sydney-Tokyo: (minimum 1,000 kg) = $3.70 the sector, the passen- per kg Sydney-Kuala Lumpur: (minimum 1,000 kg) = $1.60 per kg Sydney-Los Angeles: (minimum 500 kg) = $3.20 per kg Sydney-Amsterdam: (minimum 1,000 kg) = $3.40 per kg The Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) published a research report, International Performance Indicators: Aviation, in August 1994. The BIE found that Australia's outbound freight rates are among the lowest in the world, and are lower than on inbound rates. Freight rates ex-Australia on short haul routes to Asia are lower than intra Asia routes and rates from Asia to Australia. Ex-Australia freight rates are also lower than on long haul routes from Asia to Europe and North America and markedly lower than inbound rates to Australia from Europe and North America. The BIE analysis indicates that outbound freight rates are in fact a competitive advantage for Australian exporters. (5) International air carriers have two major scheduling periods, viz Northern Summer (last Sunday in March-last Saturday in October) and Northern Winter (last Sunday in October-last Saturday in March). In Northern Summer 1996, 15 scheduled dedicated freight aircraft and 2 regular dedicated charter freight aircraft operated out of Australia every week. In Northern Winter 1996/97 (the current scheduling period), 15 scheduled dedicated freight aircraft and 2 regular dedicated charter freight aircraft will operate out of Australia every week. In addition, there will be a weekly dedicated air freight service to Hong Kong till the end of the year and a weekly dedicated air freight service to Singapore from late November to end January. (6) The freight capacity of dedicated freight aircraft that operated out of Australia in Northern Summer 1996 was approximately 1500 tonnes per week. The freight capacity of dedicated air freight planes that will operate out of Australia in Northern Winter 1996 is approximately 1500 tonnes. In addition, Cathay Pacific will operate a weekly service till December this year with a capacity of approximately 120 tonnes and Singapore Airlines will operate a weekly service between December and February next year with a capacity of approximately 120 tonnes. (7) Dedicated international freight aircraft fly out of the following Australian airports: Sydney; Melbourne; Perth; Adelaide (8) Dedicated freight aircraft fly out of Australia to the following foreign airports: Abu Dhabi; Amsterdam; Anchorage; Auckland; Bangkok; Hong Kong; Honolulu; Kuala Lumpur; Los Angeles; Singapore; A sample of published freight tariffs to major destinations has been given in answer to Question (4) above. Actual tariffs could be better than the published rates. (9) The Department does not have information on whether freighters carry a different mix of goods to that carried on passenger aircraft. However, many air carriers are willing to carry goods in belly-hold capacity at very low freight rates provided they cover their marginal costs. As the costs of operating dedicated air freighters are much higher than the marginal costs of carrying belly-hold cargo, it is possible that dedicated air freighters carry higher value goods than that carried in the belly holds of passenger aircraft. ""Male Call '96"" (Question No. 889) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 31 October 1996: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to advertisements placed in various newspapers headed 'Talk sex for free!' and encouraging 'men who have sex with men' to relate their sexual experiences. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether the exercise, entitled 'Male Call '96', is being conducted by Macquarie University; if so, what are the details of the program, including its purpose and costs incurred by taxpayers. (3) Is the Minister also able to say whether the program is an initiative which has commenced following changes to university funding announced in the Budget.",185
364,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. Male Call '96 is being conducted by Macquarie University. The Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services has commissioned Professor Susan Kippax, from the National Centre in HIV Social Research at Macquarie University, to undertake the survey. The total cost of Male Call '96 is $350,163. The purpose of Male Call '96 is to collect nationally consistent data on men who have sex with men and the extent to which they engage in practices which place them at risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV, other sexually transmissible diseases and hepatitis A, Band C. This group is being surveyed because men who have sex with men are a high priority for education and prevention under the soon to be released Third National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Male Call '96 repeats a national survey of men who have sex with men run in 1992. The findings of Male Call '96 will be used by the Commonwealth to evaluate the Strategy by assessing the extent to which men have changed their practices since the last time they were surveyed in 1992. The findings will also inform education and prevention programs developed by State and Territory Governments and non-government organisations. The purpose of the advertisements are to recruit men to participate in the survey by phoning the free call 1800 number. The advertisingprogram is very will similar to that used in 1992. The advertisements are designed to appeal to a broad cross section of men who have sex with men, which includes men who are married, bisexual or regard themselves as heterosexuals. (3) The program is completely unrelat.ed to changes to university funding announced In the Budget. My department invited Macquarie Unive-sity to submit a tender for Male Call '96 on 24 Apnl 1996 and contracted the University to undertake the project on 31 May 1996. It is part of a broader program of work Macqua-e Univers-ty ha- been undertaking for a decade In aSSOCiatIOn with the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services through the Commonwealth funded National Centre in HIV Social Research. Terrorist Attack on the Greek Orthodox (Question No. 895) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 31 October 1996: Has his attention been drawn to an attack in Istanbul on 30 September 1996 by an extremist Islamic group on the grounds of the seat of the spiritual head of Orthodox Christians on 30 September 1996; if so, (a) Has Australia officially condemned the act; if not, why not, (b) Will he condemn the attack now and (c) Will he call on the Government of Turkey to condemn the attack. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am aware that on 30 September 1996 a homemade grenade was thrown into the garden of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch in Istanbul. Fortunately, damage from the attack was minor. R-sponsibili.ty for the attack has been claimed by a fnnge terronst organisation calling itself the ""Great Eastern Islamic Raiders-Front."" (a) The Australian Government did not issue a statement condemning the attack. The Government's attitude of deploring and condemning all acts of terrorism is well known. It has not been the practice of Australian Govern-en-s - o issue statements in respect of every terronst incident. (b) I have no hesitation in condemning this attack, as I would any similar terrorist attack. (c) I do not believe that any purpose would be served by belatedly calling upon the Turkish Government to condemn the attack. The Turkish Government has for some time been engaged in anti-terrorist actions against various terrorist groups in Turkey and its attitude towards terrorism is clear. Moreover, the Turkish Government has taken appropriate action in response to the attack on the Patriarchate. My advice is that the actions of the Turkish police have been exemplary in responding to the incident. In addition, security around the Patriarchate has been increased. Caverjact (Question No. 898) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 31 October 1996: (1) Is the prescription drug Caverjact obtainable under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; if so, when was it placed on the Scheme. (2) For what purpose is Caverjact used.",193
365,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TOTAL,"The answer to the honPatriarchate ourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, with effect from 1 November 1996. (2) Caverjact (alprostadil) is an 'authori-y required' drug used for the treatment of orgamc impotence of neurogenic or vasculogenic origin. Immigrants from the Philippines (Question No. 913)  tion and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 5 November 1996: (1) How many persons of Philippines' origins reside in each State and Territory. (2) Which NSW local government authority has the largest population. (3) What funding and staffing is provided under the grant in aid scheme to service the needs of this population in each State and Territory. (4) What is the name and address of each recipient organisation referred to in part (3) and in which electoral division is each located. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Based on the 1991 Census and current data held by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, it is estimated that the number of persons born in the Philippines that have migrated to Australia is as follows: NSW-47,799; VIC-20,960; QLD-12,409; WA-4,997; SA-4,213; NT-l,98J; ACT-I,278; TAS-732 (2) The NSW Local Government Authority with the largest population of people of Filipino origin is Blacktown with 7,841, followed by Fairfield with 3,192.

(2) Can the WA Government enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth in relation to the projects referred to in question No. 463. Mr SharpThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On February 16 1995, a meeting was held with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Honourable Brian Howe and the Premier of Western Australia, the Honourable Richard Court, to discuss proposals for funding under the Better Cities mark 2 program. 4 GIA's 3 full time and 1 part time worker (50%) 2 GIA's 2 full time workers 1 GIA 1 full timeworker 1 GIA 1 full time worker 1 GIA 1 full time worker 1 GIA 1 part time worker (75%) The projects identified at this meeting were developed through a State-Commonwealth steering committee, however negotiations on a final intergovernmental agreement between the two governments were not concluded prior to the federal election in March 1996. Nor was such an agreement entered subsequently. (2) On 17 July 1996, I announced that no new projects under the Better Cities programmes would be entered into. Furthermore, the 199617 budget does not provide for any new projects in the Better Cities Mark 2 Program. Accordingly, there is no opportunity for the WA Government to now enter into an agreement in relation to the projects referred to in question No. 463. Comcar: Employees (Question No. 926) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 5 November 1996: How many (a) full-time and (b) casual (i) employees and (ii) drivers did Comcar employ at 31 October 1996. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Number of full-time staff: (i) total employees-181 (ii) number of full-time drivers-135 (b) Number of casual staff: (i) total employees-124 (ii) number of drivers-120 Jackson, Mr Michael: Marriage (Question No. 955) Mr Hollis asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 19 November 1996: (1) Does the Marriage Act require couples planning to marry to lodge a Notice of Intended Marriage at least one month and one day prior to the marriage being solemnised. (2) Is it a fact that the entertainer, Mr Michael Jackson, was married within three days of his arrival in Australia. (3) Was special permission given to Mr Jackson and his wife to marry without waiting the required period; if so, (a) who granted permission, (b) on what grounds was permission granted and (c) were all requisite documents, including divorce papers and birth certificates, produced to the person who solemnised the marriage. (4) Will the Government change the Marriage Act to allow Australian residents to be married without having to wait one month and one day. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Paragraph 42(1 )(a) of the Marriage Act 196 I provides that a marriage shall not be solemnised unless in notice in writing of the intended marriage has been given in accordance with section 42 and has been received by the authorised celebrant solemnising the marriage not earlier than 6 months before the date of the marriage and not later than I month before the date of the marriage. The parties do not have to be in Australia when Notice is signed or given. The Notice may be given by post, or delivered by an agent. A 'prescribed authority' may, if satisfied that circumstances of the particular case justify so doing, authorise an authorised celebrant to solemnise a marriage, or where the prescribed authority is also an authorised celebrant and there is no other authorised celebrant suitable to the parties conveniently available, solemnise a marriage himself or herself, notwithstanding that the notice of the intended marriage has been received later than I month before the date of the marriage (subsection 42(5». (2)&(3) I am unable to provide this information. Records of marriages in New South Wales are maintained by the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages, a State official, under the provisions of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1995, a State Act. That Act expressly provides that '(i)n providing information extracted from the Register, the Registrar must as far as practicable, protect the persons to whom the entries in the Register relate from unjustified intrusion on their privacy'. I am assured by the Registrar there is no evidence of any breach of, or irregularity under, the Marriage Act 196 I having occurred. (4) There is no proposal currently under consideration for any amendment to the provisions of the Marriage Act 196 I relating to the giving of notice of an intended marriage or to the shortening the of such notice. The Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages points out that the majority of shortenings of time are granted to Australian citizens or residents who find themselves in unusual circumstances.",194
