1,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Proposed Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services. The Federal Liberal Trans-Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest. Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines would inevitably result in(i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia; (ii) higher domestic air fares. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright any proposal to sell Trans-Australia Airlines. by Mr Jacobi, Mr Charles Jones, Mr Les MCMahon, Mr Morris and Mr Mountford. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. The hotel industry in Australia is long-established and a valuable part of the community of this nation, providing places where the people may partake of the three basic needs of life: a place to eat, a place to drink, a place to sleep. 2. The hotel industry is accepted throughout the nation as occupying an important place in the social and economic activities of Australia. 3. The hotel industry is almost entirely within the private sector and makes a large contribution to the government in taxes of various kinds. 4. The hotel industry has a need to sustain an appropriate level of turnover and growth, and improve the level of employment. 5. The hotel industry of Australia is gravely concerned at published reports that the Government intends to increase excise charges on beer in the forthcoming Budget. 6. Sales of beer constitute most of the industry's 5811 hotels in Australia. 7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded the growth of the Australian hotel industry. 8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining economic viability and the ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community. ThursdaYrl May 1981 9. Such is its significance as a community requirement, beer occupies a place on the Consumer Price Index, and any alteration to its cost to the community would have an inflationary effect. 10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the hotel industry to pass on such increases to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer. NA i 1. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State Licence Fee taxes, which are directly linked to excise rates. 12. The hotel industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives: 1. Recognise the importance and place of the Australian Hotel industry in the social and economic life of the nation. Party policy objective of selling 2. Accept that the viability of the hotel industry is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities and stability of the industry is essential to enable it to continue to provide for the hotel needs of the nation in this period of growing population and increasing tourism. And further, that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives resist and reject any move to increase excise on beer. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Les MCMahon, Mr Millar and Mr Scott. Petitions received. Taxation: Child Care Expenses Excise on Beer To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: A substantial contribution to Australia's economy by the payment of taxation and to the quality of life of fellow Australians, is made by parents in the work-force who have preschool children_ Taxation relief for adequate child-care is necessary to enable these patents to avail themselves of child-care facilities in order to take paid employment. Your petitioners therefore humhly pray that tax-payers who incur child-care expenses in order to earn income should be able to have those expenses exempt from income taxation in the same way as other tax-payers can deduct business expenses from their assessable income. to make profit, and to sustain And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Beazley. Petition received. the major source of income of Unemployment Benefit To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of ReprC.!lentatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia, respectfully calls for: The immediate and unconditional withdrawal of any proposals to deny Unemployment Benefits to unemployed people under 18 years old. That the level of Benefits for all unemployed people, and including people receiving sickness benefits and pensions, be raised to at least 120 per cent of the poverty line. That future employment policies' and the restoration of full employment rather than the evasion of this responsibility by hiding the unemployed in short term training and education schemes. Public acknowledgement of the fact that unemployment is the result of insufficient jobs group, the education system or the unemployed themselves. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Charles. Petition received. Toxic Shock Syndrome To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency: (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ""Cosmetics"" as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions. (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry facture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users. (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mrs Child. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament undersigned Australian citizens showeth: That the last increase in the Supplementary Assistance or rent allowance payable to Invalid and Age pensioners was made in 1974; That since that time, average weekly rents, as gauged by increases in average Queensland Housing Commission rents, have risen by approximately 150 per cent and continue to rise at an alarming rate.

Petition received. and not the fault of any minority Rosemount Repatriation Hospital To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of undersigned Australian citizens showeth: Rosemount Repatriation Hospital has been of inestimable value to eligible repatriation beneficiaries for many years, and the closure or dispersal of the facilities available at the hospital would be a retrograde step. The proposed decision to close Rosemount Repatriation Hospital through active discouragement by departmental administrative officers of any further referrals by medical officers of patients for medically prescribed occupational therapy is objectionable. Closure of Rosemount Repatriatio- Hospital would severely disadvantage veterans in Brisbane's northern suburbs, as well as their relatives and friends who would be required to travel a great distance in order to visit hospitalised veterans at either of the two alternative Repatriation hospitals. Closure of Rosemount Repatriation Hospital and transfer of patients to Greenslopes would greatly add to the Administrative burden of that repatriation and general hospital. into all aspects of manuYour petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will reverse its announced decision to close the Rosemount Repatriation Hospital.

Defence Service Home Loans To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the members of the Women's Services of the 1939-45 War not at present considered eligible for Defence Service Home Loans should qualify as ""Australian Soldiers"" under the Defence Service Homes Act. They volunteered for service with the Naval, Military and Air Forces, serving wherever they were sent in whatever capacity they were required and yet are refused Defence Service Home Loans. They took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies which meant to fight His Majesty's enemies, and although not used in actual combat in war zones, they were available for that use and had a sufficiently grave to serve with distinction as have women of other lands. In accordance with the Acts and Regulations of the period, the women of the Military Forces had enlisted for service anywhere, some of the Naval women to sail in any waters, others with service on warships optional, Force could have been sent to Papua New Guinea or other territories under the control or care of Australia. Ex-servicemen of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force who volunteered in the 1939-45 War but were not sent to War Zones are granted home loans. Not to grant eligibility to all Ex-servicewomen of 1938-45 War is unjust and unfair. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you favourably consider amending the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all membe-s of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War.

And further, that annual budget allocations in the area of childrens services should be spent in full for the purposes designated. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Trade Unions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that we are gravely disturbed by the actions of militant unions and the ACTU, the failure of the President of the ACTU to assist positively in settling the dispute which has caused massive losses to Qantas our National Airline, and we applaud the action of the Government in using RAAF planes to rescue Australians stranded abroad. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Parliament and the Government should be of firm resolve not to permit such unions to hold the country to ransom and continue to take a forceful and resolute stand against such union militancy. by Mr Ruddock.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Victoria respectfully showeth that: As regular viewers and listeners of the ABC Melbourne Show band we were disappointed to learn of the dismissal of seventeen members of this outstanding orchestra. We have had a great deal of pleasure over the past years viewing and listening to this band's fine music. It is the only full-time light orchestra in Australia and we are disgusted to think that such talented musicians should be dismissed in this manner.

Motion of Condemnation,18
4,Mr HAYDEN,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"I move: That this House condemns the Government for(1) its erratic and unstable behaviour, its preoccupation with its internal dissension and the paralysis of the proper functions of government and of this Parliament because of the Government's total distraction with these problems; (2) the unfair and inequitable manner proposed for the elimination of or reduction in important community programs; (3) the serious damage caused to the federal system by savage and unfair reductions in funding provided for the States; (4) the deceitful way in which the States were deprived of $70m to which the Australian people were entitled; and (5) the extraordinary behaviour of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in seeking to publicly humiliate the Premiers through shoddy leaks to the media. The Opposition does not take this action lightly. Formal moves to censure the government of the day are made only when the state of the nation's affairs demands them-when the government has patently failed to fulfil the trust given to it by the people. This describes precisely the condition of the Government today. Over the past 10 days, and especially over the Notice of Motion past 48 hours, various events have given the nation an extraordinary insight into the degraded state into which this Government has descended: The disarray, the turmoil, the confusion and the incompetence of the Government itself, and the consequent paralysis and corruption of the Parliament. Because of these events, the truth is now apparent. Behind that stony Easter Island image, nothing stirs but personal and malevolent ambition. The forces that motivate this Government have nothing to do with the welfare of the nation; they have all to do with the survival in power of the Government. The new health program, the Lynch Committee proposals, and the results of the Premiers Conference, show that what this Government intends for the next decade is not the great leap forward that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) promised during the election last October, but a timid scramble backwards. They show that all that this Government has in mind for the 1980s is nostalgia for the 19508, when the hiwes were urged on to ever greater affluence and the have-nots were left to fend for themselves. The nation is entitled to ask why the Government is in such a dishevelled state. The answer can be found in the Prime Minister's contemptuous treatment of the Premiers and the experience of his former Minister for Industrial Relations. The petty vindictiveness of the Prime Minister towards the honourable member for  of confidential Cabinet decisions in order to score cheap points off the Premiers, show that the Prime Minister will go to extreme lengths to protect his ascendancy over his colleagues. The honourable member for Kooyong has now told us the reasons for this degradation of parliamentary and government affairs: The Prime Minister's manic determination to get his way, his suspicion of his colleagues, the subversion of government in factional interests, the bitter tensions that exist within the coalition. The honourable member for Kooyong has put it on the scoreboard. These are the reasons that, seven months after the election, the Government has achieved nothing, save a few favours for a few friends. These are the reasons that the nation's affairs are in such a disorganised, ineffective state. These are the reasons that the Prime Minister and his colleagues deserve the most severe censure of this Parliament and the nation. The Prime Minister has nobody but himself to blame for the latest crisis in which he finds himself embroiled. He was not content with simply taking the States to the cleaners to the tune of $70m. He was determined to ensure that everyone should know how clever he was, and how tough he could be in a confrontation with the Premiers. He embarked on a strategy on Monday in which he set up the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to leak the details of their cleverness to selected journalists. When this did not produce the desired headlines, the necessary stage-managed publicity, the Prime Minister called a background briefing of journalists from the Herald and Weekly Times group of newspapers, among them Mr Trevor Hawkins from the Sun News-Pictorial, Mr Wallace Brown of the Courier Mail, and Mr Geof Kitney of the Perth Daily News. This briefing in the Prime Minister's office took place on Tuesday night, and produced the news stories yesterday morning which so incensed the Western Australian Premier, Sir Charles Court. It was from these incidents that flowed the extraordinary sequence of events last night in which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer between them held four Press conferences to try to extricate the Prime Minister from the consequences of his smart-Alick behaviour. I emphasise that these were, of course, Press conferences. At no stage did the Prime Minister seek to come into this House and attempt to justify his deceit of the Premiers, or to explain why he thought it necessary to leak to the Press information that could only be seen as humiliating to all State governments and contemptuous of the Australian people. Nor has there yet been any explanation to the Parliament why this Prime Minister believes he has some special exemption from the normal Westminster conventions that preclude Ministers from breaching Cabinet confidentiality. As past events have demonstrated, however, this Prime Minister obviously believes the usual rules and proper standards concerning a great range of attitudes, among them trust, loyalty and honesty, both in personal relationships and in his conduct of government, simply do not apply to him. The honourable member for Kooyong made this perfectly clear in his speech to the House last week explaining his resignation from the Fraser Ministry. What has happened this week serves only to substantiate the very strong criticisms of the Prime Minister that were contained in that speech. Let me remind the House that, like the Peacock resignation, the events of the past 48 hours sprang from that much abused political tactic, the background briefing. In the case of the honourable member for Kooyong, so-called senior government officials were the source of the story that appeared in the Australian on 14 April concerning allegations damaging to his political and personal integrity. As the honourable member said last week, it was this story, and the Prime Minister's gross disloyalty to him in not denying it in detail, that finally provoked his resignation. The source of the Australian story has not been disclosed. Yet ironically we now have the same tactic of the background briefing being used, again in an issue concerning the Prime Minister, again with the same euphemistic source of senior government officials, and again causing political fall-out for the Government. The difference this time is that the Prime Minister has been caught out. He has been forced to admit his direct involvement, both in authorising the Treasurer to leak to the Press, and then by calling his own background briefing to reinforce his disclosure of information humiliating to the Premiers but of short term advantage to himself. I suggest that, if the honourable member for Kooyong ever had any doubts as to the identity of the source of the Australian story that shafted him, he would have few remaining doubts after the events of the past 48 hours. I suggest also that few other members of this Parliament would now have any real doubts either, irrespective of any denials to the contrary. The Prime Minister's conduct in this matter, with all of his twisting and turning in the last 48 hours-first of all to exploit the circumstances and then to preserve his political hide-raises fundamental issues that go to the heart of this censure motion. First, there is the broad question of Commonwealth-State relations. Clearly the Prime Minister and the Treasurer believe that conferences with the Premiers are, as one Premier now describes them, no more than exercises in bluff in which the biggest cheat wins. There is no doubt the principle was upheld on this occasion. Equally clearly, this Government is utterly contemptuous of such conferences as forums for meaningful and responsible negotiations. Second, there is the matter of economic management. On this occasion the Government had made up its mind on the maximum finance it would share among the States. It then set about seeing how far it could squeeze the Premiers to stay under that limit, irrespective of the merits of their individual arguments or of the needs of the States in terms of economic and welfare development. That is, this is not just a repudiation of the Premiers but it is a rejection of the rights of the people of this country. Having succeeded by shaving $70m off the funds that Cabinet had agreed the Commonwealth could afford, the Prime Minister could not resist boasting of his success or, when his cheap. sneering backfired, pushing the Treasurer forward to take his place and to take the blame. This is not only an arrogant and irresponsible means of economic management, it is also wholly consistent with this Government's erratic and ad hoc administration of the last 5f years. Finally, there are the ethics of the Prime Minister's behaviour. We on this side of the House have long held the view that this Government cannot be trusted and that this Prime Minister can be trusted least of all. We have said so, forcefully and with certainty, whenever the occasion warranted. I say so again today. I go further and say that the standards of the Prime Minister are the standards of the bully, the standards of the sneak and the standards of the snake oil salesman. They are standards that infect this Government from the top and they are standards that have been adopted by those who seek promotion and Prime Ministerial patronage above all else. They are standards that have been publicly paraded in the past 48 hours to the discomfort, I am sure, of many honourable members opposite whose sense of honesty and decency is as outraged as is that of any other member of this Parliament or the community by the Prime Minister's behaviour in the past fortnight. The Prime Minister has prevaricated, he has evaded, he has sneered, he has threatened, he has boasted and he has used his staff to hector in an attempt to intimidate the Australian Broadcasting Commission into scrapping video film of a stumbling and shifty interview he gave last night. After that appalling performance on being confronted by questions he did not want to answer on events his own foolish actions had precipitated, he tried to censor the news. His Press secretary, Mr Barnett, who gracelessly is accommodated in the officials enclosure opposite, thundered around the Press Gallery corridors last night like a half-pay reject from Cop Shop trying to bully and badger the ABC journalists into censoring the news, and when that did not work, levelling threats against them. Is that the standard that this parliamentary institution has sunk to? Are they the ingredients, the qualities, of the ethical standards that the Prime Minister clings to? All that the Prime Minister has not done is the only thing he should have done when this issue burst about him; that is, he has not come into this Parliament, admitted his mistake and his guiltinstead of hiding behind the Treasurer-and he has not reconvened the Premiers Conference to offer explanations and apologies as well as the short-changed $70m. What that demonstrates, of course, is that Parliament continues to be as much of an irrelevance to this Prime Minister as it has always been to his Government. Question Time is a farce; the Standing Orders are misused as an obstruction to proper scrutiny and accountability; the Notice Paper is no more than a stock-list of deferred debates and questions on notice, some of which have been waiting for six months for an answer. The Government's legislative program is a joke. We are now in the tenth week of sitting, yet nothing of real substance has gone through this Parliament since the election, apart from an apology of a Bill to establish a restricted Human Rights Commission and a piece of pay-off legislation to Mr Rupert Murdoch to guarantee his new airline's purchase of 21 new aircraft. If the Prime Minister does forget old friends within his own ranks at least he remembers to pay off old debts to people outside the Parliament. Freedom of information legislation which frees no information at all is jammed in the Senate, and we are all still waiting for the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) to bring before the Parliament his foreshadowed amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act, a Bill which has all the earmarks of another sell-out of the public interest to this Government's great and powerful friends. What we can make of this is that Parliament has done nothing because this Government has nothing for it to do. It reacts; it does not initiate. has no perceived objective except to stay in office by gimmickry and deceit, and no vision beyond the political problems of the immediate 24 hours. All these aspects of this Government's conduct are crystallised in the events of the last 48 hours. No single issue better characterises this Government's lack of integrity, or better illustrates its fundamental dishonesty, than does the issue of health care. Of all the broken promises, the dishonoured commitments, the smart, mealymouthed slogans, the double dealing and the double standards, and the deliberate and calculated lies of the last 5t years it is the Fraser Government's policies and actions on health care which epitomise its basic character, its subservience to wealth and privilege and its mean and grubby behaviour towards the rest of the Australian people. We on this side of the House see the question of health care quite differently from our opponents. We believe health care is a right, not a privilege. That is why we introduced the Medibank scheme in 1974. It is why we remain committed to the reintroduction of a universal health insurance scheme at the first opportunity after the next election. If the new health program is an example of the Government's duplicity, the Lynch committee's proposals-coupled with the results of the Premiers Conference-demonstrate equally well the Government's timidity. Three and a half years ago the Prime Minister announced that we were ready, as he put it, 'to stride into a new era of prosperity and development'. Over the past fortnight we have been given a glimpse of this Government's vision of what this era contains. What a miserable, dispirited vision it is! In the Lynch committee program, and throughout the results of the Premiers Conference, the Government is demonstrating that it has decided to run away from its responsibilities. It somehow sees virtues in this-virtue that is given the name of small government. In the real world, of course, small government is meaningless. In the real world, pressures and expectations exist that demand government thatcis aware, government that is realistic, government - in contact with the people and not, as the Lynch committee would have it, government cut off from them. In this real world, there are more than two million people trying to survive in poverty. For with all its potential, this society somehow manages to have one of the most inequitable distributions of wealth in the industrialised world. Social and economic injustices abound in welfare programs, in housing, in health, education, in the law, in the distribution of It wealth, income and opportunity. Discrimination plagues such minority groups as migrants and Aboriginal Australians, who suffer under one of the highest incidences of disease in the world. The drive for equal rights for women has all but been abandoned. The need for rational urban planning, housing and regional development programs has been denied. Individual citizens--no match on their own for ever-growing corporations and their everwidening power-deserve more influence in their jobs and in the market place and greater protection for their environment. This is the reality and the Government has run away from it. The only vision that stirs its leader is that of power and how to maintain it, no matter how malevolent, damaging and divisive the measures that have to be adopted to achieve that end. Yesterday's events show that he will abuse his relationship with the Press, ignore the Parliament and even subvert national economic policy-making to maintain his ascendancy over those he imagines to be a threat to him and his position. Everywhere in the nation's administration is confusion, contradiction and incompetence. The Fraser Government and its ways have become a farce. Long after the people have swept it out of office the joke will be going round the pubs that the Fraser Government was the government that decided to sell a cement works in the city where it had just closed down all the building industry. Any normal Prime Minister who presided over such chaos would resign, even if only out of selfrespect. But this Prime Minister is not normal. He gained power with whatever unsavory weapons were to hand. He is obviously determined to hang on to it, no matter what the cost to the nation or what damage it does to his own party. By this motion the House seeks to recall the Prime Minister and his colleagues to their senses. It seeks to remind them that Australians expect more from their Government than they have received from this Administration-confusion and incompetence conce-ning everything but the maintenance of power and the concentrated pursuit of vendettas against assumed rivals. This Prime Minister almostJjsingle handedly has managed to infect and corrupt the body politic in this country to an unbelievable degree. There is no longer respect or confidence within the community for the way in which political government of this nation is conducted by the Fraser Government and there is only one man who can accept the responsibility for that very black honour-the Prime Minister of this country. He is a disgrace to this nation. He ought to be scourged from office. I thoroughly recommend the motion tO,the House.",18
5,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,Is the motion seconded?,22
6,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FRASER GOVERNMENT,1 second the motion. I ask for leave of the House to amend the motion to make it a censure rather than a condemnation. It affects the time factor.,22
7,Mr SINCLAIR,FRASER GOVERNMENT,Leave is refused.,22
8,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,Leave is refused.,22
9,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"It does not make any difference whether this motion is called a condemnation or a censure; everybody in the nation knows it is one of censure on the Government. Last evening we came into this Parliament asking the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to make a statement in the House. He declined to' do it. Why? Because he was afraid of the debate that would then have taken place. The only reason there were any Press conferences or television appearances yesterday was that Sir Charles Court said: 'Unless you, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, go in front of the Australian public to say you deliberately deceived us 1 will bring you down as leader and as Treasurer. 1 will move for your sacking, and as 1I have a fair bit of control in Western Australia 1 will guarantee there will be a replacement both for the Prime Minister and for the Treasurer'. That is the only reason the two distinguished gentlemen decided to go to air last night. But, they did not have enough courage to come into this House and debate the matter that was before the nation. What is before the nation? How is it that the Prime Minister can say to the nation: 'I have taken all the money out of the taxpayers' pockets but I will not give as much as the States need; 1 will withhold it and 1 will do it by deceit and deception'? He says: 'When 1I have fooled the Premiers and made them look complete idiots, 1 will then give a background briefing to the Press as to how stupid and foolish they were'. What sort of federalism is that? What sort of national leadership is it when those two distinguished gentlemen, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, take delight in making fools of the leaders of all the States? In what way were the Premiers made fools of? It was on the basis that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer would withhold from the States not a mere $7Om but $28Om of Australian taxpayers' money-not the Prime Minister's money, not the Treasurer's money and not the Commonwealth's money, but Australians' money. Why do the States need that money? Honourable members ought to know the problems of the States. Is it any wonder that Sir Charles Court is on record in regard to this matter? He is the Government parties' leader in Western Australia. Honourable members opposite might not like him but at least he has enough courage to stand up and make them look weak and cowardly-and that is why they are here today. The only reason they have come into this Parliament to listen to the debate is that they have been instructed to do so, otherwise they will not retain their title. Why was Sir Charles Court so upset, as every Premier was upset? Not one of them accepted the offer made. They negotiated furiously. They argued, in the interests of the Australian people, that the Government should give them what they needed. The Government denied them their rights, which means it has denied the rights of every Australian. Sir Charles Court said: I have been misled by the Prime Minister. In February 1976 I was promised a new deal on federalism. It guaranteed me increased allocation from the Federal coffers, but I have been deceived. In other words, Sir Charles Court has said: 'You,  You broke your undertaking. You said in 1976 that we would not be worse off as States. We are substantially worse off and you have deceived me.' How did the Prime Minister do it? The arrangement was that the States were to get 39.87 per cent of the personal income tax receipts. Under this formula they get a mere 38 per cent. Does the Prime Minister expect them to accept it? No! It would mean a drop overall of about $280m. The Prime Minister informed the Press that the States received 10 per cent. They did not get 10 per cent because the Government guaranteed that included in their allocation this time was the provision for urban transport and soil conservation, for which previously specific purpose grants were made. They received 9 per cent. The Prime Minister has even misled the nation on that. They needed 13 per cent. If one adds on the other 4 per cent one will arrive at the amount of $280m. DOeG the Prime Minister believe the States were just going to put that money in the bank and not use it? Let us look at what else the Government has done to the taxpayer- of Australia. Let us look at the health program. The Government has dec, manded that when a person goes to hospital as an outpatient he or she must pay $15 a time. Can one imagine the situation of a person who is dependent upon a dialysis machine and who has to go to hospital at least four times a month and the situation of those suffering from skin diseases who have to attend the outpatients' department perhaps once a week? The Government has demanded that the States extract extra money from these poor, unfortunate taxpayers who suffer ill health. What sort of a health scheme is it that is run only on a Treasury basis? How can a government run a health scheme on the basis of monetary allocation and not on the needs of the sick, the poor and the underprivileged? The Government has demanded that the States extract millions of dollars from the Australian people in their efforts to keep their health. What sort of a nation is it that cannot afford a health program? The Government guaranteed in its previous election campaign that it would maintain Medibank. What a joke that is. That is one example of the many promises the Government made. The Government promised that it would maintain wage indexation and tax indexation. It intended to maintain all the rights and privileges of the Australian nation. The Prime Minister has broken promise after promise. The chickens have come home to roost now because the Government's own kith and kin, the wool growers and others, are sending urgent telegrams saying: 'Look what you have done in relation to wool testing. It will affect 100,000 wool growers and the test will not even be accepted internationally'. Even the Prime Minister's own supporters cannot tolerate him any more. When the Premiers as a group say that he is not to be trusted, why should he remain in office? If the Prime Minister were to go to the nation now on the basis of this so-called arrangement with the States, 'every Premier, irrespective of his politics, would vote against him. They would oppose him and ask for him to be removed from office because he is of no value to the nation. The reason is this: Unless a person has integrity and political honesty he or she is not entitled to hold office. Thecbehaviour of the Prime Minister. right across the spectrum of this nation, whether it be in relation to national affairs or international affairs, is of deceit ception. It does not matter what the Prime Minister tells us in this Parliament, he is prone to deceive us. He is prone to have arrangements made with the United States of America that do not mean what they say an<b,-rrangements made with the States that do not ffie;;an what they say. He has given indications in thIS Parliament of his intentions but he never carries them out. Promises made at election time are never carried out. These are the problems in relation to what is said-Mr Sainsbury-Oh, phooey.",22
10,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"'Oh, phooey"" says the interjector at the back of the chamber. He holds a marginal seat that we will take next time there is an election. Let us look at the record of the Government. Let us take one issue that affects the States. I refer to the area of pre-schools. I was the Minister who went around to every Premier and who at the time had responsibilty for looking after children under the age of five years. I said to them: 'I will put it in writing that we promise to provide 75 per cent of the recurrent costs oflooking after pre-school children'. This we did. If we look at New South Wales, for example-this situation applies right across the board-we find now that the Commonwealth's contribution to recurrent costs for pre-school children is a mere 30 per cent. If we look at itfrom the point of view of children under five being cared for in New South Wales, that State now has to pay $8.2m for this care. The figure in 1976-77 was a mere $1.7m. Is this not symptomatic of all the things this Government has done? If people go to Queanbeyan Hospital they will pay more; if they send children to the pre-school at Queanbeyan they will pay more. Let us have a look at what has happened from the point of view of housing grants. In 1975 $127m was allocated for housing grants. In 1980-81, $90m was allocated. This represents a reduction in monetary terms and a 50 per cent reduction in real terms. Let us look at dwelling construction. In 1977 New South Wales was able to construct 3,000 houses for low income earners. But with the money which has been allocated by this Government it will be able to construct 1,200 houses. Is it any wonder that the States are asking: 'What are you going to do for us?' Australian taxpayers are involved. T turn now to the question of looking after children in institutions. Again the Government says that this is another State responsibility. In 1976 the Government gave a measly $5 for each child in an institution. That allocation has not been increased since 1976. So the States-I use New South Wales as an examplenow have to provide $27.50 for each child. This and deGovernment gives nothing. That applies right across the board. The States have now been given a signal thatthis Government will not provide any unemployment benefit to 16 and 17 year oIds. The States will have to pay for their institutional or other care. This Government gives them nothing. And this is a national government interested in welfare! Let us look now at the meals on wheels situation. In the three years that we were in government we increased the subsidy for meals on wheels on three occasions. This Government has increased it once. That service is not able to keep going as it cannot: keep up with the costs. The States are having to provide meals for the pensioners and the poor as this Government is not prepared to do it. The States have to do this using taxpayers' money in the States. The meals on wheels operation requires vehicles to operate and this Government has not increased the subsidy for these vehicles but has escalated petrol tax by 400 per cent. In social welfare programs-whether we are talking about pre-schools, housing, juvenile problems or the care of young or old people-this Government has failed at every turn. The States could use $280m. They would use it for Australians who are paying taxes now. What right has this Government as trustee to say that it will appropriate that money to itself because it has a mandate so to do? Where is this Government's mandate to do any of these things? Where is its mandate to deny care to children? Where is its mandate to whittle down the States' housing finances? Where is its mandate to deny help to the underprivileged, whether they be in institutions or anything of that nature? Mr Ruddock-Your mandate would increase taxes.",23
11,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"That is just it. This Government's mandate is: Do not increase the taxes federally but sock the people really hard through the States. The honourable member for Dundas should try to tell the people in his elector Sir ate that their taxes have been reduced. They will say to him: 'Ruddock, you are out of your mind. We are paying a fortune for the care of our children. We cannot get housing loans at reasonable interest rates. We are paying enormous costs which the States have to impose for transport, health care, and every other charge'. What a thimble and pea trick it is for this Government to say: 'We will reduce the taxes to you but you will pay through the nose'. The whole idea of federalism was to give everybody in Australia a fair share of the wealth. This Government has approached it on the basis that the States should try to do best they can. The Government knows better than anyone else that some States have more capacity to levy taxes than others. Is this Government running federalism on the basis that there has to be double taxation? Obviously it is. There has to be a Federal tax. There has to be a State tax. That is the Government's policy. If we go to any of the people in Australia today they say 'What do we need a national government for? It opted out of everything'-except selling this country to overseas interests. The Government has opted out of everything. What is it going to do now as a national government? Why does it not talk about being involved in education? Why does it not talk about being involved in health? Why is it not involved in housing? Why is it not involved in urban transport where the Government has slashed programs to ribbons? The Government promised in every election campaign, for example, to assist the country lines program. After the election the Government deprived the program of the moneys that were promised. Everywhere that the Government has made promises it has failed to fulfil them. What does it mean? The interjection referred to taxes. The Government says: 'Perhaps we will drop Federal income tax rates by $2 or $3 but the mugs outside won't know that. They will have to pay another $20 or $30 through State taxes but we will go away as being good economic managers'. I make the point-luckily this is the point-that the State Ministers for Health will be here tomorrow. I hope that those Ministers tear the Government to ribbons on the basis of how the Government misled them. The Premiers are coming back. They would love to come back tomorrow. They ought to be here tomorrow to tear the Government limb from limb on the basis of how the Government deceived them by saying that it could not afford any more money. The Prime Minister went out and told the Press that it was beyond any possibility that the States could get another one per cent increase. In fact, as Charles Court has said, under the arrangements, the promises made to him in February 1976, he was entitled to another 4 per cent from the point of view of keeping up with the costs of living. Inflation is spiralling. Who has to pay the costs of inflation? Interest rates now are 17 per cent or more. Who is paying that? The Australian taxpayer. Where is the Government's economic management at any level we want to look at? How dreadful is it to think that we had a parliament in session yesterday and not one of the Government's leaders could find time to come into this House to discuss the problems as to why the the States were upset, as to why the Premiers of every State were concerned as to what was to happen to their programs! The Prime Minister could not have cared less. It was not until Sir Charles Court said: 'Listen, unless you go in and make a public confession and show how weak you are, I will bring you down, from Western Australia. I will guarantee that the Liberal machine there will move into action and we will have a new leader in the national Parliament very soon'. That is where the influence came from. Top marks to Sir Charles Court! Even though his politics are poor, his principles in this area are accurate.",24
12,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,Order! The honourable gentlemen's time has expired.,25
13,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,This Government in 1975 and in successive elections and with record majorities was given a mandate to govern this country well. We wi 11 discharge that duty through this Parliament and through future parliaments:,25
14,Unknown,FRASER GOVERNMENT,Opposition members interjecting,25
15,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,I ask honourable members on my left not to keep up the interjection level which means that the right honourable gentleman cannot be heard. I ask all honourable members to observe that.,25
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"In 1975 this Government was first given a mandate to govern this country well. After that election and through successive elections and with record majorities this duty has been discharged, and it will continue to be through this Parliament and through successive parliaments. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) spoke of the state of the nation as though there was no hope and confidence in the wider community. How far apart can he be from the feelings, the sense of confidence and optimism, that is now shared in every corner of Australia? How far is he from the imaginative decisions that we have taken over the last few days in health, in the Review of Commonwealth Functions and, indeed, in the Premiers Conference itself? The Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party can only look to the past and the prescriptions of the past which show that they believe it is government, government decisions, government bureaucracies and large spending which must determine it all. A classic example is health where the Labor Party believes the Government through taxpayers' funds should provide everything, should spend everything and do everything. We happen to have a different belief. We believe that available funds should be concentrated on the disadvantaged and on those in need. We do not believe that taxpayers' money should be used to pay unnecessary subsidies to those who are better off in the community. We do not believe in undermining individual responsibility by centralised bureaucracy. We believe the user should pay and the user is entitled to the influence that comes from paying. We do not believe in dual control ofc,.the Federal and State governments over Australia's hospitals. We believe the States have responsibilities that they ought to discharge. Labor's arrogant assumption that Canberra knows best is false indeed. The central part of this debate is whether the people of Australia, the taxpayers, should have dollars to spend on their own account or whether the Government should continue to absorb larger and larger funds, leaving less and less freedom to people throughout this country. A very essential principle consistent with political freedom is economic freedom, freedom to make decisions and to choose and determine one's own future. Labor's high taxes, big bureaucracy and interfering regulations undermined this economy in the past and they would do it again. We well know that the predictions of the Leader of the Opposition about the Australian economy time and again have proved to be so very wrong.",25
17,Unknown,FRASER GOVERNMENT,Opposition members interjecting,25
18,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"Order! Honourable members on my left are interjecting at a very loud level. This is a motion moved by the Party leader, the Leader of the Opposition. He has made serious charges against the Government. In any sense of fairness, especially in the national Parliament where it is a major national issue that is being debated, the right honourable gentleman will be heard in silence.",25
19,Mr KEATING,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Prime Minister is not answering the charge. This is Professor Kemp's 1975 policy speech.",25
20,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Blaxland will resume his seat and remain silent.,25
21,Mr HAYDEN,FRASER GOVERNMENT,This is written but unrehearsed. Obviously he has no intention of answering the debate. Mr SPEAKElt-Order! The Leader of the Opposition will give example to his followers either by his continual interjections or by his silence. This is the national Parliament and I ask the Leader of the Opposition to maintain proper decorum and remain silent.,25
22,Mr HAYDEN,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I accept that. I will set the standard for my supporters, which, unlike that of the Prime Minister, will be a decent one.",25
23,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"The Leader of the Opposition has not shown it yet, but let us see whether he can for the rest of this debate. I was indicating that the Leader of the Opposition's economic predictions have proved very wrong on so many occasions and they are wrong for this decade. In June last year he said that we would have an inflation rate of 12 per cent for the year to December. How wrong he was. In 1978 he said that we would enter the 1980s with unemployment approaching a million. How wrong he was and how wrong he is. He said that the 1980s are looming as a decade of despair. The only despair will be in the hearts and minds of the members of the Australian Labor Party as they dig graves for themselves. The Commonwealth went into this particular Premiers Conference which has led to this debate with a negotiating position. It would have been vastly offensive to the Premiers if we had made a Cabinet decision which said: 'These are the dollars, these are the cents. We have no negotiating position; we have no capacity to listen to your arguments, no capacity to adjust as a consequence of the arguments that are put'. The Cabinet decision made it perfectly plain that at most the funds given to the Premiers would be no higher in real terms than the year before, but that the final decision would be determined at the time by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and myself in conjunction with other colleagues who were at that Conference. The decision was made on that day. The decision stands. The Commonwealth demonstrated that it was reasonable, that it was flexible and that it listened to the Premiers. The Premiers would expect us to go to that Conference with a negotiating position and with some capacity for movement. If we did anything else it would certainly be offensive to all Premiers. Our fundamental concern in these matters is to protect the taxpayers of Australia. The Opposition, the Labor Party, and most of the Premiers say that they want to spend more and more funds. If we acceded to all the requests of the Premiers, if we acceded to the exhortations of the Australian Labor Party, the taxpayers of this country would have no funds at all left for themselves. Protection of the Australian taxpayer is essential to achieve the basic objectives which are important to this nation. Those objectives include higher rates of growth-high by world standards, high by the standards of the last decade-and lower rates of inflation than we had under Labor, lower rates of inflation than will be found in other countries. Over 300,000 jobs have been created under our policies over the last two years. What other industrialised country can show a performance equivalent to that in the circumstances we have? In addition, there has been greater help to those in need than on any other occasion, greater security for those in need through indexation of pensions, greater assistance to the disadvantaged than Labor ever dreamed of providing. We need to understand that the money we spend, the money Labor would like to spend, the money Premiers ask for, cannot be taken out of the sky. It does not belong to the Commonwealth; it does not belong to the States; it belongs to the taxpayers, the individual men and women of this nation. It is not a question of cheating taxpayers; it is not a question of cheating the States; it is a question of making a proper judgment about what resources should be used by government and what resources should be left to the people, the taxpayers of Australia. There is no robbery in that, and there is nothing new in States complaining. There is nothing new in States asking for more funds, but if we have a Commonwealth government, as we did in Labor's term, which does not have the capacity to say no to greater and increased demands for expenditure, then quite plainly we destroy this economy and destroy the well-being of Australia's families. We provided the maximum funds that were responsible on the arguments of the day and within the discretion provided by Cabinet. That was the appropriate thing to do to protect the well-being of this economy and the well-being of Australian families and taxpayers. It is quite plain that taxpayers are fed up with governments or political parties in opposition which just want to spend and spend and go on spending. They know that that way lies disaster for themselves, for their businesses, and for their children. Quite plainly, the States should show responsibility, as all governments should, and cut waste and bureaucracy and over-regulation. They should repeat the example of Sir Phillip Lynch and his committee which reviewed Commonwealth functions. I have no doubt that each State could pursue the same exercise with merit. Somebody has tried to suggest that there is something wrong in a Cabinet decision being made public. I should have thought that overwhelmingly the purpose of Cabinet decisions is to make them public, and the Treasurer and I, in consultation, did just that. There is nothing wrong with Cabinet decisions being made public. That is why Cabinet decisions are made-for the purpose of government. To suggest that there is something wrong in that is a strange thing indeed. The Labor Party once more shows itself as a party defending higher taxation and big spending. We need to understand that the Leader of the Labor Party has said that the challenge to socialism is the rapid spread of philosophies based on lower taxes and smaller government. He knows that as the Australian people come to understand better and better that their well-being is dependent upon those philosophies, the chance of socialism having its day in Australia will be abandoned for all time. What kind of political party is it that sees cuts in government spending as robbing governments? This Government is supporting taxpayers and giving them greater influence over the affairs of this nation. If the Opposition had been responsible, it would have been supporting the Government in what it did at the Premiers Conference. The Labor Party, as always, at the last election-",25
24,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,Order! The right honourable gentleman will resume his seat. The honourable member for Burke has interjected constantly. I warn him to cease.,27
25,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"The Labor Party has shown, as it did at the last election and the election before that and the one before that, that it is totally out of touch with the needs, aspirations, hopes and beliefs of the Australian people. As Mr Willis said: If Labor did not win in 1980 it faced a mammoth task in rebuilding the public sector and in convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable it to do so'. Well, it will never persuade the Australian people that that would be a desirable objective. The benefits of our policies are now becoming plain. We are determined that Australia will not go the way of other countries, strangled by bureaucracies, strangled by higher and higher taxes and strangled by governments which seek to make all decisions for all the people, leaving them no freedom for themselves. The Leader of the Opposition said that the future was miserable and dispirited. Well, it is only miserable and dispirited for him and the Labor Party, because under our policies Australia can and will have and is having economic growth unparalleled in the Western world today with higher real incomes, lower taxes than the people would have had under Labor, and with 300,000 more jobs over the last two years and lower rates of inflation. Mr Robert Brown-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister has brought in the wrong speech. I have heard this one before.",27
26,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,The honourable member for Hunter will resume his seat.,27
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"If the honourable gentleman does not like the truth, that is his business. The Government's policies provide the only way in which to achieve these objectives and to provide better care for those in need. The choice is very clear between the Government and the Opposition; the philosophies are clear between us: Labor's way of big government, socialism in the extreme, higher and higher taxes,higher and higher government spending leading to stagnation, unemployment and inflation or the Government's way, which is building a great future for Australia and for all the people of Australia.",27
28,Mr HAWKE,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"I rise to reply to the statement made by the senior spokesman for the Government, as he has come to be known. Before I deal with that in detail let me dispose of some of the canards with which he opened this horrible speech that he has inflicted upon this House today. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Frase'r) referred to the fact that there is a sense of confidence in every corner of this country. I wonder how many corners of this country this Prime Minister has gone to. Mr Katter-Time! Mr Jarman-I raise a point Of order, Mr Speaker. The clock showed that the honourable member's time had expired. It has now been adjusted.",27
29,Mr HAWKE,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"It is no wonder that honourable members are afraid; they will get all they want in 15 minutes. I wonder how many corners of this country this Prime Minister has gone to. Has he gone to those corners of the country in which the two million people living in poverty exist? Do those people have a sense of confidence in the future of this country which is now not one nation, as I said before, but two nations? What freedom do they have to determine their future? Let us put aside these hopeless assertions by this man who has created a level of two million people living in poverty in this country and come to the facts of the situation which are now before this Parliament. What are the facts? They are simply that the Prime Minister has lied to the Premiers of Australia. With his Treasurer (Mr Howard) he went into the Premiers Conference and told the Premiers unequivocally that the situation with which they were confronted was thatthat was the limit of the capacity of the Commonwealth Government of Australia to transfer funds under this vaunted new federalism from the Federal Government to the States to enable the States to undertake the face to face obligations of government to people, to ensure that Australians have the greatest opportunity of living a decent life. He told them that that was the limit of the capacity of this Government. Having lied to them, what happened? The nature of this man is that he is not capable of living with what he perceives to be a victory. He then, by the nature of his makeup, has to twist the knife and rub people's noses into the ground. So what did he do? First of all he went to his highly paid man, his hatchet man, Barnett, the man who has to spend so much of his time doing this job that last year he had an overtime bill of $29,000. This man said to these spokesmen: 'Look what our clever Prime Minister and our clever Treasurer did. The Prime Minister lied to the Premiers. They could have got another $70m'. What could they have done with the $70m in terms of looking after the people of this country? But no, we have such a clever Prime Minister that he lied to the Premiers! He told them that what they got was the maximum. Mr Barnett said that what was said by the Treasurer and what was said by the Prime Minister was not the case. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer lied and then when the lies became apparent Mr Barnett was sent out to try to stand over people to try to remedy the situation.",27
30,Mr SINCLAIR,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The honourable gentleman is constantly using the word 'lie'. It is an unparliamentary term. It is inappropriate, inaccurate and it is deliberately false. It is designed to distort the argument from the valid basis on which it should be put. I submit to you, Mr Speaker, that it is an unparliamentary expression and that it should therefore be withdrawn. Honourable members interjecting",28
31,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,I ask the House to come to order. This is a matter which has concerned me. No honourable member is entitled to cast reflections on another honourable member unless there is a specific motion which enables him to do so. The terms of this motion are not a censure on any member of the Parliament. It is in fact a motion which condemns the Government and because of the W:ly in which the motion is put I cannot permit personal attacks upon individual members of the House. I therefore ask the honourable member for Wills to cease using the term.,28
32,Mr HAWKE,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"Mr Speaker, whether deceit has been practised by this Prime Minister and this Treasurer will not necessarily be judged by the manipulated numbers in this House. A judgment on whether deception has been practised will be made by the Premiers of Australia. The Premiers of Australia will have no doubt whether deception has been practised because they were there and they were told what the limits were. Subsequently the Prime Minister told another, different story that shows that $70m which could have been made available was not made available. Let us come to the canards which are told by this Prime Minister and this Government in terms of what the philosophy is which justifies their position. In terms of their concepts, they say they are not a government of big government; they are the government of lesser government. Let us look at the facts as distinct from what they put out. Between 1972-73 and 1975-76 Commonwealth Budget receipts as a proportion of gross domestic product averaged 23.9 per cent. This was during the period of the Labor Government. The percentage has grown inexorably under this Government. Between 1976-77 and 1980-81 the amount taken by the Commonwealth Government as a proportion of gross domestic product has gone up from an average of 23.9 per cent during the period of the Labor Government to 25.8 per cent. This Government is not a government of lesser government; it is a government of less equitable government. What is the evidence of this? The evidence is clear. One should look at the Government's approach in terms of the sort of regulatory mechanism it is going to impose on this community. The Government says it is wrong to have a mechanism imposed upon industry in terms of the Prices Justification Tribunal or in terms of the Trade Practices Commission so it either abolishes these mechanisms or emasculates them. But at the same time the Government heaps upon heap the mechanisms which it imposes in the industrial relations field to the point where the Industrial Relations Bureau, this monstrosity, is maintainedagainst the advice of the employers,. against the advice of the trade union movement, against the advice of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and against the advice of his own Minister who has just resigned because he could not stand the stench of this Government. This is the living proof that this is not a government committed to smaller or lesser government. As I said before, it is a goverrtment which can be properly described only as a government of the privileged, by the privileged and for the privileged. What do we find in terms of this new federalism? We are told by the Prime Minister that it wi II create a new co-operative relationship with the States. In fact, what has happened under the Prime Minister is that we have reached a situation where he will not make all that is available from Commonwealth revenues to the States. He gives them misguided information. In fact, the situation has been reached where this morning the Premier of Queensland described the action of the Prime Minister as malicious and misleading. Why does the Premier of Queensland say this about the Prime Minister? The reason is that the Government says one thing and practises another. Has the Prime Minister in any way attempted to meet the charges made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen)? There is no way in which that has been done. Has the Prime Minister met the charge? This is the crucial and critical point. The charge is that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have deliberately misled the Premiers of the States on basic issues regarding federalism on what moneys will be available to provide services to the people of this country. As a result of that misleading, the Premiers have departed from the presence of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and returned to their States. They are currently undertaking an examination of what additional taxes and imposts they will have to place upon the people of Australia to continue to provide services which will enable people to lead decent lives. I ask: Can a more fundamental charge be made against the morality and integrity of a government? This is a government which on one hand says there must be honesty and truth in relations and then on the other hand enters into negotiations in which it is not prepared to tell the truth in regard to these fundamental matters which determine how the economy of this country will operate and how the welfare of its people will be determined. Is it any wonder that what we are witnessing today is a disintegration of government? The sacrifices being made under this Government are not sacrifices by the Prime Minister but sacrifices which he has imposed on others. The back benches of this Parliament and the chanceries of this world are littered with those people sacrificed by the Prime Minister. They have been sacrificed because, as has been said, he is possessed of a manic determination to get his own way.",28
33,Mr YOUNG,FRASER GOVERNMENT,No Country Party members have been sacrificed.,29
34,Mr HAWKE,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"No Country Party members have been sacrificed. Of course it is one rule for poor subservient members of the Liberal Party. They must toe the line. If in any way they try to express an opinion they are for the high jump. If the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) preempts a Cabinet decision about Trans-Australia Airlines that, of course, is all right. If the for Communications (Mr Sinclair) wants to say something about what should happen there is no question of control applying to leading members of the National Country Party; they are immune. Why are they immune? They are immune because they represent to the Prime Minister a manifestation of his conception of what this country should be about. Clearly, it is a concept, as I said, of two classes of people-the privileged who will have their privileges maintained and increased, and against that an increasing number of people whose opportunity for a decent life will be pressed further and further into the ground. Is it any accident that after five years of Fraserism and this sort of government there has been a doubling of the number of people living in poverty? Mr Jarman- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Is it in order for the honourable member for Hawker to be reading a newspaper while his future leader is speaking?",29
35,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,Order! There is no point of order.,29
36,Mr HAWKE,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"We can see how worried they are when they try to consume time in that way. The fact that the number of people who are living in poverty in this country has doubled is not an accident. It is the result of the deliberate implementation of policies calculated by this Prime Minister to produce that result. It does not happen by accident. These things happen because governments do not provide services to people-they do not provide services to the poor, the unemployed, the underprivileged, the Aboriginals and the people who depend on legal aid. Those sorts of things come about only because governments provide them, but State governments can provide them only if they are provided with the maximum amount of money which will enable them to do these things and if the Federal Government has its priorities right. In regard to the first element, we have seen this week-it stands unrefuted by the statement of the Prime Minister-the situation in which the Prime Minister has not told the truth, in which he has withheld money from the States. That is money which, under the management of this Federal Government, will not be used to do the jobs which need to be done in order, as the Prime Minister said in opening his speech, to give a sense of confidence in every corner of this country. If we are to look after the people of this country, economic management has to be carried out in a way that produces that result. Let us finally nail this misrepresentation that Minister under the economic management of the Prime Minister and this Government we have produced marvellous results. Very simply, the fact is that in the period of this Government the economic performance of Australia vis-a-vis the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, has been significantly worse in terms of growth and in terms of inflation. The facts are on record. The average rate of growth in Australia in the period 1976 to 1979 was 2.8 per cent. That was the performance in this country. What was the OECD average? It was 4 per cent. The figure was significantly less in this country than in the OECD. What was the inflation performance? Inflation in Australia was 11 per cent and the OECD average was 8.5 per cent. So, in the period 1976 to 1979 the Government failed in terms of growth performance and it failed in terms of inflation performance. It has produced that result because of this concept that it will not deal honestly with the economics of this country. At this Government's level of control it does not deal honestly; but, it has reached the bottom of the barrel now when it lies and tells untruths and deceives its own kind. It deceived Liberal Premiers. It deceived Sir Charles Court and it deceived Bjelke-Petersen.",29
37,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired.,30
38,Mr HOWARD,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"1 would like in the first part of my remarks to deal with what I believe to be the central issue in this debate and, most particularly, the central issue of the events of the past 48 hours. That is the proposition that in some way the Commonwealth Government has robbed the States of approximately $70m. It is a charge that 1 can understand. I can understand why it has been made in the circumstances of the past 48 hours but during this debate, because I regard that issue as being absolutely crucial to the credibility of what has been said by the Opposition and to the merits of this debate, I want to examine the approach of the Commonwealth to the Premiers Conference in its proper perspective. All of us know-none better than people who sit on the Opposition front benches-that in any discussion or in negotiation the people negotiating on behalf of the parties have a certain capacity and a certain flexibility. They are not sent to the negotiating table with one, and one only, instruction. They are given guidance. They are told what is the ambit of their authority and are given guidance as to what they should do. The truth is that the Federal Cabinet gave to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and me, as the Cabinet has done on the occasion of earlier Premiers Conferences, authority to make a decision on the day of the Conference as to the final amount that should be given. That fact cannot be stressed too much. We were not told, when the Cabinet took its decision, that we had to give the States the same in real terms plus absorption. We were told that under no circumstances should we go beyond that figure, that we should make an assessment on the day in the light of economic circumstances and budgetary considerations as to the appropriate amount. For it to be suggested in those circumstances that we have in some way robbed the States and that we have in some way deceived them is totally to misrepresent and to misunderstand the nature of a conference such as this. It is a total misunderstanding of the nature of Cabinet giving to Ministers a general authority and a total misunderstanding of what happened on the day of that Conference. As I have already indicated, at that Conference negotiations started on the basis of there being an offer by the Commonwealth of 8 per cent plus absorption. After very lengthy discussion that figure was increased by an amount of approximately $27m as a result of a decision on the part of the Commonwealth-a decision which was taken by the Prime Minister and me in consultation with the other five Ministers who were present at the Conference. That decision was to increase the amount by $27m by providing to the States of South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria a sufficient additional supplement so that their total increase would not be less than 8 per cent, thus increasing the overall amount to about 8+ per cent. After dinner and after lengthy discussion between the seven Commonwealth Ministers, it was decided to increase the amount. I repeat that that decision was taken only after that lengthy discussion. It was not a unanimous discussion. As everyone would expect, dilTering points of view were expressed in this discussion. It was decided to increase that amount to 9 pel' cent plus absorption. I regard that as an entirely proper, predictable and justifiable procedure for the Commonwealth to take at a conference such as this. To suggest that this is a procedure that in some way robs the States, deceives the States and is in some way dishonour able on the part of the Commonwealth is to misunderstand the nature of these types of negotiations. We indicated very clearly throughout the entirety of. the Conference just precisely what our position was. Therefore, 1 want to emphasise as powerfully as I can that the proposition that in some way the States have been robbed of $70m is a proposition without substance. We are not, as the Prime Minister and others have said during this debate, talking about whether it is the States' money or the Commonwealth's money. We are talking about it being the money of the taxpayers of Australia. We were given authority by our Cabinet colleagues. We were not given a direction. The central thing about the Cabinet authority that was given to the Prime Minister and me-it has to be repeated again and again-was that a decision as to the final amount to be offered to the States should be made at the Conference in the light of budgetary and economic circumstances that existed at the time. That was the decision that was taken by the seven Commonwealth Ministers who were present at the Conference, including the Prime Minister and me. We have heard a great deal over recent years from many Premiers around Australia that the problem with Premiers Conferences is that the Commonwealth goes to them with a fixed position, that the Commonwealth is not prepared to move and is not prepared to listen to argument. They suggest that we might as well send the Premiers a letter or a telex with the result. It has been suggested that the Conferences at no stage evince any Cabinet flexibility or willingness to move. On this occasion we demonstrated a flexibility. We demonstrated a capacity to move. We demonstrated a willingness to listen to argument. In those circumstances, for it to be suggested around Australia now by Premiers on both sides of the fence that in some way we have not handled this thing properly is a complete misunderstanding of the situation. In reality, what we have done is to conduct a negotiation in the manner that has been urged upon us time and again by the Premiers all around Australia. I find that an odd circumstance. I find it an odd charge and I find it a complete understanding of the nature of the Premiers Conferences. We negotiated within our mandate. We were not given-",30
39,Mr SCHOLES,FRASER GOVERNMENT,The Commonwealth will never have a negotiating position again.,31
40,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,I warn the honourable member for Corio. The House will come to order. I am not prepared to allow this continual noise. When an honourable member has the call he is entitled to be heard.,31
41,Mr HOWARD,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"We were not given an instruction to give that additional $70m. For it to be suggested that the States have been in any way robbed of that money is a complete distortion of the circumstance and a complete misunderstanding of the nature of Premiers Conferences. Throughout the course of this debate criticism has been made of the federalism policies of this Government. Let me remind the House and in particular the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) that when the tax sharing arrangements were first negotiated in 1976 it was always contemplated that there would be a review of those tax sharing arrangements after they had been in operation foraniumber of years. There was never any commitment that the arrangements made then would be continued in perpetuity to the letter. To suggest otherwise is to misread the nature of those arrangements and the proposition that was entered into at that time. I reject charges that the Commonwealth has abrogated the arrangement made in 1976. We have not abrogated the arrangement made in 1976. The States wanted a review of the tax sharing arrangements as much as the Commonwealth did. No Premier was more vocal than the, Premier of New South Wales in wanting a review of the tax sharing arrangmcnts. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought to know that.",31
42,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FRASER GOVERNMENT,What about Sir Charles Court?,31
43,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,31
44,Mr HOWARD,FRASER GOVERNMENT,Mr SPEAKER - ,31
45,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,The Treasurer will resume his seat. I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that he spoke to the motion which is before the House. He seconded the motion. I ask him now to hear the speaker from the other side.,31
46,Mr HOWARD,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"During this debate the Opposition has talked a great deal about economic conmis- ditions in Australia. In my concluding moments I would like to say a few things about economic conditions in Australia. I remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Wills spent most of their speeches talking about economic conditions in Australia. I point out to the House how absurd it is for those gentlemen to talk in those terms in the face of the economic performance of this country at the present time. Let us talk about the growth rates of Australia compared with those of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Let us talk about the fact that non-farm product in this country is rising by about 4 per cent this year against a Budget prediction of 3t per cent. Let us talk about the fact that fixed private sector capital investment will rise by about 20 per cent in real terms this financial year. Let us talk about the fact that this country is the envy of the industrialised world so far as overseas investment is concerned. Let us talk about the fact that the inflation rate of this country is significantly below the average of the industrialised world. Let us talk about the fact that businessmen all around Australia have renewed confidence and expectations about the economic future of Australia. Finally-Mr Charles J ones--I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Let us talk about the leak.",31
47,Mr SPEAKER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,There is no point of order.,32
48,Mr HOWARD,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"Finally, as the hour approaches 12 o'clock and the time comes for me to conclude my remarks, let us talk about the unemployment figures that will become public in five minutes time. The figures will show the best performance in the area of unemployment for many years.",32

56,Mr SINCLAIR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The Sydney Morning Herald of 4 May made the following comment: Mr Ian Sinclair is refusing knew Australia continued to breach an international trade agreement by selling cheap milk powlier. On 27 February 1981 I received a letter from Senator Peter Rae, Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, in which he set down particulars of some evidence received by that Committee and asked for my comments on it. I responded to that letter on 16 March and then on 22 April 1981. I further reponded in the following way: NOES Dear Senator Rae, The letter under your hand as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations Peacock, A. S. dated 25th March, 1981, has been received. My response to your earlier correspondence of the 16th Rocher, A. C. March, 1981, was written as a Minister in accordance with the several Oaths taken relating to that office. My comments were based on my own recollection and supported by Departmental records and my Ministerial diaries. In my letter of 16 March 1981 I set down in considerable detail my response to Senator Rae's letter which was dated 27 February 1981. As my letter stated, the detail was in accordance with my White, P. N. D. own recollection and was written as a Minister of the Crown. I have now received a further letter from Senator Rae dated 6 May 1981 in which he comments, inter alia: .Notice of Motion Nevertheless, we are left with the dilemma that sworn evidence was given to the Committee which is contradicted only by an unsworn letter from you. In your letter dated 22 April 1981 you stated the written evidence you gave to the Committee by letter dated 16 March 1981 was given as a 'Minister in accordance with the several Oaths taken relating to that office'. From our examination of the oaths taken by Ministers we are unable to see any declaration that would place written evidence given by a Minister on the same basis as sworn evidence. I do not believe it appropriate that a Minister of Government to revoke these illthis House should appear and give sworn evidence before a committee of the other House. Therefore, I make this statement with respect to the evidence that I have tendered to that Committee in the Parliament and, of course, in accordance with my responsibilities to this Parliament. I believe that is the correct and proper form by which I can respond to the honourable senator. I assert to that honourable gentleman and to the members of the Senate Committee that I believe the evidence given to them is totally correct and has the substance of my being a Minister and giving it in this place. I do not believe there is any reason for a statutory declaration to be given to confirm formal correspondence entered into by me as a Minister in this place.",33
57,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence. I do not wish to cast any reflection upon the Minister to put on oath his denial that he for Communications (Mr Sinclair). Often it is very difficult for Senate committees to understand that they cannot get evidence from Ministers of the Crown. It would be in the. interests of the Parliament and the Minister if he made a statement indicating where the evidence given is in conflict and why. Then everybody in both Houses would know the position.",33
58,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,No doubt that proposal has been heard by the right honourable gentleman. I granted him indulgence to make a personal explanation. He stated why he did not make a statutory declaration. My ruling is that that ends that matter. I have no doubt that the points raised by the honourable gentleman would have been heard by the right honourable gentleman.

GRIEVANCE DEBAT.E 35-Hour Working Week-Public Service: Staff Ceilings-Passports-Campbelltown City Council-Telephone Service in Shoalhaven Area Question proposed: That grievances be noted.,33
59,Mr COHEN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"A few weeks ago this House was debating the 35-hour week. Unfortunately I was not able to speak in that debate. Today I want to suggest to the House a way in which the 35-hour week can be introduced into at least one part of the economy to the satisfaction of the whole communityemployers, workers and consumers. I ask the honourable members to listen patiently to what I have to say and not to close their minds and reject the proposals until they have considered them carefully. I want to talk about one sector of the economy-retailing, because that is one area with which I am fully familiar. The House is aware that for over 20 years I have been involved in retailing in men's and ladies' fashion on the North Shore of Sydney. Before becoming a member of Parliament I was the full time manager of a business and since 1969 I have retained my interest in that business; so I am sure that the House will accept that I have sufficient experience to speak with some authority. I am sure that everyone would be aware of the controversy that has surrounded not only the question of the 35-hour week but also the question of extended shopping hours, in particular, Saturday afternoon shopping. What surprises me in this debate is that the proposals I am about to put forward have not, to the best of my knowledge, been suggested before. Let me first of all summarise the different views of the three groups involved in the debate. The attitude of employers varies. One view is that they should be allowed to trade when they wish and if they could have extended shopping hours the consumers would spend more, thus increasing the general prosperity. Consumer spending has been sluggish in recent years. The employers argue that if consumers had extended shopping hours, particularly on the weekend, they would spend more. The argument that retailers wish to open only to give better service is in my view nonsense. The reason--there should be no need to apologise for that--is that they would hope to sell more. Undoubtedly, consumers would get better service with extended shopping hours, but that surely is not the motive. Increased turnover and profitability is a perfectly legitimate goal in a free enterprise society and retailers should not be coy about saying so. Other retailers argue against extended shopping hours because they claim that the consumer has so much to spend irrespective of the time available. They argue that opening their shops for longer periods would simply increase overheads, particularly wages, without any commensurate increase in turnover. The result, they believe, would be reduced profitability and reduced leisure, particularly for small shop keepers who incidentally provide the vast majority of retail outlets. To maintain profitability they would have to increase margins, thus passing the costs on to the consumer. Let us look at extended shopping hours from an employee's point of view. The average retail shop is open from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., five days a week, one evening a week from 5.30 p.m. to 9 p.m. and Saturday morning from 8.30 a.m. until 12 noon although conditions vary from State to State and within States. Shops are open for almost 50 hours. Shop assistants work a 40-hour week. They also rarely ever get a full weekend off. Unlike the rest of the community, they are unable to go away for a weekend. That is the great disadvantage that most retail employees have. From the consumers' point of view, the majority of the work force is at work at the same time the shops are open. With the exception of their lunch hour, Saturday morning and one evening a week the opportunity to shop leisurely is severely restricted. For most people whose place of work is a distance from shopping centres, the only opportunity to shop is on Saturday morning or one evening a week. These are the times when shops are crowded and shopping becomes a very tortuous experience. The consumers rightly ask the question: 'Why can't shops be open at times when we are not at work?' This debate has gone on in this country for decades without any resolution. Some years ago one night a week shopping was introduced in most States and this has at least lieved some of the pressure that occurred on Saturday morning. I recently took out some figures from my own business to ascertain the pattern of retail shopping hours for men's and ladies' wear. The figures were taken over many months and it was fascinating to observe the incredible consistency in the figures. Let me run through the men's wear figures: Monday 12 per cent, Tuesday 8 per cent, Wednesday 11 per cent, Thursday 26 per cent, Friday 14 per cent and Saturday 29 per cent. There are only 3t hours for shopping on Saturday. The figures for ladies' wear are: Monday 7 per cent, Tuesday 17 per cent, Wednesday 15 per cent, Thursday 25 per cent, Friday 19 per cent and Saturday 17 per cent. The important point is that the figures for Thursday were accounted for during the period between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. In other words, 61 per cent of women's wear and 69 per cent of men's wear was sold on Thursday, Thursday evening, Friday and Saturday morning. A more detailed analysis revealed that approximately 40 per cent of women's wear and 50 per cent of men's wear was purchased on Thursday night and Saturday morning; in other words, 50 per cent of the turnover was done in 10 per cent of the shopping hour time available-the hours when shops were open and factories were closed. I am fully aware that men's clothing would probably be one of the most sought after goods in the after-hours period. Friday, and to a lesser gree, Saturday are the big food shopping days. However, from discussions I have had with many other retailers who sell different merchandise I can assure the House that most stores take between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of their turnover during those five to six extra hours day night and Saturday morning. My experience is solely in suburban stores. We must be conscious of the fact that there has been and will continue be a major shift in retail shopping from the central business districts in the cities to the suburban shopping centres as occurred during the 1960s and 1970s: If I have been a little long-winded in coming to my suggested changes please forgive me, but it is important to understand fully the background to what I propose. My proposition is that retail shops should open until 4 p.m. on Saturday afternoon and close all day Monday and that on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday mornings they open at 9.30 a.m. Little or no business is done in the first hour that shops are open. Let me now detail the benefits to all sectors of the community. In the case of the employers, re- there is a slight reduction in overheads and also increased leisure. That is important for small shop keepers. The big advantages, however, for small shop keepers would be the Monday when warehouses, offices, banks would be open and their shops closed. It is a major problem for most small shop keepers to find the time to study properly ranges of goods and to see their accountants, their bank managers and their suppliers without spending valuable time away from their shops. A full day to do the 101 chores that need to be done outside the store would be a godsend to most small retailers. In the case of the employees, the benefits would be enormous. Every weekend would be a full two days off, enabling them to go away if they wished from late Saturday afternoon at 4 o'clock until Tuesday morning. The working week could be 35 hours without any problem. The greatest advantage to employees would be the convenience of enjoying the beach, sporting facilities, restaurants and tourist resorts on Monday when they are not as crowded as they normally are on Saturday and Sunday. This would also be mutually beneficial to the recreation industry which finds Monday a very quiet day. One further idea that might be feasible-it has been suggested to me-is the idea that the central business district, that is, the city proper which I am told has suffered a very profound fall-off in Saturday morning shopping since the shift to the de- suburbs during the past 20 years, should not open at all on Saturday but remain open on Monday. This then would enable suburban shop assistants and employers to shop individually or as a family in the city. So, we would have, in fact, six days for shopping but a different five days in the city on Thurs- proper to the five in the suburbs. Finally, let us look at the advantages to the conto sumer. The consumer would gain an extra four hours shopping on Saturday afternoon. This may not appear much, but on the figures that I provided earlier, illustrating that between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of retail shopping is done on Thursday evening, Friday and Saturday morning, the extra four hours, is, in effect, an increase of 33 per cent 011 the peak shopping period. I have given this matter much thought over many years. I have discussed it with shop assistants, retailers and customers. I have always found that 99 per cent of people agree and say: 'Well, why hasn't it been done? It seems the sensible thing to do'. I ask that this at least be given serious consideration and that the matter at least be the subject of discussion and debate. Why not at least try it for a trial period? Finally, let me say that 1 disagree completely with the suggestion that the Government proposed last week to deregulate completely shopping hours in Canberra. We need regulation to prevent overheads soaring, increased costs, reduced leisure, both to the employee and the employer-I might add that I know what it is like never to have a weekend off-and the exploitation of shop assistants. It is unfortunate that that does occur in some cases. The idea that the consumer should be able to buy something 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is nonsense and unrealistic. Let us give the consumer a better deal with Saturday afternoon shopping, the shop assistants 35 hours a week, a full weekend off every week and the retailer more profitability and more leisure.",34
60,Mr ADERMANN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"Last week in this House the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made a statement on actions proposed pursuant to the deliberations and investigations of the committee for the Review of Commonwealth Functions. I accept that the result sought is economic growth, more jobs, higher incomes and a better life for all. I accept too the commitment to smaller government and the view that the Government should avoid excessive intrusion into the individual's rights and opportunities to make his own choices and set his own goals and priorities. I welcome too the philosophy of returning to State and local government responsibilities and administration which properly ought to repose there, and a commencement on the removal of the wasteful, inefficient duplication and overlap. I too enjoin the States to address themselves to a similar review, because restraint, efficiency and resistance of bureaucratic topheaviness is no less necessary in State government and could produce considerable benefits. One of the discernible consequences of the Whitlam Labor Government was an explosive growth in the public sector with remarkable growth in departments and in the Public Service. The legacy of those policies in instability, destrucwill tion of confidence in the private sector, inflation and unemployment have been clearly seen and many times clearly exposed in the Parliament. Thus the restraints in staff ceilings and the actions taken by the Government to contain this bureaucratic monolith have been well intentioned. The Prime Minister has indicated that the reduction or abolition of functions and changes outlined could lead to a total reduction in staffing of 16,000 to 17,000. I want to comment on that aspect and highlight some very real concern that I feel not about the goal but about the progress to that goal. The growth in the Public Service was observed at all levels, all divisions and all classifications. New departments had emerged with their traditional pyramid of power and personnel. It has not only been a growth in clerks and officers at the lower level but also a growth in the Second Division in assistant secretaries, first assistant secretaries and the whole range of positions. At these higher levels, each with its own service staff, secretaries, clerks and advisers, the growth has been equally discerned. But I am most concerned that when staff ceilings are set and retrenchments are made so often the cuts and retrenchments are at the lower end of the scale. The top half of the pyramid, which determines the numbers in the lower echelon who should be dispensed with, is relatively undisturbed. The structure remains and the basis exists and can proliferate again if the Government relaxes its restraint. What is the result which unfortunately manifests itself in a purely arbitrary reduction in staff ceilings? Unfortunately, for all the Government's intention otherwise, it can be service and help to the public which suffer. At the lower level we can see fewer personnel in local social security offices and Commonwealth Employment Service offices and fewer nursing staff in repatriation hospitals-in short, at the level where services and assistance are dispensed to the public and to the taxpayers who provide the salaries of the Public Service. This does happen and I believe it has happened. Higher up the scale we hear complaints that staff ceilings are preventing provision of information and services, yet the peaceful waters at those levels often do not exhibit a ripple. I agree with the Government's aims to contain and reduce the public sector, and I realise that unless we maintain that course we cannot hope to obtain economic stability and give the private sector room to move, to grow and to provide jobs. But the Government cannot sit back and say that its aim of 16,000 or 17,000 fewer public servants be attained-or, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) is reported as saying 16,000 or 17,000 fewer snouts at the trough-and just hope that the Public Service will reorganise itself into that new structure. My concern is where and how the reductions will be achieved. Will they be only or almost entirely at the lower levels or will there be very close supervision which will ensure that we will not achieve a smaller though very top-heavy and inefficient structure? Will the people who rely on the services and who should benefit from the reduction in bureaucratic growth and controls suffer frustration, reduced effiencies and services? I accept that there is a capacity and a desirability to achieve the sorts of reductions the Prime Minister envisaged. Otherwise the Government and the Committee need not have bothered to initiate such a review but could have let instability and inflation have their day. What I want to stress, ad nauseam if honourable members like, is that the task has not ended; it has just begun. The Government can and must maintain service and consideration to the community, and it can do that only if restructuring, efficiencies and restraints cover the whole spectrum of the bureaucracy. If we have just as many chiefs with just as many secretaries, advisers and comforters and 16,000 or 17,000 fewer nurses, counter officers, social workers and helpers, then we have a disaster. If pensioners are inconvenienced, if their cheques are delayed or misplaced and if their opportunities to get help from the local and regional offices diminishes, then we arrive at an undesirable goal. I believe those services, that help and compassion, can remain and even improve with the reductions which are envisaged, but not if the chief remains and the braves are sacrificed and not if the reductions are at the service level only and not in the top administration also. My injunction to the Government is not to leave it to the Public Service to work out a fair tribution of staff. If that is the course we are to take then we will get reduced services and efficiencies and moans from the top echelon about unfair staff ceilings. Where the Government should receive commendation, it will receive odium and condemnation ifthat is the mechanism employed. This is a task for the Government, a task for each of its Ministers, individually and lectively, to implement. That magnifying glass, that review, that examination and that restructuring must equally be focused at the top of the pyramid. The base of the pyramid can diminish in size only if the apex is reduced. There have been substantial benefits from the reduction of the size of the bureaucracy, but the benefits should have and could have been considerably greater. At times services have been affected because of the arbitrary nature of the cuts. Thus I can only endorse and not criticise the aim to reduce the bureaucratic monster. The goal has been announced and the underlying philosophy is very sound. However, the path to its achievement is crucial and its effectiveness is dependent on the path that we take. I know that there will be compassion and understanding; but, as I say, let us be sure that we do not end up with 17,000 fewer at the base and an unchanged number in the Second Division. The Government has put a sound proposition to Parliament. The review has been thorough and painstaking, and the goal can be realised. But the Government's task is equally to oversee and restructure the pyramid as it was to identify the goal. That implementation is a job for government, not just a sloughing off of the blokes at the lower levels of the Service by the chaps in the big chairs at the top. If the Government proceeds on the course that I advocate it will have the unqualified support of everyone on this side of the House and the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. So much else of the program put by the Prime Minister to the Parliament-for example, the elimination of duplication, inefficiencies and waste-hinges on how the bureaucracy is restructured. That restructuring cannot be delegated, it must personally be implemented by every Minister in the department which he heads and for which he is responsible. Then it can be done, it should be done and it must be done. They are hard options. They cannot be shirked or we will slide back into the dark valley which we have begun to climb out of.",36
61,Mr MILDREN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"Whilst I disagree with the general position taken by the honourable member for Fisher '(Mr Adermann), I must say that I applaud his sentiments about the service to the public. My concern is that the dis- measures which the Government is undertaking will result in a decrease in that service and a diminishing of its quality. This is germaine to the points I want to make today. I draw to the attention of the House a matter which has caused and which is continuing to cause considerable anxiety, annoyance, frustration and inconvenience to a large number of people in my col- electorate of Ballarat and, I suggest, to an even greater number of people in other parts of the country. I refer to the problems experienced by people applying for passports to travel outside this country. They include travellers, the travel agents who are attempting to service them, businessmen and a great number of all sorts of other people who under normal circumstances would not have to suffer the inconvenience of waiting many weeks, as they do today. From my inquiries it appears that there is some discrepancy between the statements emanating from the passport office of the Department of Foreign Affairs and those emanating from the clients. According to the Department, the current time for applications to be processed and issued is something like two weeks for applications made across the counter and about 25 days for application made by mail. According to the experience of travel agents and people who have come to see me a five week delay would be considered a short period. That is not two weeks. This delay does affect a large number of people who are planning trips. One agent indicated that the norm for the issuance of a passport would be closer to eight weeks. In fact, the other day, I received word from a person who had to wait nine weeks to be issued with a passport. Of course, this is something which is quite intolerable. There appears to have been a breakdown in the system somewhere. A lot of people, many of whom have not travelled before and who were looking forward to their trips, have developed considerable anxiety and have experienced disruption not only to their plans for leaving this country but also to the plans the'y have made for visits to other countries. In fact, I heard of one instance the other day of one intending traveller having to cancel his trip as a result of these delays. Many of the people affected include those intending to visit families overseas and, as I said, people conducting business and people who are going on well-earned trips, many of whom have waited for many years until they retired to make those trips. Some of these trips have been aborted, truncated or in some ways upset. It IS difficult to have to postpone a flight. People who book on advance purchase excursion fares find themselves inconvenienced. Some people have had to shorten their journeys or, as I said, cancel them because of what would appear to be a process of neglect. I do not know whether this process is deliberate but, certainly, it is a process of neglect by the Government in this crucial area of the Public Service. Some direct effects relate to 1981, but certainly not just to 1981. I think one has to look at an earlier period to see where the rot began. Early in 1981 a new form was introduced for completion by passport applicants. This again caused considerable concern to people. I know this from personal experience. People came to my office requesting me to complete their forms because they were concerned about the complexity of the form. At the same time a new machine was introduced in the passport office supposedly to streamline the process. But the personnel issuing the passports were not familiar with how the machine operated. This slowed down the process. Then the normal seasonal fall-off in demand for passports over the Christmas period did not occur in 1980. So, the normal catch-up period did not eventuate. The culmination of those factors led to a serious backlog in the processing of applications. Until 1975 the processing of passport applications was handled by the Department of Immigration. Thereafter that matter was taken over by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The demand for passports since 1975 has risen by 50 per cent. But the Department of Foreign Affairs still has the same number of staff, to a large degree, handling applications in the same way as the Department of Immigration did at that time. In response to numerous complaints and a submission by the Department of Foreign Affairs-God bless the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) who is sitting at the table-the Public Service Board provided some additional staff in Melbourne and Sydney. I understand that IS additional staff were provided in Melbourne and six additional staff were provided in Sydney. However, these are temporary staff. No new permanent staff have been allocated. The temporary staff can be expected to leave when the demand falls off. The Government's decision concerning the requirements [or travellers to and from New Zealand to hold passports or visas is expected to lead to a new rush on passport applications when that provision comes into effect in July this year. I ask honourable members to bear in mind the backlog of applications which already exists. The Department of Foreign Affairs has said that the situation has improved significantly. I have already referred to the discrepancies between the stories of the Department and the clients. I have been putting the stories of the clients but, of course, we must consider the Department's story also. The Department says that the situation has improved significantly and the waiting time for passports is now two weeks only for over-thecounter applications and 25 days for those applications made by mail. It is always unfortunate, I think, when people have to stand up in this House and berate the Government. Yet, because of events of recent days one has to bring to the attention of the people of this country some of the underlying causes of this sort of neglect. Perhaps we have seen the culmination of the Government's pursuit of a particular ideology over the last week or fortnight. Action taken in 1975 and measures introduced since then have led to the present situation. The high priests of this neo-Benthamite religion of Milton Friedman, so liberally spread as they are through this Government they are spread all over the place this morning-intone their monotonous and somwhat monstrous incantations with mesmeric effects upon their fellows. That is evident from what took place this morning. The principal symbol of their religion is small government. But small government is neither synonymous with nor sufficient for nor a substitute for good government. The Government stands condemned for its failure to provide trained personnel in the Department of Foreign Alfairs to ensure that the legitimate needs of the public are met.",37
62,Mr BAUME,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) and I have today issued a joint statement condemning the brutal bashing of the town planner of the Campbelltown City Council by standover thugs wh? are trying to force the Council to give up its action to prevent a brothel from operating in Iolanthe Street, Campbelltown. The mayor of Campbelltown and aldermen-my friends and colleagues right across the political spectrumhave been subjected to continuing telephone threats by criminals involved in the brothel business. I warn these thugs that any attempt to threaten democratically elected representatives in this way strikes at the very heart of the democratic process and that the people of Australia will not tolerate it. None of us elected to represent the people of this area will bow to this kind of thuggery. In the minute remaining I say briefly that tomorrow at 6 a.m., 12,000 subscribers in the Shoalhaven telephone area will gain full access to the subscriber trunk dialling service of the Australian telephone system when the new $3m Nowra telephone exchange begins operations. I am overjoyed that this is taking place at this time because there was a time when some pressure existed for this project to be deferred. I am very grateful indeed to two former Ministers for Telecommunications, the late Eric Robinson and the now retired Tony Staley, and the former chairman of Telecom Australia, Mr Bob Somervaille, who agreed to my strong representations that this project go ahead earlier than scheduled. I am grateful because Nowra now has full access to the STD service instead of having, as I understand it, the oldest telephone exchange of any large city in Australia. I am grateful to Telecom for all the work it has done. I am grateful particularly to the people who had charge of providing a service under the old and very tired exchange systemthe Telecom operators, the technicians and the trunk call operators in the exchange. For years they have struggled to provide an adequate service to the people of my electorate.",39

In accordance with Standing Order 106 the debate is interrupted. 1 put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. VOTING RIGHTS FOR MIGRANTS -! Ministerial Statement,39
64,Mr MACPHEE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"by leave-I take .this opportunity to report to the House on discussions with State and Northern Territory Ministers about the eligibility for the franchise of new settlers. This matter has been discussed among Ministers responsible for immigration and ethnic affairs matters regularly for the past two years or so. At our last meeting which was held on 14 and 15 April 1981 agreement was reached on the following: (1) Migrants, irrespective of their country of origin should be treated equally in relation to requirements to enrol, on their right to vote at elections for parliament and to nominate as a candidate for election to parliament; (2) Australian citizenship is the appropriate basis for the franchise; (3) No person currently enrolled as an elector should be disenfranchised; (4) Uniform legislation to give effect to the foregoing should be enacted by the Commonwealth and all States. In addition, all Ministers agreed that it would be appropriate to introduce the new arrangements from 1 January 1982 but this is subject to confirmation by respective governments. Honourable members will be aware that under existing legislation British subjects may enrol and vote after six months residence in \ustralia whereas other migrants must attain Australian citizenship-involving a minimum residence period of three years-before they are entitled to enrol and vote. In the interests of clarity, it should be noted that the term 'British subject' includes citizens of most former British colonies. T seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of 42 countries whose citizens are British subjects and entitled to vote under existing laws after six months residence in Australia. Honourable members will note that the list runs from the Bahamas and Bangladesh to Zambia and Zimbabwe. Of course, some former British colonies removed themselves from the Commonwealth and their people from British subject status but the majority remained and retained that status. Leave granted. The document read as followsList of countries to which the status of British subject is applied under the Australian Citizenship ACT: Bahamas; Bangladesh; Barbados; Botswana; Canada; Cyprus; Dominica; Fiji; The Gambia; Ghana; Grenada; Guyana; India; Jamaica; Kenya; Kiribati; Lesotho; Malawi; Malaysia; Malta; Mauritius; Nauru; NQw Zealand; Nigeria; Papua New Guinea; Saint Siera Leone; Singaporer; Solomon Islands; Sri Lanka; Swaziland; Tanzania; Tonga; Trinidad and Tobago; Tuvalu; Uganda; United Kingdom and Colonies; Western Samoa; Zambia and Zimbabwe.",39
65,Mr MACPHEE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"The removal of the anomaly between British subjects and other migrants was recommended by the Report of the Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services for Migrants more widely known as the Galbally report. When this report was tabled in the Parliament in May 1978 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced the Government's acceptance of all of its recommendations. The report in this respect stated: We observe that while migrants who are British subjects are eligible to vote after residence non-British migrants must become citizens by naturalisation before they are eligible to ommend that anomalies in voting rights be resolved and that all migrants be placed on an equal footing in their voting rights. Following the Galbally report an interdepartmental committee examined and reported on voting rights. After examination of that report by Cabinet I discussed this question with my State and Territory counterparts at a conference of Ministers in Darwin in 1980. It was agreed at that conference that Ministers would seek the reactions of their respective Cabinets and report back at the next conference which was held in April 1981. At that conference last month, Ministers expressed strong support for the changes I have just foreshadowed. I emphasise that the changes will not, of themselves, confer a right to vote upon any further categories of people. The only group of migrants affected by the changes will be British subjects-that is people who are not Australian citizens-who have not enrolled before the end of 1981. In future, British subjects will not be entitled to enrol unless they become Australian citizens. I should also emphasise that the changes will not disenfranchise anyone. After 1 January 1982 or such other date as the governments might decide all persons currently enrolled will be obliged by law to remain on the electoral rolls and to vote at elections. However, after that date, of those persons not enrolled, only Australian citizens will be entitled and required to enrol and vote. One of the options considered by Ministers was that British subjects already enrolled should be permitted to take themselves off the roll. Ministers decided that this option should not be adopted. As a consequence, compulsory enrolment and voting will continue for all those who are now on the roll and who will in future be eligible to be on the roll. The introduction of these changes will constitute a further milestone in the social and political development of Australia. The Lucia; Saint Vincent; Seychelles; changes reflect the cultural diversity of modern Australia and its independent identity. The term 'British subject' is included in many Commonwealth and State Acts, apart from electorallegislation. I am informed that it is now used only by the United Kingdom and Australia and that the United Kingdom is moving to adopt other approaches. It is fitting, therefore, that Australian legislation be re-examined as well. In most countries, the primary condition for obtaining the franchise is citizenship. Comparison with other countries, however, should not be taken too far because Australian law obliges all eligible voters to enrol and to vote. This is not the situation in many countries. in Australia for six months, Australia's franchise for British subjects vote in Federal elections. We recwithout citizenship is associated with our origins as a series of British colonies. Indeed, before 26 January 1949 when Australian citizenship was introduced all Australians were British subjects. That term described a common or shared status of citizenship of the Commonwealth of Nations. In the 1940s, each of these nations introduced its own citizenship but retained strong links with other Commonwealth nations by granting each of its citizens the status of a British subject. In Australia citizenship itself was more readily available to British subjects than to other settlers until 1973. Since then, all settlers have had to satisfy the same residence requirement for citizenship. We are now taking the next step and placing the franchise on an equal footing. The most fundamental reflection of commitment to the nation is citizenship. The most fundamental expression of citizenship is the right to elect those who govern the nation. Against that background it is of interest to consider some statistics. As at 30 June 1979 it was estimated that about 2.6 million overseas-born residents of Australia had periods of residence greater than the three years necessary to apply for citizenship. In fact only 1.4 million-about half-had become citizens. When we study the 1.2 million who had residentially qualified to apply but had not become citizens, we find the British subject group comprised almost 70 per cent of the residentiallyqualified non-citizens. Analysis of the period of residence in Australia also reveals a noteworthy pattern. Of the migrants born in the United Kingdom, including the Republic of Ireland, who had not taken citizenship, about 60 per cent had lived in Australia for more than 4 years; about 36 per cent had lived in here for 10 or more years; and about 13 per cent had lived here for 22 years or more. It is for these sorts of reasons that a study has been made of the Citizenship Act and of policies, practices and procedures associated with citizenship. When. the results of those studies have been fully evaluated, further anomalies will be removed. In foreshadowing legislation to vary the entitlement of future migrants to enrol and to vote, I emphasise two things: Firstly, all Australian residents who believe they qualify for Australian citizenship should enquire at the nearest office of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs or lodge an application; and, secondly, British subjects who believe they are entitled to enrol on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll should inquire at or make application to the Australian Electoral Office before the end of 1981. I commend this decision to the House. I present the following paper: Voting Rights for Migrants-Ministerial Statement, 7 May 1981. Motion (by Mr Fife) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",40
66,Mr YOUNG,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"The Opposition, as is warranted, treats the announcement by the Government with the seriousness that it deserves. We see the ramifications of the change and it is to be hoped that the changes enunciated by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) do not in any way offend those people already living in Australia. I think everyone in this country would agree that all people coming to live in Australia should be treated in exactly the same way. Whilst the Galbally Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services to Migrants may have recommended along those lines I do not know that it went as far as to say that citizenship ought to be the basis for the franchise. Nonetheless, that is a stand which the Australian Labor Party takes at the moment. I point out at the outset that the policy put forward at the election in October last year by the Labor Party, expressed by my colleagues the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) who was then the shadow Minister and by the leader of the Labor Party, was that all migrants, irrespective of where they come from, should have citizenship for the purposes of the franchise but that the period after which they would become eligible to make application for citizenship should be reduced from three years to one year. I make it quite clear that in respect of the statement made by the Minister the Opposition has not changed its mind. The Opposition believes it is right that all migrants should be treated equally. In this case that means people coming from any one of the 42 British and so-called former British areas or from the United Kingdom itself should now have citizenship as the basis for the franchise. This is the same burden as that carried by migrants from other parts of the world. We in the Opposition see no major substantive argument for leaving the set period at three years. Indeed, according to the figures given by the Min· ister it appears that the period stipulated does not seem to make much difference to the migrants themselves. Those people who do not wish to take out citizenship do not seem to have been affected by the reduction from five years to three years. It may be the case that they will not be affected by a reduction in the period from three years to one year. Whilst it is the overwhelming view of the Labor Party at the moment that citizenship ought to be the basis for the franchise-certainly, it is a view I hold very strongly at a personal level - It IS not a view that goes unchallenged. As honourable members would be aware, views have been expressed by some members of the New South Wales Labor Party committee on ethnic affairsalthough action has not been taken by the New South Wales Government-that a mere 12 months residency should be the basis for a person's being allowed to vote in this country. People from other parts of Australia hold similar views. It may be that there are people in the Government parties who hold such views. At the moment the policy we put forward at the last election stands as far as the Labor Party is concerned. If the Government has a substantive reason for continuing with the three-year residency period then such a reason is certainly not to be found in the Minister's statement. We cannot find any argument why that three-year period remains. I think it is quite a change not only to say to people who might be described as British subjects that in the future 'You will have to take out citizenship' but also to say The period to which the change relates will increase from six months to three years'. Again it seems to me that it would have been better to compromise the time period with that citizenship commitment. Perhaps the residency period then could have been reduced quite substantially. Certainly, a Labor government would look very closely, as soon as it came to office, at reducing the period for all people, not just British subjects, in terms of applications for citizenship in this country. I make those points in relation to where we stand. I think it is also important to say in relation to the measure that agreement with the States, of course, has been sought but that again there are varying views within the States as to what they want to do. It is not just the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affiairs that is affected; the electoral laws of the States and Commonwealth will have to be changed. It is to be hoped that the States will follow suit. As I said earlier, New South Wales-the largest of the States in terms of population-is looki-g closely.at reside.ncy as the basis for the voting rIght. Agam, we wlll have to be cognisant if the States after the change is implemented this year move to liberalise the opportunity for people to be placed on the electoral roll.",41
67,Unknown,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,42
68,Mr YOUNG,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"I wish to conclude my remarks because there is an arrangement-I am thankful to the Government for it-that if I reduce my period of speaking to the House then the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent), the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) and the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) can say a few words about their experiences in this field. Between them, they have had a great deal of experience. In support of this question of dealing with all migrants equal-y, I reiterate what the Labor Party had to say at lts conferences in 1979 and 1980. It said: . . . 'there shall be no distinction between Australian citizens whether born in Australia political rights' . . . 'a Labor Government will amend all Federal Acts to specify ""Australian citizen"" wherever the term ""British sUbject"" appears . . .' I will say a little bit more about that later. It continued: 'At the same time, the existing rights of British subjects already living in Australia would be preserved'. The Labor Party policy states: A Labor Government will grant citizenship to all permanent Australian residents of good character (who apply for it), after 12 months continuous resi-enc- in this co.untry. These provisions will apply to all ImmIgrants comm-. to Australia whether from the Commonwealth or not. BrItish subjects already in Australia at the time of proclamation of the Act will preserve their existing privileges. However, they will be encouraged to become Australian citizens. All immigrants arriving after the legislation rela-ing zenship is introduced will be treated equall-, .wIthout any prejudice to their country of birth, colour or religIOn. It is quite clear to the House from that statement that the Labor Party is in accord with the equality of treatment which as a result of this statement of the Minister of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is to be given to all people who come to Australia to make it their home. I reiterate that it is important to encourage as many people as possible who are now eligible to go on the electoral roll to do so before January 1982, because after that time they will face a far more difficult hurdle. I would like also to reiterate that we see no substantive reason for the Government maintaining the three-year qualifying period, and on coming to office a Labor Government would immediately review that period with a determination to reduce it to 12 months. Whilst in the Minister's statement some mention was made of the term 'British subject' appearing in Acts of Parliament, it ought to be made even clearer that the term 'British subject' appears in no fewer than 75 Acts of this Parliament. That situation ought to be looked at and dealt with quickly. It appears in Acts such as the Atomic Energy Act, the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act, the Australian National Airlines Act, the Broadcasting and Television Act, the Christmas Island Act, the Commonwealth Banks Act, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the Commonwealth Police Act 1957, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act 1961 and the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act 1972. If the Minister is determined, as he says in his speech, to do something about it-as is the United Kingdom-then it ought to be done as soon as possible to clean up the discrimination which is now very much a part of the legislation in the way in which it has been framed by this Parliament. or overseas in legal, social and The Opposition gives enthusiastic support to the treatment which in future will flow from this statement whereby all who come to make Australia their home will be treated equally, irrespective of where they come from. We do say that the qualifying period should have been looked at more closely by the Government. We think there is a case for shortening that period to closer to the six months which was previously necessary for all British subjects rather than extending it to three years, which was the period applicable to all other migrants. In that respect we say that upon becoming the Government we will be looking at reducing the period to 12 months.",42
69,Mr FALCONER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"The House to citiis debating a statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) on the subject of voting rights for migrants. The Minister, in his statement, outlined decisions which were being taken following consultations on 14 and 15 April between himself and State Ministers responsible for immigration and ethnic affairs. The Minister outlined that agreement was reached at that meeting on the following propositions: (1) Migrants, irrespective of their country of origin should be treated equally in relation to requirements to enrol, on their right to vote at elections for parliament and to nominate as a candidate for election to parliament; (2) Australian citizenship is the appropriate basis for the franchise; I note that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) on' behalf of the Opposition has expressed support for the changes which are to be introduced, although he has done so in a somewhat qualified way in that he has suggested that a Labor government would want to review the period of residence whiCh qualified people for citizenship. It is of interest to note that he did not say a Labor government would reduce the period required for citizenship. He left it very open by saying that it would 'look very closely' at the period for citizenship. I suggest to the House that it is all very well for Labor spokesmen in Opposition to suggest that they would look at that period and lead people to believe that there is a strong prospect that they would reduce the residential period for citizenship. However, it is interesting and instructive to note that Labor parties in government have agreed with the present period. The communique from the conference of Ministers responsible for immigration and ethnic affairs held on 14 and 15 April stated: The Conference expressed strong support for adopting a uniform Australia-wide qualification for voting rights based on Australian citizenship. Citizenship is available to all people after three years' residence. People already enrolled will have their existing rights preserved. Ministers agreed to work toward introducing this change by I January 1982 although some States face technical problems which will first need - o be resolved. So, State and Commonwealth governments of whatever political complexion agreed that these changes based on the present period of three years residence should be introduced. I suppose it would be fair to say that any period of residence required for citizenship is to some extent an arbitrary one and it might be subject to some adjustment one way or another. I suggest to the House that something like the present period of three years is a logical and appropriate period rather than, say, a marked reduction to one year. There is a need to ensure that people who vote in our national and State elections have a commitment to Australia. The Minister said in his statement to the House: The most fundamental reflection of commitment to the nation is citizenship. The most fundamental expression of citizenship is the right to elect those who govern the nation. The pattern of immigration in the past indicates that a number of people came to this country under assisted migration programs from the United Kingdom and from other countries in the 1950s and 19608 and it was not uncommon for a number of those people to stay for, say, two years and then go back to their country of origin. Certainly they completed the requirements to qualify for their assisted passage but their attitude of mind was that it was something of a working holiday, or maybe in other cases people felt that they wanted to come to Australia but after arriving and living here for a while felt they had no long term commitment to the country. That became obvious only after a couple of years. Therefore, r suggest that any substantial reduction in the present period of residence required for the taking out of citizenship would not be in the best interests of this country and would not be in the best interests of the migrants who want to make Australia their home for the rest of their lives. I commend the Minister's statement to the House. I look forward to some bipartisan support on this matter and I hope that the Labor Party in Opposition will not seek to use the opportunity to curry support with migrant groups on the basis of suggestions that the Labor Party in government has not been prepared to carry out.",42
70,Mr KENT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"I am honoured to follow my colleague on this side of the House, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), into the debate on the statement of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affai-8 (Mr Macphee). May I say also that I have some practical experience in the matters the Minister mentioned as I was disenfranchised myself for more than five years after my arrival in Australia. I ask the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer), whose Government was practising the disenfranchising of migrants for five years until we came into office in 1972 and reduced that period to three years, how he would support that proposition? On the one hand, he talked about waiting for three years, but under his Government the franchise was given to many migrants six months after arrival in this country. r cannot reconcile one attitude with the other. In our recent history we have pursued policies to attract migrants as settlers. Therefore, it is our responsibility to assist migrants in the difficult task of settlement and to make sure that they share equal rights, opportunities and duties, as do all Australians. I agree with the Minister when he stated: Migrants, irrespective of their country of origin should be treated equally in relation to requirements to enrol, on their right to vote at elections for Parliament and to nominate as a candidate for election to Parliament. The Minister's way of achieving equality differs somewhat from mine. The proposal that settlers from the British Commonwealth should take out Australian citizenship in itself is not opposed. However, the requirement of three years' residence before one can apply for citizenship is the key to our opposition. By disenfranchising British settlers for three years we do not help anybody. It is not the way to go about introducing equality. This Government knows how to pervert facts to cover up its intentions. Let me mention only that it is toying with the idea of lifting the retiring age of women to 65 years, under the guise of equality, instead of reducing the male pensionable age to 60 for those who wish to retire early. Equality and equal treatment is not achieved by pulling everybody into the mud but by lifting up those who are not treated fairly. After all, equal pay for women does not mean lowering the male pay but improving the pay of women who are discriminated against. The proposal of my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide that all settlers be extended the privilege of becoming Australian citizens after 12 months residence, which is Labor's policy, is a much fairer approach to this question and a much more equitable solution. But even that in itself will not eliminate discrimination unless we accept the policy of the Australian Labor Party and remove the requirement that an applicant for citizenship has to demonstrate an adequate knowledge of the English language. Such a requirement, of which our racist bureaucrats in the Minister's Department are so fond, certainly discriminates against migrants from non-English speaking countries. I hope that the Minister will ask his Party to accept our policy on this matter. The Minister also mentioned in his statement that 1.2 million migrants who qualified residentially have failed to take out Australian citizenship, and he said that 70 per cent of them are British subjects. J do not think that by disenfranchising them in the future the Government will force them to become citizens. After all, there are approximately 400,000 migrants of non-British background who also have not taken out citizenship. I believe it is known to the Minister that many migrants are reluctant to go through the citizenship ceremony as it is a humiliating procedure, especially in regard to the oath. The requirement for renunciation of their old country is painful to them. I thank the Minister for the arrangement that allowed me to speak in this debate. A couple of my colleagues also want to say a few words, so I will not extend my remarks. However, I mention to the Minister that the Victorian Minister of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Kennett, is working on an alteration of the citizenship rules to cut out the requirement for migrants to renounce allegiance to their old country. I hope that the Minister will take notice of that and will assist the Victorian Minister of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to alter the wording of the oath and to make the ceremonies more simple and more acceptable to those people who have not taken out citizenship.",43
71,Mr BAUME,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"1 represent a portion of the Illawarra region of New South Wales which has one of the greatest concentrations of migrant communities. I also have a name which clearly is not an Anglo-Saxon name, and in fact I was the first member of my family to be born in this country. I speak, therefore, with some feeling about the necessity for migrants who come to Australia to recognise their need to have a real determination to become Australian citizens before doing so. I support what the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) said on this matter. In particular, I want to say that I reject entirely the proposition that a naturalisation ceremony should be described as a humiliating experience, and I was most disappointed to hear the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent), describe it as such. I hope that the tone set by the honourable member.is not one that will be maintained in this debate. I point out that in setting a period of three years as the proper limit before one is entitled to become an Australian citizen and therefore to vote in elections, the Australian Government has followed a principle that is accepted throughout the world, with the exception of New Zealand, where a slightly different situation exists. Honourable members opposite must recognise, when suggesting that this period should be reduced to one year, that the countries from which all our migrants come specify a period of residency of at least three years as their basic requirement before allowing people to become citizens. Everyone of these major sources of our migrants has a rule that the Opposition says should not exist in Australia. For example, in Austria the period is 10 years; in Germany 10 years; in Greece eight years; in Italy five years; in Holland five years----.: Mr Kent-They don't need migrants.",44
72,Mr BAUME,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,The babble opposite indicate that those countries are not inviting migrants. Let me say that in the major migrant receiving-Mr Kent--They are countries people migrate from.,44
73,Mr BAUME,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,J wish that babble would cease. It is such a pest.,44
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member for Hotham will remain silent.,44
75,Mr BAUME,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"He has had one go which was incomprehensible. I wish he would not keep going now. Amongst the major migrant receiving nations of the world, Canada has a basic residence requirement of three out of the preceding four years. The United Kingdom requires five years, and most migrants in my area come from the United Kingdom. A period of five years' residence is required in Britain before a person is entitled to take out citizenship. In the United States of America it is five years. Those aie the world's largest countries in terms of receiving migrants. We are not even matching them. In our generous approach to migrants, after three years, instead of five or ten or all the other periods I mentioned, they can become Australian citizens in what the honourable member for Hotham has described as a humiliating ceremony, a humiliating experience. I suggest that the Government deserves support from the migrant communities for taking a very generous view, in world terms, of the amount of time people should stay before being allowed to vote and to become Australian citizens. I am overjoyed to see that the Government is now removing the anomaly by which some. people who were British subjects did not have to become Australian citizens before being entitled to vote. I believe it is right that the franchise should be given to Australian citizens and to no other people, except those who have already qualified for the franchise, of course. I support the view that there should be no retrospective action. I think that the Government has done the right thing in this matter. I wish to make one final point. It seems to me to be absolutely vital that the Government should protect the citizens of Australia by providing a reasonable time such as three years before migrants become eligible for citizenship. It is possible that, as a result of some error, some people who come to Australia may well not be desirable residents, as is shown by the level of the 4eportations. The waiting period of three years will protect this country from the very few migrants who come to Australia who are not desirable residents and who prove that by committing offences. I support wholeheartedly the Minister's statement. Its contents were agreed to by all the States, I think, including the Labor States. That is why I suggest that it is disappointing to see in this House today an attempt to create a feeling of division on this matter by trying to appeal in a pretty base way to some small migrant groups.",44
76,Mr SCOTT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"1 say at the outset that the statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) raises more questions than it provides answers. I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to provide those answers at a later date. I am nevertheless grateful for the opportunity to say a few words. I say initially that I agree with my colleague the honour.@.g-e member for Hotham (Mr Kent) that - MPfPblems which migrants have to face in the citizenship ceremony can be felt and understood only by those who have had to go through it. It is all right for people from the other side of the chamber to make noises but they do not know the problems which this ceremony creates for some migrants. I was not put in the position of having to renounce a previous allegiance. This is the area, I think, which needs to be looked at. I simply hope that the Minister has that in mind. I will touch on some points which have been alluded to in the razor gang report. We have an indication that the administrative procedures in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for granting citizenship will be streamlined. That is all we know, but I hope that that streamlining will provide those migrants who wish to become Australian citizens with the opportunity merely to fill in a form before a justice of peace, if that is their desire. From my own experience, working in the electorate, I have to say that the local government councils do a marvellous job when a ceremony involves a number of people. It is only the comradeship of the local government people and, perhaps, a migrant's friends that takes away some of the problems which he faces at the time of having to renounce his former country. As I said earlier, that is the reason I support the point of view of the ""honourable member for Hotham on the citizenship ceremony itself. I will touch on another area which J think is very important. I hope that the Minister will take note of it. I refer to the requirement in the application for citizenship for a person to speak English. I have a constituent, a 57-year-old Greek lady, who was refused citizenship because she did not meet the necessary qualifications. I put it to the Minister and to the Government that at 57 years of age-the Government should bear in mind that this migrant has been here for seven years-the opportunity for her-indeed, her ability-to pick up the language will be quite a problem. In effect she will be being denied citizenship and the right to vote. I draw attention to the list of countries which has been provided by the Minister. I believe that there are 42 of them: A number of countries on that list are not English-speaking countries. They include Cyprus, Fiji, Guyana, India, Jamaica and many others. Problems can be encountered by people from those countries in meeting the qualifications for voting. A major point in the Opposition's position in regard to this statement is that the Government is not giving something; it is taking away from the current position and privileges that have been alforded British subjects. They di<:i not previously have to fulfil the new requirement that the Government has suggested. Therefore, a new restriction is to be imposed on them. Their status will be reduced. I suggest to the Minister and the Government that it would have been far better to have lifted the privileges enjoyed by other sections of our migrant population to those that have been enjoyed by migrants from the United Kingdom. This is the main thrust of the Opposition's argument. I conclude by referring briefly to the number of cuts being implemented in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs by the razor gang. I have alluded to the citizenship procedures. The information service is to be terminated. Other roles of the Department are to be rationalisedthat is a beautiful word. Adult migrant and refugee education programs will be restricted. Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Not only is there an agreement in relation to the time that honourable members have in which to speak but also the honourable member for Hindmarsh is raising material that is in no way covered in the statement which has been given to the Parliament today.",45
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,The Chair is not party to any arrangement. Some latitude is given to all honourable members. 1 will hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh but 1 remind him to be relevant. Mr SCOTTI accept that there was an agreement in regard to time. If r had not been interrupted 1 would have finished my speech. I thank the Minister for making his statement. I hope that the points 1I have raised have been noted and will be attended to.,46
78,Mr RUDDOCK,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"I wish to make some comments on the important statement that has been made by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee). The statement deals with the eligibility of new settlers in Australia to vote. For a long time different tests have applied to people coming from different parts of the world. That has been a matter of some concern to migrants. That concern is certainly appreciated by me. In the past those people who came from former British colonies were able to enrol in order to vote shortly after their arrival whereas those who came from other countries were not. The Minister has made it quite clear that migrants to Australia, wherever they come from, seeking to vote in Australian elections will be able to do so on the same basis, that is, when they become citizens of Australia. I think that is a fair test. There seemed to be some unanimity of view when the Opposition spokesman on this matter, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), addressed the House. Having heard some of the other Opposition speakers one could be forgiven for believing that that is no longer the case. The Government takes the view that citizenship is the appropriate test for people to be eligible to vote. The principal matter that has been called into question by the Opposition has been the length of time it might take a person to qualify for Australian citizenship. It ought to be clearly noted that Australia provides in its three-year eligibility test a very generous basis upon which people may seek to become Australian citizens. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) directed the attention of the House to the time it takes to acquire eligibility to apply for citizenship in other countries. That is important when we consider many of the countries whose former citizens come to Australia to settle. Quite frequently those countries set an inordinate time Which people who have taken up permanent residence have to wait before they can qualify for citizenship. In relation to some of the European countries, 10 years of continuous residence is required before migrants in Austria and in the Federal Republic of Germany qualify for citizenship. In Greece-a considerable number of new Australian residents and citizens are from Greece-it is required that the people seeking Greek citizenship spend eight of the 10 years preceding the application in Greece. In Italylikewise there are many Italians who have setled in Australia - five years' residence is required. I do not wish in any way to appear racist in the matters I am mentioning. I do not believe it applies only to European countries. For instance, in Malaysia 10 years within the 12 years preceding the application-including the one year immediately preceding the date of application-is the period for which people of that country must have been resident before they seek citizenship. I could go on. These comparisons with other parts of the world indicate that the requirements in Australia are extraordinarily generous. But one ought to ask oneself: What do the migrants want? When we look at the figures we find that on average it takes eight to nine years for people who have taken up permanent residence to apply for Australian citizenship; that is, when they exercise their own choice. I do not wish to debate this matter at length. In case it is thought that Australia, in taking the approach that citizenship ought to be the test, is being unreasonable, let me add one other important fact. In no country, apart from New Zealand, is the test for eligibility to vote other than citizenship of that country. Of course, New Zealand with its very special relationships with countries in the Pacific region has a different basis for that. That, of course, is understood. Citizenship is the natural basis upon which eligibility to vote should be granted. Nobody would expect it to be otherwise. People should have some loyalty to the country in which they settle. I believe that is the test involved in terms of citizenship. Some criticism has been offered of the tests for citizenship. I see nothing wrong with the test of renouncing all other allegiance. I think it is an important criterion for people taking up Australian citizenship. Imagine people claiming to be citizens of Australia in a situation, say, in the last war, in which they had come from Germany or perhaps Japan, had taken up permanent residence and were seeking Australian citizenship, but were not prepared to renounce all other allegiance in order to enjoy Australian citizenship. Is that what honourable members opposite are saying? If they are saying that these people should not renounce all other allegiance I believe they are selling Australia short. That is what is involved in the matter.",46
79,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) referred to the fact that about half of our permanent residents are not becoming Australian citizens. There are various causes for this situation, including that which was referred to by my colleagues; namely, the need to shorten the period of eligibility. It should be no more than one year. We urge the Government to consider this change seriously. However, a further factor is very important here. I believe many people are reluctant to become citizens because they do not have the whole of their family in Australia and have little hope of achieving a full family reunion under present circumstances. At the moment the proportion of migrants coming to Australia under the general eligibility scheme which deals with skilled workers is almost the same as that for people coming in under the scheme of family reunion. Y 6t many of these skilled workers have not been recruited to go to specific jobs. They have immigrated because of a general belief that there is a demand for their skills. The result is that often those entering Australia under general eligibility criteria cannot find employment for their skills and are contributing to the unemployment boom while at the same time they lack an adequate family support system. While this is happening humane considerations are being thrown a-L-Qe with respect to the family reunion schem-,C1;l;rrent1y, this scheme is responsible for approximately 20 per cent of total settler arrivals. It is clear that this intake is far too small to accommodate many worthy cases. Whilst no statistics are kept which show what proportion of immigration applications are made in the family reunion category, experience in my own electorate and information from other honourable members whose electorates contain large numbers of migrants, strongly suggest that many applications are refused. Whilst we lack hard data as a result of the failure of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to record relevant statistics, an analysis of families of immigrant patients admitted to the psychiatric hospital in Royal Park, Victoria, showed that only one-third of those surveyed had their whole family in Australia. If this reflects the general situation, clearly the situation is creating considerable distress for many families in Australia who are forced to live without the support of their relatives as well as for those overseas who need the support of their families in Australia. I suggest that this is an important reason why many of those migrants already here are not too keen to become Australian citizens. If more families were reunited in Australia there would be an increase in applications for citizenship. Apart from purely humanitarian principles there is no reason to believe that immigrants settled under the family reunion scheme are any less succe.>sfully settled than those who enter under the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System. I seriously question whether the NUMAS factors are any more likely to result in successful settlement than is the experience of being reunited with, and assisted by, one's family in that complex process. Indeed, it would seem to me that many of the NUMAS factors, such as responsiveness, presentation, and initiative, are difficult and perhaps impossible to assess with any great accuracy and are probably irrelevant to the settlement process anyway. Other factors such as competence in English, education, literacy and adaptability have a distinct Anglo-Saxon bias and do not necessarily result in more successful settlement. In the light of these observations I submit that there should be a substantial increase in family reunion migration to Australia. In the short term we should be looking at doubling the number in that category while also creating conditions which would allow for even greater numbers in future years. In pursuit of this goal I submit that all permanent residents of Australia should be able to sponsor all relatives, bot'hl-dependent and independent, who wish to emigrate, with exceptions being made only on the grounds of health or character. Priority should be given to closest relatives such as brothers and sisters with a gradual move to categories such as cousins, nieces, nephews and other extended family members. Whilst total numbers entering under the family reunion scheme would increase substantially under this proposal, the total number of migrants could remain the same or be only marginally increased. This can be achieved by the abolition of NUMAS and the substitution of a scheme which I have forwarded to the Minister in my submission to him concerning NUMAS. That scheme would ensure that only those skilled workers who have a specific job to which to go would be admitted. I believe if we move towards these changes both British subjects and other residents will be more keen to become Australian citizens, and to participate fully in Australian life-including voting.",47
80,Mr MACPHEE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"Whilst several of the comments which have been made have had some relevance to the overall question of citizenship they have been fairly far removed from the statement. I made. Therefore, I will dispose of those matters first before referring to those which were relevant to the statement. The honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous), who spoke last, made remarks relevant to the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System review. They will be taken into account by me in the course of preparing my recommendations to Cabinet. However, I wish to leave him with a couple of thoughts. Firstly, he said that we should have almost unlimited family reunion. I ask him to consider the level of the skills of persons and the numbers of persons who would come into Australia. He mentioned in particular that brothers and sisters should get priority. I ask him to consider, under a non-discriminatory policy, how many hundreds of thousands of people that will involve each year and whether-",48
81,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, r take a point of order. I did not say 'unlimited increase'-",48
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,Mr Millar)Order! If the honourable member is of the view that he has been misrepresented he can raise that matter with me at a convenient time.,48
83,Mr MACPHEE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE,"I did not say 'unlimited' either. I do not wish to take up the time of the House by debating that matter. I said 'virtually' or 'almost' or some qualifying adjective. The point I am trying to make is that we can have a thoroughgoing review. I wish that honourable members opposite would consider the consequences of their recommendations in respect of family reunion, especially regarding the job market, the level of skills, the numbers involved, the infrastructure costs and so on. I support the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) when he said that in 1975 in the last calendar of the Whitlam Government there was a net outfiow from Australia of 5,000 people. That is hardly consistent with the kinds of statements now coming from the honourable member for Burke. Another matter that was ancillary to the debate was raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) referring to the number of Acts that might have to be changed as a consequence of this statement. In fact, I draw his attention to the fact that in my speech I said: The term British Subject is included in many Commonwealth and State Acts, apart from electoral legislation. I am informed than it is now used only by the United Kingdom and Australia and that the United Kingdom is moving to adopt other approaches. It is fitting, therefore, that Australian legislation be re-examined as well. It is the Government's intention to do that. I expect that the State governments will do the same. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) also raised a number of matters that are being looked at in the broader context of citizenship. I thank him for the constructive comments which he made. They are being looked at currently by me. I established a task force, in fact headed by Mr Kiosoglous from South Australia, to look at aspects of the Australian Citizenship Act and that includes procedures including the questions of ceremonies. I have to say in fairness to the honourable member for Rotham (Mr Kent) that he and I attend some ceremonies together. Not all of them are of the quality of ceremony that is, in fact, performed in Wollongong about which the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) was speaking. There is a very uneven quality in the ceremonies. I think the recommendations which I will finally put to Cabinet will take account of the comments of both the honourable member for Hotham and the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I welcome comments from both sides of the House over the next few months about the overall question of citizenship because we are planning for the Budget session major reviews to that Act. With the exception of the 1973 Whitlam Government amendments there have been no real amendments to that Act since it was introduced in 1949. It is certainly due for a major overhaul. The point was made by several people, including the honourable member for Hindmarsh, that somehow or other this proposition is taking away the rights from British subjects. It is not doing at all. I have gone out of my way today to stress that we are not taking away from any person any entitlement that he or she now has. We are not taking away any franchise. One could argue, I suppose, that in prospect we are taking away from future migrants who are classified in those 42 countries as being British subjects something that they might have expected to enjoy. They will be well aware of that when they migrate. If that deters them from migrating I would be very surprised. If it does, so be it. It has been argued by the Opposition that we produce equality by lowering the requirement for everyone to the British subject requirement of six months' residency. Then a compromise was advanced to make that time 12 months. I might say that on the argument advanced by the Opposition if we do that we are still taking something away from the British subjects. We are not, in reality, doing that at all. I ask the House to consider this matter: We have a highly complex system of government in Australia. It is not uncommon for us as members of the Federal Parliament to be assailed by people at meetings and elsewhere about matters which we know are within the purview of local government or State government. Indeed, the honourable member for Hindmarsh once raised a matter at Question Time, I recall, with my colleague the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) about a matter that was fairly and squarely within the realm of a State Minister. If it is difficult enough for people born in Australia to understand the distribution of powers under our Constitution and if it is difficult enough for them to make judgments about where responsibility lies and how votes should be cast it certainly is difficult for persons coming into Australia, especially if they do not speak English when they arrive, to be able to cast their votes in an informed fashion. Despite the efforts now being made in respect of adult migrant education I honestly believe, and the Government certainly believes, it would be irresponsible to give to people, unused for the most part to a federal structure with a bicameral legislature and a proportional representation system in the Senate, the right to vote until they really have understood the nature of the institution. Let us remember too that many of them have come from nondemocratic societies. Another point about the proposal is that it has been discussed fully by the State Ministers and me at two lengthy conferences in the past year. The State Ministers and I reached agreement in principle. We recommended to our respective Cabinets what the changes ought to be. Each of those that Cabinets, including the New South Wales Cabinet, came to the view reflected in my statement to the House today. Really, the Opposition would do well to take note of the fact that the eight governments-the Federal, the Northern Territory and the six States-are in agreement about this measure. I have undertaken to the State governments that when the Electoral Act is amended or when the draft of the amendment is available I will circulate it to the States and they will be able to provide for reciprocal legislation. In 1973 the Whitlam Government introduced changes to the Australian citizenship Act and made a three-year residence requirement for everyone, British subject or not. I would have thought that should have been welcomed then as a step in the right direction. I would have thought also most honourable members would have agreed that the principal privilege of citizenship is the right to vote. Whilst it can be argued that some of the great European civilisations certainly allowed residents to be very active leaders in their communities, it can be argued that if a resident can have a commitment is it too much to ask that that resident show the commitment by becoming a citizen? The Government believes the appropriate way is that citizenship should be the basis for franchise, that citizenship is the recognition of commitment to our country. Finally, I refer to the question of whether we are depriving anyone of any benefits. I remind the House of the statistics that I gave about the number of persons from the United Kingdom who have been here for many years and who have not taken out citizenship. Many of them may now choose to do so when they recognise that the right to vote goes with it. Other studies will be made in the course of the work of the task force on citizenship to find out why people choose not to take out citizenship. In conjunction with the States we will be conducting a citizenship awareness raising program. This is not to get jingoistic and so forth but to encourage more people to make that final commitment and take out citizenship. We have a close system of consultation with the States. Just as I have been consulting the ethnic groups with the honourable member for Port Adelaide over the review of NUMAS we are consulting the ethnic groups themselves and the State Ministers at the moment about the proposal. The State Ministers and I have agreed to meet when I have proposals to put to them about citizenship so that all aspects of the policy, procedures and possible legislative changes will be examined in conjunction with them. There is a'!great deal of consultation proceeding. I hope that the Opposition, having registered its view today, will reflect upon it and will seek to bring itself into line with the States, the Territory and the Federal Government. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",48
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSUMER PROTECTION," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Fraser Government's further abandonment of consumer interests by, among other means, the disbanding of the Prices Justification Tribunal and the reduction in the consumer protection functions of the Trade Practices Commission. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMotion (by Mr Macphee) put: That the business of the day be called on. The House divided.

Question so resolved in the affirmative NA 1981 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time. Second Reading",50
85,Mr NIXON,WOOL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: 63 That the Bill be now read a second time. 46 The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Wool In17 dustry Act 1972. Honourable members will recall that previous amendments which became law on AYES 23 May 1980 provided for wool grower levies in the Market Support Fund to be progressively Jull,D.F. refunded to wool growers as the credit balance in the Fund reached agreed satisfactory levels. The Market Support Fund was established in September 1974 to provide funds to operate the Wool Reserve Price Scheme. Since that time wool MCLean, R. M. MCMahon, Sir William growers have contributed to the Fund through a 5 per cent levy on their gross sales value of shorn wool. The 1980 amendments to the Act were O'Keefe, F. L. Peacock, A. S. introduced after the Government acceded to strong requests from the Wool Council of Australia to revolve the Fund. The views of all sectors of the industry were canvassed at the time and not all agreed with the Council's proposals. Shipton, R. F. However, contributions to the Fund are made by wool growers and it is only right that the views of growers should be given primary consideration. Revolving the Fund means that repayments will be made to the wool growers who contributed the money on a first in first out basis after the Fund has reached an agreed satisfactory level. The Act provides that the Minister for Primary Industry will, with the written agreement of the Wool Council of Australia, make a declaration specifying a period of contributions to be returned to wool growers. The level of the Fund currently stands well above $400m. This is in excess of requirements to operate the Reserve Price Scheme and it isrealistic at this stage to consider refunding levies collected during the first year of the Fund's operation. The continued collection of the 5 per cent levy will enable the Fund to be maintained at the desired level, for its primary role of market support. Development of the administrative procedures has been a complex task and has, however, revealed a number of aspects of the Act which need to be modified to remove certain difficulties and anomalies before the refund scheme is implemented. While the overall administration of the refund scheme is to be in the hands of the Australian Wool Corporation, much of the detailed work will be performed by wool brokers and wool merchants who are registered with the Commissioner of Taxation as agents for the collection of wool tax. These firms are referred to in the Act as 'registered persons'. It is clearly undesirable for the Corporation, which does not hold the necessary wool transaction records, to be burdened with the task of making refunds to individual growers where this task could otherwise be undertaken more simply and less expensively by registered persons. Wool growers who sold their wooi to or through a registered person will normally receive their refunds through that same person; that is, the firm which collected the 5 per cent levy. The Act as it stands provides that where a registered person ceases to be registered, the Corporation will pay the refunds directly to the wool grower clients. To cater for the situation where the firm concerned has since gone out of business, it was provided that refunds to clients of that firm were to be made by the Corporation. Some firms have ceased to be registered persons for the purposes of refunds because they were absorbed in takeovers or because they became registered under a different name. It now appears that many successor firms are capable of making these refunds, but are precluded from doing so by the provisions of section 42K(7) of the Act, which requires the Wool Corporation to make refunds in situations of this nature. Again, it is undesirable that the Corporation be burdened with the cost intensive task of making refunds to individual growers where this work could be performed automatically by firms wpich have 'inherited' these growers as clients. Accordingly, clause 7 of this Bill amends the Act to remedy this situation. A further proposed amendment removes an anomaly created by wool growers entering into certain. types of forward selling transactions. Under the Act as it stands at present, a decision to refund 1974-75 Market Support Fund levy payments would mean that some growers who sold wool forward before shearing prior to 1974-75, and eventually paid the levy during 1974-75 after shearing, would not be eligible for a refund. Other growers, however, who sold forward in 1974-75 but did not pay the levy until the following year would be eligible for a refund in respect of 1974-75. This situation is inequitable and not consistent with the first-in-first-out principle for revolving the Fund. Clause 5 of the Bill corrects the anomaly be deeming the time of sale of wool to be that time when payment for the wool is made. An amendment proposed by clause 4 of the Bill will enable the Corporation, and registered persons assisting the Corporation, to be reimbursed for administrative costs incurred before the formal declaration of a refund period. The Bill amends the Act to enable these costs, which could not otherwise be recouped, to be charged to the Market Support Fund. A number of other amendments of the principal Act are considered desirable and timely and it is opportune to introduce them now. I will refer to each of them briefly. The Bill provides in clause 10 that a statement given to a wool grower claiming a refund should set out the findings of the Corporation regarding the facts of the claim as well as the reasons for the Corporation's decision. The Bill also provides for an increase in the membership, and in the quorum for a meeting, of the Australian Wool Testing Authority. (Quorum formed). Since a significant proportion of the wool clip is tested in stores controlled by private treaty merchants it is appropriate that their organisation be represented on the AWT A. Additionally, the Wool Council of Australia is of the view that, as growers pay for the bulk of wool testing, the Council should be directly represented on the Authority. Honourable members will be aware that the Government has made a separate decision to sell the AWTA, but no time scale has yet been set. Nevertheless, it is still appropriate for the Government to provide for the Authority's continued administration. Accordingly, clause 14 of the Bill provides for representation by both the Wool Council and private treaty merchants. As a result of this amendment, all major industry organisations will be represented on the Australian Wool Testing Authority. They will thus have an input in consideration of the future sale of the Authority and a first hand association with the shaping of ongoing testing and certification of wool. Clause 16 of the Bill revises the provision regarding declaration of pecuniary interests by Corporation members. The revision is in harmony with the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest. All members of the Corporation are required to declare any pecuniary interests in matters being discussed or considered by a meeting of the Corporation, and for that declaration to be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Icommend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerin) adjourned. FISH (EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGE) Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time.",50
86,Mr NIXON,WOOL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to introduce, as from 1 July 1981, charges to recoup part of the cost borne by the Commonwealth for inspecting fish for export. This is part of the Government's program to recover costs of providing export inspection for certain agricultural and fishery products. Export inspection is designed to ensure that products meet minimum standards of quality, hygiene and presentation when exported. In 1979 the Government introduced charging for meat, grain and wool inspection aimed at recovering approximately 50 per cent of the inspeCtion costs of the Commonwealth. The Government proposes that fees aimed at a similar level of recovery should be imposed for similar services provided by my Department to seafood exporters. Turning to specifics in this Bill, honourable members will see that it provides for the recovery of fish .export inspection costs to be achieved through charges on fish inspected for export and for which an export permit has been issued under the Exports (Fish) Regulations. The Bill provides that the person to whom an export permit is issued under the Exports (Fish) Regulations is liable to pay the charge. Exemptions may be provided in the regulations. To achieve the 50 per cent cost recovery, it is proposed that the following rates be recommended to the Governor General for promulgationby regulation; rock 10bster-3.9 cents per kilogram; all other shellfish except oysters, squid, cuttlefish and octopus-2.5 cents per kilogram; all other fish except oysters in the shell or half shell-0.34 cents per kilogram; oysters in the shell or half shell-l cent per dozen. On current estimates of fish exports for 1981-82 these rates will yield approximately $lm in a full year. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerin) adjourned. FISH (EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGE) COLLECTION BILL 1981 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time. Second Reading BILL 1981 Mr NIXON (Gippsland-Minister for Primary Industry) (3.22)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is related to the Fish (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1981 which was just introduced. Its Second Reading purpose is to provide for the collection of charges proposed in that Bill. It follows the provisions for the collection of levies in other export inspection ch-rge legislation. Specifically, provision is made for exporters to pay charges due to the Commonwealth for the inspection of fish for which an export permit has been issued under the Exports (Fish) Regulations. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerin) adjourned. DRIED FRUIT (EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGE) BILL 1981 Bill presented by· Mr Nixon, and read a first time. Second Reading",52
87,Mr NIXON,WOOL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is associated with other Bills just introduced for export inspection charges on fishery products. The purpose of this Bill is to impose charges for the export inspection of dried fruit from 1 July 1981. The Government's intention is to recover approximately half the total inspection costs of these products. A maximum rate of charge is specified, namely $11 per tonne. The actual rate of charge will be specified in regulations. It is proposed that a rate of $5.50 per tonne for exports in 1981-82 be recommended to the Governor General for promulgation in regulations. On the basis of long term export averages, charges at this rate will yield approximately $259,000 in a full year. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerin) adjourned. DRIED FRUIT (EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGE) COLLECTION BILL 1981 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time.",52
88,Mr NIXON,WOOL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is associated with the Dried Fruit (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1981 just introduced. It is designed to provide for the collecenter tion of charges proposed in that Bill. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerin) adjourned. PLANT VARIETY RIGHTS BILL 1981 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time.",53
89,Mr NIXON,WOOL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to make possible the granting of proprietary rights, somewhat similar to a grant of patent rights, to people who breed or develop new plant varieties. Whilst this is a new area of legislation in Australia, similar type schemes are currently operating in Europe, the United Kingdom, South Africa, the United States of America, New Zealand, Japan and several other countries. The proposed Australian scheme will, on the advice of the Australian Agricultural Council, be restricted to horticultural, ornamental and other selected pasture and fodder species. The major field crops and annual pasture species will not be considered for registration under the scheme. The scheme, as set out in the B.m, will permit a plant breeder, who has developed a new plant variety, to apply to a registration authority for the grant of a right to confer sole ownership of that variety on him. Such rights will permit plant breeders, or organisations employing plant breeders, to levy and collect royalties from people selling or producing new varieties registered under the scheme. I emphasise that the granting of a right does not imply that the variety is better than an existing one, but simply, as with other patents, that it is different. ,n' A major advallfage resulting from a plant variety rights scheme will be increased availability of new plant varieties to the Australian horticultural, agricultural and plant nursery industries, with consequential benefits to farmers and gardeners. There is evidence that, in the absence of rights, Australia has been denied access to some potentially valuable varieties of plants developed overseas. These varieties have ranged through Second reading pasture grasses, grape vines, and a number of horticultural crop and orchard plants. Plant improvement by breeding is a long and costly process. Rights of ownership of a new variety, with royalties on sales, will compensate to some extent the costs incurred and will provide a stimulus to companies and private breeders to into long term breeding programs. Such additional plant breeding will complement the work being undertaken by government funded organisations. The development of the proposed Australian plant variety rights scheme has extended over several years. It evolved through a series of technical consultations between representatives of the Second Reading Commonwealth, the States, seed industry groups and the Nurserymen's Association. The legislation covering the operations of similar type schemes in other countries was also examined in detail. I add that the Australian Agricultural Council has been closely involved with the scheme since it was first proposed. The Council will have an essential and key role in the operation of the scheme and it has already contributed substantially to the principles embodied in the present Bill. In briefthese principles are: The scheme will not have the potential to cover all plant species. It will be restricted in its scope. Participation in the scheme will be entirely voluntary. A breeder may choose whether to release a new variety without applying for protection. The grant of a right will be given where a new variety can be clearly distinguished by one or more important characteristics from any other variety whose existence is a matter of common knowledge. These characteristics must be capable of precise recognition and description and the variety must be homogenous and stable in it characteristics-in other words, it must remain true to its description after repeated reproduction or propagation. Nothing in the Bill will prevent farmers or gardeners retaining seed of protected varieties for sowing of crops for sale for human and animal consumption. Protected varieties will also be freely available for research purposes and to plant breeders for use in breeding programs. Protection of a right, once granted, will be the responsibility of the owner of the new variety, through the normal legal process. There will be provision for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and for the protection of the public interest. The Act will be administered by my Department in which a registrar of plant varieties will be appointed. In the initial stages, only a limited number of species will be eligible for registration. These species will be determined on the recommendation of the Australian Agricultural Council. The whole question of plant variety rights in Australia has already aroused considerable controversy. This is not entirely surprising, as similar arguments of opposition to such schemes were put forward in the United States, Canada and other countries. Some of the arguments that have been raised in Australia are misleading and show a lack of understanding of what is intended. For instance, there have been claims that under the scheme it will be illegal to grow existing known varieties. That is not true. There have even been claims that plant breeders will deliberately breed disease susceptible plants that will require massive inputs of pesticides and fertilisers to survive. That is a ridiculous argument. Other arguments do raise important issues, but these generally are not related to matters within the scope of plant variety rights schemes. For example, the preservation of plant genetic resources for use in future breeding programs is certainly important. It has been recognised as such in Australia and in other countries. Gene banks, or seed collections, particularly for the major crops, are in existence in Australia and are expanding. The Australian Agricultural Council has under consideration ways and means of improving existing collections and establishing new ones. However, these matters are completely unrelated to plant variety rights. One of the most common complaints is that a plant variety rights scheme may lead to takeovers of Australian seed firms by multinational chemical companies. There is no denying that take-over bids can occur in any business activity, including the seed industry. There is nothing unusual about that in a free enterprise system. I am confident, however, that if any takeovers should occur in the Australian seed industry, they will not be as a direct result of plant variety rights legislation. Safeguards are provided for in this Bill against monopoly control that may not be in the public interest. These include powers for the registration authority to have control over licences and to ensure reasonable supplies of varieties at reasonable prices. As I have already said, species will be included only with the agreement of the Australian Agricultural Council. Because of the need to encourage a greater understanding of the intentions of a plant variety rights scheme, the Government has decided only to introduce this Bill at the present time, and not to proceed with it further in the Parliament until the Budget session. This will allow several months for interested people and organisations to study the details of the Bi Il, and will in turn lead to more informed public discussion and understanding. It should be pointed out that in introducing the Bill, the Commonwealth is primarily carrying out the wishes of the States, as expressed in Agricultural Council. The legislation, as it now stands, accords with what has been envisaged by the Council. The Council will discuss the legislation in detail at its next meetil).g in August, by which time it should also have before it the views of interested parties. I believe the Bill opens up well- prospects for encouraging development of small plant breeding firms in Australia, and therefore, an increase in the number of new plant varieties available, and improvements in the efficiency of Australian plant industries. I commend the Bill to the House. Mr Kerin-- Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to address a few short questions to the Minister.",53
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WOOL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member has my indulgence to make a brief statement.,54
91,Mr KERIN,WOOL INDUSTRY AMENDMENT BILL,"-As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has already said, there has been considerable and significant controversy in the community about the question of plant variety rights. J welcome his statement that the legislation will lay on the table for quite a while and that it will not be discussed until the Budget session. In a few places the word 'unanimous' may have slipped out of the Minister's second reading speech. Can the Minister inform us whether the unanimous agreement of the States is still required before the Government proceeds with the legislation. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerin) adjourned. NA Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time.",54
92,Mr HOWARD,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, in terms both of its size and the range of matters it covers, may well be described as an omnibus measure to amend the income tax law. Three of the measures will give effect to policies foreshadowed in the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for the last election. These are: An immediate deduction for capital expenditure on the connection of a business property to mains electricity; a concessional deduction for the cost of insulating a taxpayer's first home; and an immediate deduction for capital expenditure on storage facilities for petroleum fuel. Also included are provisions to give effect to the decision, announced by me late last year, that tourist buses may qualify for the investment allowance with effect from 1 January 1976. The Bill also contains further amendments to the gift provisions of the income tax law, including some that will give effect to the 1980-81 Budget decision to allow deductions for gifts to certain overseas aid organisations. Last, but by no means least in importance, the Bill proposes amendments designed to provide a counter to various forms of tax avoidance. Trust stripping, expenditure recoupment schemes and exploitation of trading stock transfer provisions and of the tax-exempt status of certain bodies are the avoidance areas covered. Extensive details of most of these changes have already been announced and, relying on that and on the detailed explanations contained in an explanatory memorandum that will be circulated to honourable members, I propose in this introductory speech to limit myself to the key points. Cost of Connection to Mains Electricity In this respect the Government is aiming to provide assistance to persons who, particularly in remote areas of Australia, face the often heavy cost of obtaining the facility of a mains electricity supply. Capital expenditure on connecting mains electricity, or upgrading an existing connection, to a property on which a business is carried on is to qualify for deduction in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Qualifying expenditure will be the capital costs incurred by an owner of the property, or by a lessee or sharefarmer, in bringing the mains electricity to the point on the property where the supply authority meters conBILL 1981 sumption. The dt<9u,ction will be available only where the cOlJ,neQtion or upgrading is, at least in part, to be used for business purposes in the production of assessable income. Second Reading In its present form the Bill would apply to connections or upgradings effected under contracts entered into on or after 1 October 1980. In the light of representations to the effect that this would disadvantage people in rural areas who, after having contracted for supply may have to wait a considerable period for the connection to be made, the Government has now decided that the concession should be available for connection and upgrading costs incurred on or after 1 October 1980, no matter when contracts were entered into. I shall be proposing amendments to this effect when the Bill is in Committee. I want to add that the Government is aware that some may see scope in the concession for the inflation of costs so as to benefit the utilities that supply electricity. I give notice now that any action of this kind could very well place the continued availability of the deduction in serious jeopardy. Home Insulation Costs This concession will provide tax assistance to people who take steps that have an effect of reducing energy consumption. It is proposed that an income tax deduction will be allowed for amounts paid by a resident taxpayer for insulating a first home. Amounts paid by a taxpayer for thermal insulation materials, and for the cost of their installation in a dwelling, are to be an allowable deduction if the dwelling is the sole or principal residence of the taxpayer in Australia. It is a further condition of the deduction that the taxpayer or, in the case of married couples, the taxpayer or his or her spouse, has not previously owned another dwelling in Australia that he or she used as a home. The deduction will be available for insulating a dwelling purchased by the taxpayer on or after 1 Octob-r 1980 as well as a dwelling constructed by the taxpayer where constuction started on or after that date. Amounts expended by eligible taxpayers for the insulation of extensions to their dwellings will qualify for the newdeduction under corresponding conditions. Fuel Storage Facilities The third election policy initiative covered by the Bill relates to the capital cost of storage facilities for petroleum-based liquid or gaseous fuel. The Bill will authorise a deduction, by way of a 100 per cent' depreciation allowance, in the income year in which the facilities are first used or installed ready for use to produce assessable income. The allowance wilPapply to plant in Australia used wholly and exclUsively to store fuel held for use in a business as fuel or as trading stock for disposal. Ancillary plant used wholly and exclusively to convey fuel in and out of storage or to measure the amount of fuel stored will qualify. So too will the cost of installation of eligible plant qualify. Storage facilities for crude oil and other fuels being held for further processing will not qualify for the allowance nor will rail, road or shipping tankers, pipelines or containers for use in the transport of fuel. Expenditure will qualify for the allowance if it is incurred under a contract entered into on or after 1 October 1980 or, if the expenditure is on facilities constructed by the taxpayer, if construction commenced after that date. Facilities that a taxpayer acquired second hand on or after 1 October 1980 will qualify if used by the taxpayer at a site other than where they were situated at that date. Honourable members will recall that, late last year, legislation was enacted to give effect to the Government's decision to remove the specific exclusion from the income tax investment allowance of plant for use in connection with amusement or recreation. When introducing that legislation, which applies from 1 October 1980, I announced the Government's further decision to permit tourist buses to qualify for the investment allowance as from 1 January 1976, the date of commencement of the allowance. Measures to achieve that result are in this Bill. By these measures the exclusion that applied for the period between 1 January 1976 and 30 September 1980 of plant for use in connection with amusement or recreation will be treated as not having applied in relation to tourist buses. Buses brought within the scope of the investment allowance by this amendment will, of course, remain subject to the general requirements of the investment allowance provisions. For example, the general exclusion from the allowance of cars and other light vehicles will mean that buses designed to carry fewer than nine passengers will continue to be excluded, as will buses of any size that are hired out on a 'driveyourself' basis. Amendments under this head will extend the existing gift provisions of the income tax law which confer deductions for gifts of the value of $2 or more to specified funds, authorities or institutions in Australia. One extension will introduce a scheme to authorise deductions for gifts to certain public funds maintained for the relief of persons in deVeloping countries. That proposal, which has been most warmly received, was announced in the 1980-81 Budget Speech. It was supplemented by a ministerial statement on 18 September 1980 which listed 22 organisations that are to qualify for the concession, with effect from that date. The proposed arrangements will accommodate the decisions announced in that statement and, as well, will make provision for further additions to the list of eligible organisations and funds. Under the legislative scheme proposed in the Bill, gifts made to a public fund established by an organisation approved for purposes of the scheme by the Minister for Foreign Affairs may qualify for deduction. It will be necessary that the Treasurer be satisfied that a particular fund is for the relief of persons in a country that is certified by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be a developing country. A further requirement is that Tourist Buses the Treasurer-by notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette-declare the fund to be an eligible fund for purposes of the scheme. Generally, gifts to an eligible fund will be deductible from the date of the Gazette declaring its eligibility. Transitional arrangements will apply so that gifts made to a fund maintained by one of the 22 organisations nominated in the ministerial statement may qualify for deduction when made after 18 September 1980. Other amendments will mean that gifts to the International Disaster Emergencies Committee African relief appeal will qualify for deduction when made after 30 June 1980. Further amendments will ensure that deductions are available for gifts to the IDEC Kampuchean relief appeal made after 30 June 1980 when the present authorisation of deductions was to have terminated. The Bill will also authorise deductions for gifts to the Herbert Vere Evatt Memorial Foundation made after 16 January 1981 and for gifts made after 23 December 1980 to a public fund that is established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing religious instruction in government schools in Australia. This later amendment places on a general basis a right of deduction now contained in the law in respect of a limited range of bodies. Gifts Tax Avoidance I turn now to remaining provisions of the Bill designed to deal with a variety of income tax avoidance practices. With one qualification that I shall specify later, the amendments have all been foreshadowed in announcements I made last year on 5 March, 24 June and 4 August and on 30 January this year. With the introduction of this Bill, all proposals for action against specific schemes of tax avoidance foreshadowed in announcements I have made will have b-n given legislative form. I also expect that, before the House rises for the winter recess, new general anti-avoidance provisions will be brought before it for consideration. Section 36A Schemes The Bill proposes the amendments foreshadowed in my statement of 30 January 1981. These are designed to provide a counter to tax avoidance schemes that set out to exploit the special provisions of section 36A of the income tax law that apply to changes in interests in trading stock, such as changes that occur on the formation of a partnership. This exploitation takes place under arrangements whereby a person who has, for example, some cattle about to be sold or a crop ready to be harvested, enters into a partnership with a company controlled by the promoter of the scheme. The cattle or the - rop, as the case may be, is transferred to the partnership for an amount roughly equivalent to market value. However, a special right of election available under section 36A is used so that the property is treated for tax purposes as having been transferred at the substantially lower tax value at which it would have been brought to account if the transfer had not taken place. The net result is that the former owner realises an amount close to market value of the property, but is taxed only on the substantially lower value. The amendments proposed will make an election under the section ineffective where the person who disposes of an interest in relevant property receives consideration in respect of the disposal that is substantially more than the amount that might reasonably have been expected if the property had been valued at the low tax value applicable as a result of the election. The consequence of the ineffectiveness of an election in these circumstances will be that the person will be treated as having disposed of the property at its market value. Transfers made in ordinary family or commercial dealing are specifically excluded from the scope of the amendments. These amendments will apply generally to changes in ownership or interests occurring after 30 January 1981. However, consistent with action taken previously by the Government to debar the carry-forward of paper losses resulting from avoidance schemes, the Bill will ban the carryforward from one year to another of such tax losses resulting from earlier section 36A schemes, with first effect forJh- income year 1980-81. Trust Stripping Schemes Changes that I outlined on 5 March 1980 to deal with variants of the trust stripping arrangements against which remedial legislation was enacted early in 1979 are the next matter covered by the Bill. These arrangements, which sought to free from tax altogether the trading profits and other income of trusts, commonly entailed a specially introduced nominal beneficiary being made presently entitled to income of the trust that was to be stripped. By this means, the trustee was relieved of any tax liability in respect of the trust income. The arrangements were at the same time designed so that not only did the special beneficiary escape tax, but the family from which the income was diverted received the benefit of it in atax-free capital form. The 1979 amendments are contained in section 100A of the Income Tax Assessment Act and operate to treat income to which a beneficiary is nominally made presently entitled under reimbursement arrangements of this type as income of the trust estate to which no beneficiary is presently entitled. The trustee is thus liable to be taxed on the income at the maximum rate of personal income tax, which for 1980-81 is 60 per cent. The variants of the trust-stripping arrangements with which this Bill deals exploit the exclusion from the 1979 amendments of income of a trust estate to which a beneficiary becomes presently entitled in the capacity of a trustee cif another trust estate. That exclusion was intended to ensure that section 100A would apply only in relation to the last link in a chain of distributions through interposed trusts, thereby removing any possibility of double taxation on income as it passed through the chain. The amendments now proposed will continue the scheme of applying section lOOA to the last nominal beneficiary only, but in a way that aims to prevent the exploitation that has been experienced. For this purpose, the exclusion from section lOOA of income to which a trusteebeneficiary becomes presently entitled is to be limited to so much of that income as is passed on by the trustee as income to which a beneficiary of that trust estate is in turn presently entitled. Further amendments will deny deductions for losses or outgoings incurred under arrangements to which the section applies. This will prevent the section being frustrated through such amounts being available for write-off against other income of the nominal beneficiaries. The amendments will apply generally to trust income paid to, or applied for the benefit of, a,'beneficiary after 5 March 1980 and to losses or outgoings incurred after that date. Expenditure Recoupment Schemes Legislation against expenditure recoupment schemes already exists. It was foreshadowed on 24 September 1978 and now applies to a range of losses and outgoings. Broadly, the legislation applies to deny a deduction where the specifically designated loss or outgoing is incurred under an arrangement whereby the taxpayer or an associate obtains a benefit the amount or value of which, together with the tax advantage sought, effectively recoups the claimed loss or outgoing. In my statement of 4 August 1980 I foreshadowed action to extend the provisions to deal with variants of the recoupment type schemes that had by then been encountered. These involve paper losses generated in producing or marketing films, in operating gold mines, in purchasing consumable supplies and in carrying out market research. The amendments in respect of these variants are to apply with respect to losses or outgoings incurred after 24 September 1978. The decision to do this follows the clear warning given on that day and repeated subsequently. I now make public that more recent information coming from returns of income for 1979-80 indicates that, before my announcement on 4 August 1980, still further schemes of the expenditure recoupment type had been implemented. As in the case of the schemes referred to in that announcement it would appear that promoters of the further schemes had chosen to ignore the Government's repeated warnings. In the light of the information now available, and of the clear government commitment to put an end to expenditure recoupment schemes, the Bill proposes extensions of the existing legislation additional to those I have already announced. These latest identified variants against which remedial action is now proposed involve paper losses generated in acquiring a licence under a copyright existing in computer software; by way of commission for collecting assessable income; by way of a fee in relation to the growing, care and supervision of trees; by way of an amount paid in relation to the enhancement of the value of shares held as trading stock; and by way of a fee in relation to the procuring of master sound recordings. Honourable members would be interested to know that one of these schemes--that built on commissions for collecting assessable income--generated identified claims for deductions for 1979-80 of no less than $1l1m. The additional amendments will also have effect from 24 September 1978. In pursuance of that, I refer to the clear and unambiguous warning given by the Government at that time. They, and the amendments specifically outlined in my statement of 4 August 1980, will ensure that the ban on the carry-forward from one year to another of paper losses created under tax avoidance schemes, and which at present applies to expenditure recoupment arrangements, will apply similarly in respect of all the latest variants. Exempt Bodies In a statement on 24 June 1980, I foreshadowed legislation on tax avoidance through attempts to exploit the tax-exempt status of various entities. As I said at the time, two earlier warnings about the abuse of the privileged status of tax-exempt bodies had gone unheeded, and there was clear evidence that substantial revenue losses were accruing through the use of these bodies as vehicles for diverting taxable income from individuals and companies. I outlined in my statement examples of the kinds of schemes being employed. I do not think it is necessary to describe them in detail again now. Broadly, however, the schemes involved the diversion of income from a person who would otherwise be liable to tax on it to a body that has no tax liability. The exempt body was required to pay to the person from whom the income was diverted, or to an associate of that person, a tax free consideration equal to the greater part of the diverted income. As a fee for its participation it retained a small amount of the income for its own benefit. As mentioned in my statement, the legislation will operate where under a tax avoidance agreement entered into after 24 June 1980 an exempt body provides consideration for property giving rise to diverted income and the consideration is substantially more than the amount that, in the circumstances, would be paid by a taxable public company. The income derived by the exempt body in these circumstances, without deduction of losses or outgoings incurred under or in connection with the tax avoidance agreement, will be subject to tax at the maximum rate of personal tax. These measures will apply only to income derived by exempt bodies from participation in the particular tax avoidance schemes. Their ordinary income will continue to be exempt from tax. Finally, the last, and bulkiest, ,section of the Bill contains a number of formal amendments, incorporating changes in drafting style. These will result in the adoption, in references to other provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, of a 'forward referencing' style. Before C9ncluding, I mention that legislation in pursuance of the Government's commitment to provide tax incentives-for investmentin Australian films is at an advanced stage and will be - brought before the House before the winter recess. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr John Brown) adjourned. INCOME TAX (DIVERTED INCOME) Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time.",55
93,Mr HOWARD,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is closely related to measures contained in the Income Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1981, about which I have just spoken. By reason of those measures income tax is to be charged on income diverted to an exempt body under a tax avoidance arrangement entered into after 24 June 1980. The overall design of the legislation is counteract the exploitation, for tax avoidance purposes, of the privileged status of tax exempt bodies. This Bill will formally impose tax on the diverted income. The rate of tax of 60 per cent proposed by the Bill is the same as that payable a trustee of a trust estate on accumulating trust come and is equal to the maximum rate of perships sonaltax. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on, motion by Mr John Brown) extend adjourned. CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL 1981 Bill presented by Mr Moore, and read a first time.",59
94,Mr MOORE,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The principal purpose of this Bill is to amend Customs Act to give effect to a number of recments ommendations of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. The Roy\ll C-ommission made a large number of recommentrol dations. In many cases only administrative action was recommended or was found to be required on an examination of the recommendations. There has been substantial progress already towards implementation of those recommendations., Other legislative recommendations did not relate to the Customs Act. Some required action by the governments of the States and the Northern Territory. These amendments give effect to the Government's decisions on those of the Royal Commission's recommendations which are considered by the Government to require action by way of amendment to the Customs Act. The Royal Commission recommended that responsibility for narcotics control under the Customs Act in situations beyond the Customs barrier should be transferred from the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to the Australian BILL 1981 Federal Police. This recommendation has been implemented by an Administrative Direction and Administrative Arrangements Order. This Bill Second Reading contains provisions to give clear legislative authority for the division of powers and functions. The particlarly affects the seizure of goods and their custody, claims for recovery of seized goods, avenues of redress and the final disposal of any seized goods which become condemned to the Commonwealth. The proposed amendments are contained in clauses 3,26, 33, 34, 36 and 38. Clause 25 is proposed to implement the recommendation of the Royal Commission that a person seeking to clear goods through Customs to might be required to disclose and prove his identity or the identity of the owner of the goods. This measure is designed to facilitate the apprehension of those importers of illicit narcotic drugs who address the drugs to ficticious persons for collection by by anonymous agents. The Royal' Commission inalso recommended that the Customs control over and aircraft at sea or in air space within three nautical miles of the Australian coast should to the area within 12 nautical miles of the coast. This is consistent with international law and convention. The Bill implements that recommendation-in clauses 12,24 and 29. However, the Bill provides that the limitation to the area within 12 nautical miles will apply only to foreign ships and aircraft. Customs control over Aus- . Second Reading tralian ships and aircraft will be exercisable to the extent consistent, with international law and convention. The Bill also proposes a number 01 amend the ments of a more general nature. These amendflow from a continuing process of review and modernising of the Customs Act. All imported goods become subject to Customs conon importation. They remain subject to this control until they are released by Customs. The control is essential to the Customs barrier against prohibited imports such as narcotics or quarantinable goods. It is also essential to Customs duty collection role. The control usually is exercised. through a system of documentary checks. These necessarily are supplemented by physical examination of a proportion of the imports. the Customs Act imposes responsibilities those who are in possession of goods which are subject to Customs control. They are required keep the goods safely and to produce them or able account for them when so required by Customs. The Customs Act now recognises the passing Customs entries as the principal authority for dealing with imported goods. When the entry is endorsed as passed the entry document remains in the possession of the Customs. It has been necessthe ary to develop administrative procedures for a written authority to be given to the person in posimposed session of the goods. The authority allows son, usually a shipping company or an airline, to deliver the goods for the purposes for which have been entered; for example, for warehousing or for home consumption. It is proposed to give legislative effect to practice by replacing the passing of entry by giving of an authority to deliver the goods. 9 proposes that delivery authorities may be as prescribed by regulation. Almost half of the clauses of the Bill are consequential on these changes. The delivery authority given On the basis of an examination of commercial documents - furnished by the owner of the goods, or his agent. However, intelligence may received from other sources suggesting that narority cotics may be concealed in the goods or thaUhe changes. goods are not properly described in the documents. Provision is made, therefore, to permit an authority to be suspended in order to allow a physical examination of the goods. It is now an offence to move, alter or interfere with goods which are subject to Customs control. This offence is too limited in its present terms. The employee who improperly moves the goods will be liable. The principals, who have the readjourned. sponsibility to keep the goods securely, are not liable for their failure to implement and oversight effective systems for that purpose. Accordingly, clause 5 now proposes that principals should be litime. able for the acts of employees involved in the unauthorised movement of goods which are subject to Customs control. A defence is provided to protect those principals who do take reasonable cautions and exercise due diligence to ensure proper compliance with the Customs Act. Clause 13 proposes an amendment to section 64 to imthof orise regulations to prescribe the time and manner for ships, aircraft and their cargo to be reported to Customs after arriving from overseas. Last year the Customs Act was amended to provide a means.for dealing with refugee boats or other illegally imported vessels. Clause 26 now proposes new sections to supplement those on powers. New section 207 will permit the speedy disposal of a seized vessel that is.too unseaworthy to to be maintained by Customs. Customs will be to dispose of the vessel even though it has not been condemned to the Commonwealth. This will of reduce the costs now incurred in keeping such vessels. New section 208B provides that a person with an interest in the vessel has a right to take proceedings to recover the proceeds of any sale of vessel or the value of any destroyed vessel. New section 208E allows conditions to be on the sale or disposal of ships or aircraft, the perwhich have been condemned to the Commonwealth. By clause 30 they may again be forfeited if they the conditions are not complied with. Customs Tariff Proposals are introduced into the Parliament from time to time following that Government decisions to alter the customs duty the on imported goods. These Proposals are usually Clause incorporated into a Customs Tariff Amendment Bill or a Customs Tariff Validation Bill. Clause 28 proposes to amend section 226 to extend the validity period of Customs Tariff Proposals from six will usually be months to 12 months. The proposed extension of the life of the Proposals will reduce the number of Customs Tariff be Bills. This will not diminish in any way the authof Parliament to scrutinise Customs Tariff Provision is made in clause 35 to allow Customs Tariff Notices to have up to six months retrospective effect, except where the proposed alteration would increase the duty payable. The Bill represents a desirable advance towards a modernised Customs Act and will assist effective Customs administration. 1 commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr John Brown) EXCISE AMENDMENT BILL 1981 Bill presented by Mr Moore, and read a first . Second Reading",59
95,Mr MOORE,INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend section 114 the Excise Act 1901 to extend the validity period of Excise Tariff Proposals from six months to 12 months. This amendment is being proposed as a consequence of the Customs Amendment Bill 1981. That Bill similarly proposes an extension to the validity period of Customs Tariff Proposals. Excise Tariff Proposals are introduced into the Parliament from time to time following a Government decision to alter excise duty. It has been the practice to incorporate the Tariff Proposals into an Excise Tariff Amendment Bill. These are normally introduced late in a parliamentary sitting. When an Excise Tariff Amendment Bill is unable to achieve passage prior to six months after a proposal is introduced, it has also been the practice to validate that proposal by an Excise Tariff Validation Bill. This proposed amendment will have the effect of reducing the number of Excise Tariff Bills. It will not, however, diminish in any way, the authority of the Parliament to scrutinise excise tariff changes as they occur. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr John Brown) adjourned. NA",60
96,Mr MOORE,TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE AUTHORITY,"For the information of honourable members, I present the report of the Temporary Assistance Authority on certain parts for hearing aids. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1981 Consideration resumed from 6 May, on motion by Mr Howard: That the Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Willis had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, House is of the opinion that the Bill is deficient in that it fails to give effect to the Law Reform Commission's Report ""Privacy and the census"" that identified census information should be held in Archives with access forbidden for 75 years, except for strictly limited access for purposes of medical research'. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr MACKellar) read a third time.

97,Mr MACKELLAR,NATIONAL HEALTH,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 1981, which was passed by this House on Thursday of last week, provided that the proposed Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal would, at intervals of not more than 12 months, hold an inquiry into the rate of remuneration paid to chemists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. Our colleagues in another Second Reading place queried whether holding an inquiry meant immediately handing down the findings flowing from that inquiry. Accordingly, our colleagues have amended this Bill to change the emphasis from holding an inquiry at no more than 12monthly intervals to making it mandatory to hand down the findings of an inquiry into remuneration at no more than 12-monthly intervals. The Government supports the amendment the passed by the Senate as it puts beyond any doubt the Government's intention that no more than 12 recommendation of the Australian months should elapse between reviews of chemists' remuneration, including the publication of the results of those reviews. I reiterate for the benefits of honourable members that has it has always been of concern to me that under the present joint committee frameworks inquiries tended to be prolonged to the detriment of chemists. 1 commend the amendments to the Committee. Third Reading",61
98,Dr BLEWETT,NATIONAL HEALTH,"1 think the Minister for Health (Mr MACKellar) will now recognise that the combination of vacillation and hasty legislation equals confusion. The fact that the biggest proportion of yesterday's proceedings in the Senate was devoted to dealing with the problems that arose from the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill confirms the remarks I have just made. I stress again, as I stressed in the second reading debate, that some of the problems with this Bill could have been avoided if there had been adequate time for discussion within both parties-not simply the Opposition but, quite clearly from yesterday's debate, within the Government. We on this side of the Committee are disappointed that the Government was not able to accept the further amendment to permit the proposed Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, if it so desired, to have a power to make retrospective judgments in its determinations. However, we were pleased that in the debate that took place in the Senate certain points were clarified. The amendment we are now discussing makes it quite clear that there will never be a gap greater than 12 months between determinations. Of course, it is open to the Tribunal to meet within shorter periods. We also understand from the discussion that past costs can clearly be taken into account by the Tribunal in its determinations. As I said, we are disappointed that the Minister for Health (Mr MACKellar) was not prepared to permit another amendment. It seems that he was extraordinarily stubborn not to allow that amendment. At the moment, a kind of machismo seems to have gripped the Government. The only explanation for the extraordinary behaviour in the last couple of days of the Easter Island man and his side-kick, the Treasurer (Mr Howard), is that somehow they felt that their political machismo was being undermined. It seems to me that on this legislation the Minister, after much vacillation, has simply been stubborn. We could have got a somewhat better result if he had been more sympathetic to the amendment relating to a retrospective element in the determination. However, we are glad that the debate in the Senate made clear something which was not made clear in this House in the short time we had the Bill before us, that is, that as part of the transitional arrangements retrospective considerations will enter into the first determination. As I understand it, the Tribunal when making its first determination this year will under clause 10 (2) be able to employ considerations retrospective to 1 May 1980. We support the clarifying amendment which has just been moved by the Minister. It probably simply spells out something that was implicit in the Bill. No doubt this is a suitable accommodation of some of the difficulties seen by the senators. Indeed, it may have bought off some of the persistence for an even broader amendment. We certainly support the claryifying amendment doing this in the spirit in which we have tried to support this legislation throughout. I think it is most desirable that we get this Bill through as quickly as possible. There has been much delay in coming to a decision to provide for a means of adjudicating on pharmacists' remuneration. Therefore, we support this amendment as we believe it clarifies the Bill on a crucial point. We give it our support. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (TENDERS) BILL 1981 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 April, on motion by MrMoore: That the Bill be now read a second time.",61
99,Mr MOORE,NATIONAL HEALTH," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have your indulgence to suggest that the House have a general debate covering this Bill, the Customs Securities (Penalties) Bill 1981, and the Customs Undertakings (Penalties) Bill 1981, as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.",62
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL HEALTH," Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these three measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",62
101,Mr JOHN BROWN,NATIONAL HEALTH," The Customs Amendment (Tenders) Bill 1981 and cognate Bills give effect to one of the decisions made last year by the Government on the assistance arrangements to be afforded the clothing and footwear industries. The principal Bill, the Customs Amendment (Tenders) Bill 1981, provides for a scheme to call for and deal with tenders for import quotas on a range of textile, clothing and footwear products. The Bill includes provisions requiring successful tenderers to give an undertaking to utilise fully this quota and to provide a security to Customs in respect of penalties which may become payable for a breach of such undertakings. The other two Bills-the minor Bills-provide for the imposition of penalties for breach of undertakings and for failure to provide securities. I should like to indicate at the outset that the Opposition does not oppose any of these three Bills. However, I indicate also that the Opposition is not entirely satisfied with the assistance arrangements in respect of the textiles, clothing and footwear industries which have been adopted by the Government, and of which these three Bills form an important part. Levels and forms of industry assistance are now among the most important economic issues facing Australia. The Opposition shares the view expressed in the report of the Crawford Study Group on Structural Adjustment which recommended that levels of protection afforded Australian industry should be reduced in the long term. However, we do not believe that sudden or dramatic reductions in protection are warranted, particularly at a time of high unemployment such as presently exists in Australia. While the rate of unemployment is at least 6 per cent of the work force, there is no logic in reducing protection so as to throw even more people out of work. I am sure that even this heartless Government would agree with those sentiments. The Opposition's commitment to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries is based on the realisation that the continued employment of about 120,000 Australians in these industries is essential. Many of these jobs are provided in regional centres with few alternative job opportunities. Many of the jobs are held by workers who lack the skills appropriate to alternative areas of industry. To reduce employment even more dramatically than is already occurring is not to achieve a restructing of industry. Rather it is to create more massive unemployment and to concentrate it in certain regions. We cannot countenance that as a proposition. Having acknowledged the need at this time to maintain protection levels, it is also important to determine which are the most appropriate forms of assistance. We in the Opposition happen to believe that import quotas are appropriate in the case of certain industries, and the textiles, clothing and footwear industries are among these. It is perfectly clear that only quotas can provide the needed degree of certainty to the industry to enable it confidently to invest in plant which will help it produce a more competitive product in the future. These Bills provide for the administration of import quotas on a two-tiered basis. Most of the quota is to be allocated to bona fide importers who have been involved in importing in recent years. However, a small proportion is to be sold by tender. Because the basic quota is to be fixed for the next seven years, the amount to be sold by tender will increase, assuming that even under this Government there is market growth over the period. W j; The Opposition recognises that the main benefit of a base quota allocation is stability for I most of the importing industry. We recognise also that sale of quota maximises the efficiency of the importing sector and at the same time the auction system ensures that the maximum feasible revenue is gained by the Government rather than by private profiteers. While recognising that there is a trade-off between stability and the benefits of quota sale, it nevertheless seems unfortunate that the profits to be gained by those enjoying base quota allocations will always be greater than those to be gained under sale quota, assuming, of course, that the duty rate bids for sale quota reflect the high, effective rates of protection which import quotas convey. The duty rate on base quota is to be fixed at 50 per cent, whereas sale quota could well involve rates two or even three times this level. The sale by tender system will reflect the real protection afforded by the imposition of import quotas. It appears to the Opposition that the profits to be gained by this system should accrue to General Revenue as they would under a tariff system rather than to a privileged group of importers. Indeed, it is possible that, through strong bidding for sale quotas by base quota holders, these profits could be unfairly maximised. These opportunities for profiteering should be overcome. As a minimum measure, the rate of duty on base quota should be reconsidered annually and adjusted in line with the trend of prices revealed by the tender system. The differential between base and sale quota duty rates should never be allowed to become excessive, if indeed it should be allowed to prevail at all. The recent and continuing revaluation of the Australian dollar upwards is causing an increasing disparity between the free on board price of imports and the price of locally produced products. In these circumstances, windfall profits are likely to be made by base quota holders. The Opposition is of the opinion that this should not be allowed to continue. Indeed, this is only one area of concern to the Opposition. This problem is paralleled by the need to ensure that the/price levels on the Australian market are the lowest possible in respect of locally produced goods. This requires a greater degree of planning in the industry. The Opposition has long been of the view that complex and interrelated industries such as textiles, clothing and footwear should be given closer attention by government. It is not good enough to give an industry a level of protection which is possibly the highest in our history and then pretend that we can leave the rest to the market. History proves that market forces are not effective in this area. We believe the Government has its head in the sand when it comes to the management of the industrial sector of the enconomy. On the one hand, at enormous cost it quite properly protects the private sector from the full impact of a free market environment but, on the other hand, it pretends to deregulate industry by irresponsible actions to remove proper and beneficial interventions such as price justification. We know, of course, what has happened to the Prices Justification Tribunal in the last few days. The Opposition believes that industry-specific policies are needed for industries such as these and that these policies should be appropriately devised and managed by industry authorities established for the purpose. In addition to these general concerns about the administration of assistance arrangements for the textile, clothing and footwear industries, we have some particular concerns with the provisions of these Bills. We are particularly concerned that the arrangements for quotas do not allow a small number of large importers to tie up the market. Small firms must not be unreasonably excluded, and competition should be maintained. In this respect we hope that due consideration will be given by the Government to the call by Mr Clive Rodger of the Apparel Manufacturers Association of New South Wales that the security required under the legislation not be too high so as to be an overburden on small firms. The Opposition has also been concerned that the right to buy and sell quotas is not abused and exploited by firms which are not bona fide importers. We understand that the officers of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs will have stronger powers under the legislation in this respect. We are very happy about that. However, it is always essential that adequate staff is applied to these tasks. We call on the Government to ensure that its manic determination to bash the public sector does not result in costly losses in this area. In conclusion, I reiterate that the Opposition supports the Bills as a desirable improvement of the import quota system, notwithstanding its concern that there are a number of areas of the Government's assistance arrangements which are poorly conceived.",62
102,Mr DAWKINS,NATIONAL HEALTH,"1 will be extremely brief. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) has made most of the points that one would want to make in discussing the Customs Amendment (Tenders) Bill. I have had brought to my attention the circumstance of a particular importer who is disadvantaged as a result of the measures being discussed here today. I do not want to go into the matter in detail. This person has had a growing business and, because of the nature of the way in which quotas are set, the quota which he will be allocated, as I understand it, will be insufficient for him to continue his business at the level which it has now reached. Therefore, he will be faced with restricting or downgrading the level of his business undertaking. I think this is an unfortunate consequence. Of course, the answer which will be given is that he will be able to tender for an extra quota. But, of courS"", being a very small businessman it is unlikel- that he will be as successful in that operation as other larger operators. I just want to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore). I have mentioned to him that I would like a letter from the man concerned incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read as followsManufacturers Importers Wholesalers P,O. Box 630 Fremantle Western Australia 6160 Telephone National (09) 3356405, International 61 9 335 6405 Bankers Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia 88 High Street Fremantle Western Australia 6160 Mr John Dawkins Ref: to Clothing quotas 25 February 1981 Dear Sir, Further to our discussion regarding looking into the possibility of increasing the amount of clothing we would need to import to retain a viable business. As I explained to you, with the new quota system being introduced as of 1st January 1981. If our quota is based on our base performance for the two year period determined by the Federal Government, this would mean to us a complete loss of our wholesale business. We have been importing clothing for more than five years, our total imports during this time have been small due to the lack of assistance given to us from Customs Tariff during this time. We were informed that certain items were dutiable, and as such did not import certain types of clothing such as rayon Batik. We were informed during 1975 to 1978 that all handicraft clothing must be made from natural materials such as cotton. We have now come to realise that Batik rayon is not dutiable, and we could have been importing rayon Batik without paying the duty as told before. We have had difficulty finding suitable cotton material, and as such, were forced to import lower quantities than we had wanted at this time. During the last eighteen months, our imports of clothing have increased 1000 per cent, giving us the opportunity to develop our wholesale business. We now employ one shop assistant plus my wife and myself, and were looking at employing more staff as our business grew. If we are hit with quotas based on our base performance for the period determined by Federal Government, this would mean an end to our business as such. During the five years I have been in business, we have worked seven days a week, sometimes a twenty hour day just to build our business to what it is today. tioned that overnight all the ness can be undone through no fault of our own, just at a time when we can slow down to a 6 day week, 10 hour day. We have built up a good clientel for our clothing during the last eighteen months, and now see everything we have worked for ending, just at a time when we should be receiving the reward we have worked for. I have enclosed a list detailing clothing imported during the base performance determined by Federal Government, and sincerly hope you will look into this problem for me.

106,Mr DAWKINS,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"The prime purpose of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill that we are debating today is to adjust payments to schools and to tertiary institutions to take into account cost increases which have occurred in relation to certain items since those grants were introduced. The Bills particularly relate to cost increases last year and this year. As well as that, the opportunity has been taken to include a number of other amendments to the funding arrangements for schools and tertiary institutions. These are not of any contentious nature. For instance, some of them are consequent upon some amalgamations which have taken place between colleges of advanced education and a university and a CAE in Tasmania. A rearrangement of funds is necessary as a result. In the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill, the opportunity has been taken by the Government to put into effect some of the promises which were made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) prior to the last election. I must say that, because of the abandonment of so many election promises, it is a very rare event indeed to have an opportunity to discuss the fulfilment of some. Here we have an instance where action is being taken to commence the process of implementing these election undertakings. Of course, we know, as the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) has indicated on previous occasions, that eduction funding is considered annually. So, we may well have in 12 months time some abandonment of these promises as well. At least we should be thankful for the fact that this Government is, in fact, moving on this occasion to implement promises. The first relates to the undertaking to provide. $25m over three years in the form of capital assistance for non-government schools for them to provide new places. This legislation provides the first instalment of that $25m-that is, $7.4m for this year-in pursuit of that objective. The next Government undertaking which is put into effect by this legislation is to compress the current six levels under which non-government schools are described into three. On this occasion levels two and three are joined. The same subsidy arrangements will apply to those former levels. There is also a new program of assistance for the education of the severely handicapped both in institutions and in their own homes. This is a very welcome initiative. Finally, the Government has ta-en the opportunity to commence the implemeiltation of its progralh"" to provide support for part time nonprofit ethnic schools which are providing supplementary courses in community language and cultural education. I emphasise that the Opposition does not intend to oppose these Bills, but it takes the opportunity to move amendments to these two Bills. I have an amendment in relation to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill and a further amendment in relation to the· States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill. In relation to the motion that the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill be read a second time, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substi-tuting the following words: 'whilst not denying the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the reduction in the activities of the Schools Commission as announced in the Review of Commonwealth Functions in that: (1) the contraction of the information collection and dissemination activities of the Commission constitutes an obstacle to the debate on education policy and will limit accountability for education expenditure, and (2) the withdrawal of the administrative functions of the Commission at the State level will limit and downgrade the services the Commission provides particularly to the non-government sector'. As I indicated, I will move an amendment in relation to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill. Whilst I do not formally move it now, I indicate that the text of that amendment will be: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not denying the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the ill-considered and grossly inequitable changes to the funding, organisation and financing of students in tertiary education as announced in the Review of Commonwealth Functions, in that: (1) the re-introduction of fees is not only a breach of an election undertaking but will grossly disadvantage students with limited means and will compromise Australia's research effort; (2) the gutting of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme will confirm tertiary education as the preserve of the rich; and (3) the heavy-handed threat in the review to 30 colleges of advanced education is based on the wholly false premise that the consolidation of single purpose colleges will result in cost savings in spite of the Tertiary Education Commission's advice to the contrary'. I take this opportunity to move one amendment and to foreshadow another because, whilst the Bills before us do bestow certain benefits in relation to education in this country, they pale into insignificance in terms of the damage that is being done to education throughout Australia as a result of the Government's decisions flowing from the Review of Commonwealth Functions. It is extraordinarily ironic that we should be debating these Bills, which are supposed to be beneficial to education, at the same time as we have before us the results of the continuing assault that this Government is waging against education. The decisions which have been announced-I will go through them in some detail in a moment-simply represent a continuing part of the Government's resentment of an education system which is open to all, free to all and which provides a quality of education which we all should be aiming for. In fact, this Government has not been interested in maintaining the high level of education in this country. It has been concerned to restrict access, particularly at the tertiary level. It has been concerned to attack the level of research undertaken in tertiary institutions and it has been concerned to downgrade the activities of the Schools Commission, which has transformed school education in this country not only in the government sector but also in the non-government sector. I mention briefly the decisions which have been made in the context of education as a result of the Lynch committee and to comment on the ways in which these decisions will seriously damage education in this country. In the first instance the Government has decided to re-impose fees for those students undertaking second or higher degrees in universities and colleges of advanced education. The fees will apply to those students who will enroll for the first time in 1982. The Government has decided that the fees should not apply to 'recognised double degree and diploma combinations. It has also decided that the fees will not be paid by those students in receipt of Commonwealth Government and university postgraduate awards. The scale of fees has not been announced because the Government has said that the level of fees will be set in the Budget context. The Government has said that there will be a reduction in the amount of funding to the colleges and universities as a result of its decision on the Tertiary Education Commission report to take account of the fee income which the universities and colleges might expect from the imposition of these fees. I think the important pomt to remember about this is that this is just a repeat of a proposal which was first foreshadowed by this Government in 1976. An identical proposition was put up at that time but not proceeded with. The reason it was to reintroduce not proceeded with was the Minister at the time, surance Senator Carrick, indicated quite clearly that the - posaIs costs of raising the fee income would probably ible reintroduction of tertiary fees. exceed the revenue which was collected. That task has been given to the universities and colrepresented leges. It is something they have not sought and they do not want. This is clear from the fact the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee in 1976 strongly opposed the introduction of these fees. It has on this occasion also indicated that a great mistake on the part of the Government impose them. There are already indications that the universities, particularly the staff at universities, are highly resentful of the introduction of these fees. I want to read out two communications which I have received in the last couple of days. I suspect that this is the beginning of a barrage of com"" plaints which all members of parliament will receive as a result of this grossly ill-considered decision. The first cortununication comes from the Monash University Staff Association and it states: . . . urges immediate reconsideration of proposal to introduce fees for later degrees and to close Educational Research and Development Committee. Later degree students make productive contributions to research and to maintenance of professional standards. The consequences of enactment of these proposals will be maximum damage to the nation's human capital for minimal financial savings. In saying that the Monash University Staff Association simply affirms the remarks which I and the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) were making yesterday in another debate on a related matter. The Department of Economics of the University of Wollongong has also opposed the reintroduction of fees for second and higher degree students without a substantial expansion and upgrading of the Commonwealth Post-Graduate Award Scheme. It goes on to complain: about the way in which the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme will be tightened. I will come back to that in a moment. These complaints are not coming particularly from the students concerned, they are corning from the staff association in one instance and the academics from the Department of Economics in the other instance. The reason they are complaining is that they know the value of the contribution post-graduate students make to the research effort in universities and therefore to the research effort throughout Australia. The other aspect about the introduction of these fees is that it is a clear breach of a pre-election commitment given by the current Minister for Education, Mr Fife. In October of last year he said: There continues to be speculation about Government plans fees for tertiary education. I have given an aspublicly and I repeat that assurance, that no proare being considered by the Government for the.poss. To any fair-minded person, that simple statement a commitment not to reintroduce fees at the tertiary level. On this occasion the Governthat ment has reintroduced fees, although only for post-graduate and second degree students. Clearly it is an absolute abrogation of that undertaking it is which was given by the Minister for Education to last year. I want the House and everybody in Australia to note what the Minister has done and to take that on board because, when presenting the report of the Lynch committee, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) solemnly declared that it was not the Government's intention to reintroduce fees at the undergraduate level. What has to be remembered is that this is just another worthless Liberal Party, Liberal Government undertaking. It is just as worthless as the one that the Minister gave in October last year. What we are seeing now is the thin end of the wedge in regard to the wholesale reintroduction of fees at all levels in tertiary education. In answer to a question from me on 25 March this year, Mr Fife clearly said: that the matter of fees was something which had to be taken into account in the annual budgetary considerations. So it is quite clear that this is the decision for this year. The decision is not to reimpose fees at the undergraduate level next year, but it is no guarantee that they will not be introduced at some stage in the very near future. Therefore I think we have to continue to emphasise the damage that the reintroduction of fees could make and would make if we had a reintroduction at the undergraduate level. I want to refer briefly to a survey which has just been completed at the Macquarie University; a university, by the way, which happens to be in the electorate of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). This is a preliminary paper. The survey was conducted only in the last couple of weeks. It indicated that 40 per cent of students would defer or withdraw from undergraduate education if they were forced to pay fees of even a fairly nominal amount of $300 a year. A survey was done in 1976 for the Education Research and Development Committee. That survey was supplemented by other surveys. What has come out of the Macquarie University survey in the last couple of weeks indicates that the resistance to paying fees is very much greater than was thought to be the case at that time. If fees of $1,000 had been imposed.on law students this year half of those students, who one would expect to go into professions with fairly high incomes after graduation, would not have enrolled in law school. The Government has to recognise that the imposition of fees does provide a direct and severe deterrent to people to continue with their tertiary education. The fact that the Government is, at this time, imposing fees for post-graduate students and for second degree students means that this will severely disadvantage the most needy of those students. Clearly, the only assistance available in the form of post-graduate awards is awarded on the basis of merit and not on the basis of need. Therefore, students who are quite successful and who can make a positive contribution will not be able to afford fees unless they are amongst the most able students who are lucky enough to be in receipt of post-graduate awards of one kind or another. ' I think the point is that the Government, obviously, thinks that it will receive a fair amount of revenue as a result of the introduction of this measure. But inquiries and calculations that I have made show the Government is likely to receive not more than one per cent of the total amount which the Commonwealth spends on tertiary education as a result of the imposition of these fees. Not all post-graduate students will pay, but in addition many of those students who will be forced to pay will be discouraged from enrolling and, therefore, the Government will not receive fees from them. So, in return for imposing a measure damaging to Australia's research effort, highly disruptive to university education as a whole and highly disruptive to the administration of universities-these fees cannot be collected for nothing, as all that will be raised in the form of revenue is about one per cent of the amount that it currently spends on tertiary education. I refer quickly to the proposals that the Government has in mind in relation to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and loans. I do not want to go into all the ways in which TEAS has declined over the last few years; but we know that a declining number of people are receiving TEAS benefits and, particularly, that a declining number of people are receiving the maximum benefit. I did go into this matter in some detail in an earlier debate in this House. We cannot look at the loans scheme in isolation from TEAS, because the Government has stated clearly that from the time it introduces the student loans scheme it will set the benefits in relation to TEAS i.n the knowledge that extra supplementary assistance will be available through the loans scheme. There is absolutely no doubt as to what that means. The Government will either freeze the TEAS benefits or reduce them in order to force more and more people to take out loans to support themselves through tertiary education. This is at odds with a recommendation from the committee which the Government set up to inquire into the student loans scheme and which reported in 1977. That committee, the Butcher committee, said at the time that any loans scheme ought to be introduced purely as a supplement to the existing system of tertiary education assistance, that is, it did not say that a loans scheme should replace a tertiary allowance or even replace it in part. It said that there was a case for the introduction of a loans scheme on a supplementary basis for students who were unable to support themselves entirely on the existing level of TEAS. That is not what the Government is saying on this occasion. It is forecasting that TEAS will be gutted. It will be available to fewer and fewer people. Clearly it will be available at a lower level of benefit than is the case at the moment. That will compel students to take out loans in order to pay their basic living costs. There will be great resistance, particularly students with poorer backgrounds, to incurring debts at this time of their lives. They are being asked to incur a debt at the age of 18 or 19 which they would pay back upon graduation. It is the Government's theory that once they graduate and obtain a job they ought to repay to society some of the investment which society has made in their education. It is a grossly unfair system in practise. I refer again to the Macquarie University's survey made in the last couple of weeks. Four hundred and eleven students were asked how they predicted their ability to repay the loan. Only 6 per. cent said that they would certainly be able to repay it, 25 per cent said that most likely they would be able to repay it and something like two-thirds said either that it was unlikely that they would be able to repay the loan or that they would not be able to repay that loan. If that is what they thought, they would not take out a loan in the first place. The reason they doubt their ability to repay the loan is that these students are aware of the high level of graduate unemployment that exists in this country. They are a ware also of the fact that once they graduate in their early twenties that will be just the time when they will incur other debts for houses or cars or whatever. They do not want the extra burden of repaying the cost of having to support themselves through their university or college course. Repayment may be possible for those people who float straight into highly remunerative occupations upon graduation, but that will not be the experience of most gratuates. The people who will be most in need of extra support will be least likely to be attracted to the loans schemes. I urge the Government to reconsider this matter. It is certainly not a cost saving device. In short term it will cost the Government more as it makes available the funds for the loans scheme. It is true that over time some of the money will be repaid. The Government.expects that it will save, presumably by gutting the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. But at the same time, this year and next year it will certainly cost the Government more. I suggest that the Government carefully reconsider the question of introducing a student loans scheme. It will discourage people from entering tertiary education. I desperately hope that it is not .,the intention of the Government to discourgepeople from going on to higher education. Already we have appalling falling levels of participation in higher secondary and post secondary education in Australia. What we really ought to be attempting to do is increase the number of young people who are participating in education, not providing further serious impedifrom ments to their continued participation in education. I refer to one other matter which relates to the area of schools education, that is, the quite absurd decision of the Government to close down the Curriculum Development Centre. The Curriculum Development Centre was established by-Mr Ruddock-If the States want it they can contribute. Mr DAWKINSThe honourable member for Dundas says that the States can contribute. I am sure the States are going to be terribly enthusiastic about making all kinds of contributions to the Commonwealth from now on. Mr Ruddock-----oIf it is useful they will be enthusiastic. .' Mr DA WKINSWhat the honourable member for Dundas has to remember is that the States now know that the Commonwealth has withheld from them $70m which it could have made avaihtble for this and other purposes. They are not going to be enthusiastic. They are not going to be the slightest bit enthusiastic about taking over on a voluntary basis functions which are quite clearly national functions, Federal Government functions, and have been at least since the inception of the Curriculum Development Centre. The decision in respect of the Curriculum Development Centre is not a huge matter of national importance, but it does highlight very clearly the absurdity of many of the decisions in the education area which were made by the Government as a result of the Lynch committee. The Government has just spent $200,000 on refurbishing premises for the Curriculum Development Centre the in Lyneham. It was only on 18 March, something like six weeks ago, that the current Minister for Education opened those new premises. He said that he was very pleased to have been invited to perform the official opening of the new premises. He then went on: In the five years since its establishment the Curriculum Development Centre has undertaken a formidable array of projects which have resulted in an enrichment of the fabric of Australian education. He further said: Perhaps the highlight of the Centre's efforts was the release last year of the discussion paper Australian Schools' which has been acclaimed both in Australia and internationally as an important contribution to this aspect of the education debate. He went on: I am sure that when public reaction to the paper has been assessed and analysed a refreshing approach to curriculum through a core curriculum concept will result. This exercise is, however, by no means an isolated undertaking. In co-operation with the State education agencies, the Curriculum Development Centre has produced a most impressive array of curriculum Through its work the Centre has demonstrated to Australian educators, and others portance of on-going curriculum development, as well as the value of having identifiable areas of specific curriculum focus, as our education system strives change. That is what the Minister thought just six weeks ago when he went over to turn the key at the CDC premises in Lyneham. He is to go back in a couple of weeks time to put up the shutters. That is a most deplorable turn-around. I would like to know what it is that has possessed the Minister to have such a complete reversal of attitude in just sixweeks. I take the point of the honourable member for Dundas. I certainly hope the States will contribute to the costs of continuing the CDC although not because I think it is their obligation to do so. I do not think it is. This is a national task which costs the Commonwealth only about $2.5m a year. It is not an expensive undertaking, and already the States are making a contribution of just under $lm to the cost of running the place anyway. It is just a stupid decision of the Commonwealth. I hope that the States will come to the party and keep the centre going, though I might say that the chances of the States responding in that way would be much greater if the Commonwealth would turn round and hand over the $70m which, in my opinion, it deceitfully withheld the other week from the States. I wish to raise one other matter and I refer to the quite short-sighted decision of the Government to restrict the activities of the Schools Commission. The Schools Commission has been making an invaluable contribution to the education debate in this country by the provision of information and the dissemination of that information. Through the activities of the Schools Commission we in this place and others around Australia have been able to make a more informed contribution to the education debate and have been more left aware of the amount and direction of education expenditure in this country. The Government's decision to contract that activity is most unforturesponsible. nate and undemocratic and will result in serious problems for government and non-government entitled 'Core Curriculum for schools.",65

109,Mr COLEMAN,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"1 support the Bills before the House, but before speaking in particular on the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1981 I seek the House's indulgence for a moment. I want to take this opportunity to thank the people of the Wentworth division for electing me as their representative in this historic House and also those hundreds of members and supporters of the Liberal Party who in the period from my pre-selection as candidate in March to my election as a member in April worked so hard in the campaign. I will strive to justify the trust that they have placed in me. The division of Wentworth is a Liberal Party stronghold in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. As some members of the Opposition frequently noted during the recent by-election, Wentworth has never been held by the Australian Labor Party, although nowadays, as a result of boundary changes, it has some booths where the Labor Party wins the support of a majority of voters. It is my intention as well as my duty to serve them all, regardless of party allegiance. The division of Wentworth has always been well represented in this House by members who have played a major role in the national life of the country. One need only mention the three members who preceded me: Sir Eric Harrison, who in his 25 years in this House served in many ministeries before becoming Australian High Commissioner in London; Leslie Bury, C.M.G., who also held a variety of portfolios with distinction; and Robert Ellicott, now the Honourable Mr Justice Ellicott of the Federal Court. Robert Ellicott, my immediate predecessor, set a standard that I can only hope to emulate. He has a legacy which speaks for itself. I am referring not only to his great reputation for integrity but also to the variety of measures for which he was He established the Federal Court, the office of Ombudsman, the National Institute of Sport, Art Bank, the National Women's Advisory Council, to mention only a few. He introduced tax incentives for film makers, he completed the purchase of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and he introduced self-government to Norfolk Island. As a local member and not as a Minister Mr Ellicott established the Inner City Legal Services Centre in Oxford Street in the electorate of Wentworth. I have mentioned these illustrations of his achievements only to indicate the loss to this Parliament which his elevation to the Bench represents. However, it may be that Robert Ellicott has not yet really resigned from politics. So intermeshed now are legislation and litigation, parliament and the judiciary, that as Mr Justice Ellicott he will, I am sure, continue to playa major role in the public life of this country. Turning now to the measures before the House, I am grateful for the opportunity to make my maiden speech in this chamber on the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill, not only because it was introduced by an old colleague and friend from the Parliament of New South Wales but also because in one package it expresses so much of the philosophy of the Liberal Party. The Bill expresses the Liberal Party's real commitment to freedom of choice in education, the importance it attaches to the rights of minority ethnic cultures in the Australian community and its concern to assist the severely handicapped among us. I will start with the third theme of the Bill and the clauses which provide for the introduction of a new scheme to encourage the development of educational programs for those victims of life's genetic lottery or of other afflictions-the severely handicapped children in institutions or homes. This measure represents the adoption of the 1979 Queensland study 'A Survey of Special Education in Australia' prepared for the Schools Commission by the Fred and Eleanor Schonell Education Research Centre in the University of Queensland. That survey estimated-one can only estimate-that there are about 108,000 handicapped Australian children and adolescents. These are children who are blind or visually handicapped, deaf or partly deaf, physically handicapped and suffering, for example, from cerebral palsy or spina bifida and those severely or mildly mentally handicapped. For generations voluntary organisations and the State educational authorities have had or have assumed the responsibility for assisting parents in the education of these children. In recent years the Commonwealth has accepted its share of responsibility in this field both in research and in the funding of programs. In 1977 the Schools Commission expanded and re-formed its SpecialEducation Advisory Group and decided to undertake the detailed national study which is the basis of this legislation. This year the Commonwealth Government has already committed $17.8m for the Special Education Program and now this Bill commits a further $2m for the severely handicapped. Recent Commonwealth commitments, the Schonell survey and now this Bill represent the beginning of a significant new deal for the severely handicapped, and I congratulate the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) on it. I turn now to a potentially more controversial part of the Bill, that concerned with funding ethnic schools-the multiculturalist theme of the Bill. This grew out of the report prepared by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs called Review of Multicultural and Migrant Education of September 1980. So we are in an area where there has been increasing debate. We hear warnings that multiculturalism is being carried too far, that it will produce a backlash, that earlier generations of ethnic migrants for nearly 200 years were assimilated into Australian society without hearing the word 'ethnic', let alone having special ethnic institutes, programs, and so on. We are being warned that multiculturalism is becoming a growth industry exploited by opportunist, pseudo-idealistic bureaucracies that will in the phrase of one commentator-himself an ethnic migrant, if one must use these termstransform a decent, well-governed Australia into a racist cauldron. One must note such l;,rarnings when they come from sincere and incelligent critics. Obviously if carried to extremes multiculturalism would destroy our national cohesion and identity. I have no doubt these critics will be against this aspect of the Bill before us, yet I do not believe the criticisms are justified. Ethnic community schools, part time and operating after regular school hours and at weekends, have spread across Australia. There are about 600 such schools in which about 100,000 students are taught. They are voluntary organisations and are larely self-financing, although they receive some State government and some foreign embassy support. They are here to stay. They specialise in ethnic languages and cultures and they help cushion the student's transition from the country of origin to Australian life. They reduce the traumas of assimilation. Probably every member in this chamber has been to scores of naturalisation and citizenship ceremonies where speeches have been delivered stressing that the taking of Australian citizenship involves the renunciation of any other citizenship but not of any ethnic heritage. This Bill and these ethnic schools do no more than encourageJhe retention of those heritages-a practice and method that has in any case been maintained, although not on current scales, for generations without any government assistance by the German, Jewish, Greek and Italian communities in Australia. Nevertheless, it is the case that there has been some dissatisfaction, even among sympathisers, with the schools. The 'Review of Multicultural and Migrant Education' reports that the quality of education given in these schools is not uniformly good, that some of the teachers are not adequately qualified, that much of the teaching material is unsatisfactory and that many of the premises used are makeshift. Above all, public authorities really know very little, with any certainty, about the schools. The Bill, in accordance with the recommendations of the review referred to aims to improve this situation. It provides for financial assistance to approved programs. In other words, it will give money to the schools-up to $30 a child-but not without strings. The money will go only to approved courses. This excludes instruction that is predominantly political or religious. One further consequence is that in the process of examining courses for the purposes of giving approval, a good deal more information will be obtained about the schools. I believe this information will enhance the standing of these voluntary enterprises. In short the schools deserve support for three reasons: They are an outstanding example of the voluntary principle, they reduce the shocks and traumas of assimilation into Australian society and they contribute to the maintenance of the linguistic and cultural inheritance of Australians. I am glad to be able to support this part of the Bill. The third theme of this Bill concerns Commonwealth assistance to government and to independent schools. It seems to me that two of the great problems of the day in the field of public education are, firstly, to arrest the disappointing erosion of confidence in government schools arising out of what parents perceive as a fall in standards of literacy, numeracy and discipline in government schools despite the investment of massive sums of money in them and; secondly, to cope with the consequent rising public demand for the services of independent schools, whether church or secular, traditional or experimental, so that real freedom of choice between different kinds of education continues to be possible. The arguments about literacy and numeracy in government schools continue without agreement being in sight. No doubt one can always find some expert on either side to prove anything. Meanwhile parents are voting with their feet in favour of independent schools. In my electorate, which contains some very famous government high schools, about half the students attend independent schools; the waiting lists for these schools are growing and there is talk of closing down at least one high school-a measure to which I am completelyopposed. The solution to the government school problem lies primarily with State governments, State de .. partments of education and the state school teachers. The crisis will not pass until they take the steps to restore educational standards to the place they used to have in government schools. In my view this involves a range of policies from renewed emphasis on the three Rs to the restoration of serious and respected public examinations. If that happens-the sooner it happens the better-I believe the move to independent schools will be less pronounced. Yet, from the point of view of Commonwealth involvement in education, the issue is not only one of educational standards-fundamental as that is-but also of parents' freedom to choose between different kinds of schools, government or independent. We see today, as I have said, an expansion not only of traditional independent schools but also of more innovative or experimental ones. There would be even more if we adopted some version of the voucher system for the choice of schools. But be that as it may, the freedom of choice which parents now enjoy would be quite impossible without financial assistance from government of the kind provided for in this Bill. One might sometimes be forgiven for believing that this is now, after all these years, a bipartisan policy shared by government and opposition but in fact we know that the Opposition, or at least strong elements in it, does not yet really believe in parents' freedom of choice and the legitimacy of both independent and government schools. One has only to remember the reaction of the Opposition to the razor gang's common sense proposals to return a variety of government functions to the private sectora reaction that in some cases seemed about to cause seizures, if not hysterical fits, so great is the horror of the private sector, including the private educational sector, to the socialist mind. I believe there really is no true basic consensus on this question of freedom of choice in education. It is still an issue that illustrates the philosophic differences between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. I congratulate the Minister on this aspect of the Bill. Taken together, the three themes of the Bill illustrate compassion for the handicapped, concern for the welfare of ethnic minorities and a determination to maintain real freedom in one of parents' most important choices-the education of their children. In my view, the Bill can stand as a simple symbol of the policies of the Liberal Party and this Government for the 1980s. It has been a strange experience for me to be listened to in comparative polite silence after some 10 to 11 years in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. I now look forward to later debates in this famous chamber when I should not expect, or wish, for such quietness. Nevertheless, 1 thank the House for its courtesy.",70
110,Dr JENKINS,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"1 would like to convey my congratulations to the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) on making his maiden speech. It is quite fitting that he should make it in an area on which State parliaments base so much discussion-the area of education. I also welcome him to that growing circle of former members of State parliaments who have entered Federal Parliament. However, I must warn him that if he expects his State colleagues, even of the same parliamentary persuasion, always to look upon him with admiration, he will be sadly disillusioned. Mr Barry Jones-It happens on our side.",73
111,Dr JENKINS,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"It does happen on our side. I am afraid events of recent days will reduce the honourable member's popularity. As has been said by the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), members of this House do not oppose the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill or the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill. In fact, they honour Government undertakings and, after all, that is a rare event in this House in recent times. So we can but approve them. I draw the attention of the House to the statement by the Minister for education (Mr Fife) about the Government's policy on education. On page 1862 of Hansard of 30 April, he is recorded as having said: This is in conformity with the Government's resolve to ensure equality of opportunity and freedom of choice Australian school children and their parents. I will go back to that statement later. I must admit that with regard to the schools assistance legislation I did have sympathy for the point of view put by the honourable member for Wentworth regarding the program to assist non-profit part time ethnic schools. These schools are well established in our communities and they do require assistance. Variations in standards are involved and I am pleased to see that this extra assistance will be paid to those schools where the· children are undertaking approved supplementary community language and cult-ral education programs, because here there issoine degree of accountability. So, whilst I support these particular part time ethnic schools, I am concerned about the contribution that is made to multicultural education. It seems to me that although those schools satisfy the requirements of that one group in preserving the language, culture and knowledge of history of that group-a very laudable objective-they are still not breaking down the barriers between the culture of that group and those of other groups. Australia is now rich in ethnic people and ethnic culture. I would like to see the opportunity for multicultural exchange. This is not provided for in our schools at the moment in any effective form. The attempt in South Australia, with its program in a number of primary schools, does give some sort of lead but it has not gone very far. I now move to the other program, which is to develop education programs for severely handicapped children. We are told the Bill makes provision for the introduction of a new scheme. What is the scheme and how will it operate? It will cost $19.3m but what is its objective and how will it be carried out? Just as an objective, it is acceptable. But are we not sensible enough in this Federal Parliament to. be told how it is to operate, what accountability there will be and what its objectives are? How far would it go? The Preston Institute of Technology had the Education Program for Infants and Children which dealt with Down's syndrome children. This was started under a special grant from the Department of Social Security. It was an early education program which began with babies affected by Down's syndrome in their first year of life. It was eminently successful an- because of its success it .drew numbers beyond those approved for the pilot scheme. The effect snowballed and about three months ago the Institute thought it would not be financed beyond 30 June. Only recently has it been told it will be allowed to carryon. What is its future? What is the future for similar schemes under this education program for for all severely handicapped children, or does it not apply to those schemes at all? It seems to me that it is programs such as those for the severely handicapped which we should support. We are given insufficient information concerning them and the Government's objectives. I think the Minister ought to take some time to explain the objectives of that program to us. I come back to equality of opportunity and freedom of choice. 1I have a telegram from N. Robinson, the Secretary of the Preston Institute of Technology Association of Professional Staff. It states: General meeting of academic staff Preston Institute concerned at introduction of fees ing education. This will cause shortage of Australian specialists 'eSpecially in technological and business areas. When the Whitlam Government started massive involvement of Federal funds in education programs it seemed to start at both ends. One may have questioned why it started first with the tertiary area and the abolition of tertiary fees. The fact is that at that stage tertiary education was elitist and exclusive. Qnlyaverysmall percentage of people wefeable to break through the barrier of fees and the expenses of attending a tertiary institution. Some of us were able to do it by working during the day and studying at night, but there were very few indeed and it was done under very difficult circumstances. In the early 1970s tertiary institutions expanded and they were freed of fees. There is now a deliberate attempt to return these institutions to their former exclusive and elitist state. This introduction of fees for second and postgraduate degrees is an example of this. It will affect those who come from poorer economic circumstances far more than any others. Surely we will not be told by members of the Government that a primary degree is the end of tertiary education. Surely anyone looking for expertise in the technological, scientific and business fields would say that the first degree just lays the base for expertise. Why should it be forced upon those who wish to continue their education to improve their skills, which are needed in so many fields in Australia, that they must be able to afford to support themselves and pay fees? Not only have there been cutbacks in this area but also there has been the question of the facilities which are available for tertiary education. The Tertiary Education Commission pointed out: The situation is a serious one . . . Despite the fact that total student load has levelled off, there is a backlog mand for teaching space . . . There are a number of examples of overcrowding, the use of unsuitable temporary accommodation and substandard facilities which require replacement as a matter of urgency. That appears on page 7, volume 2 of the TEC report. It is further stated on page 9 of that volume: . . . that the capacity of universities their teaching and research commitments will be seriously impaired unless there is an increase in the funds for capital works above the level available in 1980. In this House we hear so much about natural resources, their development and how that will build up the country. Surely the greatest natural resources in Australia are human resources-the development of their skills and abilities. The overall effect of the cuts in this area will be to reduce staff numbers, raise the size of classes and, bit by bit, cut back on the number of places available to for ,post-graduate and continuharoship to students and lead to students. In 1974 the maximum Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance was 75.4 per ' cent of the Henderson poverty line. Today it is 61.7 per cent. If we look at the cutoff point for means testing for the allowance we see that the cutoff point declined from 100.1 per cent of the average male wage in 1974 to 80.1 per cent today. The student income cutoff point dropped in real terms from 28.3 per cent of the average male wage in the previous financial year to 12.8 per cent. These cuts make it harder for children of working class families, mature age students and people living in country areas to enter tertiary education. So much for equality of education and freedom of choice in education! My colleague the honourable member for Fremantle has already referred to student loans. It is impossible to expect students to carry out their courses, after obtaining loans and be hit by repayments at the time when, if they are from working class backgrounds they are already struggling because they have not been in the work force for so many years. It is no solution at all. I speak from experience of that situation, although it was many years ago. My colleague from Fremantle would say: 'Anyone with science and medical qualifications is one of those who gets into the high income group as soon as he hits the work force'. Well, it is still a battle if such a person has to pay back student loans. Let me return to the area of primary and secondary education and the question of the Schools Commission. We were disappointed that the involvement of the Schools Commission in program administration and information collection in the States is to be reduced. The State offices are pretty vestigial already. Further cutbacks in their involvement will mean a further lack of, or indeed the absence of, information of dewhich gives us any degree of accountability of programs in schools whether government or nongovernment, primary or secondary. We cannot afford this. The introduction of the Schools Commission provided us with a source of information to enable us to judge just how adequately or inadequately the programs were working. Here and colleges to meet we intend to cut it back further. We will cut out special support for educational research. We have. reachedthestage-wherewe can afford to cut out invol'vement in educational research. I have heard many comments that the schools program has been a failure regarding literacy. I must admit that sometimes when I see the spelling of some tertiary graduates I am inclined to believe it, but the fact is that those schools programs have not been a failure. Today a much higher number of people, through those programs, can communicate, whether verbally or by writing. No one can deny that. Literacy has improved. The sort of campaign that has been conducted to suggest that the position is worsening is ridiculous and only inspired to return us to the good old days of the master and servant situation as far as education is concerned. I now turn to the question of the Curriculum Development Centre. We were told that if it is abolished it will provide a saving of money to Federal revenue. Once more the gun has been held at the States to agree to contribute 50 per cent of the operating costs. What purpose does this serve? There will be a disappearance of a centre that has served a real purpose in curriculum development. If there is concern for literacy surely this is one area to which particular attention should be paid. Whilst as members of the Opposition we do not oppose these Bills, we have our reservations about the Government's so-called attitude to equality of opportunity and freedom of choice. Financial restraints restrict those opportunities and the freedom for children who, if they come from the lower wage earning group, are already disadvantaged through the facilities that are available to them in the home. I trust that at some stage members of the Parliament will be able to sit down and talk about the sorts of national objectives in education that are needed to potentiate the human resources which are the best natural resources this country has.",73
112,Mr BAUME,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"I am glad to have the opportunity to congratulate the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) on his maiden speech in this House. I am glad that iLwas on such an important topic as education. I believe his contribution to the debate was in keeping with the usual high standards that the Australian community has learnt to expect from the honourable member for Wentworth. T attended university with him in Sydney. I then worked with him in the late 1950s on the staff of a magazine called the Observer which ultimately merged with the Bulletin. The honourable member for Wentworth then became a most distinguished editor of the Bulletin magazine. I was very glad to work with him as the financial editor of that magazine for some years. I am overjoyed to see him as a member of this place and to hear the quality of the contribution that he has made to the debate on this important subject of education. I will now deal in detail with the burden of States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill, particularly the Government's commitment to provide over three years a total of $25m capital grants for new places in non··government schools throughout Australia. I will concentrate on the problem facing the non-government school system in Australia. ] am a little tired of hearing speakers opposite talk about the disadvantages suffered by lower income groups in Australia in the education system as though this disadvantage related entirely to the State school system. The bulk of the Catholic education system is directed towards providing education for the disadvantaged, lower income earning groups of this nation. It is arrant nonsense for honourable members opposite to suggest that to give any taxpayers' funds to the Catholic education system is to look after people who are privileged. The reality is that the Catholic education system operates at a resource level of only 70 per cent of the level available to the average State schooL The Karmel Ilgures on resource allocation indicate that the Catholic education system suffers a 30 per cent disadvantage. The bulk of the system provides education facilities for the lower income earning groups in our society. It is about time the Opposition stopped suggesting that the Government's provision of assistance to this section of the education system is providing something to a privileged and advantaged section of the community. That is nonsense. Let me detail the manner in which the nonState education sytem, in particular the Catholic education system, has been subjected to a significant degree of disadvantage. Figures demonstrating the point I am making are recorded in the Schools Commission report for the triennium 1982-84 which was released last month. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there has been a growth in the non-State system in recent times. There is no doubt about it. As a result of this Government's activities, there has been an increase in the number of enrolments and proportion of enrolments in the non-government primary school area following a degree of assistance given by this Government to that section of the education system. 1 point out that the recovery in that proportion, which is now 20 per cent of all enrolments, took place after a substantial fall in the number of enrolments in non-government schools which was generated under the Labor Government. In 1972, in the term of the previous coalition Government, the proportion of students who attended non-government schools in Australia at the primary level was 20 per cent. That is exactly the same as it was last year. In other words, there was a fall under Labor and the there has now been a recovery. We have restored a degree of choice in education which was being diminished by the policies of the Labor Governfor ment. I think that point should be made. There has also been a significant increase in the resources available in the State system .and no doubt some increase inthose available to the nonState system in terms of the number of teachers. For example, in the time span I have just mentioned, from 1972 to 1980, there was an increase in the number of State school teachers of 35 per cent. The increase in the number of nongovernment school teachers was only 31 per cent. The State system, which it is alleged this Government has knocked down, has increased its number of teachers at a faster rate than 4as the non-State system even though the proportion of students attending school ,in the two systems is exactly the same now as it was in 1972. To pretend that this Government's policies have massively disadvantaged the State system as against the non-State system is evidently nonsensicaL Let us look at what will happen in the future, There is no doubt that all the projections indicate a growing distaste within the community for the styles of some State schools and State school teachers. There is an increasing desire, evident in the projections, by people to exercise a greater freedom of choice to use other systems. In the S9hools Commission report the lower projection for the non-government primary school enrolments, which last year accounted for about 20 per cent of all enrolments, is an increase to 21.7 per cent by 1984. The higher projection is an increase to as much as 23.8 per cent, which means that the State schools would suffer an off-setting reduction. At the secondary level the same sort of trend is expected. In 1980 26.4 per cent of students attended non-government secondary schools. The lower projection is an increase to 27.3 per cent by 1984. The higher projection is an increase to 28.5 per cent, with off-setting reductions, of course, in the State school system. Many people might ask: 'Why are people expressing this choice?' It could well be held that the more the people of Australia see of the activities of some teachers' federations around this country the more concerned they become about the level and quality of teaching and the attitudes of teachers in the State school system. The House probably does not need reminding that the New South Wales'Teachers Federation got solidly behind the producers of the recently controversial homosexual kit prepared which they hoped would be distributed in New South Wales schools. The Teachers Federation got so much behind it that it threatened to sue the Federal Government if the money for the kit was withdrawn. Of course, as a result, the Federal Government, regrettably, had to provide that money. This occurred despite the fact that approval for the provision of that money was obtained by deceit. It is important to note that the Teachers Federation took a strong position requiring the Federal Government to provide the money for that homosexual kit even though approval for the money was obtained in a deceptive manner. Let me dramatise further the disadvantage that the non-State school system has. I refer to student-teacher ratios. Once again, the position is evident from the Schools Commission report. The latest figures available are those in 1979. In government schools in the primary sector the student-teacher ratio was 20.3 per cent compared with 24.4 per cent in the Catholic school system. That indicates a massive disadvantage in the Catholic school system. Yet there are continual objections from honourable members opposite to our attempts to eliminate that disadvantage. The States are responsible for the State school system. We believe that we have an obligation to provide freedom of choice and equality of opportunity through the non-State system. Quite frankly, I would much rather the subsidies which at present are paid for each child under this Government's policy than the old system which relied much more heavily on a substantial taxation deduction. Under the old system the richer a person was the bigger deduction he got for having a child at a non-State schooL That system did not provide enough assistance to the Catholic education system in particular, which, as I have already outlined, caters to a large degree for the underprivileged and lower income groups in our community. The disadvantage which I outlined in the primary school system also obtains in the secondary school system. In 1979 government schools had a pupil-teacher ratio of 12.3 to 1 but in Catholic schools on average there were 17 pupils per teacher. This trend is evident in the total staffpupil ratios in the government school systems too. In particular, I think it is worth pointing out the differences in the ways in which the various States run their education systems. It intrigues me when I hear many honourable members opposite and members of the New South Wales Parliament endeavouring to attack the Federal Government for a situation which is far from perfect in the New South Wales education system when in fact the Federal Government is obliged to adopt an even-handed approach across Australia, unless the States agree that it should not do so. Yet when we look at the New South Wales education system we find that its achievement levels under the Karme1 targets are way behind those of other States, particularly Victoria. In 1919 the student-staff ratio in New South Wales was 13.4 pupils per staff member and in Victoria the figure was only 10.9. Why are there these massive differences? For example, why the New South Wales student-staff ratio of 13.4 much worse than those in Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia, and so on? It seems to me that bears a direct relationship to the manner in which the New South Wales Education Department runs its school system. Whether or not that EduMany cation Department is competent is a matter for the State education authorities. But it is a matter for us that for the past few years the New South Wales education authorities have mucked around with the allocations by the Federal Government to education in New South Wales State schools. am only too well aware of this situation. There disastrous need for a third high school in my torate. Over the past four years the Federal Government has provided enough funding for this high school to have been built, heaven knows many times over, but the high school has not been built for the very simple reason that the State Government of New South Wales has diverted an average of $6.5m a year out of our capital funding to New South Wales for schools and into the resince current funding area. It is entitled to do that. gret that it is entitled to do that, the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) that I have raised this matter several times in the past. I would be most grateful if the Federal Government could look into this matter as closely as possible. It seems totally wrong and unfortunate that in a State such as New South Wales, which is cryi)1g out for additional capital facilities for new school buildings, particularly in rapidly developing areas such as mine, the federal money allocated for this purpose can be diverted into recurrent spending. Basically, it means that this money can be diverted into placating the demands of an aggressive and hungry Teachers Federation in New South Wales which would rather see the money spent on teachers' salaries-in other words, increasing the number of teachers-than on increasing the facilities which are so desperately needed in developing areas such as mine. When we have a choice between reducing class sizes and providing enough schools in deVeloping areas, surely our first priority should be to provide enough schools in developing areas. It is quite evident that that priority is not supported by the New South Wales Government. Not only has it diverted $6.5m over the last four years out of capital allocation from the Federal Government and into its recurrent spending but, I understand, it also plans to do so next year. In the few minutes available to me I want to say briefly that there has been a lot of discussion on the question of whether or not tertiary education is should be free. Many honourable members have so received a lot of correspondence on this matter. Certainly criticisms have bee- levelled at the it question of whether or not a second degree should be provided at the expense of the taxpayer or at the expense of the person seeking the degree. people in my electorate are in the blue collar worker category. Their prospects of sending a child to university, as I understand it, are something like seven times less than the prospects of a professional family sending a child to university. Yet these blue collar workers are required to proI vide through their taxation the means by which is a the professional people of Australia perpetuate electhemselves through their children by sending those children to university. It seems to me to be immoral and improper that the working people of how Australia, with this seven to one imbalance, should be required to pontribute to the funds of people attending university when there has been no increase whatsoever in the prospects of children of blue collar families attending university this new free tertiary eduction system comI remenced. I believe that that is demonstrated in the and I point out to Williams report. . The best thing for us to do would be to wipe out this system, whereby we are perpetuating a professional class at the expense of the worker, and restore a system of means tested scholarships and then open exhibitions for particularly bright children to ensure that the children of working people can go to uoiversity. In particular, we should use the savings from the money being wasted because it is being spread far and wide at the moment to increase the living and other allowances.available to people in the poo-er income groups seeking to go to university. In this way we would do something positive to diminish that savage inbalance. I hope the Government will take that proposition on board. I believe it would be much more democratic than the present system, which works so much to the disadvantage of most of the people of Australia. Nonetheless, I strongly support the present Government's activities in the education area. I commend the Minister for his outstanding contribution in this area. He certainly has been of major support to me in my electorate and to the education systems of Australia.",75
113,Mr BARRY JONES,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"1 commence by taking up the point put by the honourits able member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), which was based on a half truth. I agree with one half of that truth. There is, as he said, a 'savage imbalance' between the participation rates in tertiary education of the children of blue collar workers and children from the professional classes. My own electorate of Lalor illustrates that very clearly. In a sense, when the honourable member said that we ought to prevent that 'Robin Hood in reverse' situation where the parents of poor children subsidise the children of the rich he was really assuming that nothing can happen or will happen in the whole base of our education system to increase the participation rates of working class children. That seems to be based on a pessimism or fatalism about the future of tertiary education with which I would not want to agree. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) and will concentrate my remarks on the States Grants (Tertiary Education) Amendment Bill. It is not adequately grasped how much access to universities and colleges of advanced education is confined to particular segments of Australian society. and specific geographical regions. For example, in the Melbourne metropolitan area the provision of tertiary educational facilities is almost exclusively found in the centre, the north-east and south-east, with grossly inadequate provisions in the north-west and west. This is not confined to Melbourne. We could find a similar situation in comparable areas of Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and other large cities. Rural areas are similarly disadvantaged. I have done some work in comparing educational participation rates in three Victorian federal electoral districts-my own electorate of Lalor, which is an industrial area to the west of the city, with a heavy migrant concentration; the electorate of Kooyong, a residential area in the inner eastern suburbs; and the electorate of Mallee in the north-west of Victoria, running up to the South Australian and New South Wales border. Education participation rates have an enormous cyclical influence in determining the type of community which emerges. For example, without a significant number of tertiary students it is unlikely that there will be many bookshops in an area. Without bookshops people are likely to devote their free time to television. Children are unlikely to be stimulated by books and may lose any desire to go on to higher education. They are less likely to participate in theatre, live music, soon. There is a cyclical process by which high education participation leads on to a wide range of skills, occupations or wages, leading on in turn to a broad demand for services, a larger range of service employment, more educational institutions which, in turn, leads on to high educational participation. So the cycle goes on. Conversely, low education participation rates lead to significant contractions in job opportunities, demands for services and demands for educational facilities. Let me illustrate this point: The 1976 census showed that in the electorate of Kooyong 6.92 per cent of the total population had a degree or graduate diploma; in the electorate of Lalor 0.54 per cent; and in the electorate of Mallee 0.98 per cent. If we look for the number of students at universities or CAEs expressed as a percentage of people aged 17 to 24 the figure in Kooyong is 46.05 per cent, in Lalor 10.74 per cent and in Mallee 4.5 per cent. For every person in Lalor with a degree or graduate diploma there are two in Mallee and 13 in Kooyong. The census figures do not distinguish between universities and CAE students, between pass and honour students or between full time and part time students. If full time university students had been isolated in this group, there would have been a far wider discrepancy. Lalor and Mallee have educational profiles like Mississippi, Kooyong like California. My electorate of Lalor is part of an educationally disadvantaged area, that is, Melbourne's western suburbs with 520,000 people comprising 19 per cent of the metropolitan population but, because of the particular demographic profile of the area, containing an atypically high numberperhaps 23 per cent or 24 per cent-of Melbourne's children. Melbourne has three universities-the University of Melbourne, Monash University and La Trobe Universitywith, in 1979, a total enrolment of 38,562 students, and 19 colleges of advanced education with 45,950 students, both figures including full time and part time students. Only one tertiary educational institution is located in the western suburbs. H is the Footscray Institute of Technology-I never lose an opportunity to point out the excellent work that the institute is doingwith 2,580 students, only 3.05 per cent of Melbourne's total enrolments. So, the west starts off with 23 per cent of Melbourne's young people and finishes up with 3 per cent of the enrolments at tertiary institutions. It is true that the Deakin University established at Geelong with 4,400 students has some students from Melbourne's west. The tragedy is that the reand port of the Victorian fourth university committee in 1971 concluded that there was insufficient demand in the western suburbs to support a university and recommended that priority be given to a fourth university in Melbourne's eastern region. That seemed to exhibit a depressing circularity in argument. In other words, it is said: 'If there is no institution, there is no demand; if there is no demand, there is no need for an institution. Where then is there a demand? Where there is already a high level of demand.' So the already existing structure of demand is reinforced and little is done to increase the possibilities of people in the west of Melbourne. J seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard Question on Notice No. 43 and the very interesting answer given on 4 December 1980 by the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) under the heading 'Secondary and Tertiary Education'. Leave granted. The question and answer read as followsMr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 26 November 1980: (1) Is he able to say whether, in Australian secondary education, there is (a) a high drop-out rate of45 percent between Years 10 and 12, (b) differing retention rates between Government, Roman Catholic and independent schools, (c) a variation in retention rates e.g. 32.4 per cent in NSW and declining proportion of students proceeding from Year 12 to higher education of 54.6 per cent in 1974 and 48.7 per cent in 1977, and (e) a variation in urban educational participation compared to rural participation; if so, what estimates have been made of the percentage of young people aged between 17 and 24 years who would have the intellectual capacity to benefit from tertiary education in Australia. (2) Is he also able to say what proportion of Australians the 17 to 24 years age group are actually undergoing tertiary education compared to those in (a) the United States of America, (b) Canada, (c) Japan, (d) Switzerland, (e) Norway, (f) Denmark, (g) Sweden, (h) France and (j) the USSR. Mr Fife-- The answer to the honourable member's questionis as follows: (1) (a) Enrolments in Australian were 39.6 per cent of those in Year 10 in 1977. This implies an apparent drop-out rate of 60.4 12. It is an apparent, rather than true rate, because the method of calculation does not explicitly take account of net changes to the school population due to migration, nor of those students who spend more than one year in the same grade. (b) the apparent retention rates from the first secondary year (Year 7 or Year 8) to Year 12 vary between the types of schools specified. In 1979 the respective apparent retention rates to Year 12 were: Government schools-28.9 per cent Catholic schools-44.1 per cent Other Non-Government schools 87.1 per cent Note that the above apparent retention rates are affected by transfers between types of schools, mentioned in (a) above. (c) there is variation in apparent retention rates between State systems. In 1979 the respective apparent State system retention rates to Year 12 were: New South Wales Victoria(a) Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania(b) . Northern Territory . Australian Capital Territory (a) Excludes students in the Tertiary Orientation Program in Technical Schools. (b) It is possible to obtain the Higher School Certificate either at the end of Year 11 or at the end of Year 12, (d) of those students enrolled in Year 12 in 1973,54.5 per cent proCeeded to universities and colleges of advanced education in 1974. The corresponding proportion in relation to 1976-1977 was 48.7 per cent. It should be noted however that over this period enrolments in Technical and Further Education institutions were rising rapidly. Statistics on the proportion of Year 12 students proceeding directly on to Technical and Further Education are not available. (e) there does appear to be a variation in urban educational participation compared to rural participation. Research studies indicate a greater retention rate to Year 12 exists in metropolitan and other urban areas than in rural areas. Once matriculation level is reached, however, the proportion which make the transition to higher education is about as high for country as for metropolitan students.

115,Mr BARRY JONES,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"-As I was saying before the suspension· of the sitting for dinner, on 4 December 1980 the Minister for Education gave an extremely interesting answer to a question about secondary and tertiary education. He provided some very depressing figures about the degree of wastage, that is the drop out in secondary schools from the year 7 or year 8, to year 12. There is an enormous variation in the degree of drop-outs between the three school systems. The retention rate in government schools was 28.9 per cent. In Catholic schools it was 44.1 per cent and in other non-government schools it was 87.1 per cent. In other words, more than 70 per cent of government school pupils drop out. In Catholic schools over 50 per cent drop out and in the nonGovernment schools-the so-called private schools-only 13 per cent drop out. There we see a perpetuation of the stratification of Australian society due to poverty in education. Mr Kent-There is a class difference.",80
116,Mr BARRY JONES,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"There is a very strong class difference, and poverty in education is largely inherited. In the 1960s education was a very big issue in Australia. Part of the process of de-Whitlamisation since 1975 has been a turning away from education, a kind of complacent sense that we had gone as far as we could go in Australia. As I said in another debate last night, in 1980 the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development economic survey on Australia showed out that this country ranked fourteenth of 23 nations listed for educational retention rates for young people aged between 15 years and 19 years. The Williams report on Education, Training and Employment confirmed: while 60 per cent of our 15-19 comparable figures are 24 per cent in Japan and 28 per cent in theU.S.A. We have the paradoxical situation in Australia of the highest youth unemployment in the advanced world and also the highest youth employment. The reason that it is possible to have both figures is that we have a very much lower participation rate at the tertiary education level. Although some attempt has been made as far as Technical and Further Education is concerned to increase the actual numbers involved, it is very far from being the equivalent of full time education. Mr Kent-It will be worse when the Government introduces fees. Universities will be only for the rich then.",80
117,Mr BARRY JONES,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"If the Government introduces fees, of course, the situation will become far worse. Why have we slipped so far behind other technologically advanced nations in education? We are afflicted by a combination of ignorance, apathy and self-satisfaction-a dangerous mixture. What is the explanation for our low participation rates? I can think of three possiblities. First, Australians may be smarter than everybody else and our natural gifts do not need formal education for them to mature. The second possibility is that we are dumber than the people of comparable nations and education could not really help. Third-I suspect this is the correct answer-we are culturally so isolated and so lacking in vitality that we fail to understand that the educational revolution, aborted here, is still going on elsewhere and as a result we are slipping behind. The Williams report made it clear that there is a yawning gap between those who receive tertiary education and graduate to professional employment and those who leave school with minimal and unmarketable qualifications, with skills that are appropriate only for the contracting number of routine and repetitive jobs. The question that this nation and this Parliament have to face is: How can working class people be given access to education which maximises their skills and leads to satisfactory personal and vocational outcomes? Mr Kent-Charge them fees.",80
118,Mr BARRY JONES,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"The Government's answer and the razor gang's answer is to charge them fees. The school is an excellent sorting machine. It classifies people and sets them apart. Just as cattle and sheep are branded, so school leaves its brand or caste mark for life. Few succeed in washing or shaking it off. If a person attends a poor school and lives in a poverty stricken social environment-age group are in the labor force Mr Jacobi-He is fixed for life.",80
119,Mr BARRY JONES,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"He is fixed for life. The school system will do relatively little to overcome these disadvantages. If one is disadvantaged, school will tend to extend those disabilities through life. Cultural poverty seems to be inherited and it is extremely difficult to shake off. It is an irony that as we approach the goal in some areas or a satisfactory class-pupil ratio in conventionally equipped classrooms-a goal that has been pursued by all parties for some time-this goal may recede, turn into a mirage and prove absolutely irrelevant. The crippling effects of educational and cultural poverty are causes of and consequences of unequal access to power. The middle and upper classes have access to information and power but the working class does not. H existing economic, social or educational systems create or reinforce information poverty, then in an increasingly information-based society the degree of disability suffered by the poor must grow wider with every additional year of unequal outcomes in education. While this disparity exists it will be impossible to bring about a political redistibution of power and existing hegemonic structures must continue. The 'skill mix' shifts each year to the disadvantage of the poor. Language ability was less relevant when migrants were employed as labourers or process workers in factories, but with higher personal skills being required in sophisticated service employment, a poor command of English will disqualify many migrants from work. It is true that the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act does make some attempt to improve access to multicultural facilities, but there is a strong element of tokenism in it-not intended necessarily by the Minister for Education-but I believe that is what the effect will be. I conclude by pointing out that there are basically two kinds of educational experiences people need to cope with life. There is the education that assists the development of the inner life, the personality and there is education to strengthen the outer life. Education for inner life covers personal growth, creativity, independent thought and evaluation, the generation of psychic income, and aesthetic factors. Education for outer life covers economic relations, employment, consumption pattern, tool using, income generation and group responses. In Australia middle class education puts a very heavy emphasis on personal development. I regret to say that in working class areas-we have heard these expressions from many Ministers, not from the Minister for Education but certainly from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) there is a tremendous emphasis that all that is needed in working class education are qualifications for income earning. I think that the emphasis on personal development in middle class education in teaching languages, the arts and literature, does not inhibit employment prospects or the capacity to generate income. In fact it is quite the reverse. While consumption is the standard measure of outer life, on which we place so much emphasis, creativity and expression remain the key to inner life. The increasing tendency towards division of labour and the fragmentation of knowledge forces many people to seek fulfilment outside work, by active participation in sport, gardening, hobbies or the arts, Or to suppress self-expression through increased dependence on alcohol, drugs, spectator sport and television. As the American education writer, James Coleman argued, life used to be experience-rich and stimulus poor; now it is experience-poor and stimulus rich. Culture is often perceived as an optional extra, reserved for the highly educated-the icing on the cake. Four thousand years of human history before the Industrial Revolution demonstrates how creativity and work were integrated and that the urge to make appears to be universal. Some nations have had long traditions of intense personal participation in specific cultural forms-for example, pottery, calligraphy and writing poetry in Japan; music in Hungary; and soccer in Latin America. In addition, creativity has often been associated with a happy and vigorous old age. In working class education, highly specific training-for example, in typing and shorthand, dressmaking, cooking, woodworking and metalworking-does not necessarily guarantee employment, income or personal development. Indeed, the reverse is true. The idea that a young man's prospects could be ensured by putting a spanner in his hand, pushing him out the door and watching him go on to fame and fortune is now anachronistic, dating from the time when people were described by their function, as 'hands'. I say to the Minister that the extent of unrecognised and untapped talent in the working class in Australia remains the great unknown in Australian education. Very often we are inclined to take the patronising view that there is nothing we can do about it, that it is futile to try to expect people in working class areas to be able to aspire to a higher degree of participation in education. We tend to get that recurrent cycle--Mr Jacohi-They get locked in.",80
120,Mr BARRY JONES,CUSTOMS UNDERTAKINGS,"They get locked in, with low expectations. Because there are low expectations there appear to be low demands. Because there are low demands poor provisions are made. That is a tragedy and the social wastage that is involved in Australia is not in this nation's interest. I urge that before the Minister comes back with his next Bill he asks the Schools Commission to examine the principles on which it is operating to make sure that educational participation is truly democratic and pluralist.

124,Mr JOHN BROWN,FUNCTIONS,"Last week the people of Australia witnessed some of the most reprehensible actions yet Second Reading taken by the Fraser Government. Given this Government's ccntinuing shameful record, I put to the House that that is, indeed, a mouthful. Nevertheless, I stand by it. I think the actions of last week really add to the total shame of this Government. Last week the Government cut, slashed, shaved, revised, eliminated and sold off. These were the themes of last week. Since Australia is, by any standard, one of the world's to substi- most prosperous and most affluent countries and certainly one of the major trading powers, one can only ask why. Have we gone crazy; has the manic obsession of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) with deficits and with getting his own way pushed him past the point of reason? Affluence has changed Australia, at least under this Governbut will grossly disadvantage ment. We were once a country of adventurous and radical people deeply concerned with social rights. We have changed to a conservative country, more deeply concerned with preserving in the review to 30 Colleges the standard of living of the haves, with great regard for the have-nots both in and out of Australia. Under this Government, overseas aid the Terto developing countries, to countries in our area, the Third World countries with a shamefully low standard of living has almost disappeared. I instance the cutting off of aid to Vietnam. Surely we owe the Vietnamese people some assistance. This has not been so under this Government. I want to come back to the new health care proposals. The changes to the health scheme announced last week and the recommendations of the Lynch razor gang together amount to little other than a second Budget and can be regarded only as a part of an overall move by this Government to opt out completely of its responsibility to the States and to the Australian people. No longer is this Government prepared even to pretend that it is providing services to the Australian people in return for their taxes. It now intends simply to collect the taxes and tell the people to look to State governments or to private enterprise to provide the services. All this has been done in the name of smaller government. The Prime Minister has embraced the term 'smaller government' as his philosophy and quotes it as if it were holy writ. What is this smaller government that the Prime Minister is always talking about? The Government's total expenditure on the public sector has been running at 38.8 per cent of total government outlays. The great inroads into this figure and the much heralded cuts in government expenditure produced by the razor gang will reduce government spending in the public sector by all of 0.4 per cent, when it is running at 38.8 per cent. I remind honourable members that during the period of the Whitlam Government which was widely criticised by the then Opposition for encouraging big government and for letting growth in the Public Service run wild, total government expenditure in the public sector was only 36 per cent, less than this Government's expenditure even after the effects of the razor gang have been taken into account. So much for this Government's rhetoric about small government. But there was a strange manifestation this week. I am sure honourable members can recall that when tax indexation was introduced it was presented by the Prime Minister as a means of keeping government honest and small, to stop its spending rising in line with the inflation fed expansion of Commonwealth Government income tax collection. By abolishing tax indexation the Prime Minister has cynically abandoned any notion of small government. But to do so in the same week as the razor gang reported is simply an insult to common sense. It is a ludicrous state of affairs. What the Government did last week in reneging on its responsibility for health care and in cutting government services is just a continuation of its general philosophy of creating an even wider division between the wealthy and those who have to bear the burden for the wealthy-the low and middle income earners. The Prime Minister, like a latter day Otto Niemeyer, might I suggest, would have us believe that everyone in Australia must be prepared to make sacrifices for the good of the economy; that we all have to pull our belts in a little, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker, which might be a decent problem.",82
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FUNCTIONS,I trust that is not a reflection on the Chair?,83
126,Mr JOHN BROWN,FUNCTIONS,"No, sir, only on the expansion of your personality. We all have to pull in our belts a little, even me. To use the Prime Minister's much quoted expression, life was not meant to be easy for any of us. I wonder what the vast majority of low and middle income earners ih this country feel when they see wealthy professionals all around them employing smart accountants to develop schemes by which they can avoid paying taxes or when they read in the papers about people such as Mr Robert Holmes a'Court cooly paying out $800,000 for a racehorse at the recent yearling sales. Obviously life was not meant to be easy for that type of privileged personl When the Government with its muchvaunted cuts has been able to shave a minuscule part of government expenditure, it is strange that people such as Robert Holmes a'Court, who can pay more than half a million dollars for a racehorse, can manage, as he has in the last few years, to amass a total of $59m tax free because the Government will not close the loopholes or will not introduce some form of tax on wealthy people such as him who are leaving the working class of Australia to pick up the tab for the Government's expenses. There was another strange manifestation in Sydney last week. The Lend Lease corporation sold Australia Square, a rather prominent building in the middle of our city, for a nice tax free profit of $50m. I wonder what the taxpayers earning $9,000 or $10,000 a year think about that when they are asked to dip their hand into their pocket every week. If the razor gang wanted to do something why did it not do something in that area? It is not the Holmes a'Courts of this world who will be disadvantaged by the Government's dismantling of the health scheme or by cuts imposed by the razor gang. Those who bear the brunt of the Government's policies will be those people struggling to raise a family on a low wage and who are now forced to find several hundred extra dollars a year to pay for health insurance. Perhaps we might thin k of hard working public servants whose jobs have been placed in jeopardy by a Government whim. It is easy enough to deal savage blows against these people with the stroke of a pen. This Government ignores the human suffering which these changes will entail. What the cuts in the Public Service mean is this: Not only are 17,000 jobs under threat but also public servants, those people who serve the public, will have less time to spend on their tasks. They will have less research back-up, less training and development and so we will have a less able, a less open, a less informed, a less innovative and a less compassionate administration. Is this really a step forward for society in Australia in 1981? Could members of the Government really justify that as a step forward? Is this what the Prime Minister wants? Does he want a situation in which the more affluent we become the more selfish we become? If we look at the changes to the health scheme as an example of the hardships the Government is imposing on ordinary people we find that there has been a return to the pre-Medibank dark ages of the 1960s. I am sure that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), who is at the table, would not be proud to be the present Minister for Health. I am sure that he is happy he is now the Minister for Transport and does not have to preside over these sorts of health cuts. In the 1960s the people were forced into health schemes or else ran the risk of facing huge hospital bills if they were unlucky enough to become ill. Is that the way that life runs in Australia in 1981 ? Should life be a lottery for people who are too poor or whose income is so low that paying into a health insurance fund becomes a hardship? Do these people have to live life like a lottery hoping that they or their kids will not get sick? To make matters worse the Government has slashed its overall funding of health care, forcing the States to find the necessary finance to keep their hospitals from closing. The people of New South Wales, which happens to be your State, and my State, Mr Deputy Speaker, are probably more fortunate than: others in this respect because they at least have a sympathetic State government and a Premier who refuses to bow to the pressure placed upon him by the Federal Government to impose a second income tax. Nevertheless, money for health care has to come from somewhere and New South Wales will have to find some $150m extra this year in order to meet its health commitments. Obviously, hospital fees will have to rise dramatically and, in fact, it was announced today that hospital bed costs will rise from $50 to $80 a day in New South Wales. This increase will be passed on to individuals in the form of greatly increased health insurance contribution rates. I read an article in the Sydney Sun Herald over the weekend in which I noticed that the Minister for Health (Mr MACKellar) was questioned about the likelihood of increased health contributions. He said that that would be a matter for the States to determine. In this, as in everything else, the Government is ignoring its part in causing the problem and is pushing the responsibility for the inevitable cost increases on to the States. The Feds committed the crime and they are simply using the States as scapegoats. Who is going to benefit from the changes to the health scheme? Certainly not the State governments and certainly not individual Australians. Those who will benefit from the Government's action will be the shareholders of the health insurance schemes, who will reap a bonanza from a vastly expanded membership, the owners of private hospitals and the doctors. The high income earners of our society will be the beneficiaries, not the men and women struggling to bring up children on low incomes in places such as the western suburbs of Sydney, which I represent, or the western suburbs of Melbourne. Health. care is just one area where ordinary people will suffer. If we look at the Lynch report we can see many more areas where suffering will occur. The Government claims. that in making the cuts that it has set out in the Lynch committee's report it has merely. trimmed off those services which were not an appropriate field of government activity. What will happen instead, though, is that huge gaps will now be created in services such as nutrition research, preventive medicine and education innovation simply because government is the only body interested in those areas. Private enterprise just will not fill those gaps. The Government pulls out of those fields because there is no profit to be made in them. Inevitably, private enterprise will not fill those gaps. The big sufferers are the public and the country as a whole. The Lynch report has advocated the elimination of 17,000 Public Service jobs. The Government claims that this will be achieved largely through natural wastage. People who leave the Public Service simply will not be replaced. This is all very well. However, the people whQ leave will be those who have the brightest prospects in private enterprise. It is precisely those people who have represented the cream of the Public Service who will be most tempted to leave a service where morale is low and rewards poor to seek brighter opportunities elsewhere. This will leave a dispirited Public Service lacking in talent, overworked and unable to cope with the demands of those they should be serving-members of the public. Already government departmep.ts are finding it difficult to cope with inadequate staffing levels, morale within the Public Service is generally low and the public is forced to endure delays in its dealings with government offices. The effect of even greater staff cuts will be devastating. In the few moments left to me I would like to refer to a problem within my own electorate. In 1973 the then Whitlam Government purchased a block of land in Parrmatta at a cost of something like $5m with the intention of building a Commonwealth office building on that site. The rationale behind that was not just the housing of public servants in a building owned by the Government, by the people, but the many social benefits inherent in it. Anybody with a knowledge of town planning believes that to get the public servants away from the centre of Sydney and out into the areas where they live is a social advantage. They are saved from the problems of travelling for an hour a day and the cost of transport, and from the inherent problems of clogged roads and overutilised trains in which they travel to the city. The building started by the Whitlam Government included some very necessary community facilities which are very much need in my city. As soon as this Government came to power in January 1976 building was stopped and the plan was shelved. Since then the project has languished. A few months ago I was optimistic because the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) visited Parramatta and encouraged us to believe that the Government might be about to make a decision to build. However, no decision has yet been made and I noticed in the Lynch report that funds hav- been cut for government buildings already started in Adelaide and Townsville. Also, in one bland statement it was stated that surplus Commonwealth land would be sold, and I fear that that might be the prospect for the land in Parramatta. Obviously, the Government would get a big profit because the land is now worth about $20m. I dare say that land in Parramatta is under great threat. Mr Burr-What does Tom Vren think?",83
127,Mr JOHN BROWN,FUNCTIONS,"Someone mentioned the honourable member for Reid. I add also that I have noticed that the Glebe Estate is now on offer to the New South Wales Government. I hope that that Government will take over the Estate. The purchase of the Glebe Estate was one of the great achievements of the Whitlam Government. This area of old homes was bought, the houses were restored, and the traditional residents of Glebe have been able to stay there. It would be a dreadful tragedy if this land were passed over to private enterprise.",85
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FUNCTIONS, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,85
129,Mr MCLEAN,FUNCTIONS,"1 support the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) outlining the Government's Review of Commonwealth Functions. The Opposition has adopted a very curious position on the Government's expenditure reduction policy. It seems to want to have a bob each way. It spent all of the last election campaign criticising us for being a party of big government expenditure and high taxes. It was certainly curious to hear the socialists criticise the Government on those grounds. In fact, the socialist party almost won the last election by criticising the Liberal Party for being the big government, high tax party. On philosophical grounds at least, that was a curious position for Opposition members to adopt. Therefore, it is also curious that they should now criticise the Government for trying to redress the imbalance by moving towards smaller government and lower taxes-the very things they seemed to espouse during the last campaign. The situation is even more curious when we read of the socialist party's own position regarding the public sector and taxation. Its position seems to depend on whether it is in government or opposition and whether it is approaching an election. For example, last week the Leader Opposition (Mr Hayden) severely criticised the Government for reducing the Government sector in order to allow the more productive private sector to expand. Yet in 1975, when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, he said: We expect that as the expansion of public sector activity is restrained, the opportunities for private sector expansion will improve. When in opposition, and well removed from any election, the Leader of the Opposition said when talking about the desirability of getting lower taxes in Australia: This sort of approach strikes directly at the democratic socialist notion that equality and equity can only be assured by a stronger public sector. In 1978, also far removed from any election, the shadow Treasurer said that a future Labor government would: . . . face a mammoth task in rebuilding the public sector and an equally mammoth task in convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so. It seems to me that the ALP is all over the place on this issue. It has different views at different times and seems to be guided more by votes and political expediency than by high principle. If the Labor Party is noW suggesting that we should have tax cuts but no expenditure cuts then it basically is advocating its old economic policies of massive deficit blowouts, to be financed either by printing more money and causing inflation, or by going into massive debt, causing interest rate hikes and placing future generations of Australians in debt because we, the present generation, decided to live beyond our means. The basic reason for the present cuts is to reduce the overall public sector borrowing requirement which has been a major cause of the interest rate rises in Australia. The fact remains that governments have to either tax or axe if they are to have responsible Budgets. If that is not done government expenditure rises. Any government expenditure increase that is not financed either by taxes or borrowings simply leads to more inflation. The ALP still clings to the old economic doctrines in accusing this Government of increasing unemployment to control inflation. The shadow Treasurer said this very recently when commenting on the latest consumer price index increase. The Leader of the Opposition still seems to share that belief. Yet in 1975 the Leader of the Opposition, the then Treasurer, said: Today it is inflation itself which is the central policy lem. More inflation simply leads to more unemployment. Once again, there is no consistency in ALP economic policy. It just happens to be convenient from, time to time for it to change its policies to meet the political demands of the moment. This Government has been criticised for being harsh. People have said that the razor gang decisions will cause more unemployment. I think that the Press comment in this regard has been most interesting. Many editorials have criticised the Government for not going far enough, but they have agreed that the nation would be better off for the trend established by these cuts. The Australian Financial Review last Friday stated that there will not be wholesale redundancy of public servants. It made the point that the staff reductions of about 17,000 people would be achieved by, to use its own terms, natural wastage, resignation, retirements and lower recruitment. To suggest that decreasing government expenditure will increase unemployment ignores the fact that such expenditure is financed by taxes. Higher taxes simply mean that people have less to spend and therefore businesses have less to sell and must reduce their costs and levels of operation, including their levels of employment. The Labor Party obviously has forgotten its own experience in government, when record increases in government expenditure led to record increases in unemployment. It tried to explain its poor economic performance in terms of depressed international economic conditions rather than in terms of its own domestic mismanagement. At the present time, with depressed international conditions, the policies of this Government of expenditure restraint and reduced deficits have led to a situation where almost every economic indicator available shows that we in Australia now have a stronger economy than almost any other country in the industrialised world. Employment levels over the past two yearsyears of government expenditure restraint-have risen substantially. Labour force figures released this week show that total employment rose by 146,900 in the year to March 1981 and by 328,500 in the last two years, with the overall position of schoolleavers improving strongly. Certainly, unemployment is still too high, but at least we are making some progress on this very pressing problem. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) today issued some more figures which state the unemployment situation in April. He said: . . . preliminary unemployment estimates released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics were the best figures prob- since the monthly surveys were introduced in February 1978. The Minister further stated: . . . the estimated total of . . . people unemployed and looking for full time work was the lowest April figure recorded. To suggest, therefore, that in economic terms expenditure cuts are both heartless and incorrect policy completely ignores not only economic sense but also the facts of recent economic history, both in Australia and overseas. Surely the latest employment figures and the soundness of our major economic indicators suggest not an abandoning of our policies of expenditure restraint but a strengthening of these policies as outlined in the Prime Minister's speech. I cannot see how these results indicate a harsh policy or one lacking compassion. There was no mention of hitting the needy in the welfare area, and neither should there be any mention of that. Surely this policy is the only one which offers a humane, longer term approach to our major economic and social problems: It has already led to better economic performance and to more employment. What is harsh about that? What is harsh about increasing the capacity of the Government, through these cuts, to increase its manoeuvrability by giving it the option of moving towards a combination of lower taxes and/or a concentration of more resources on the really needy sections of society? This is a flexibility which the Government did not have before these cuts were announced. These cuts have proved that the capacity of the Government to move in these directions can be increased without in any way placing increased burdens on the welfare sector. I believe the Government can do much more in this direction. For example, we should now decide not to proceed with the construction of a neW and permanent parliament house and, similarly, we should look at some of the more extravagant fringe benefits enjoyed by members of this Parliament. In this context I want to stress to the House the importance of the present public perception of members and senators of all parties. I think some cynicism and scepticism about elected representatives is a good and healthy thing but my own contact with my electorate indicates that there is a belief-rightly or wrongly, it does not matter-that we as the elected representatives confer benefits upon ourselves quickly, generously, unobtrusively and with unanimity but, at the same time, expect others in the public sector to accept restraints and cuts. I believe it is important that the cuts involve an equal bearing of the sacrifice by all sections of the public sector, including ourselves. If this program of public sector cuts, which I support- is to have credibility and gain the degree of public acceptance we require, we should apply to ourselves the same standards we apply to others in the community. I want to refer to the new parliament house which, at present, is expected to cost in excess of $300m at current prices. Certainly that figure will grow. Within my own party I have long been opposed to the construction of this building. I believe it is now appropriate, given the Government's report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, to restate this view because, after all, it took some 350 decisions of the so-called razor gang to save something like $560m of taxpayers' funds. With one decision not to proceed with the new parliament house we could effect savings equal to 40 per cent of that total amount achieved by the razor gang. When the decision to proceed with the new parliament house was made it was said that it would provide the nation with a sense of national identity, a sense of national pride, that it would be a memorial to parliamentary democracy, and so forth. Very lavish phrases and many superlatives were thrown about. I reject that proposition on several grounds. Firstly, the integrity of parliamentary democracy or the achieving of a sense of national pride does not depend on bricks and mortar-it depends on what happens inside that building; it depends on the quality of government and the dignity of the members of parliament who sit within that building. The second point I make relates to some of the other major projects in the Australian Capital Territory which are being shelved at the moment, such as the national museum. The point is that most of my constituents in Perth, and most residents of Western Australia, because of our isolation and the present structure of air fares in this country, are denied the opportunity to visit and see these so-called national buildings which their taxes have helped to build. I sometimes think that some of these things, such as the National Art Gallery and national museums, ought to be built in some of the more populous centres of this country. The third point I make in regard to the new parliament house is that the building we occupy now is an historic building and with some minor additions, and some changes to our present Standing Orders, it could certainly suit our foreseeable needs. As I said earlier, I extend my argument in this regard to include also certain fringe benefits enjoyed by members of parliament, particularly those benefits which have no real influence on how well we do our jobs. I mention the need to restrict members' fringe benefits not because they constitute major public expenditure savings; they do not. It is not a matter of dollars and cents. I raise the matter because some action ought to be taken in those areas if we, as members of parliament, wish to apply expenditure restraints in other areas of the public sector and in so doing maintain credibility and some degree of public acceptance for these expenditure cuts. I support the concept embraced in the statement by the Prime Minister last Thursday. It is in accord with every major strand of economic thinking by respectable bodies overseas. Within Australia there have been many comments in support of this strategy. I would like to quote from the latest monthly publication of ANZ Bank Business Indicators. That publication said: The outstanding feature of the Australian economy is the lift now occurring in private sector demand and in total employment. It goes on to explain rises in consumption expenditure and the massive increases in private investment expenditure in Australia, and then states: This expansion by the private sector should lift the flow of revenue to Government. At the same time it should also obviate the need for direct Government involvement in stimulating economic activity . . . In particular, the growth in private sector economic activity should provide scope for some reduction in the growth of Government spending without adversely affecting total economic activity. Considering present and expected growth in total investment expenditure, it would be desirable for the Government to lessen its demands in order to maintain an economic environment conducive to further abatement in the rate of inflation. On economic grounds, responsible management grounds and compassionate grounds I believe the decisions of this committee of review announced last Thursday are responsible and in the best long term interests of this country.",85
130,Mr MOUNTFORD,FUNCTIONS,"This debate is in response to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to Parliament last Thursday on the Review of Commonwealth Functions. We are told that this review had as its aims the streamlining and fining down of Commonwealth operations, partly by withdrawing from functions more appropriately handled by the States or private enterprise and partly by rationalising the functions which properly belong to the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister went on further to say that the aim of the review in the wider perspective was to establish the conditions under which there can be increased opportunities for all and better care for those in need. To complete the scenario of the results of the review's findings, one needs to read to the end of page 3 of the statement. If one did not know our Prime Minister and those who support him, or at least sit behind him, one would think that those who sit on the Government benches really had the interests of all Australians at heart. But we know differently. What has been written in this review is fairy story stuff and is unworthy of being espoused by this Government. T-e speech writers who prepared the scenario should be writing for Disneyland or the Hanna-Barbera organisation, because they are writing about matters affecting Australians of which their political masters could not care less. The Government has expressed the view that there should be small government and increased activity taken up by the private sector with the object of creating employment opportuni-ies.and of giving people a greater say over theu lives. Hence we have seen a series of attacks on the Public' Service and the public sector by this Government over recent months, culminating in the decision to reduce public services as outlined in the review document. In so doing, the Government. is taking a typical Milton Friedman attitude. Friedman holds that such services are relentlessly in conflict with liberty and that the market accords to the individual the sovereignty of choice whereas the state, as it enlarges its services, - urtails or impairs that choice. By its acceptance of a large Public Service and a protective role for the state, democracy commits itself to an irreversible descent into totalitarianism and communism. Professor Friedman is firm about this prospect, and has stated: If we continue our present trend and our free society is replaced by a col1ective society, the intel1ectuals who have done so much to drive us down this path will not be the ones who run the society; the prison, the insane asylum, or the graveyard would be their fate . . . or shaH we have the wisdom and the courage to change our course, to learn from experience, and to benefit from a rebirth of freedom. Obviously Government members have been made disciples of Milton Friedman's theories because what they are proposing has a marked similarity. The Government had best beware as there are grave disadvantages in being associated with a policy that will not work. It should be noted that this arch exponent of monetarism, Professor Friedman, has already been forced to disassociate himself from Israel and Chile where he was once celebrated as a prophet. The Friedman policy in Britain has so far produced only high inflation, deep internal stagnation, the highest unemployment since the Great Depression and some indication that he would like to be detached from these policies as well. I believe the Government is misreading both the economic signs and the political signs in taking the actions outlined in the review and by reducing the public sector community involvement. The policies of smaller government espoused by the Thatcher and Reagan administration have not worked and will not work. The attack which we see on the public sector at the present time is a generalised attack. Education, urban services and other conventional functions of government as well as assistance to the sick, public housing funding, assistance to the unemployed and the unemployable and other government enterprises are all under attack. We are told that people must be left free to choose. The divesting of government activities to private enterprise is supposed to create a greater freedom of choice, more employment, economic growth and a better life for all. In putting forward such theories, of course, the Government is pretending that the giant financial institutions and multinational corporations do not exist. These corporations control and govern the world economynot governments. These corporations have the power to set prices and to create employment or unemployment, whichever suits their need, from country to country. They influence extensively the taste of consumers and, similarly, they organise their supplies of raw materials. With all of this influence these corporations erode the power of the market. Does anyone suggest that corporations such as the Bank of America, Shell, IBM, Philips, Exxon and Esso do not have a great influence on the finances and market forces of Australia? It is because of these influences that the Government's policies will not work. The disbandment of the Prices Justification Tribunal will make it even more difficult to control any excesses. It needs to be remembered that the abolition of the Prices Justification Tribunal will not be welcomed by the rural industry also. Inquiries into stevedoring, woolbroking charges, spare parts and fuel prices all save primary producers a lot of money. The National Farmers Federation recently said that PJT recommendations meant a $43.5m saving on fuel prices for primary producers alone. I will now turn my attention to some of the more specific matters outlined in the Review of Commonwealth Functions. One of the hardest hit areas is that of education. In that area we have seen monetary reductions over a wide range of activities. The first item is to restrict the opportunity for persons over 19 years of age to receive a Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance while doing their Higher School Certificate through the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme. This is a miserly decision as not more than 2,000 persons throughout Australia took advantage of the scheme during 1980. Many of the people who were unable to complete their HSC during their school life saw this as the only opportunity to better themselves in later life. Similarly, the decision to introduce fees for students undertaking second degree or diploma courses in universities and colleges of advanced education is obviously only the thin edge of the wedge for the eventual reintroduction of fees for all1evels of courses. Over a period of many years this country has tablished a proud record in the availability of free education which has enabled all persons, including young people, irrespective of their financial background, the opportunity of education so that they can procure a better standard of living for themselves and their families. Education must never be linked to the financial standing of individuals. The restriction of payment of TEAS allowances to those persons required to live away from home by reason of geography or home conditions means that the only students eligible will be those from country locations. At the present time the scheme is a - joke as the majority of students receiving the allowance come from country locations. Because of the fact that their families usually operate under income splitting schemes this allows them to be satisfactorily means tested so that they receive the benefit. The supposed rationalisation of colleges of advanced education will do nothing but reduce the effectiveness of these colleges. In New South Wales those hit the hardest are those located in the heavily populated areas where the need is greatest. The Milperra College of Advanced Education, which is within my electorate, is one of those affected. The population of the region served by this college is as large as that of South Australia. It is the only college in the southwestern region of Sydney-the fastest growing metropolitan area in any part of Australia. The college has 800 students, 62 on the academic staff and 62 non-academic staff. The college conducts a great many courses including those concerned with teacher education, multicultural education, career education, social welfare and the arts. Should that college be amalgamated, it would deprive access to tertiary education to 20 per cent of those students because of travel problems. It may be of interest to note that few of the colleges of advanced education in the country were affected. For instance, the Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education, which is in the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), has not been the subject of any cuts of the razor gang. Tf one has seen this college one would say that it should be the first to be affected. So much for rationale and fairness! Another area to suffer from the Government's decision is Aboriginal affairs. The cruel reductions by the Government have seen the percentage of the national Budget spent on the recovery of Aboriginal Australians reduced from 0.9 per cent in 1974-75 to 0.6 per cent in 19S0-SJ-a reduction of over 30 per cent in the six years of this Fraser Government. The hopes concerning the lives of these, our fellow Australians, have been dashed es- once again-just after their hopes had been raised in the early 1970s by a caring and sympathetic Labor Government. It makes the policy of self determination impossible because they are being denied the resources necessary for management. This is not good enough for the Aboriginal men, women and children who should be treated as equal partners in the development of our great country. The 44 pages of the Prime Minister's statement made no commitment to the future but instead showed that the Government had opted out of significant areas of government responsibility. It has no mandate from the people for doing so. I suggest that the Australian people will not support the supposed free enterprise government for much longer because they will come to realise between now and the next election that this Government has abrogated its responsibilities to others rather than pursuing a course of providing incentives and assistance to those in our coummunity who are most in need of them. In those important areas of education, health, job-creation, pensioner benefits, housing and urban transportation, the Government has failed the people of Australia. The Government's cynical exercise of cutting back on necessary welfare areas so that it can give some rebates in direct taxation payments in 1982-83-just prior to the next election-whilst increasing indirect taxes, will not be accepted by the Australian electorate because this Government has lost its credibility. The big difference between members sitting on this side of the House and those on the Government side is that we care about people. We care about their quality of life, the type of world that they live in and the type of world that their children will grow up in. We believe the benefits derived from the resources of this great country should be shared amongst the people of Australia. We have always held to those principles in the past and will hold to them in the future because we belong to a party of principle. We believe only governments can ensure that people receive their rightful share of a country's wealth and that they are cared for in time of need. We do not believe the private sector can ensure those things. The private sector friends of this Government do not have a good record in corporate responsibility or public service. In fact, the opposite is the case. Hardly a day goes past without one of its corporate colleagues being arraigned for corporate crime. Today's Sydney Morning Herald records the fact that a friend of this Government and, I understand, a former Treasurer of the Country Party, Harry M, Miller, is to go for trial on 22 charges for breaches of the Crimes Act or the Securities Industry Act following the collapse of the theatre booking agency, Computicket Australia Pty Ltd.",88
131,Mr SCHOLES,FUNCTIONS,He was appointed to a number of boards by this Government. .,90
132,Mr MOUNTFORD,FUNCTIONS,"That is correct. He was appointed to those boards by this Government. These friends of the Government put our former bushrangers to shame. Yet it is to these people ,that the Government is saying that we should entrust our future. I have no doubt that the. unprincipled activities of this Government will be fairly judged. by the people of Australia at the next election when a Labor government, dedicated to improving the quality of life for Australians, will be elected. The people of Australia will not forget the way in which this Government has deceived them by its constant breaking of election promises since it took office in 1975. This Government of deceit and deception, which now lies in tatters, should resign and let the people of Australia decide what type of government they want.",90
133,Mr BURR,FUNCTIONS,"J was intrigued by the speech of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Mountford). He implied throughout his speech that the Federal Government and, I assume, the State governments should increase their spending for various types of public enterprise. I suppose to the electors in the electorate of Banks and other electorates held by Labor representatives that might seem to be terribly attractive. Nowhere in the speech by the honourable member for Banks or, for that matter in speeches by other Opposition members, was the correlation made that increases in public spending also mean increases in taxes. Governments can spend only the moneys they take from the people in taxes. If the Australian Labor Parly advocates that governments should increase expenditure, for what ever reason they are also saying that they should take more money in taxes so that they can spend it. If the Labor Party is the party of principle and honesty it claims to be why do not its members tell the people that if they are to spend more money they will also take more from them in taxes? If they are going to be honest, they have to admit that. Let us refer to some of the things that the Australian Labor Party would do if it were given the opportunity to govern. I refer to what the Labor Party said at its conference held in Adelaide in July 1979. It said: Labor is committed by its Platform to 'an expanded interventionist role by Government, and a responsible development of the public sector to satisfy social needs and provide employment'. What the Labor Party is advocating and what it was charged to carry out by that conference in Adelaide, rather than a reduction in the size of government and the taxes that are taken by government from the people, is an expansion of the role of government to involve itself in the private lives of individuals throughout Australia. In order to do that it was also charged to take more taxes from the people. It was committed to do that by the conference in Adelaide. It will do it in a number of ways. I cannot go through all the motions passed at the Adelaide conference but I will inform the people of Australia about some of them. Let us look at the Labor Party's health policy for a start. The most discredited policy that was implemented by the Labor Government during the years 1972 to 1975 without doubt was the Medibank policy. It cost this country more than it could possibly afford. It pushed health costs through the roof. We are still paying the price of that policy. This Government, through announcements made last week by the Minister for Health (Mr MACKellar) has finally decided to bite the bullet and break down the final vestiges of that Medibank policy. All I can say is that it is five years too late. What would the Labor Party do if it got back into office? Again I refer to its conference in Adelaide in 1979. It was stated: The new ALP Platform states that 'A Federal Labor Government will introduce a universal health scheme to be financed by an income related contribution . . .' It is proposed to return to its discredited policies of 1972 to 1975 and reintroduce Medibank. It could not be afforded by the people of Australia then and it cannot be afforded by them now. The Labor Party is proposing to impose such tax burdens on this country as cannot possibly be afforded. I can only assume that I have hit a very raw nerve with Opposition members who are trying to interject. I leave it to my friends in the Opposition to contemplate the truth of what I am telling them at this stage. Let us pass on from the Labor Party's health policy. What else would it do if it were given the opportunity of governing? I return to the Adelaide conference. Let us look at the Labor Party's policy on oil and mineral exploration. What would it do? At the conference it was stated: Labor will establish an Australian Hydrocarbon corporation, a GQvernment owned fully-integrated oil company. It was proposing to spend $l,OOOm, based on estimates at that time, in socialising all our oil and mineral exploration. Can this country accept socialised exploitation of our mineral wealth at a time when the Australian people are demanding tax cuts? It is simply not possible. What it illustrates is that the Labor Party has not learnt its lessons of 1972 to 1975. It is intent on expanding the role of government in the community and charging more in taxes to do so. This Government, on the other hand, is intent on reducing the role of government in the community and, as a consequence, reducing the taxation burden on the Australian community. There is only one thing wrong with the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions presently being debated, that is that it does not go far enough. The report proposes very good policies on the part of this Government, but it must be on ly a starting point for other things to follow at a later stage. The report presented by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) proposes that there be a reduction of 17,000 public servants. Why only J 7,000? Why not get rid of a whole lot of dead wood in the Public Service and, more particularly, in the statutory corporations that this country can well do without? The taxpayers cannot afford to keep those public servants in their cushy jobs. I wonder whether my friends in the Opposition have studied some of the statements made by a former respected member in this place, Mr Clyde Cameron. Do they know what his comments were about feathet-bedded public servants? They are defying that respected former member of this House and saying that we should continue to feather-bed them. I do not believe we should. I do not think the Australian community can afford to do so any more. I ask why we are reducing the Public Service by only 17,000 people. Why are we not looking further into the statutory corporations? The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations suggested that there are 260 statutory corporations employing about two-thirds of the public servants in this country. Why has not more been done to reduce the number of employees of those statutory corporationsin the light of that Senate Committee report? It highlighted the dead wood and the inefficiency within those statutory corporations. More should have been done to weed out the dead wood in that element of the Public Service. I have mentioned previously that whilst I believe that the report that has been brought down by the Government is a good report, and it is heading in the right direction, it simply does not go far enough. The honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous), who has migrated from Greece, is trying to interject. Perhaps his former country is socialised but we do not want socialisation in this country. The report is a direct response to the Coombs report presented in this chamber by the Whitlam Government. The Coombs report suggested a whole range of measures through various departments socialising all the activities throughout the Australian commercial world. It suggested ways of doing that. The Whitlam Government mercilessly pursued the suggestions made in the Coombs report. The report we have before us reverses the trend that was' put in train by the Coombs report. There is only one thing wrong with this action of the GOVernment and that is that it is five years too late. We should have done this in 1976 when we first took office. There are still further things which I believe the Government should do. We should be cutting back further on our Public Service. I cannot understand why in this.report there is a notation against the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet which states: 'The staff interchange program will be expanded'. Does it mean that staff will be transferred from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet or does it mean that staff will be transferred into that Department?",90
134,Mr SCHOLES,FUNCTIONS,What do you think?,92
135,Mr BURR,FUNCTIONS,"I do not know. If it means that staff are to be transferred into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet I would strongly oppose that. I do not believe that Department should be expanded beyond its present size. I wish to deal with a few other areas where I believe the Government should also have cut back further. I cannot justify the continuance of the Industrial Relations Bureau. I believe it should have been scrapped and we should have reverted to the former Industrial Inspectorate. The Industrial Relations Bureau has not justified its continued existence in the light of criticisms that have been directed at it not only by the trade union movement but also by employers and all others in the field of industrial relations. I strongly urge the Government at the earliest possible opportunity to scrap the Industrial Relations Bureau and to go back to the former Industrial Inspectorate. I believe the Government should have done far more to cut back on the irresponsible spending by the State governments. We have reached a stage where spending by State government is very much in the limelight. The present Federal Government cannot be expected to cut back its expenditure and, in the process of so doing, reduce the burden on the taxpayers of Australia while the State governments continue to spend taxpayers' money in an irresponsible and cavalier fashion. That cannot be done. If there is to be a reduction in taxpayers' charges and a reduction in the role and the involvement of the Government then the States also have to play their part. We cannot justify State Premiers simply screaming poverty when they come to Canberra, expecting the Federal Government to bail them out of their economic problems, and then' charging back to their home States and spending taxpayers' money irresponsibly on the basis that they have not been charged with raising that money from the taxpayers. This raises two propositions. Either the State governments must be more responsive to the directions of the Federal Government's policy proposals, in cutting back the size of theit involvement and their Public Service, or they must take far more responsibility in raising their revenue by way of taxes. The Premiers cannot have the best of both worlds simply by coming to Canberra, screaming poverty, wanting more inoney and then going back to their home States and spending it in a totally irresponsible manner. I think this Government should go a little further. I strongly recommend that the Government divest itself of more involvement with statutory corporations and other areas of public enterprise. I cannot justify government intervention or involvement in any form of commercial practice or activity. I do not need to go any further than to instance Trans-Australia Airlines. TAA has been shown to be grossly inefficient--far less efficient than its private enterprise competitor. The Government has taken a decision to turn TAA into a private company. I disagree with the Government in that I believe that the .shares in TAA should not be offered either in majority or in total to public subscription. I do not believe it is the role of the Government to maintain an interest, let alQne,a controlling interest, in a commercial enterprise such as TAA. When the company is established I strongly urge the Government to offer all· the shares for private SUbscription.",92
136,Mr SCHOLES,FUNCTIONS,"Corio) (9.16}--One of the things that I noticed about the speech of the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr) was his generalisations-broad sweeping statements. He said that there were 2,000 statutory authorities; that half of them should be done away with. Members of this Parliament, irrespective 'of on which side of the House they sit, usually know their own areas and their own electorates best. If the honourable member knows of Commonwealth services in his electorate then he should name which of those services he considers should be discontinued. If his State is receiving government assistance then he should stand-up and name those areas of assistance that he thinks are exorbitant. The facts are that the last three years he has spent half his time in the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) trying to get greater levels of government assistance for his electorate and his State-Mr Burr- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. I would be grateful if the honourable member for Corio would give me another 15 minutes to outline-",92
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FUNCTIONS," Order! Does the honourable member for Wilmot have a point of order? Mr Burr- Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg your pardon. At an appropriate time 1 will claim to have been misrepresented.",92
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FUNCTIONS,I suggest that the honourable member wait for an appropriate time.,92
139,Mr SCHOLES,FUNCTIONS,"Every honourable member in this House kIiows oUhe successful efforts which were made to get freight equalisation and other , ,. benefits for Tasmania. I am sure that the apple growers and potato growers of New South Wales are complaining about these measures because Tasmania is undercutting the New South Wales market with the help of Commonwealth subsidies. I am not disagreeing with that but I suggest to the honourable member that when he asks for subsidies he should not get up in, this Parliament and say that they are not proper and appropriate. The report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions reveals some strange bedfellows. I do not think the, report is a sound one. There are to be cuts in government expenditure but I doubt whether many wool growers.,-certainly the' representatives of'tnc' wool growers-will consider that the Government is taking a step forward by getting rid of the Australian Wool Testing Authority. When the Authority was run by private enterprise it was inefficient and costly and did not do the job expected of it by the wool growers. Under its existing management it is efficient and profitable. Now the Government steps into bring b-ck inefficiency in the name of private companies. If the Government can make a quid it does no- matter who suffers. Honourable members· all heard the talk about this great new health scheme. rhe user 'paysthat is the principle we are talking about.'Who is the user of a health scheme? What are his economic circumstances, especially if he is a low income earner living from ,hand to mouth, not a pensioner but a low income earner with a family? Mr Hyde-You can help the poor people. . ' Mr ,SCHOLES-I am not talking abput the poor people either; I am talking about the ordinary people who live in the conununity, the Australians whom some honou,rable members opposite ought to consider sometimes. I am talking about a.family with a child who has a disability; who cannot eat certain foods, who has to have regular hospitalisation, who has to have dialysis treatment or many of the other ,treatments which are extraordinarily expensive in our society. What does the Government say? If that family is unlucky enough and .cares enough to want to do something abQut that child then the Government says that the user should pay! The ,misfortune of ill health is not s-mething that we choose ourselves. It is not an afHiction, and it is certainly not a sign of some evil thing that we have done to ourselves or our children. It is something that happens to us. The user pays-wha- utter rot! The user pays idea is an easy way out for p-ople who want to avoid their responsibilities to their fellow human beings. In the field of health the Government has abdi-ted totally its responsibilities to its fellow human beings. It has no' heart, no care, and no responsibility. It is all right for the Prime Minister, he talked today about unnecessary subsidies. Ask him to come into this Parliament and list the subsidies he gets on his own property. In many instances they are greater than the costs for the sick. But the user pays! In the field of health the community has a responsibility to itself t- ensure that those people who have need of treatment are entitled to get that treatment at the most reasonable cost possible. To criticise the situation of payment for health services on the basis of ability to pay is to talk about abandoning the sick because their ability to pay is the lowest of any section of the community. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Wilmot, made it a virtue that the poor should not get treatment because they cannot pay. Within 12 months it will cost $700 to $900 a year to be adequately covered by a scheme. That is the cost that the Government is about to infiiqt on the average family in Australia. Not too many families, large families especially, 'will be able to 'afford the cost. When the Government inflicts that charge on those families it whould just remember that many will not be able to afford it. They will not be adequately covered. What is a public hospital to do when the father of that family has a massive coronary, arrives at the hospital door, does not have adequate medical cover and does not meet the criteria for being disadvantaged? Does it say to him when he needs open ,heart surgery and intensive care treatment: 'lam sorry. Take him home and arrange for the cheapest funeral' you can afford'? The medical costs involved to save the father, the breadwinner, of such a fiunily are between $10,000 and $20,000. The user pays! Perhaps we should say that the family should sell the house, as people do in America, the free enterprise way. Not on your life.·Most Australians disagree with the Governmerit's proposals on health. It is a coward's castle. <;learly, the Government is running away from its responsibilities as a national governme-t. I want to speak also about a number of other matters. Firstly, I will deal with some specific matters in the areas for which I have responsibilityon the Opposition benches. ""-r Barn- Jo-es-The Australian Capital Territory: M- SCHOLES-The Australian Capital Tertitory and Defence, and I speak also as a member of the national parliament. I make just one' point. Someone here tonight spoke about getting rid of l'arliament House as a cost saving factor. In the last couple of days the Government has been talking about government borrowings being one of the causes of high interest rates. It is not much more than a year ago that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Howard), who are now talking about the evils of government borrowings, were going to the State governments and encouraging them to take up loan funds for infrastructure borrowings. If people want to know the most irresponsible action that has taken place in the financial world in this country in the last three years, at the behest of this Commonwealth Government, it is over $300m of borrowings for an international trade centre in Melbourne which is one of the greatest white elephants in this country's history. It is a monument to the incompetence and irresponsibility of the Victorian Government, and a monument to the double standards of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, who encouraged and advocated those borrowings. They now come into this House and tell us that it was evil. May I make a contrast with those borrowings. A small amount of money was borrowed to establish the Belconnen Mall in Canberra, which was set up under separate management. The Commonwealth contributed $lm. The Mall currently has an estimated value approaching $54m. It has a debt situation of around $40m. This year its profits on running equalled the original Commonwealth investment. It is providing for the community in which it is established considerable infrastructure in the form of playgrounds and other recreational facilities which a community would expect from its local government body, if Canberra had one-it does not. The Mall is providing those things at no cost to the responsible government, being the Commonwealth Government. If it is sold, over a very short period there will be a profit to the Treasury of in excess of $20m if it is sold at anything like its market value. Who gets the benefit of that $20m? Mr Hyde-The taxpayer.",92
140,Mr SCHOLES,FUNCTIONS,"The taxpayer, my foot. It will go into providing more subsidies to people like Malcolm Fraser. That is where it will go. Government members do not seriously think that their Government is in the business of benefiting the taxpayer. The Government has transferred $4,OOOm of taxpayers' funds from communitybased operations, operations which would normally be of value to the lower middle income earner-in other words, the 70 per cent of Australians who earn their living by means of manual or other forms of labour-mainly to overseas companies. But the biggest and the wealthiest people in this Commonwealth have been the beneficiaries of $4,000m of resources transferred in five years. We should remember that the people are paying more taxes and the Government is spending more as a percentage of gross domestic product than the average spent during the three years of the Labor Government. Let us not kid ourselves about small government or saving taxpayers' money. The Government is spending taxpayers' money as hard as it can go. What the Government is doing with it, of course, is paying off the big contributors to its parties' funds. Utah got a $120m dividend for a donation to the two political parties that govern this country, and there has been plenty more of that. I have about three minutes left to speak and I want to use that time to discuss a couple of things, including the area of defence, which notably was left alone. Whilst a number of teachers colleges, an early childhood development centre, and a couple of Catholic teachers colleges in Melbourne have gone, an organisation that this Parliament through one of its committees indicated was a waste of public funds, is to continue. I did not hear the honourable member for Perth (Mr MCLean) mention this, but it was stated in a report to this Parliament that the Australian Defence Academy was a waste of public funds. Of course, the Academy is sacrosanct because it is the Prime Minister's favourite project. It is like the 707s. It does not matter what they cost, the Prime Minister wants them, therefore the country must need them, and the taxpayer must be glad to pay for them. It is a waste of public funds, no more and no less, but it is still in the Government's - Mr MCLean-What about the new Parliament House?",94
141,Mr SCHOLES,FUNCTIONS,I said that the honourable member had mentioned that. Mr MCLean-Do you agree with it.,94
142,Mr SCHOLES,FUNCTIONS,"No, I do not agree with any of the Government's cuts. The Government is moving to close the Defence Printing Establishment. It is also moving to close the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, although there is some charade about sale to private enterprise. I suppose that since the Government did not tell the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bouchier), it had to put up some sort of charade, but the fact is that the Government is going to close it. The charade is that within a year the Defence Printing Establishment will be transferred to the Australian Government Publishing Service. But the report on the Department of Administrative Services says that the functions of the Government Printing Office will be disposed of to private enterprise immediately, except for those essential requirements of Hansard and immediate Government Printing. The Defence Printing Establishment carries out at a high technological level a considerable amount of sensitive and important printing, which is necessary for the armed forces of this country. It is to be sold off so that someone can make a quick buck. Damn the armed forces and damn the requirements they might have for accurate and secure printing! The Government has no worries at all about the people who work there. The Government must have a friend in Melbourne who is prepared to make a big donation and who wants quickly a printing works or some section of a printing works. For any government to sell off any essential defence establishment as a cost saving exercise is a repudiation of its responsibilities for national security and defence preparedness; and that is exactly what is happening in this instance. The Defence Printing Establishment provides a highly confidential printing service for the Department of Defence. The Government is saying that its printing requirements should go out to private contractors. Honourable members ought to read what the Prime Minister said in the Review of Commonwealth Functions because the Defence work is not being transferred to the Government Printer. The Government Printer's functions are being sold to private enterprise, and that is' all there is to it. There is only one thing that can be said with re- ing gard to Canberra. Canberra is completely defenceless in the face of a ruthless and exploitive Federal Government. It is about time the Government gave the people of Canberra, whether they want it or not, the responsibility of making their own decisions with regard to their own money. The Government talks about letting people make decisions on how to spend their money yet in Canberra it has a principality with an absentee prince and an authority which it is paying but which has no decision-making power at all. It is a disgrace to any democratic society and it is a disgrace to this Parliament that that situation continues.",94
143,Mr HYDE,FUNCTIONS,"The observation I must make to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) is that a loud voice and assertion is no substitute for argument. If the Opposition is going to insist that all these things which the Review of Commonwealth Functions mentions can be retained in the public sector and that they will necessarily be more efficient and so on and so forth, I point out that it is as incumbent on the Opposition to provide argument as it is on us. The report of the co-called razor gang is something of a watershed. To understand that we need to understand some recent history. Ever since 1975 the Liberal Party has talked of small government. In 1980 we introduced what was the biggest Budget in real terms in Australia's history. That was followed by an election which the Australian Labor Party came close to winning, although it was still appreciably short of the majority of public opinion; but it achieved that result by costing the Liberal Party's promises. The interesting thing about the election is that during the latter part of it the Labor Party spent its time-Mr MCLean-Criticising the Government.",95
144,Mr HYDE,FUNCTIONS,"The Labor Party spent its time criticising us about big government. It seemed to win some votes on that. Socialism is normally defined as the public ownership and control of the means of production, distribution and exchange. Mr Kent-There's nothing wrong with that either if it is-",95
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FUNCTIONS, Order!,95
146,Mr HYDE,FUNCTIONS,"Just pipe down a second and let me complete the argument; it will demonstrate to the honourable member that we are both in a fairly inconsistent position. Since that time, in terms of small government, the rhetoric from this side of the House has been excellent. The Governor General's Speech was clearly a speech in favour of small government. On behalf of the Government the Governor General said: My Government will give particular attention to encouragthe growth of the private sector and to increasing the freedom of choice of taxpayers in spending their own incomes. It will be an important policy objective to continue to restrain public expenditure so as to provide scope for reducing the burden of taxation. We read a similar recommendation in the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the South Australian Liberal Party. I will not read that speech as honourable members can look it up. The Tuesday before last in this House the Prime Minister said: The Government's direction has always been that individuals are the best judges of how to spend their own earnings, that the disadvantaged and the needy must be provided for, that the tax burden must be reduced, that employment must be increased, that freedom of choice must be paramount. I agree with all those things, and I agree with them very strongly indeed. Small government requires two things: It requires a small public sector and it requires small regulations of the private sector. The two areas we have to get out of are these: The public controlling of the society, because we own it and take all the decisions; and we have to get out of the business of telling all the individuals in the society how they will spend their money and, as a result, how they will occupy their time. Last Thursday'S statement was a very important first step in the right direction. Mr Kent-It was a disgrace.",95
147,Mr HYDE,FUNCTIONS,"The honourable member is welcome to his opinion because he wishes to go in an opposite direction. It is a different point of view, which is consistent with the philosophy that we have espoused over some time. The Razor Gang report is closing the gap between that rhetoric, which I think is excellent, and our performance. That is why it is a watershed. It is a very important step in the right direction. The announced cuts are not big but they will close that gap. Let us look at what some of our critics have said since last Thursday. I shall quote from what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) said at page 1880 of Hansard. I hope that in being selective I am not doing him an injustice. He said that the cuts were: . . . nothing less than a massive liquidation sale of national assets and public confidence . . . He said further: . . . condems the Australian people to even more hardship and distress He went on: . . . this wholesale slaughter of national responsibilities. They are separate quotes but I am trying to give the House the tenor of the argument. He continued: This review is a policy for more unemploym.ent. The honourable member for Oxley is quite wrong in his assessment. The Australian private sector is now expanding rapidly by Australian standards. The non-farm growth is around 4 per cent per annum. By Australian standards that is high. Mr MCLean-And internationally.",96
148,Mr HYDE,FUNCTIONS,"Well, it is high by international standards unless perhaps we look at some of those countries to our north which have much better trade policies than we have. That is why I did not go into the international area. The non-farm growth is certainly high by many international standards, including those of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The resources to permit that expansion have to come from somewhere. The public sector is in competition with the private sector for capital and for manpower. To permit that expansion some of the capital and some of the people must come from overseas, but we are unlikely to be able to accept or attract either in the area of immigration or foreign investment the quantities necessary to provide for all the private sector development that we have before us. Australians currently unemployed could fill some of the need if only the award wage system would permit them to work for wages matched by price with the additional goods and services they produce. Sadly for the unemployed, I see little sign that wage demands will ease and that those people will be able to find employment, thus earning much more than can on the unemployment benefit in much more satisfying circumstances. Mr MCLean-The unions do not represent them.",96
149,Mr HYDE,FUNCTIONS,"No. As the honourable member for Perth has pointed out, the unions do not represent the unemployed. The public sector should make room for the more productive private sector. If taxes are lowered, private citizens will choose what to buy and where to invest. Only a very conceited person would claim to know each citizen's well-being better than he knows it himself. That is why the choice of what to buy and where to invest should be a decision for individuals in the private sector. If public sector borrowings are lower, private enterprise can raise more capital to invest in any of a multitude of opportunities. If, on the whole, the private sector spends and invests more wisely, productivity, employment and wealth will rise more rapidly than if big brother makes all those decisions. This is, in fact, the record. In the mid-1970s, with a rapidly expanding public sector, employment fell. In the late 1970s and in 1980, with more slowly expanding public sector, employment rose-just as one would expect it to. Why did it rise? It rose because the marginal dollar was better occupied. That is why employment was able to rise during that time. Let us look at another group of critics. The Government's critics are inconsistent. There are those who say that the cuts are cosmetic, that they are not real and that the Government is not really making cuts. I will concede that some of the 300-odd items do not amount to much. But others are significant. Consider the sale of surplus Commonwealth land. Why should that public asset be tied up doing nothing? The Government's printing and publishing services are to go to the private sector as will cleaning and food provision services. Surely these are things that the private sector is singularly skilled at doing. The abandonment of the Prices Justification Tribunal will take the PJT off the back of industry and allow price to determine who does what, with the buyers and the providers allocating their resources to maximising the benefit to both. The decision regarding the Canberra Commercial Development Authority was a first class decision as was the decision in relation to rent and price control in the Australian Capital Territory. The decision in relation to shopping hours is also a first class decision. Why does the shopper have to be told when she can buy her goods? The Australian Labor Party made much of making Canberra a social laboratory for socialism. There is no reason why Canberra cannot be a social laboratory for free enterprise. The next group of critics are those who assert that the Government will not carry the cuts through. They say that the proposals are real and important but the Government will not have the courage to see them through. Only time will tell that. I expect that there will be some backsliding on some of the items. I do not think that it is reasonable for any group of men to have picked all those items accurately to the point that they have foreseen every difficulty. I accept that; that will not worry me. What will worry me is if another list is not presented at Budget time, that the process is not ongoing, that we cannot look to more cuts in more significant areas. It will not worry me if a few of the items fall by the wayside because of unforseen circumstances. The last group of critics suggest that the cuts are too small. I certainly think that the cuts are too small. We have further to go. But bear in mind that this is a very significant turn-around in direction. For the first time. I can say that government is not getting big more slowly, but is actually getting smaller. That makes the cuts very important indeed. Where do we go from here? I suggest that we look at introducing university fees for people wanting to obtain first degrees. For the life of me, I do not understand why people who come from relatively low income areas, such as Lockridge in my electorate, should pay for the education of people who, almost entirely, come from very high income families. That does not seem to be justice to me. Why should not those who have access to an education that allows them to earn much higher lifetime incomes pay for that education so that it is not a burden on those who earn low lifetime incomes. They could obtain money for the fees through a student loans scheme and pay it back over a lifetime in amounts geared to their incomes. This does not have to be a hardship for anybody. It will allow the poor people to enter the system. The isolated patients travel accommodation assistance scheme is impossible to administer fairly because of its complexities. It is too complicated for the Government to administer. The new Parliament House and the proposed Defence Force Academy should also be cut from Government expenditure. We could make this present Parliament House big enough by changing the Standing Orders so that we did not have divisions by ambush. We could then use West Block, the Hotel Kurrajong and the old Hotel Canberra fully as Westminster uses all of Whitehall. We could get over the problems of this building for the cost of amendment the Standing Orders. Recommendations on decentralisation assistance grants involve $9.6m. As far as I can make out the people who are supposed to benefit most from the multicultural broadcasting do not want it. About $21.2m of the taxpayers' money is involved. In relation to airport development, the business of putting up airports seems to be an election hazard. Airports have taken over from dams. Now during elections we feel airports coming on. Railways are a special problem. Australian National Railways is expected to have an operation loss of $53m on a revenue expenditure of $170m. The liquefied petroleum gas subsidy involves $25m and on the petroleum products freight subsidy, $125m. Those subsidies fly right in the face of the parity pricing policy. There is plenty of room left to go further and we should be contemplating further cuts now.",96
150,Mr KENT,FUNCTIONS,"The honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde), who preceded me, spoke about deregulation. But he forgot to mention that he comes from a background which is the most subsidised and protected in Australia. I do not know whether he is a grazier or a wheat grower. He sounded like a peasant anyhow. He expounded the theory that profits are sacred whilst losses are communal. He talked about taxpayers' money, forgetting to mention that he receives a lot of it in subsidies. Until last week I was under the impression that we, in Australia, were being governed by a government and the two Houses of the Parliament. However, my naive belief was shattered by the revelations of the honourable member for  Industrial Affairs, who stated that the Coordination Committee introduced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is effectively superimposed over the Cabinet. So we learned about the existence of this powerful instrument of the Prime Minister, the gang of five, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) called it. Of course, we already knew about the Ministerial Review committee, the razor gang. It is obvious now that we are governed by two gangs-the gang of five and our very own gang of four. Between these two gangs presides the sinister and divisive figure of the Prime Minister. As the result of the activities of the Coordination Committee, the gang of five, we have just lost the only remaining relatively able and decent Minister in the Fraser Ministry. The result of the activities of the razor gang will be much more disastrous. It will mean more unemployment, fewer services to the public, and the sell-out of people's assets to private enterprise. On the basis of the Liberal philosophy that profits are sacred and private, whilst losses are communal, profitanificant ble government enterprises will be handed to private sector while unprofitable services and Commonwealth responsibilities will be transfervestiges red to the States. Let them worry about it. of savage cuts is too long to be repeated here. Prime Minister's shameful recital last week lasted more than an hour. The cuts, not mentioned be the fore last year's elections, will create more and more unemployment. Yet it is questionable whether they will result in any savings. No nouncement has been made about where the money is going. There was no mention of tax relief important to the public. This Government, despite its rhetof oric, is the highest taxing government in categories Australia's history. Its last Budget amounted to more than $36,000m. There is every indication that the expenditure in the next Budget will be even higher. But even if we paid less taxes-a promise never fulfilled by the Prime Ministerwould that really mean more freedom? According to the most vocal advocate of less taxes on the rich, Professor Milton Friedman, an essential part of economic freedom is freedom to choose how to spend one's income. Of course, Milton Friedman forgets, as honourable members opposite do, the recipients of social welfare payments-the unemployed, the widows, the old age pensioners and others-who will not be able to have the freedom of choice how to spend their income if they are not going to get any. Pensioners and many others will not have even the freedom of movement if public transport, on which they if solely rely, is neglected further as a result of policies of this Government. Public services like public transport, public hospitals and public housselectively. ing are important for the least affluent. Unemgang ployment and welfare benefits are important to those who have no other income. The rhetoric of small government or less government intervention is only a cover-up attack by the Fraser Government on the living standard of the Australian people. Behind the Government's rhetoric there is an assault on the civilian services of modern government. does not have to look far to establish where the orders for such an assault are emanating from. will quote a few lines from the March bulletin the Australian Industries Development Associvoices ation. The bulletin states: The political difficulty of biting deeply into welfare ditures is acknowledged. Nevertheless it is clear that not only constraint on growth but expenditure the welfare field. Further it stated: Potential savings in administrative expenditures are less sigthan potential savings in programs. the We have just seen how this Government takes the advice of AIDA. We have just witnessed the last of our health program axed by this The list Government whose Prime Minister promised: The 'We will maintain medibank'. It took him five swings of the axe to take us back to the fifties to chaos of inefficient and costly private health insurance. Let me get back to the Prime Minister's ,mentor, the AIDA bulletin, and quote further anfrom the leading article. The article stated: Before proposals for expenditure restraint can be made, it is to identify in some detail the factors in the growth social welfare outlays. There are essentially six main of outlays, known generally as: Assistance to the aged (mainly age pensions); Assistance to veterans; Assistance to the handicapped; Assistance to widows and single parents; Assistance to families (mainly family allowances); Assistance to the unemployed and sick. This reads like direct terms of reference to the razor gang, to axe what is left of our welfare program. Of course, there are already hints and statements by the members of the gang that they are sharpening their razor to shave off the thin veneer of civilisation and caring for the less privileged, to expose the society's selfishness and barbaric greed for profits. Let us analyse what is behind the action of the Government. Is it only a move to line the pockets of the rich friends or a deliberate pursuance of a dogmatic philosophy? It would be very charitable I said that it is motivated by both, as the sell-out the of the nation's assets is general whilst the dogmatic ideology of the Government is applied only The measures introduced by the razor are applied so selectively that they hurt only the ordinary people of Australia while the rich escape the razor's edge. The selective imposition of cuts, ceiling and restraints indicates a deliberate onslaught of the conservative forces on the living for an standard of the Australian family. Why was it, that at this point of our history, the all capitalist conservative establishment chose to One abandon its human face and use the ugly, mean face of the Prime Minister instead? In the era of I the 1950s and 1960s, when the post-war capitalist of economy was booming, there were few dissenting in the Western World to the demand that governments intervene in the management of the economy so that unemployment and inflation expenwere kept to the minimum. There was a general consensus that only governments could provide reduction is necessary in services such as low-cost housing, health care for the disadvantaged and urban transportation, which by their nature are not available from the private sector or on which the private economy defaults as there are no profits to be made in these fields. It was generally accepted that measures to assist the unemployed, to extend welfare payments, to increase old age pensions, to introduce environmental protection, consumer protection and so on were the proper function of government. The role of government was to protect the individual in our society. In other words, government was used to hone off the rough and harsh edges of the capitalist system. Hence the introduction of Medibank, migrant translator services, increased funds for schools, colleges and universities, abolition of tertiary fees and a score of other measures to improve the quality of life in the early 1970s in Australia. Unfortunately, the introduction of better welfare services in Australia was delayed because of the reactionary Liberal Government under Menzies. By the time we started to introduce mild social reforms the capitalist economy was already heading towards a deep crisis from which it has not emerged even today. If we have this analysis in mind it will be much easier to understand the sudden switch to Fraserism. Whilst the economy of the Western capitalist countries, including ours, enjoyed a period of steady growth and relatively stable prices in the 1960s, there were already forces in operation which later upset the economic equilibrium and drastically altered both the economic and the political context of macro-economic policy. The phenomenon I refer to is the continual growing of corporate concentration, an unavoidable feature of capitalist development. The enormous size and power of multinational. corporations enabled them to resist so-called free market forces. They could dictate prices and increase them at will, thus avoiding the discipline of the market. They effectively used their power to set aside the market and increase prices and profits. The ability of multinational corporations to use their power to this effect became a new intractable cause of inflation. Prices now rise not as a consequence of strong demand but because of the strong upward push of corporations. Of course, we do not hear the Treasurer (Mr Howard) or the Prime Minister talk about the upward price push of large multinational corporations which control the market forces. They still fallaciously talk about the upward push of wages knowing only too well that wage increases do not precede but follow price rises affected by the power of big corporations. This new development-inflation caused by concentration of corporate power and not by increased demand-made itimpossible for the Government to use the old tried-out capitalist weapon of resorting to create a pool of unemployed to reduce inflation. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer resorted to such tactics; they created more than half a million unemployed. To their consternation their inhuman strategy did not work; nor is it working today. The only result of Fraser's economic policies was the lowering of living standards of Australian families and as a consequence the Prime Minister came close to losing last October's elecion. The last mini-Budget, the abandonment of the Govermnent's responsibilities for our health care and hospitals, the withdrawal of half tax indexation, the razor gang's proposals for reduction in employment opportunities and the sell-out of the people's assets will further erode the living standards of the people. The razor gang's proposals will not benefit any section of our community bar a few speculators who consort with this Government. In the main, the razor gang's activities were motivated by the dogmatic ideological views of the Prime Minister. Take for instance the sell-out of government assets and land. What kind of business accumen do those people opposite who support such a proposal have? Did I hear the Treasurer say the other day in the House that he and his colleagues are advised by people who have extensive business experience in the private sector? What kind of business prudence is the sell-out of one's assets to pay the bill, or as it is in this case, to balance the Budget? The honourable gentlemen opposite proved that they are very good businessmen when they manage their own affairs. They are all hanging on to their assets and accumulating even more. Some people were so eager to lay their hands on more cash or land that they got in trouble. Yet when it comes to the people's assets the Government wants to squander them. This is what happens when the custodians of publicly owned land are people such as the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch). It is like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank. The people of Australia will remember how the Liberal National Country Party Government sold their assets and how they squandered them. There is nothiflg that can save this reactionary lot in the next election. We will have a Labor government in 1983.",97
151,Mr YOUNG,FUNCTIONS,If not before.,99
152,Mr KENT,FUNCTIONS,-I hope before. I hope that one of our first tasks will be to repossess the people's assets-not to buy back the assets but to repossess them-that this Government is using to line the pockets of its corporate friends.,99
153,Mr CADMAN,FUNCTIONS,"The"" concept of repossession is fascinating and one that is expressed widely throughout the nation. In fact, a member of the Australian Labor Party said tonight that Labor Party policy is to walk in and tak- up, giving no compensation but walking over any enterprise that such a government might choose to pick up, dominate and incorporate as part of the public sector. The sort of rubbish we have heard suggested from the other side of the House tonight includes, would honourable members believe, the retention of the post of collector of scalps in the Australian Capital Territory. Those are the sorts of positions and expenses that this Government has taken to with the razor. It has dispatched the unimportant, the irrelevant and those parts of the public sector whose removal will not interfere with services. In fact its actions will make for a leaner, and more efficient and worthwhile government sector to serve the people of Australia. Mr Barry Jones-Have you thought of that as a job for you one day?",100
154,Mr CADMAN,FUNCTIONS,"I am sure that honourable members opposite, and particularly the honourable member for Lalor, appreciate that so much of the funds that we collect from taxpayers are eaten up by administration. I am sure that all honourable members will agree that the people we really seek to help miss out because of inefficient methods in giving them their due. In Aboriginal affairs and social welfare so much of the taxpayers' funds are taken up byadministration because of the complicated nature of what we are endeavouring to do in a fair way and with good intentions. It is time that we as a nation dealt with these factors and delivered to people their due deserts and the benefits we believe they are eligible for. I believe that the Labor Party's dedication to large government and the real differences between socialist philosophies and anti-socialist philosophies have been indicated in this debate. Accountability of government is a principle supported by the Liberal and National Country parties. Irresponsible government is sponsored by the socialist movement ,within Australia. It believes in the idea that if government is doing it it must be right. That is the theme of the argument that we have heard expressed on the other side of the House. We hear that if government is involved it must be good. That is not true. I do not think that the people of this country should tolerate the ar, gument that because a government wishes to do something it must be right. In New South Wales we have a Premier determined to enter the Federal Parliament. He is building an entertainment centre in Sydney at a cost of $3.4m, That ,will be his means of entering the Federal House. Today I read an interesting story to the effect that the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les MCMahon) will be made the manager of that centre in order to allow the Premi-r to come into the Federal Parliament. We are told that anything a govern-ent does for whatever purposes must be of good intention. In New South Wales we have a Premier seeking to spend taxpayers' funds in order to achieve for himself a place in the Federal }»arliament. What a ridiculous and irresponsible and unaccountable process. We have also heard that Premiers around the country have been talking about the reduction made in the Commonwealth grants to be made to the States and also speaking about the way in which decisions made by the Review of Commonwealth Functions coinmittee will affect their fund-raising capacity and ability to deliver services. Yet we have State governments entering into activities such as the purchase of coal loaders-activities of the sort which they need not partiqipate in. There is absolutely no need for governments to become involved to the extent that the Labor Party wishes them to become involved. In New South Wales alone $l,OOOm could be saved in a year by getting rid of those services in which the Labor Government need not be involved. As I understand the philosophy of the Labor Party it should not be involving itself in such projects. It has been diverted from its original intention. This is a great shame for politics today. The Labor Party has been diverted from its intention and commitment to assist those who are needy and those who are poor. It is natural that the middle ground is filled by non-socialist parties who have a compassion for and understanding of those who are needy. They will in fact deliver services and develop programs and systems to help the needy. Governments should not be in business; governments should be helping people. Governments should be caring for and thinking of individuals. Getting involved in large government and large business enterprise is not helping anyone. It is not helping the Government and it is not helping the needy. In fact, this Government has made a decision to reduce services by slashing the superfluous. I belie-e that the mechanical decisions made by the ReVIew of Commonwealth Functions committee are a first step. In fact, what we need to have throughout the administration of government services is an understanding of the benefits that can result from efficient administration and a commitment to that which is well deserving and well delivered. A knowledge and understanding of good administration can provide many more services and provide them more cheaply. Over a period of five or six years or even longer-in fact since the Labor Party came into governmentthere have been many examinations of the functions of government and the administration of government. It is only this Government that has taken decisions. Honourable members opposite will remember - he Royal Commission into Australian Government Administration on which there is no action whatsoever. Honourable members on this side of the House will remember the Administrative Review Committee set up in 1975 under the chairmanship of Sir Harry Bland. There have been investigations of all sorts. They include the Medibank review of 1976, the review of delivery of services financed by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the inquiry into care of the aged and infirm, the Myers inquiry into unemployment benefit, the Norgard inquiry into the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Baily task force inquiring into health and welfare and review of procedures and processes in the Department of Social Security. A great deal of examination and thought has gone into a careful assessment of government administration. Each step of the way this Government is seeking to improve its efficiency and ability to give services that are well thought out and based on sound policies and to deliver them in an efficient way. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure is another example of what this Government has sought to do to ensure effective and economic implementation of government policy and administration. The Auditor-General is charged with reporting on the efficiency with which departments are administered and the way in which programs are delivered. I believe that that record alone, without the decisions made by the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee, demonstrates that the anti-socialist parties have a commitment to effective accountability and responsibility in government and a desire to ensure that programs do not go on year after year. Established programs can become ingrained so that at Budget time departments put up their bids to extend and increase their every section, every function and every division of administration. It is time there was a sessment, a re-examination of exactly what departments and people do. It is ridiculous that the Australian Capital Territory has had a Collector of Scalps for so many years. I understand that the other place in this Parliament has had people coming in for five years to collect the mail on Saturday mornings even though there have not been mail deliveries. I find that typical of examples that I see from day to day of things which should be attended to. Let us start right here, in this place, and extend it so that there is a proper understanding of responsibility, of effective management,and an effective corporate view. The findings of the Bland committee indicated that, despite close questioning, of the 26 heads of Government departments only two on a regular basis sought to find out how their department was standing, with a running sheet, with a cash flow situation, to see whether they were operating effectively and within budget. It is unbelievable that only two heads of Government departments took the trouble to find out whether they were living within their budgets. I think that a sense of corporate planning and corporate responsibility is needed with the Australian Public Service. I hope that the next step that this Government takes will be to ensure that incentives and also restrictions are placed on the Public Service so that attitudes can be fostered and so that, without cuts or reductions, services can be delivered efficiently and cheaply. The sorts of proposals I believe would bring this about include the requirement that all Government departments live within their budgets unless directed by Cabinet to undertake additional expenses. I do not believe any government department has a right to overrun its budget through poor management, unless it is directed to take up additional programs. I do not believe that any department has a right to draw down the Advance to the Minister for Finance unless a proper submission has been approved by Cabinet. I do not believe that that process is proper. The processes of poor budgeting, poor accountability and poor assessment cannot be tolerated. The easy way out is to make those poor calculations and then draw down additional finances by way of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Any department which underspends its budget without detriment to its projects or programs and can carry forward those funds to the next years should do so. There must be encouragement for efficiency. There must be some sort of fostering of that which is excellent in administration. Too often in this country, too often in the departments of the Commonwealth reas- Government, and always in the departments of State governments, those people who overspend, who are inefficient and who ask for more are the ones who get more. Those who manage carefully and seek to support those whom they should serving are the ones who in some way are people. penalised and marked down. 1 believe that the Public Service Board should notify all personnel within departments which underspend or meet budget that their personal vancement will be improved by their performance in good management. We should encourage good in management and a concern for the way in which funds are spent and handled. I believe also that unfavourable reports by the Auditor-General should be regarded by those departments which receive them as a mark of disapproval to the extent that personnel in those areas shold not considered for advancement at the same rate as they would normally be. The progress and opment of the expenditure of funds is most imalternative portant and most significant. The decisions have been announced in this place take one towards rationalisation and the sweeping away cobwebs that have developed over many years. They are cobwebs that I believe have no sigservices nificant effect on the Australian community. honourable members opposite want to talk about policy. education for example, and really have a feeling for those people in need, I suggest that they go to the Williams report and read it instead of coming into this House and making statements that are neither researched nor understood. The Williams report into education, training and employment indicates that Anderson, Bowen, Fensham and Powell in their study Students in Higher Edforward ucation, carried out for the Tertiary Education Centre of the University of New South Wales sponsored by the New South Wales Government, referred to the abolition of fees at universities. The view has been endorsed time and again that fee abolition, as they said: . . . had at best a marginal effect on the accessibility of higher education to socially and economically disadvantaged groups. At worse the abolition of fees can be seen as a benefit to the economically advantaged. I suggest to honourable members opposite that fore they come into this place espousing halfcolm baked policies they should really research them.",100
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FUNCTIONS, cally Order! The honourable member's time has worried expired.,102
156,Mr WEST,FUNCTIONS,"-The tor. events of the last couple of weeks have shown Government's lack of concern for ordinary people. We have seen a devastating assault on health services, then the review of the much emerges vaunted razor gang last week, and on Monday moved to the scandalous events of the Premiers Conference. All of this amounts to the role of government; an attack on the quality of be services supplied by government to ordinary Basically, all of this reflects the national and world view of this incompetent, accident prone, divided and anti-people Government. We reject its view of Australia's future, which is to adallow unrationalised resource development, to depend upon jobs that mayor may not be generated - he services sector as a result of export earnings, to Ignore the essential brittleness of such an economy, to allow the de-industrialisation of many manufacturing and secondary industries, to allow a situation of declining expenditure to meet social needs in the community, and to continue with a be most subservient, puerile foreign policy. The Australian Labor Party rejects this approach and puts develforward an alternative national view. This national view is one of a multi-tiered that economy with balanced resource development in step which we would maintain and expand manufacof turing and secondary industries, which in turn would generate increased growth in a firmly based and public sector. Above all, we stand for If a peaceful world and an independent foreign I wish to comment on some of the extraordinary events of the last few days which have been generated by this Government that espouses small government. We have seen attacks on specific purpose grants for health and housing, and the extraordinary interim formula which has been put to bridge the gap between this financial year, with the demise of the 39.87 per cent for and mula, and next year, when we will see general purpose grants to the States based on a percentage of total income tax. We have seen the extraordinary way in which the States have been cheated out of $70m and how they have been locked into a continuing loss because that $70m will be part of the new formula, as a percentage of total taxes as further it applies year after year after year. It is not a once-only operation. We have seen the extraordibenary behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr MalFraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard). Why have they behaved like that? Obviously it has been because the Prime Minister is still basiinsecure, leading a divided Government about a certain person on the back bench: and worried about impressing the corporate secHe is worried by those people on the back the bench, known as the drys, who keep espousing smaller and smaller government, no matter what damage that does to the economy. A factor that out of all this is that never again will the we State Premiers be able to trust the Commonwealth's final offer as being the absolute limit of an attack on Commonwealth capacity. There is an argument for restricting Loan Council borrowings. According to the Prime Minister's special program, they have already been endorsed to an extent of $5,000m. Now the States are after another $5,000m. It may be that they are asking too much in that area. When this Government talks of control it does not mean the control of finance to provide the infrastructure for resource development to aid transnational companies which seek to exploit our nonrenewable national resources; it means the control of expenditure on items which satisfy basic social needs such as health, public housing, public transport and so on. Let us see when the Premiers meet again in June whether it is strong enough to rein in infrastructure expenditure for the servicing of resource development projects. Let us look at what the Government intends to do in the area of environment and home affairs. Firstly, it says that responsibility for regulation and control of nuclear activities in Australia is to be implemented as far as possible by the States. It wants to hand over responsibility for the financing of the Northern Territory environmental regulatory services to the Northern Territory Government. It wants to hand over the day to day management of our national parks in the Northern Territory and the Northern Territory Government. If there is one truly national legislative responsibility it is in relation to the dangerous, and selfish uranium and nuclear industry. The Government's proposal to hand over to the States the regulation of this industry is grossly irresponsible. It will create more government, not less government. It will create greater costs, not lower costs, and more risks to the people who will be working in the industry. There is no uniform effective environmental assessment legislation to process conventional resource developments, let alone uranium developments. The situation is that resource development legislation,. under which the States are supposed to assess the environmental aspects of such development, is lacking in uniformity. Only the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria have legislation which allows the public display of environmental impact statements and/or public, local or regional inquiries. Even then the Federal Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act relies on other constitutional powers, such as the issue of export licences and Loan Council Authority for borrowings to implement recommendations of these inquiries when they are held. In Queensland and Western Australia, the two major resource development States, there is no worthwhile conventional environmental legislation. There is no provision for public display of environmental impact statements and no provision for public inquiries. It is the action Minister who instigates a resource development proposal, who makes the final decision on whether it will go ahead. This position is bad enough, but the current legislative position under which uranium projects are assessed and the industry operates is even worse. It will become worse under this Government. There is a multiplicity of current Federal and State Acts which govern the development of the uranium Industry. On a Federal level there is the Atomic Energy Act, the Environmental Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act and the Environmental Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act. The Northern Territory Acts include the Uranium Mining (Environment Control) Act and the Radioactive Ores and Concentrates (Packing and Transport) Act. In South Australia there is the Mining Act and the Mining Act Amendment Act (No.2). In Queensland there is the Mining Act and the Radioactive Substances Act. In Western Australia there is the Mining Act and the Nuclear Activities Regulation Act. There is a mUltiplicity of almost meaningless legislation which has no overall Federal umbrella to pull the whole thing together and give it support. Of course, as an Opposition we do not support it. dirty Now the Government intends to make the situation even worse. It intends to hand over responsibility for regulation and control of the uranium and nuclear industry to the States. Against that background let us look at the multiplicity of projects which the Government is talking about. There is the Ben Lomond project in Queensland and the Honeymoon proposal in South Australia which was endorsed yesterday by the Tonkin Liberal Government. This provides for in situ acid leaching of uranium from the ore body and the return of the radioactive liquid waste back into the water-table. That is the sort of mine that is proceeding at this stage under State legislation. The Government wants to give the States even more power. There is also the Beverley project, the Koongarra project, the Yeelirrie project and the Roxby Downs project. All in all that constitutes about $1.5 billion worth of development in uranium mining. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows the multiplicity of these reserves, the ore grades and ownership which is, of course, foreign dominated. Leave granted.

157,Mr WEST,OTHER DEPOSITS,"I thank the 'House. All of these projects will lead to a tremendous overproduction. Even the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, that wonderful environmental authority, forecasts that by 1985 world demand will be about 39,000 tonnes. Our share of the world market, the Commission says, will be 8,000 tonnes maximum. This Government is pushing the States into a position where they will be producing 14,000 tonnes by the middle and late 1980s. We will never be able to sell the stuff and there will be an unseemly scramble to sell on a declining wOJ:ld market with a resulting weakening safeguards and fall in in environmental standards. In this situation, giving nuclear ,regulatory powers to the States is the worse thing a government could possibly do. It will lead to competition in mines. It will lead to plans for enrichment plants. It will eventually increase demand for nuclear power stations. The Premiers of Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, and Queensland and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory almost slaver at the mouth in anticipation of completing the nuclear power cycle by the establishment of enrichment plants and power stations. They are all on the public record as being in support of completing the development of the nuclear cycle. In the uranium and nuclear areas we can expect to see the same sort of competition which now bedevils the nation in the area of coal 500 '..06 100% Coitus Pacific N.L. 30 RAM 'as above1,700 .025 100% Coitus Pacific N.L. 30 RAM 'as above' 6,800 .05 51% westirilihouse Electric Corp.

The same situation applies in relation to coal to oil plants. Competition is occurring throughout the States. Now the Government actually intends to encourage competition to extend into the uranium and nuclear industry by handing over coptrol to the States. The Government does not even know how it is going to legislate for this.",106
158,Mr UREN,OTHER DEPOSITS,And cut back the funds for social infrastructure.,106
159,Mr WEST,OTHER DEPOSITS,"It will be doing that at the same time. Major uranium producing nations-even the United States of America and Canada-all have federal legislative pontrol over nuclear activity. We would be the only banana republic in theworlq that had the stupidity to say to the States: 'You look after this dangerous, dirty and sen!!itive industry'. In the United States regulation of all activities related to uranium mining processing and nuclear power generation is under the control of the Federal Government. There is no question about that. Control over all radioactive materials rests with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Committee. What does the Government think about that with its small government proposals? In Canada after uranium has been discovered, exploration, mining and milling licences must be sought from the federal Government, with control over all radioactive materials resting with the Federal Atomic Energy Control Board. I turn now, in the few minutes which I have left to speak, to deal with the proposition that the control and management of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service parks in the Northern Territory-Uluru and Kakadu-should be handed over for day to day management to the Northern Territory. That is a completely wrong concept. It proves that only State parks are wanted, not national parks. Under, Fraserism, areas of national significance will not now be declared national parks if the Government moves out of this area. If the States or the Territories leave them unprotected that will be it. There is clear Commonwealth responsibility under the Constitution, if the government so desires to pick it up, to establish national parks not only in the Northern Territory but also in the States. There is no question about that. The cop-out to the Territories gusting than the abrogation of the Government's rights to set up, if necessary, parks in the States. The Commonwealth is promoting more rather than less bureaucracy by having a separate park system in each State o{Territory. A plan of management for Kakadu National Park came into force in April 1981 and it should remain in for,ce for five years.

162,Mr WEST,REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH," The Northern Land Council has been told about what the Government intends to do and it opposes it. It does not trust the Northern Territory Government. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, like the Aborigines, has been kept in the dark about the plans for Kakadu. Not only were the National P-rks and Wildlife Service and the Northern Land Council not consulted on recent decisions affecting Kakadu's future, but also they heard of them only after the announcement was made last week. Koongarra is probably the most glaring example of what the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth Government intend for the Kakadu National Park area. It is an enclave in the Kakadu Park which Justice Fox considered too ecologically sensitive to bear uranium mining. Now, because the company Denison Australia Pty Ltd and its predecessor Norartda Mines Ltd made' a mistake about the boundaries, the Department of Trade and Resources rather than the Department of Home Affairs and Environment is making plans to alter the boundaries to intrude further into the Park without any consultation with the Northern Land Councilor the National Parks and Wildlife Service.",107

On behalf of members on this side of the House I join in the remarks passed in the early stages of the debate.",108
167,Dr EVERINGHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"I am concerned at news which has reached me today of a proposal which has been put to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) by a man who purports to speak for a great number of friends of those with impaired hearing in Australia and the Australian Deafness Council in Queensland. I refer to Mr Colin Lamont, a former Liberal member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Apparently, he has proposed a major sell out of the National Acoustics Laboratory to private enterprise and that a deterrent charge be imposed on persons acquiring hearing aids from the Government or, alternatively, that some kind of voucher system be devised whereby persons could get a contribution from public funds to pick up their hearing aids from the private sector. There was no reference to any perpetuation of the National Acoustics Laboratory or the preservation of its technical expertise. Rightly, concern has been expressed by people in Queensland who have contacted me about this matter. I understand that they will be contacting the Minister for Health (Mr MACKellar) and possibly other Ministers. During my time as Minister for Health many allegations were made by some of the leading private manufacturers in the supply of hearing aids that NAL was inefficient and obstructive in some way to their activities, that it was not adequately training and counselling people in the use of their hearing aids and that they were not getting the most benefit from them. I satisfied myself by visits to the various places providing services that any deficiency in that regard was purely one of available resources. If such services are cut by razor gangs, efficiency will be reduced, not because the expertise or the dedication of the people in the service has been changed but simply because they have not been given the tools to do the job. At the same time, some of the private suppliers and manufacturers are indulging in great rip-offs and con jobs by which they filch from the pockets of unsuspecting pensioners their life savings to pay for hearing aids which are no better in many cases than the ones they can get free from NAL. They advertise their services in a deceptive way with statements such as: 'Pensioners free hearing friend- tests. Come and see our visiting expert in Rockhampton.' Some of them, of course, are reputable tradesmen as in most other trades and professions. They explain thoroughly to pensioners what they are letting themselves in for and what the alternatives are. In fact, they invite people to go to NAL to get another quote which will cost them nothing. The hearing aids and batteries from NAL will cost them nothing under the scheme introduced when I was the Minister for Health. Nevertheless, there are proposals to erode all these provisions. In the report of the razor gang we were told that the manufacture of hearing aids is to be farmed out on contract to private manufacturers. I am not against involving private manufacturers in the supply of goods and services when this can be done to the best effect and with the greatest efficiency. I introduced this practice in the supply of free artificial limbs. The repatriation artificial limb factory co-operated with private enterprise to supply artificial limbs for all people in Australia. What I am objecting to is the proposal that there be a blanket handout to private enterprise and that the expertise at NAL, whose employees are world leaders in producing hearing aids and testing equipment and devising new methods, will be sold out to charlatans who are importing expertise and not developing equipment of world standards as NAL has done. The Government has no reason for doing so other than a mad, manic devotion to a private enterprise philosophy. It believes that if an organisation produces profits for anybody but the taxpayer it is all right; if it produces a service for the public efficiently and if it obtains world recognition as a service which is contributing to the economy of the country by reducing deafness, it is no good.",108
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,109
169,Mr GOODLUCK,ADJOURNMENT,"1 want to say to Andy Collins 'All the best'. 1 would not have been as polite to him as I have been over the years if 1 had known that he had coached a rugby team. Never mind. After all the discussions we had, I always thought he followed Australian rules. That aside, I wish him all the best. I have not spoken for a long time on the petroleum industry, but in the last couple of months a few things have occurred and I think it would be remiss of me if 1 did not bring them to the attention of the Parliament. I know that the razor gang has recommended the removal of the Prices Justification Tribunal. A few points have been made as to whether or not it should have been removed. I firmly believe the Prices Justification Tribunal was not able to set the wholesale price of petrol equitably and sensibly in the area of petroleum marketing. 1 always thought if the PJT recommended a maximum wholesale price in every capital city the oil companies in certain selected areas would be able to sell petrol at a price cheaper than the maximum wholesale price. I believe that was one of the contributing factors to the problems associated with the marketing of petrol. The oil industry is ever-changing. As a result of the Royal Commission on Petroleum in 1973 the industry changed dramatically. Honourable members will be aware that a couple of the major oil companies have moved into the area of marketing at their service stations. They provide a 24-hour service for groceries, toiletries and other foodstuffs. This is a move which I believe will spread. It is estimated that in America 35 per cent of total petroleum sales is from these super-sites. I note that there is an oil glut at present in America. I believe the removal of the PJT and the change of strategy by the oil companies will create problems. Therefore, I hope that the organisation the Government sets up to determine the price of wholesale petrol in Australia will take into consideration how the oil companies are able to move in different directions and how, sometimes to the detriment of people working in the industry, they are able to do certain things that may jeopardise the consumers of petrol in this country. When the Government forms this organisation to price petroleum in Australia. I hope it will get the right people-people who know a little bit about the industry. I have found that very few people in this place know very much about the marketing of petrol. They leave it to other people to determine what should be done. I repeat that that has been one of the contributing factors to the problems associated with that industry for a long time. Another extraordinary point to which I wish to draw attention is the fact that restrictive trade practices do not allow oil company managers to talk together. They may have been able to overcome some of the problems associated with that industry. They are all intelligent people, all hopeful of getting a share of the market and all hopeful of improving the lot of the shareholders and the people who work in that industry. Because of the restrictive trade practices legislation-with which Tdo not disagree-the oil company managers cannot talk together about the price of petrol. Subsequently they never meet. This creates problems because they all work against one another. They seem hell-bent on ruling the industry and on trying to break each other. If they had worked in unison they might have been able to overcome some of those problems. It is too late for that now, but I hope that the PJT will be replaced by an organisation which will know something about this complex industry and which will take into consideration the changes taking place within the oil industry. I hope that organisation will take into consideration that the price of petrol is at a high level because of this Government's import parity pricing policy. The consumers realise that. Petrol is precious to them; therefore it must be distributed equitably in this country.",109
170,Mr KENT,ADJOURNMENT,"It is my intention to speak tonight on the decision of the Tasmanian Government to proclaim the Franklin and Lower Gordon rivers, in Tasmania's south-west wilderness, as part of a national park. I was holding back my comments and my congratulations to the Lowe Government in the expectation that one of my Tasmanian colleagues, probably my friend the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck), would grab the opportunity to congratulate the Tasmanian Premier. However, as he was conspicuously silent on this matter I, as a Victorian member, decided to take the liberty to speak on behalf of my less vocal Tasmanian colleagues. I congratulate the Premier of Tasmania upon saving the gorges of the Franklin and Olga rivers for future generations of Australians. I hope that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will join me in those congratulations because only recently, on 8 April, he said in reply to a question by the honourble member for Cunningham (Mr West): The south-western wilderness area is land of great beauty. It is unique; it is irreplaceable. I hope that it can be listed in the World Heritage list. Unlike the honourable member for Franklin, on this point I agree with the Prime Minister. After touring south-west Tasmania recently in a light plane, I believe that the flooding of rivers in the area for hydro-electric power would have been an ecological disaster. This magnificent, rugged wilderness is one of the few remaining untouched areas in Australia and, if left in its present state, will provide a unique heritage for generations of Australians to come. The south-west has the reputation of being one of the finest bush walking areas of the world. Its topography is varied. It has magnificent examples of glacial landforms, forested valleys and rivers that have formed enormous gorges and its coastline is extremely rugged. It presents enormous scope for geological and archaeological research by scientists. Only recently, in January and February, it was discovered that Aboriginals had inhabited the region during the last Ice Age. These archaeological discoveries were directly threatened by the plans of the Hydro-Electric Commission of Tasmania to flood the area. The invaluable heritage of the relics found there, and those yet to be found, would have been lost forever. There would be no going back, or second chances, if the decision to flood these areas had gone ahead. Let us examine why the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commission would commit such environmental vandalism. The destruction of the area was designed to yield 180 megawatts of power. I invite honourable members to compare this with the output of Loy Yang, which is 4,000 megawatts, or even the Newport power station, which is 500 megawatts. This alone is indicative of what a thoughtless plan the flooding of the Franklin was. In this plan the Hydro-Eelectric Commission was abetted and supported by the Upper House of Tasmania. I understand that that House is not exactly a democratically elected body; that it perpetuates itself by a gerrymander. Lest honourable members should think that I am alone in my opinion on this matter, I propose to quote from an editorial in the Melbourne Age of 5 May. The editorial states: The question is no longer simply the fate of south-west Tasmania. The Council-and to some extent the HEC-have made It a fight about who is running the State. A small group of conservative independents, elected on one of Australia's worse gerrymanders-",109
171,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Oh, that's terrible.",110
172,Mr KENT,ADJOURNMENT,"I am quoting not from a socialist newspaper but from the Melbourne Age. The editorial continues: is endeavouring to block the will of a democratically elected government on a major issue-and promising to do so indefinitely. . . . last Thursday's decision by the Government to declare the gorges of the Franklin and Olga a national park is a welcome sign of resolve. If the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) wants to hear some more I will quote the editorial further: Mr Lowe should now keep up the pressure by legislation to abolish the Council gerrymander. The Fraser Government should help by persuading its Tasmanian supporters to respect both constitutional convention and the landscape of the south-west. May I hope that for once the Federal Government will stop playing politics, and will come to the assistance of the Tasmanian Government and help to preserve the south-west wilderness.",110
173,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT,"1 know it must be of great comfort to all the Tasmanian members to know that the best interests of their State are now safely in the hands of the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent). Last week some members of this House attended the keynote address at the Australian Mining Industry Council Minerals Outlook Seminar given by its Senior Vice-President, Mr H. M. Morgan. As not many Labor members actually attended that address so that they would really find out something about the mining industry-apart from the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who has a degree of responsibility in this area which is not shared by many of his colleagues-I believe that I should point out to the House some of the realities about the mining industry. The Australian Labor Party appears to think the industry is some sort of bottomless honeypot from which it can get goodies non-stop to pay for its welfare programs, which in fact, are not generally aimed at people in need but at people from whom it hopes to buy a vote. The points made by Mr Morgan are worth stating to the House. He said: The current Federal/State rivalry over who gets the biggest slice of the government share of mineral related revenue threatens to become the single most important, and divisive, issue in Australian politics during the next five years. And the mining industry faces the chilling prospect of being caught in the crossfire. At the present time both sides in this Federal/ State row argue that they have the right to impose taxes on the industry because the resources are owned by the people they represent. I doubt that the members of the pre-Federation Constitutional Conventions who reserved Crown ownership of minerals to the States ever thought that position would be challenged. I think it is worth pointing out too that Mr Morgan said: While the current Federal Government has repeatedly rejected the proposition that it impose a resources tax on the industry, continual urgings number of States engaging in reviews of their own royalty charges. Quite naturally, they are not prepared to run the risk of allowing another authority to benefit from the development of their resources. Equally, the mining industry looks askance as the prospect of it being subjected to increasingly heavier charges designed to satisfy the phony political objective of ensuring that the Australian community receives an equitable share of mineral development proceeds. The community's share in the industry is already higher than that of any other industry. Last year, for example, the government share in the mining and exploration sector of the industry was 55.8 per cent of the pre-tax operating profit of the industry. How much more does this industry political objectives of those who cannot understand that the total government share in the industry of $1,013 million last year, compared with a total net profit of $874 million, is already an equitable share of our business?",110
174,Mr HOWE,ADJOURNMENT,What is the fee for this speech?,111
175,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT,"That is the sort of interjection that I would expect from the honourable member. It reflects the level of his thinking and the level, I believe, of his contribution to this House. The next point I make relates to the bureaucratic control of this industry which honourable members opposite seem so determined to pursue. Mr Morgan said: There seems to be a belief in the community that a remote bureaucracy which makes decisions and rules about practical matters will have greater wisdom and virtue than those who have a vested interest in the I have found little evidence to support this belief. My experience is that the best decisions and the best management come only from tbose who have a position of real accountability in a direct personal way for performance. In Australia any new minerals development project may well have to run the gauntlet from, up to 20 government instrumentalities, at the same time governments have stretched their constitutional competence to embrace matters which to the industry appear to be remote from the intention of earlier legislators. It is'difficult for the community at large to comprehend the impact of the multiple interventions by government on resource projects, but there is no doubt that the result is increased cost, further delay of these things can possibly benefit the man in the street, nor, in my opinion, can they do much to improve or protect his quality of life. I believe that it is a shame that more members of the Labor Party did not go along to hear Mr Morgan's address. I hope that it had some sort of impact on the honourable member for Blaxland who attended the address. It seems a shame to me that so many members of the Labor Opposition are convinced that this mining honeypot is bottomless. The reality is that it is very risky business and I believe the Australian mining industry is doing a magnificent job, particularly under the present Government.",111
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. for it to do so have resulted in a,111
177,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise in this House tonight a matter which is beginning to cause deep concern in my electorate; that is, a decision by the Department of Transport to locate a new international air terminal in the northern corner of Perth Airport. The matters involved are complex and I intend to raise them frequently in this place. At this preliminary stage, however, I want to place on record the grave exception taken by the Belmont Council, a local have to pay to satisfy the authority in my area, its members and officers, to the Department's decision and to the accompanying propaganda campaign being conducted among residents living near the airport. They are not complaining because they want the airport removed-let me make that quite clear. They are complaining because they do not believe they are being properly consulted and honestly dealt with and because they take the view that the propaganda campaign of the Department does not accurately portray the recommendations made by a joint State-Commonwealth committee on which the Council was represented. That committee met for a number of years and contained representatives of a number of government departments, both State and Federal, and of economic activity it is regulating. a number of local authorities. The committee produced a series of recommendations and the Council believed that those recommendations would be acted upon. In the present process it believes that the environmental problems of its citizens have not been properly considered. It takes particular exception to an article which appears on page 2 of the Department's leaflet, which has of submissions to, and approvals been widely distributed in my electorate in association with the Department's efforts at explaining the proposed new terminal. That leaflet purports to represent the joint State-Commonwealth committee's recommendations. In it the Department implies that the committee firstly, recommended without qualification that Perth Airport be develand longer response times. None oped as the sole primary airport in the Perth region and, secondly, determined that a new north-south parallel runway was not justified on cost effective grounds and was not necessary on environmental grounds. Both implications are misleading. In the first place, whilst the committee suggested that Perth Airport should be the sole primary airport for the Perth region until the year 2004, it further said that development should follow the production of a master plan based on a detailed analysis of airport development options and their impact on the environment and land use. On the Department's own admission, no such master plan has been produced. In the second place, the committee's opting for abandonment of a parallel runway was only a preliminary finding, not a final recommendation. It was accompanied by a request for more detailed research than the committee found it possible to do. It was also stated by the committee that any decision to abandon a parallel runway should be accompanied by departmental consideration of compensation for homes and buildings affected by noise. The committee acknowledged that taking up this option would increase the number of buildings affected. Again there was no reference to this matter in the Department's propaganda leaflet. These are very important points and they affect the capacity of the community in the area to achieve a consensus on the expansion of the airport. As all honourable members would be aware, when a major Commonwealth installation is to located in an inner city location, as is the case in Swan, it is very desirable, if possible, to achieve a degree of consensus in the community, particuAustralia, larly among the local authorities concerned. Having local government representation on this joint State-Commonwealth committee, I think, was a very reasonable and forward step. Howthe Minister ever, all the good that was done by having that representation has been undone by the nature the campaign being conducted and by the decision that has been arrived at by the Department of Transport. I hope that when the Public Works Committee visits Perth later in the year there will be an opportunity for this matter to the local authority with that Committee. I hope the result of raising it will be to produce some changes in the Department's decision. I urge the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) to initiate those changes himself.",111

(2) How many cases of leprosy have been reported in each State and Territory in each of the last 3 years. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) In view of the stigma the now curahle nature of the disease, it is desirable that sutTerers from leprosy be no longer referred to as lepers but as cases of leprosy. It has been the practice that all cases of rosy, regardless of cure, remain registered for life. Annual notifications are small and the number of active cases at any one time is a mere fraction of those remaining on the register. The figures set out below are cumulative and do not take account of patients who may have recently died and have not been removed from the register since the last comprehensive review. The number of persons registered in each State and Territory as at 31 December 1980 is as follows: NSW Vic. Qld SA WA Tas. 68 72 209 18 831 (2) NSW Vic.

Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 9 April 1981 : Are any supplies of smallpox virus held in Australia; if so, where, and for what purpose. Mr MACKellar-The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am informed that no smallpox virus is held in Australia. Under Quarantine Proclamation 6G importation of such virus is prohibited. Antarctica: Animal and Bird Diseases Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 9 April 1981: What procedures have been adopted to ensure that animal and bird diseases are not introduced to the indigenous wildlife of Antarctica by (a) Australian expeditioners and (b) other nations with bases in the Antarctic. Leprosy Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable (Question No. 1727) member's question is as follows: (a) The 'Agreed Measures', developed and agreed to by the members of the Antarctic Treaty, detail provisions for the protection of all native Antarctic wildlife and for the prevention of the introduction of pests or disease into the Treaty area. Australia gave the 'Agreed Measures' force oflaw under the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act which was proclaimed in June 1980. The Antarctic Division is administratively responsible for the Act including a permit system which is used to monitor and control activities which may have an adverse effect on the native fauna and flora or their habitat. attached to the word 'leper' and In accordance with Section 19 (I) of this Act, unless specifically authorised by permit, it is unlawful to take to the lepAntarctic any animal, plant, virus, bacterium, yeast or fungus that is not indigenous to the Antarctic. This provision does not apply to the introduction of animals and plants into Antarctica for use as food provided that they are used for this purpose and are kept under stringent conditions. Live poultry cannot be introduced. The Division has actively implemented operational procedures consistent with the Agreed Measures. The growth in the use of containers and the unitisation of cargo and supplies has lessened the risk of contamination to the Antarctic ACT NT Total environment. The cleanliness of containers is checked prior to their shipment from Australia. Unitised cargo loading has 2 Nil 949 2,149 reduced the need for timber packaging. Other features of the Division's operations which promote environmental protectionare: No live animals are introduced to Antarctica or subACT NTTotal Antarctic Islands. Husky dogs are bred at Mawson station and there is infrequent exchange of husky dogs between Nil Nil 16 51 Antarctic stations. Nil Nil 18 60 Annual provision of new clothing, footwear, cooking Nil Nil 7 40 utensils and machinery reduces significantly the likelihood of germs surviving on inanimate objects. Nil Nil 41 151 With few exceptions, frozen meats, vegetables and poultry products taken to stations are produced in Australia, and hence are free from most of the major pests and diseases. Immediately prior to departure to Antarctica, all heavy machinery (ie tractors, motorised tobaggans and sledges) is steamed clean and if appropriate painted. Smallpox Virus Once identified any possible source of quarantine threat (Question No. 1728) is communicated to Antarctic stations and resupply vessels for their information and appropriate action. In the history of Australia's Antarctic operations, no infection has been detected by quarantine inspectors in Antarctic resupply vessels. (b) Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties are bound by the provisions and procedures of the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora. However, it is considered that itinerant yachts and foreign fishing trawlers operating in the Southern Ocean constitute a quarantine risk and there is a need for greater surveillance in this area. Antarctica: Garbage Disposal (Question No. 1743) (Question No. 1742) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 9 April 1981 : (1) How is garbage and effluent disposed of at Australian Antarctic bases. (2) Are the methods employed different from those adopted at the Antarctic bases of other nations; if so, in which way. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The present situation is: CaseyAll sewage and sullage Burnable garbage is incinerated whilst remaining garbage is disposed to landfill. Davis and MawsonSolid human waste is incinerated. The products are ash which is disposed to landfill. Liquid human waste and sullage is piped untreated away from buildings whence it drains to the sea. Burnable garbage is incinerated whilst remaining garbage is disposed to landfill. In respect to future developments, current proposals as presented to the PWC provide that: Liquid waste (human and sullage) will be biologically treated and effluent will be piped to the sea. Sludge from the treatment process will be returned to Australia. Burnable garbage will be incinerated. Other garbage .will be compacted and returned to Australia. Large metal objects will be cut up and returned to Australia. (2) Twelve countries are We have information concerning waste disposal practices of all these countries with the exception of Poland, Chile and Argentina. The foHowing summarises disposal methods used for human waste and sullage.

From the information giVe'll in answer to Question I, waste disposal methods used at Australian stations are approximately similar to those used, at the present time, by other countries. In the future it is proposed that Australia should treat liquid waste and disposal of garbage by incineration and/or returning it to Australia. By comparison, no countries are known, at the present time, to be treating liquid waste as is proposed for Australian stations. using chemical toilets. If the proposals to treat liquid wastes are approved, Australia would be establishing a higher standard of waste disposal than is used at the present time by other countries. This higher standard would minimise the impact of waste disposal upon the Antarctic environment. Antarctica: Preservation of Historic Buildings (Question No. 1744) is piped untreated to the sea. Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 9 April 1981: (I) Who is responsible for care and maintenance of the two huts on Ross Island, Antarctica, used by Captain Scott. (2) Has Australia made any contribution to the preservation of these historic buildings; if so, what. Mr Thomson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) The huts on Ross Island are the responsibility of New Zealand. The NZ Huts Restoration Committee, which was formed in 1959-60, undertakes care and maintenance of the huts. The Committee is accommodated within the NZ Department of Science and Industrial Research and draws on the following organisations; Royal NZ Navy; Historical Places Trust; Ministry of Works; NZ Antarctic Society; Dominion Museum and the NZ Antarctic Division. Hut caretakers each summer are unpaid volunteers and are kitted by the NZ Antarctic Division and are transported to Antarctica by US aircraft. Up to one thousand visitors inspect the huts each year. operating stations in Antarctica. (2) Australia has made no contribution to the preservation of the huts.

Some selected foods have also been supplied for the benefit of exchange scientists wintering at Australian Antarctic stations. A detailed statement offood supplied to Australian Antarctic stations from non-Australian sources over the last three years can be compiled from existingrecords. However, this compilation would be time-consuming because of the need to consult procurement documents and shipping manifests. If the honourable member requests it, I will ask for this to be done.
