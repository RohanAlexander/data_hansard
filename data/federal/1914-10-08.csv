1,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Denison) [3.31]. - I move That the honourable member for Kennedy. Mr Charles MCDonald, clo take the chair of the House as Speaker. I have great pleasure in making this, motion, because it was my privilege to sit under the honourable member for Kennedy during a period of three years, when, by reason of the impartiality which he showed to every member, he gave the fullest satisfaction to all parties. But the honourable member is so well known, not only to his fellow members, but also throughout the length and breadth of Australia, that I shall not occupy time in eulogizing him further.  [3.33] - I second the motion moved by the honourable member for Denison, and undoubtedly express the opinion of honourable members on both sides when I add that in the honourable member for Kennedy we shall bave as Speaker a man who will give even-handed justice to all parties. Colonel RYRIE (North Sydney [3.35]. - T move That the lionorable member for Lang, Mr. William Elliot Johnson, do take the chair of the House as Speaker. I make no apology for this motion.

It is well known to all honourable members that during the last Parliament the honourable member for Lang had an arduous and exacting time as Speaker, and it will be acknowledged by all fair minded men that he discharged the duties of his difficult position with impartiality, ability, and distinction.

9,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member have leave to move a motion? Leave granted.,8
10,Mr FISHER,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"Since the dissolution of the last Parliament a distinguished member of that Parliament, the Honourable Senator Gregor MCGregor, has passed away. He had been a member of the Commonwealth Parliament since its inception. He ably fulfille d all the duties imposed upon him as a representative of the people ought to f u l f i and we would be wanting in courtesy to his memory and his bereaved widow and relatives if we did not place on record in this Chamber, as well as in the Senate, where he served the country uo well, the esteem in which we held him. I shall be glad to have the co-operation of the Leader of the Opposition in submitting this motion. Nothing that 1 can say would be a sufficient tribute to the memory of our deceased colleague. He was a firm friend; he was a stout and valiant advocate of the principles in which he believed, but he never dealt an unworthy blow; he was always genuine, genial, and honourable in all his actions towards his colleagues, and towards his opponents. We would go a long way before finding any like bim. His death was to me a personal loss. I am sure that I speak for every honourable member when I say that we regret his demise. I can only hope that his widow and relatives may be consoled in this time of trial and difficulties by the recollection that the late Senator Gregor MCGregor was a citizen of the Commonwealth, his adopted country, who performed high services for ' those whom he represented, and for the whole of the people of Australia. I trust that by adopting this motion that I am about to move we shall place on record our appreciation of the great services that the late senator rendered to the Commonwealth Parliament, and to the people of this country. moveTliat this House places upon record its high appreciation of the great public services of the late Honourable Senator Gregor MCGregor, and tenders its sincere sympathy to the bereaved widow and relatives of an eminent citizen, whose decease is a great loss to the Commonwealth.",9
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"Parramatta) [ 7 . 4 8 ] - I sadly but very willingl y second the motion submitted by the Prime Minister. Although not a member of this Chamber, the late Senator MCGregor was nevertheless a member ol one of the important parties of this Parliament. I recognise, with the Prime Minister, that the personality of Senafcor MCGregor was a most remarkable one in many ways. Without adventitious aids of any kind he secured for himself a commanding position in the Commonwealth, and did every duty which fell to his lot l them, - and they were many and various and important--in sucb a way as to commend him to all sides of Parliament. In paying a tribute to a fallen colleague there are no such things as parties. We all join in mourning the loss of one who, in his day and generation, served his party, and, through his party, according to the best of his lights, his'country. I believe that in everything he did he was actuated by the sole desire to further the good of his fellow men and the advancement of this great country, which we all have so much at heart. I echo the sentiments of the Prime Minister, and greatly regret that it so frequently falls fco our lot to mourn for colleagues who have fallen by the way.

ELLIOT JOHNSON - Can the Minister of Home Affairs tell me whether the date for closing the competitive designs for the Commonwealth Parliament House at Canberra bas been indefinitely postponed?,9
14,Mr ARCHIBALD,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"I may inform the honourable member that the date for closing the competition in designs has been postponed on several grounds, principally because the war would prohibit competition among architects throughout the Continent of Europe, and confine the competition entirely fco American and Australian professional men. Many connected ""with the architectural profession are now on active service and bearing arms. One of the judges also is a distinguished Austrian. I have, therefore, decided that the matter sbould be postponed and revived on a future occasion. PRIVATEMEMBERS ' BUSINESS. '",9

16,Mr BOYD,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,That was not the policy you had last year.,10
17,Mr FISHER,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"I do not see that there is sufficient ground for departing from the usual practice of this Parliarelative ment. As there will be ample time to carry out all Government business, and the same time afford to private members the opportunity to discuss matters they wish to bring forward, the Government ally? propose to allot a portion of the time this session to private members. think any Parliament has suffered by adopting this practice.

At Phillips Pond a useful supply of water has been found, apart from the boring. I am informed by the Engineer that the water supply is a matter of some gravity, but that the Department is making every effort to discover water along the track and to utilize to the full any supply that can be obtained.

If will he endeavour to arrange with the and Governor of the bank that the same interest shall be charged to small settlers as may is charged to big corporations?",11
37,Mr FISHER,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,"I do not propose to make any investigation into the conduct conof the Commonwealth Bank. When all other financial institutions turned down the Cloncurry copper works, and 900 were thrown out of employment, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank at financed the works, and enabled operations to be continued.

56,Mr SPEAKER,PICTURES OF PROMINENT,"I have to inform the House that I attended this afternoon in the Senate chamber, where His Excellency the Governor General was pleased to deliver his opening Speech, of which, for greater accuracy, I have obtained a copy; but following the usual procedure, unless honourable members desire it , I do not propose to read it . (For text of Speech, vide page 7.) Motion (by Mr FTSHEH) agreed toThat a Committee, consisting of Mr Jolley,"" Mr Lynch, and Mr Hughes, be appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to the Speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General to both Houses of the Parliament. Ordered That, the Committee do report this day. The members of the Committee retired, and having re-entered the chamber, Mr JOLLEY presented the proposed Address-in-Reply, which was read by the Clerk as follows: MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY : We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.",14
57,Mr JOLLEY,PICTURES OF PROMINENT,"Grampians) [8.23] - I move That the Address be agreed to by the House. The Governor General's Speech to honourable members today contained, as one living in a British community would expect, first of all, a reference to the calamitous war which is at present devastating Europe. There came one day, from what was apparently a clear sky, % tremendous bolt, which has not only plunged into deadly warfare two nations that were formerly friendly to each other, but has involved in deadly strife practically the whole continent of Europe. The unbridled arrogance and tyranny of one European monarch, anxious to try his pet army, led him, without considering the lives' of his own people, or their material welfare, and without regard for the well-being of the world at large, to' involve practically the whole of Europe in dreadful warfare. Our own great Empire became involved in that war, not because of any desire for material gain; not because she felt that her material interests were likely to be but in response to a far stronger call. The call which Great Britain answered was the call of honour, than which none could be more potent. We feel, and I say "" w e "" as a humble unit of the great British Empire, that B r i tain would not be the Britain that she has taught the whole world to believe she is if she had failed to respond to that call when she saw the neutrality of her Allies outraged, and an arrogant nation attempting to ride roughshod over the whole of Europe. Her response was immediate, and I say unhesitatingly that she has never engaged in a morejust war. There have been many wars in our history-mos t of them glorious, most of them entered upon in a righteous cause. There may be some might be described as "" splendid mistakes ' ' ; but in respect of the present war there is no room for doubt, no room for hesitancy, aud there is no reason why the whole Empire should not have responded as it has done to the call of the Mother Land. Canada has responded, not only with men, but with munitions of war and general war material. Distant South A f r i c a , not so long ago herself involved in fierce conflict with the great Britisli Empire, was so strongly permeated with the spirit of freedom, so imbued with a sense of the freedom she enjoys under British rule, that she was one of the first of the Dominions to throw in her lot with the Mother Country. We know of the response made by our own great Commonwealth. Honourable members need not be reminded of the facts, for they are patent to all of us. We know, too, how in unhappy Ireland, even up to the last day distracted and divided, two warring factions, apt to break into terrible strife at almost any moment, at the first hint of external aggression fell into line, and formed, instead of a menace to the Empire, one of its stoutest bulwarks. We in this Commonwealth are, fortunately, able to view with confidence the great war cloud. There are two or three considerations in connection with the war, and not the least important is that of financial stability. We are fortunate, inasmuch as a previous Labour Government-and this is one great tribute to the Labour party-ha d placed us in a position with regard to our financial institutions, which enables us to well withstand the strain. The Commonwealth Bank and the Australian note-issue, reviled, and unjustly reviled, as they have been, by press, politicians and platform orators, are today a very present help in time of trouble. I have no hesitation in saying that without them, if the war continued much longer-and we have no reason to say thai; the end of it is even yet dimly visible-ther e would be the gravest danger of almost every proprietary financial institution in Australia closing its doors. That disaster we have now no cause to fear. Behind the Commonwealth Bank, abused, as it has been and is,, and abused, as I can already foresee, it is still likely to be, we have the whole credit of Australia, and it stands today - [2]- 2 that between the Commonwealth and financial disaster. Between Australia and material disaster tliere stand also our two great arms of defence-the A r m y and the Navy. These, too, I say without danger of contradiction, were fashioned by a Labour Administration, and it is meet and fitting that the party which fashioned those weapons by which we are enabled to avoid disaster should be the first to use them. We owe them to a Labour Government, and it is meet and fitting that a Labour Government should now be in office to administer them. His Excellency's Speech referred, necessarily briefly, to the question of Protection. If ever the question of increasing the Tariff, so as to make Protection effective, should appeal to the people of Australia, it is at the present time. Not that it is any more necessary today than it was before; but from the march of events in the last few months many people who before the war would not admit the necessity for the desirableness of Protection have now been converted to that plank in their platform which is so dear to the Labour party. We have seen in the past, and, in fact, we see still, our miners and other working men acting as hewers of wood and drawers of water, diving into the recesses of the earth and risking their lives, or ruining their health, to produce our raw materials. These materials are produced; and instead of good Australian bone and muscle and brain and intelligence working them up to the finished products, they are, in many cases, carried across the seas and, to the foreigners' profit we pay doubly for tbem. We raise these raw materials first, and get paid for only the rough work. In almost any shop we could see until quite recently goods marked with the legend "" Made in Germany;"" and I shall not be satisfied until that, or any other similar legend, is replaced by "" Made in Aust r a l i a . "" I am pleased to see that the programme which has been presented by the Governor General is one that will, in all probability, be strongly approved by the people generally. There was a class of people who, perhaps not more than eighteen months ago, regarded the Labour party as enemies and with distrust; and the greatest possible tribute to the work that has been done by that Labour part jr t is in the fact that now that people have"" had time to consider, they have, even in the rural constituencies, recognised the claim of that strong and united party to lead the destinies of this great Commonwealth in a time of trouble. It is amagnificent tribute to the work of the past; and I am sure it will inspire the Government to proceed in the full hope chat what they may do in the future will be fully approved, allowing for the necessary difficulties that must be encountered during the next three years. The farmer was regarded as the last stronghold and citadel of so-called Liberalism in this country; but that citadel has at last been definitely taken by the siege guns of Labour. It was a habit amongst the Opposition, and other Conservatives, to deal with the farmer as the ostrich-raiser deals with his birds. If there ostrich-raiser on the Opposition side he will know that when it is desired to pluck the valuable feathers, it is usual to place a paper bag over the heads of the birds; and this is what the Opposition, and the press that represents them, did. They put the paper bag of misrepresentation around the head of the rural ostrich; and, as it was thus bandaged, plucked out its tail feathers. However, that paper bag - whic h probably was made up of a copy of the Argus-ha s been pecked through by the ostrich; and now the farmer in this country has had the scales removed from his eyes, and has demonstrated the fact by giving his support to the Labour party, in view of what they have done in the past, and of what tliey propose to do ih the future, and placed that party in its present strong position.",14
58,Mr LYNCH,PICTURES OF PROMINENT,"Werriwa) [8.35] - It affords me - very great pleasure to second the motion proposed by the honourable member for Grampians. A more statesmanlike utterance than the Governor General's Speech now under consideration never came before an Australian Parliament, and certainly it may be said with truth that the Speech is worthy of the occasion. Never before in the history of our country did we find a Government confronted with so many and varied difficulties as is the Government of Australia today. It is true that many of these difficulties were begotten in the past mis- Commonwealth. management in the States, for which mismanagement the Commonwealth Government can in nowise be held responsible. Notwithstanding .that our population is a small one-scarcel y 5,000,000 of people-yet , unfortunately, the bulk of these people are artificially supported on the seaboard, with an empty continent behind them; and the duty devolves on the Government, not only to provide for meeting our obligations with regard to the Empire, but also to maintain a vast army of industrial workers engaged on our State railways and other public works, from which we hope ultimately to derive a profit, and, as foreshadowed in the Speech I am commending to-night, to foster the industries of the Commonwealth. Those difficulties are no doubt great and varied; but as a working farmer myself, I have every confidence in the Government. In 1902 I lost some of my sheep and the is any whole' of my crops; yet I had faith and confidence in the resources of the country; and if we are only true to ourselves we cannot possibly fail. We 'know that we are better men because of the vicissitudes and trials which occasionally come on us. As an Australian native myself, I am proud of the stand that is everywhere taken by the people in their efforts to meet the difficulties which confront them. I am sure that the progressive policy of the Government, as laid down in the Governor General's Speech, will be of inestimable value, especially if it be backed up by progressive State Governments whicn have control over what I , as a practical man, say is of the most vital importance, namely, the lands. If those State Governments do their duty, and assist in setting reproductive labour free, we know that, with the assistance which the Commonwealth Government can give, we need not be afraid of the issue. It is a special pleasure to me to see it foreshadowed in the Speech that we are soon to have before us the question of granting wider powers to the Commonwealth. This question was put prominently before the people during the election campaign, and we are told that it is to be brought forward in the immediate future, so that this Parliament may be given power to give full and fair expression to the will of the people in every matter material to the interests of the As a Protectionist through conviction all my life, I feel that the fiscal question and the one to which, I have just referred, are very closely allied. I believe in the policy of effective Protection, because no country bas yet attained industrial greatness without it . I hold that Protection can and does accelerate production, but yet, without the wider powers asked for by the referenda, which are necessary to insure the equitable distribution of wealth, much of the benefit from production is lost to the real producers-the workers of the country. I should like to say that to my, perhaps, simple mind there is no difference between the principle of the proposal of the Labour party-that is, State control with the right of punishment where wrong-doing is perpetrated either in the production or distribution of wealth-and the principle we all , whether Liberals or Labour men, subscribe to in regard to the security of life now. and property. The proposal simply means that we endorse the principle that the community must do for individuals what individuals cannot do for themselves. Under the fundamental principle of Democracy, we have claimed the right to govern ourselves, and, since that democratic law rests on the moral law which makes every man responsible for himself, the responsibility miist be accepted, and punishments provided for. We accept the principle of State interference; and to leave the great avenues of production and distribution to be exploited by powerful interests, whether individual or corporate, is to perform only half our duty and bring loss and in j u ry on the community. It , therefore, affords me very much pleasure to see those proposals put forward so pjpminently. I hope that when they are submitted to the people, tliey will receive sanction and that this Parliament will be made the instrument which we aim at making it-so potent as to know no superior from one end of Australia to the other. There is another little matter to which I should like to briefly allude; and I wish to be brief in this my first utterance in the Parliament of my native country. I refer now to the heroic stand made by little Belgium. In the Speech of the Governor General we are informed that some recognition of this heroism is to be made; and it may be said by some that the money could be better spent at home. We are, however, showing that it is not only when we are well and prosperous that we can recognise worth or maintain the dignity of Australia. The prominence given to the question of Belgian independence is fraught with great consequences to the world. When we find the great nations of the earth subscribing to the doctrine that it is not numerical strength but in dividual worth that should be maintained-that the individuality of a nation is something valuable, irrespective of the size of the nation-w e have gone a long way towards the solution of a great problem. It is shown that in the councils of the world nations, both large and small, provided that they are worthy and progressive, ought to meet on equal terms and receive equal consideration; and this will , in a great measure, assist in bringing about permanent peace, seeing that the desire to seek superiority by brute force will not be so rampant as It would, perhaps, be just as well if I , as a working farmer, were to say something regarding the proposal to make the Commonwealth Bank of greater benefit to the producers of the country. As a farmer who has sold wheat at Is. 9d., Is. 10d., and 2s. a bushel in the lean years, I say that, notwithstanding all the many and varied, and, doubtless, commendable efforts to establish co-operative societies and other institutions to handle our produce so as to save much of the monstrous cost of distribution, all such systems break down to some extent. They never cau realise the object in view, because the bulk of the primary producers are mostly needy producers. No society or system has yet been evolved by private enterprise by which these people can be financed during a period that must elapse before they can market their goods to the best advantage at the other end of the earth. And I see no reason why, under a parental Government, such as I recognise to be now in office, the Commonwealth Bank may not be made the means of financing such needy settlers and doing away with an army of rapacious middlemen, who are utterly unnecessary. Such a system ought to be and can be introduced, and it will go a long way towards making the position of the man on the land more secure. I do not inteud to further occupy the time of honourable members, but I trust that the proposals which are mentioned in the Speech, .and which to me, as a pra<> tical man, seem so commendable at this, crisis in our history, will be put into practice in the shortest period possible.

Although I believe there is hardly a person in Australia wbo would question such disbursements, nevertheless we, as a Parliament, ought not to allow to pass any longer time than is necessary before validating that expenditure.
