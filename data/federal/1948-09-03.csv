Motion (by Mr Chifley ) - by leaveagreed toThat, during the absence of Mr Holt, Mr. Hutchinson be temporarily appointed in his place as a member of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. SNOWY RIVER SCHEME.",12
1,Mr WILLIAMS,P ARLIAMENTA RY PROCEEDINGS,Will the Prime Minister inform'the Honse of the position in regard to the Snowy River water conservation scheme? Has any .agreement been reached between the Australian Government and the Governments of New South. Wales and Victoria in relation to the scheme 1 Will the right honourable gentleman give to the House what in formation ' be has of this great scheme and an estimate of when it is likely to be implemented ?,12
2,Mr CHIFLEY,P ARLIAMENTA RY PROCEEDINGS,The Minister for Works and Housing will answer the question.,12
3,Mr LEMMON,P ARLIAMENTA RY PROCEEDINGS,"Preliminar y examination of the scheme indicated to the engineers of the Department of Works and Housing that it was worthy of fnrther examination. At a conference of Gommonwealth and State Ministers held in 1947 is was decided to establish a committee, representative of the Commonwealth and the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria to examine the engineering aspects of the scheme. The committee is to present its report to the three Governments concerned. It is anticipated that the report will be. submitted to the Prime Minister early in November. I trust that when it is received it will be considered by the two States purely from the standpoint of the national value of the scheme. A great source of power remains untapped in the waters of the Snowy River and it is hoped that when the report is discussed by the three Governments the scheme' will be considered without bickering between the. States and solely from the point of view of the benefits its implementation will confer upon Australia as a whole. MOTO RVEHICLES . LEFT - HA ND DKTVE. Mr FALKINDER , - I direct a question to the Minister for Transport. Is it a fact that the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers discussed a proposal to ban the use in Australia of left-band drive motor vehicles? What was the attitude of the Commonwealth towards that proposal? Was consideration given to the fact that large numbers' of American A r my jeeps are now being used by Australian primary pro-, ducers who would be placed in an unfortunate position if such a ban were imposed? Mr ""WARD -;-At the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, the subject of left-hand drive motor vehicles was raised at the instance of the Premier pf Queensland, Mr Hanlon. Attention was drawn to the great danger to public safety causod by the increasing number of such vehicles on our roads. Some of the States have already taken action in the matter and Mr Hanlon was anxious that a uniform practice be adopted in all States. After having expressed their opinion that no more of these vehicles, other than those imported by the consular services for their own nse, should be registered, the conference expressed a desire that the subject be referred to the Australian Transport Advisory Council for consideration. That' course will be taken. The problem will be listed for discussion at the next meeting of the council.. POSTAL DEPARTMENTFEMALE POSTAL ASSISTANTS. . Mrs BLACKBURN -^Ia view of the accepted Labour policy favouring the civil equality of men and women, will the Minister for Labour and National Service explain why women postal assistants now receiving 75 per cent, of the male rate of wages are to have their rate cut to a lower percentage? As these women are doing exactly the same work as men, carrying the same loads, making rounds of the same size, and working the same hours, will the honourable gentleman sho-w how the proposed reduction can be justified?",12
4,Mr HOLLOWAY,P ARLIAMENTA RY PROCEEDINGS,"I am not able to say - whether, or not such a reduction can be justified. That is a matter for determination by the Commonwealth Publie Service Arbitrator to whom the ease has been submitted. I - do not know whether a final decision has yet been made. I shall discuss the matter with the Postmaster General and inform the honourable member in due course. NA KEROSENE. Mr.ANTHONY - I direet a question to the Minister representing the Minister for - Shipping and Fuel. I have received letters and telegrams from farmers' organizations in the northern part of New Sputh Wales, notably in the Tweed district, who are anxious tQ increase production of primary commodities. They say that their members arc'unable to obtain supplies of distillate and power kerosene because of a restriction placed by the Department of Shipping and Fuel on the oil companies delivering these fuels. In these communications the oil companies arc accused of having oversold their quotas and it is alleged that because of this no further supplies will he made available to them until the 1st October. The worse consequence of that, of course, falls not upon the oil companies but upon the f armers, who are precluded from carrying out their preparations for spring sowing. Therefore, I ask whether the requisite fuel can be made available to the farmers, irrespective of what the oil companies may or may not have. done.",13
5,Mr OHTFLET,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"This matter has been . the subject of a great deal of consideration. I shall not go into all the details regarding overselling, but it is completely clear that there has even been propaganda in favor of the unrestricted selling of various petroleum products that are in short world supply,' 1 clo not know anything of the particular matter mentioned by the honourable member, hut I can easily appreciate that, if Prime companies have been over-selling their quotas, farmers, through no fault of their own, may not be receiving essential supplies of fuel. In view of that, I shall - make it my business to get in touch with the Minister for - Shipping and Fuel and ask him to have an immediate inquiry made. CIVI L AVIATION. MISSING PASSENGER AIRCRAFT.",13
6,Mr CONELAN,DISTILLATE AND POWER,Has the Minister for Civil Aviation any information to impart to the House about the report that a passenger' aircraft is missing between Brisbane and Sydney?,13
7,Mr DRAKEFORD,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"I have some information. I regret that it is not satisfactory. Ah Australian National Airlines liner, VH-ANK, leftBrisbane for Sydney at 5.35 p.m. yesterday and was due atMascot airport at 8.55 p.m. At' 7^53 p.m. the crow of the aircraft reported its position as being over Williamtown, the nearest airport to Newcastle, at a height of 6,000 feet, and it was cleared to come down to 4,000 feet. At 8.12 p.m. Mascot aeradio was in. touch with the aircraft and everything appeared to be normal. No further message was received from the machine. At 9.15 a.m. today, a message was received from officers of the Caldare, a coastal vessel, that at 8.20 p.m. yesterday an aircraft was seen two miles off the coast at Terrigal, opposite Gosford, flying at 200 feet and apparently losing height. This position would be on the course of the missing aircraft. A Catalina flying ho'at has been diverted since that news was received to search the area in addition to the other aircraft that have been searching since daylight this morning. I hope that news will come to hand soon and I trust, as I am sure all honourable members do, that it will be of such a nature that it may relieve the anxiety of everybody concerned. It is understood that the aircraft had a complement of ten passengers and a crew of three. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY. DREGER NAVAL RASE-MEDICA L OFFICERS.",13
8,Mr RYAN,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"The Parliamentary delegation which has just returned from Japan, and of which I was a member, visited the Royal Australian Naval personnel .at the naval base of Dreger in New Guinea and inspected .the installations and amenities provided. Generally - speaking, the conditions 'for both officers and ratings are satisfactory, but tlhere is a shortage of electric fans. 'Only approximately 40 fans are provided at the base. Will the Minister for the Navy inquire into the position with a view to providing additional fans at an - early date ?",14
9,Mr RIORDAN,DISTILLATE AND POWER,I shall have inquiries made and inform the honourable member of the position.,14
10,Mr WHITE,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"Severa l surgeons and - other medical officers are still retained in the Royal Australian Navy, although they enlisted merely for the duration of hostilities, and should have heen demobilized soon after the termination of the war. As three years have elapsed since the cessation of hostilities, the chances of their re-establishing themselves successfully are rapidly diminishing. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,-Does the honourable member wish to make a speech on the subject?",14
11,Mr WHITE,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"No, - I am merely making an explanation. The Minister for the Navy knows very well that representations for the release of these medical men have been made to him by relatives and by other honourable members.",14
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTILLATE AND POWER,Order !,14
13,Mr WHITE,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"As the Army demobilized its medical officers long ago, will the Minister for the Navy undertake that justice will be done to medical officers still in the Navy who enlisted only for the duration of the war, so that they will not be penalized because of their patriotism and loyalty?",14
14,Mr RIORDAN,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"I thank the honourable member for his explanation of the background to his question. Had he paid attention during question time in days gone iby, he would have heard other honourable members ask similar questions. Mr WHITE*-It is a pity the Minister does not do something to rectify the position. Mi:. RIORDAN - The honourable member would have heard the reason for the retention .of some doctors in the service af the Navy - Certain medical men who still are retained in the Navy were enlisted as "" hostilities only "" which meant for the duration of the war and a period thereafter. Legally, they can be retained, but the Navy Department is most anxious to release those who desire to leave the service.",14
15,Mr WHITE,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"What is preventing their release? Mr Riordan;-Fro m time to time, I have been in communication with the British Medical Association on the matter, and only a fortnight ago spoke to Dr Hunter about it. I also had discussion last week with the Director of Medical Services, with a view to investigating the possibility of obtaining for the navy service medical officers from overseas, so as to release medical men still retained in the Navy. WHEAT.",14
16,Mr TURNBULL,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform me whether the growers' representatives will control policy and sales under the Government's scheme to stabilize the wheat industry, or will the Minister continue to do so?  plan, which is subject to agreement by the States, provides for an Australian Wheat Board. Policy will not be affected by the plan because full and effective control over overseas markets is vested in the Commonwealth, and that provision will not he altered.",15
17,Mr FULLER,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"I preface a question which I wish to ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture by quoting the following report which I have taken from the Daily Advertiser of the 28th August last:NA WHEAT STABILIZATION. Lockhart, Friday: At the Farmers and Settlers' Association meeting today, Mr. Kendell, M.L.A., for Corowa, said that notwithstanding some faults, he was going to support the federal wheat stabilization plan for the sake of young men taking up blocks.",15
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LOCKHART FARMERS AND SETTLERS SUPPORTS,Order ! What is the honourable member's question,15
19,Mr FULLER,LOCKHART FARMERS AND SETTLERS SUPPORTS,"Can the Minister incompany form the House of the progress being made by the various State governments in introducing legislation to give effect a stabilization plan on a national hasis?  authentic information on the matter raised by the ' honourable member. understand that the Government of the Western Australia is taking a ballot of the wheat-growers of that State to ascertain whether they are in favour the Commonwealth plan, and that similar action is being taken in Victoria South Australia. I have no definite in formation about the desire of the growers in New South Wales, but I know that the Government of that State has indicated that it is in favour of Commonwealth plan. In Victoria there are divided counsels, the Liberal section Australia? of the composite Government in that State being strongly in favour of the Commonmanufacturing wealth plan whilst the Country party section of that Government is rather in different to it . I understand that a similar situation exists in Western Australia. So far as the wheat-growers themselves are concerned, my informationand information leaks through to me from various sources-is that there has been a marked swing among them in favour of the Commonwealth plan. I am also in formed that 75 per cent, of the wheat growers in Victoria are likely to vote in favour of the Commonwealth plan. I understand that a similar vote is likely in South Australia. I am not unconscious of the fact that this marked swing towards the Commonwealth plan, and the notable silence of members of the Australian Country party, has some association with the fact that world prices for wheat are falling, so that many people are anxious to get in out of the wet, and to obtain the benefits of the Commonwealth stabilization plan. NA CEMENT COMPANY LIMITE D.",15
20,Mr LANG,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"Can the Treasurer in form me: (1) Whether a permit was ? issued recently to the Metropolitan Portland Cement Company authorizing that to import cement manufacturing machinery to the value of $950,000 from the Ford Motor Company of the to United States of America, which involved a total expenditure of $1,189,110 to cover complete charges? (2) Who made the request for the release of such a I large amount of dollars, and who made recommendation for the grant? (3 ) Was the permit issued prior to the flotation of the company? (4) Was a portion of of land owned by the Commonwealth near the Warwick Farm racecourse also sold and to the company as a factory site? (5) Prior to the issue of the permit to expend such a large number of dollars for the purchase of machinery, were any the inquiries made as to whether suitable machinery was not, in fact, lying idle in (6) Was the Government informed that two of the largest cement plants in the Commonwealth were not in production?",15
21,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"I tliink that the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) raised this matter, without mentioning the name of the company concerned, during the last sessional period, and he has since written letters to me on the subject. Indeed, I owe him an apology for not having answered his letters until after I returned from my recent visit abroad. The history of the flotation of the company to which the honourable members have referred has been considered by the Capital Issues Board. That body is, as every honourable member knows, a most reputable one, and the Deputy Governor of the Commonwealth Bank presides over its deliberations. I understand that a number of applications for the flotation of new capital have been refused by the board. I particularly inquired into this matter because of the attention paid to it by the honourable member for New England. As I say, the board has to deal with a great number of applications, and in many cases it has to point out to applicants that their applications do not conform to the board's requirements. The proposal is often amended to meet the criticism of the board and is approved in the amended form. My recollection is that that occurred in the case of this particular company. The question of importation also arose, but that was a different matter, because it concerned the Treasury and the Commonwealth Bank. When a large sum of dollars is involved, the matter is referred to the Treasury and myself directly, particularly if there is any doubt as to whether the grant of dollars is warranted. In this instance, an application was made for an allocation of dollars for the purchase from the United States of America of second hand plant for cement-making. I do not remember all the technical details of the type of plant that was sought. I asked Treasury officials, who are especially qualified for this work, to examine the whole proposition. After they had done so, it was decided to make dollars available for the purchase of this plant. It may be true, as the honourable member for Keid has said, that some cement manufacturing plants in Australia are not now in full production. In my own electorate, there are some which are not producing to full capacity. The reason is not lack of plant but lack of labour. Indeed, the development of new processes in the industry in recent years has enabled fewer men to manufacture greater quantities of cement. After the matter had been fully examined, I agreed to the granting of dollars, as I have done in hundreds of other cases.",16
22,Mr ABBOTT,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,The application had to come before the right honourable gentleman?,16
23,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"Yes , but I make it clear that not every application comes before me.",16
24,Mr ABBOTT,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,I understand that; but this particular application did come before the right honourable gentleman?,16
25,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"An application for a large sum of dollars comes before me. For instance, applications by newspaper proprietors for dollars with which to purchase newsprint, and hy the proprietors of the paper manufacturing plant at Boyer, in Tasmania, involved a large sum of dollars, and, therefore/ they came to me for consideration. In approving of the grant of any dollars, I have in mind that great developments are : required in this country in connection with our public works programme. The present programme involves an expenditure of nearly £600,000,000. At the moment, there is not sufficient labour to man all the works, or undertake all the projects that we should like to begin. Of course, one can always question a judgment or opinion in this matter, but I did not see any reason why, all other things being in order, and in view of the report of Treasury experts, dollars should not be granted for the purchase of this cement making plant. Naturally, because of the dollar stringency, I grant any application with the greatest reluctance. In the matter to which the honourable member for Reid has referred, the importation of the plant did seem to me to make a contribution towards fulfilling Australia's cement requirements and, even more important, the sale of supplies in excess of local requirements will enable us to earn dollars. We could sell large quantities of cement, if it were available, in the dollar area.",16
26,Mr ABBOTT,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,Hav e we sufficient shipping for the purpose?,17
27,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"I understand that some of the countries which urgently require cement, would provide the necessary shipping. We have granted an application by the management of the Boyer newsprint organization for a considerable amount of dollars, in the same way as we have provided a large amount of dollars for the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, to establish a tinplate mill, which will save dollars. As I believe that the dollar stringency will continue for a long period, any expenditure of dollars which Avill ultimately save dollars or earn dollars in the future always seems to me a matter which deserves earnest consideration. I have outlined the broad circumstances of the purchase of the cement-producing plant, but if any honourable member desires further details, I am always prepared to supply them. However, I make the qualification that I always endeavour to avoid' divulging to the public intimate details of any business, because I do not think that that is proper unless a charge of corruption has been made. The information is given in confidence, and the confidence should be respected. RE-ESTABLISHMENT LOANS.",17
28,Dame ENID LYONS,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"-In view of the decreased purchasing power of Australian money since the legislation was framed to permit of the granting to ex-servicemen of re-establishment loans up to £1,000, and having regard to the fact that the allowable amount of a loan for home-building has recently been increased, will the Minister for Repatriation recommend to Cabinet an increase of the allowable amount of re-establishment loans ?",17
29,Mr BARNARD,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"-The matter of re-establishment loans is one aspect of government undertakings which I administer for the Department of Post-war Reconstruction. I shall examine the points raised hy the honourable member to see what merit there is in the claim she has made, and will let her have a reply in due course. HOUSING.",17
30,Mr DALY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"It has been brought to my notice that reipresentatives of the New South Wales Housing Comniission complain from time to time that some defence establishments, such as air force camps and army hutments, are at present not occupied by officers or men, yet are withheld from the State Government,, thus preventing their use as emergency housing. Is the Minister for Works and Housing aware of any service establishments which could be made available to the State governments? Are they being held for any particular purpose, or is there no foundation for the statements that have been made concerning them?'",17
31,Mr LEMMON,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"The policy of the Government has been to make available to all State housing authorities any surplus hutments, and any naval, army or air force establishments capable of conversion into temporary civilian housing accommodation. New South Wales has fared extremely well under this policy,, for more hutments have been made available to it than to all the other States combined. I do not know of any establishments which are now surplus and could be made available. RABBIT SKINS.",17
32,Mr DUTHIE,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"I point out to the - Prime Minister that the Australian rabbit has earned for Australia many dollars, which could be devoted to the purchase of wire netting for use in combating the menace, which is increasing, owing to the prices of skins falling. In view of the fact that production of wire netting in Australia is at present 4,000 tons annually, which is less than the 1938-39' production",17
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,Order ! The honourable member is giving a great deal of information. I understood he intended to ask a question.,17
34,Mr DUTHIE,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,I am endeavouring to help the Prime Minister.,17
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,Order ! The honourable member is not helping himself by his. attitude.,17
36,Mr DUTHIE,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"In view of the great and continuing increase in the demand for wire netting by many primary producers of Australia who wish to utilize it to combat the rabbit menace, will the Prime Minister give earnest consideration to the possibility of importing certain quantities of this material from the United States?",17
37,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture will answer the - question.  rabbit has been a prime earner of dollars in recent years. It is recognized, ever, that it would be better to do without the rabbit and earn dollars by selling more primary produce. It is also recognized that, due to several years lag in the production of wire netting and to the great demand for it at the present time, many primary producers have difficulty in obtaining their needs. However, the question of the importation of wire netting from dollar areas or from any other source involves not only the question of dollar shortage but also the question of what would be an economic price which the farming and grazing community could afford to pay for the imported article. There is an organization in Sydney which has been busy for some months' circularizing primary producers and primary producers' organizations urging them to bring pressure to bear on the Government to import wire netting from dollar areas. This organization includes in its propaganda an order slip, but it studiously refrains from informing the primary producer what would be the landed cost of the wire netting. According to the latest information I have, the landed cost of No. 8 plain wire imported from the United States of America would be in the vicinity of £4 a cwt., compared with 28s. a cwt. for plain wire manufactured in Australiaalthough I admit there is an insufficiency - of Australian-made wire. The landed cost - of wire netting from the United Kingdom, .according to the latest information I have, is about £5 15s. peT cwt. for a 42-inch - coil .of li-inch mesh wire. Those costs are high and it is doubtful, even if there were a free flow of wire from overseas, whether primary producers could afford to huy it. For the information of - the honourable member and other interested parties, I .am obtaining figures showing the landed oosts of wire netting from the United States of America and from other - world isouxces. COTTON.",18
38,Mr ADERMANN,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"I understand that the matter of increasing the guaranteed price for cotton was discussed at the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers and that the Prime Minister informed the Premier of Queensland that he would consider the subject further how- following that discussion. As the planting season is now about to commence, can the Prime Minister say definitely by how much the guaranteed price for this season's cotton will be increased?",18
39,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"It is true that the Premier of Queensland, Mr Hanlon, raised the matter of cotton production at the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. At that conference T pointed out to him that after the 20th of this month the fixation of prices will rest with the States. As I see it at the moment, there is no reason why, should the Queensland Government believe it to be desirable, the price of cotton should not rise to world parity. That is a matter for determination by the State Government in conjunction with the Queensland Cotton Board. One of the great difficulties in the fixation of a price for cotton which will provide an adequate net return to growers in Queensland is that certain charges are made by the Queensland Cotton Board in respect of its commitment to its bank. With the production of cotton at present at a low level, the charges to which I have referred amount, I understand, to 7d. per lb. Thus, whatever price might be obtained, about 7d. per lb. has to be deducted in order to enable the board to meet its commitments .in respect of certain' advances. What I said to Mr Hanlon was that following on whatever happened after the 20th September in respect of prices control, 'and probably before the end of this year, I would ask the Australian Government to examine the whole question of cotton priees. I did not promise Mr Hanlon that anything could be done immediately, and I cannot make such a promise now; but, certainly, something will be done within the next few months. In the meantime, it appears that for this .season and, perhaps, for the next season, the cotton-growers could be amply .covered by ruling prices., if the State government and the Queensland Cotton Board allowed them to rise to world parity. IMMIGRATION .",18
40,Mr GULLETT,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"Many of migrants who come to Australia are qualiuniversities. fied in various professions and trades, but they are unable to practise here because their qualifications are not recog-' nized by the authorities. This fact tends to discourage the migration of qualified persons to Australia. Will the Minister for Immigration confer with the State trade examining bodies and university authorities with a view to inducing them to set up a council to examine migrants on their merits regarding academic trade qualificatione, so that they will have to do the whole course again, but will be given credit for the which they acquired abroad?",19
41,Mr CALWELL,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"I should be very from glad if the State authorities would take a broad view regarding the recognition of degrees acquired abroad, and of technical skill which many migrants particulars. possess. I think the honourable member, when asking his question, had in mind alien migrants rather than those of British birth, but there are complications regarding these also. I am not sure that Canadian medical degrees are recognized by Australian universities under any reciprocal arrangement, and we have reciprocal arrangement with any foreign countries in this respect. When war broke out, the only two foreign countries with which we had an arrangement for-the recognition of medical degrees were Italy and Japan. There was no .reciprocal arrangement with university authorities in Holland, Austria, Germany, Belgium or France, for instance, and I do not think that there was any disposition the part of the authorities in those tries to recognize Australian medical degrees. Why that should be, I do not know, because the standard of medical training in Australia is as high as any part of the world. Indeed, Australian university standards in all faculties are that statement? particularly high. I am glad that the honourable member asked his question, because it might serve to shake people out of their lethargy. At present, Australia is losing the benefit of the knowledge and skill acquired by immigrants during years of study. These people, who have come to make their homes in Australia must, under the present arrangement, begin de novo if they the wish to acquire degrees in Australian SUBSIDIES.",19
42,Mr CONELAN,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"I understand that the 12th September has been fixed as the date upon which the payment of subsidies upon imported cotton goods will cease. Can the Prime Minister say whether the subsidy will be payable on goods carried in a ship which arrives at and Fremantle before the 12th September, not but which does not unload the goods until it reaches its final port of call three or qualifications four weeks later ?",19
43,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"Instruction s covering this matter have been issued, apart the general order in relation to subsidies. So that there will be no confusion, I shall arrange for the release at an early the date of a statement giving exact COAL. EMPLOYMENT OF POLISH MINERS.",19
44,Mr RANKIN,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"I ask the Minister for Immigration whether it is true that the miners' federation has declined to no allow Polish and other immigrants to work with members of that federation in Australian mining projects? If so, what reason has been given for the ban imposed upon these immigrants? Will the Government take suitable action against the federation to ensure that the Government's policy of giving immigrants a reasonable opportunity to be absorbed into the Australian population shall preon vail? Has the Minister read a statecounment by the secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour party, Mr Lovegrove, that action taken by the miners' federation against the Polish in miners is part of the Communist can>. paign? Does the Minister agree with",19
45,Mr CALWELL,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"I was expecting this question to be asked yesterday, and some had begun to think that I should. have to wait until next Tuesday for it. I liave seen the resolution of the council of the miners' federation. I think that it is a most unfortunate resolution. I notice, however, that it says that members of the federation offer no objection to the employment of any person because of race, colour, or creed, and in that respect I believe that the federation is on firm ground. There is considerable misconception on the part, of the council of the miners' federation regarding the types of .immigrants coming to this country. It is untrue to say that Poles are not accustomed to a democratic way of life. Many Polish ex-servicemen and displaced persons were members of social democratic ^parties in their own country. They were not fascists or supporters of totalitarian refimes and their only desire in coming to Australia is to find an opportunity for a free and full life among democratic people. Of the Poles employed at Glen Davis, seven worked in Britisli coal mines and were members of the miners' federation of Great Britain, which, as the Prime Minister said last night, is a Communist controlled union. They have discharges from that union. These Poles at present are removing the over-burden or doing certain other work above ground. The miners have a legitimate reason for objecting to the employment underground of Poles who cannot speak English. They are entitled to some assurance that such Poles will not endanger the safety of other men. I think, however, that this legitimate fear on the part of the miners is being exploited. As no useful purpose can be served by wrangling with the council of the miners' federation in the press or in other ways about this matter, I have asked the president and secretary of the federation to come to Canberra to talk the matter over with me. I am satisfied that if there are any valid grounds for criticism of the employment of Poles underground, we can remove those grounds. If the miners fear that the Government will bring Poles to this country to disturb industrial conditions, they may set their minds at rest. We have no intention of disturbing the mining industry; but the fact remains that in the last twenty years the number of men employed in that industry in Australia has fallen from 24,000 to 17,000. We have heen no more successful in securing sufficient miners in Australia than the people of England have heen in getting enough miners from their own ranks. In the United States of America, the disposition of workers to undertake mining has changed to such a degree that the average age of American miners is now 42 years. We intend to bring to this country people from displaced persons camps and also Poles who served with the British forces, particularly those who fought alongside Australians in the defence of Tobruk. . All these people will be found employment in this country. We cannot get too many of them. They are excellent types, and the Government will not be intimidated or told by anybody that migrants are not to work, here, there or anywhere else. WOOL. RE-SALES BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES. Mr Abbott having earlier addressed a disallowed question to the Prime Minister,",19
46,Mr ABBOTT,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"Has the Prime Minister read in the press the statement that Mr Robert Schuman, the French Foreign Minister, has taken strong exception to the allegations of the Australian Minister for External Affairs that France had re-sold Australian wool to the United States of America at a price below that paid to the Commonwealth? As France takes 90 per cent, of Australian sheep-skin exports, will the Prime Minister request the Minister for External Affairs not to imperil this market by making rash statements?",20
47,Mr CHIFLEY,METROPOLITAN PORTLAND,"I have seen certain press statements but, of course, I cannot accept them as accurate reports of the conversations between Mr Schuman and the Australian Minister for External Affairs. It has been clear for some time that Australian wool and other commodities have been re-exported from certain European countries in return for dollars which properly should have come to this country. That matter has been taken up at a high level. I have been in touch with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, and he has broached the matter with the countries concerned. I have made a statement on the position emphasizing that no governments had been concerned in the re-exporting of Australian commodities to dollar areas, but that this had been done by get-richquick business people who had been able agreed to to sell the goods at a discount, receiving half of the dollars back on the free maran ket and making their profit out of those dollars. The honourable member for England will understand that.",20

50,Mr WILLIAMS,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"Eobertson) [11.27]. - I am pleased indeed to bave this opportunity to say a few words about the Speech delivered by the Governor General upon which His Excellency has been so warmly congratulated by members of this House. I should like to add my congratulations to those already voiced both for the manner in which the Speech was delivered and also for the substance of it. The Speech opened with a reference to the Government's intention to donate £10,000,000 to the United Kingdom Government. I am sure that every person in Australia will be pleased that the Government has expressed its intention to give this additional £10,000,000 which, with the £25,000,000 provided last year by this Parliament, makes a total g if t to the people of Great B r it a in of £35,000,000. We, in Australia, cannot do too much to assist the people of Great Britain who suffered so greatly and endured so many privations during the war in order that we might still be free. It is heartening to find the Australian Government co-ordinating so heartedly with the United Kingdom Government in the relief of distress in Great Britain. A great opportunity is at hand for Australia to grow more food and so help to relieve the distress of the starving people on the other side of the world. Recently, I had the honour of leading a parliamentary delegation to Queensland. The members of the delegation, who were the guests of the Queensland Government, were taken to Capella, Ln central Queensland, where they witnessed a remarkable sight. Queensland Government has started there a project which must appeal to the imagination of every Australian who wants to see our great country develop. At Capella, the Queensland Government has acquired a great property known as the Peak Downs Station, comprising 73,000 acres, and has in view the resumption of additional areas of land .until eventually it will have at least 500,000 acres under the plough. To witness the great tractors ploughing thousands of acres in a very short time, each giant machine ploughing a swathe as wide as this chamber, is indeed an inspiring sight. This project envisages the production of food in the grand manner such as has been employed in the United States of America for many years.",22
51,Mr ANTHONY,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"And Bussia, too.",22
52,Mr WILLIAMS,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"So m e honourable members opposite, like the honourable member for Bichmond (Mr Anthony), are prepared to condemn any methods merely because they are similar to those adopted by Stalin. We do not care what Stalin is doing in that respect. Surely there ie nothing wrong in adopting good methods from Bussia. I am sure that the Opposition members of the delegation applaud the methods adopted by the Queensland Government, which is operating in conjunction with the British Overseas Food Corporation, in implementing this project. The Queensland Government and the corporation have signed a joint agreement under which the former is to acquire the land. Of the £2,000,000 to be invested in the project, £1,500,000 w i ll be provided hy the corporation and £500,000 hy the Queensland Government. wholeA. special body of men will be appointed to oversee this great project and to bring to f r u it i o n as soon as possible the sorghum crops that have been planted, and the sunflower crops from which oil will be extracted for the manufacture of margarine and the provision of much-needed cooking oils for the people of Great Britain .",22
53,Mr ANTHONY,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"What is the principal crop ? The Mr WILLIAMS - In the main, sorghum will be grown for pig feed. It is planned to produce 500,000 pigs annually, which will be fed on sorghum grown nearby. These pigs will be slaughtered and shipped to Great Britain . Every person who has been to Capella has applauded most highly this great undertaking. When we view projects such as this we cannot but feel that those who conceived them deserve the greatest credit. It is hoped that the rainfall in the Capella district this year will he up to average so that the project may have a successful beginning. The Governor General referred in his Speech to the economic stability of this country. ""When one moves around Australia and talks to people in all parts of this vast continent, one finds that there is general agreement that the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) deserves the greatest credit for the economic and stabilization policies carried out by his Government, and it is usually given to him. Had not a firm hold been kept on the economic affairs of this country both during the war and in the post-war years, Australia would now have been in the shaky condition that many other countries are in today. The economy of Australia is an object lesson to the whole world, and the people in other countries envy us. We are proud of our Prime Minister - We are proud of the way in which he has directed the affairs of this country, and our opponents, even the millionaires of Australia, must be thankful in their hearts that our economy has been kept so stable and that our assets are safe and sound today. They are, in fact, safer than they have ever been. Doubtless some people, in their desire for gain, are anxious to displace this Government, but I am sure that the average men and women of Australia who have given a little thought to these matters will be content to allow this Government to remain in control for many years to come. Reference was made in the Governor General's Speech to the defence of Australia, and we have heard a great deal of comment about this passage from members of the Opposition. No doubt we shall hear a great deal more from them in the same strain in the future. However, we can all remember what happened to Australia during World War II., when honourable members opposite were in power. When the war began, they were fighting amongst themselves, their parties were torn to tatters, and they could not produce a stable government to make this country safe for even one hour. They threw in the reins of government and the Labour party came into office. We all remember how ifr. Williams. quickly it stimulated the courage of the people and marshalled the whole nation behind it. That is history. In the light of. those facts, it is laughable for members of the Opposition to talk now about this Government neglecting the defence of Australia. I am sure that the people who have heard the criticism by honourable members opposite will hope that, should the world be so unfortunate as to be embroiled in another global conflict, a Labour government will still be in office in this country. The Labour party has a splendid record. It has been kept in office by the people, who have great faith in it. There is little to be gained by raking over ancient history now, but I am impelled to do so when honourable members opposite condemn this Government and try to persuade the people that it has no policy for the defence of Australia. Their attacks inevitably bring to mind the events of a few years ago, when the people looked to a Labour government to save their country in its hour of peril. The people of Australia know that this Government stands side by side with the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, acts in close co-operation with them, and has the advantage of the advice of their experts as well as that of its own experts. Naturally the public cannot be told every detail of the nation's defence plans, but I am happy to place myself in the hands of this Government and its advisers,- and I have no doubt that a majority of Australians will be confident to do so also. The Governor General referred in his Speech to the fact that, in view of the result of the recent referendum, controls over prices and land sales are heing handed by the Commonwealth to the State governments. That is a very good thing. Further, I consider that the sooner we can throw overboard all war-time controls, the better it will be for the nation. We found it necessary after the termination of hostilities to keep certain emergency controls in operation for some time. As 1I have previously said, it was a good thing that we retained those controls, but as. we are returning to peace-time normality it would be a. good thing if we could get rid of them altogether.",22
54,Mr ANTHONY,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"But did not the honourable member urge the people to vote * Yes "" at the referendum ?",24
55,Mr WILLIAMS,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"I did, but apparently the honourable member cannot understand that, when we asked the people for power to exercise those controls, we also told them that we would use the power only if necessary. Those controls have now gone back to the States, which have power to keep them in operation for ever if they want to do so. I say that such controls should not be permanent. They should operate only in special circumstances, and the special circumstances which led to their introduction will soon cease to exist. The Governor General also made reference to coal production in Australia. Everybody realizes that, if our national development is to proceed, we must have increased coal production. I hope honourable members will forgive me if I refer again to central Queensland and to the coal deposits at Blair Athol, near the Capella district, which I mentioned earlier. There is a tremendous coal deposit at Blair Athol. It is not a coal seam in the ordinary sense of the word; it is a mountain of coal. It is covered by an overburden of about 30 feet of earth. When that overburden is removed, one can stand on pure coal. The deposit extends downwards for a distance of 90 feet .in some places, but the general depth is between 40 feet and 60 feet. It would be possible to supply the whole of Australia with coal from Blair Athol if we could open up a good railway system to the coast. Having seen coal being mined at Blair Athol, I urge the Government to develop open cut mining in Australia wherever possible. We must congratulate the Hanlon Government in Queensland upon its enterprise in obtaining overseas capital and concluding an agreement with a British company to lay down a new railway line from Blair Athol to the coast, the probable terminus being Mackay. When the line is completed, it will be possible to transport to port vast quantities of coal that are waiting to be At present, Blair Athol is served only by a light railway running to Rockhampton about 250 miles away. It is impossible to transport the coal won at Blair Athol, which amounts to approximately 1,400 tons a day, over a light railway. The English company which is directing the project will require approximately five years to get its railway into operation, so that the southern States of Australia cannot look to Queensland to provide any quick relief of the situation brought about by the shortage of coal. Of course, we hope that the railway line, which is estimated to require five years to complete, will be ready for use in a far shorter time. However, I mention the exploitation of the coal deposit at Blair Athol as an instance of what a government of men of imagination can do, and to illustrate the results that follow from attracting overseas capital to Australia. There are many large financial institutions overseas which are ready to invest money in Australia and to assist us in developing our great continent. If we were in a state of war the railway line which I have mentioned would, no doubt, be constructed in a much shorter time, but in times of peace, when there is no conscription of labour and people are free to work when and where they like, all we can do is to endeavour to attract labour to the jobs where it is most needed. I shall say something later concerning that aspect of the matter. The Governor General's Speech mentioned the subject of industrial arbitration. When the important measure which amended the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act was debated in the Parliament last year a great deal of discussion took place on its merits, and the Government emphasized that its purpose was to "" stream-line"" the arbitration machinery of the country so as to avoid strikes. The leaders of the Government have continuously counselled the workers of this country to adhere to arbitration, and I take this opportunity to say to the workers that if they do not heed that advice they stand in great danger of losing the advantage which they have already acquired. I repeat that it is of the utmost importance to Australian mined. workmen that they should heed the advice offered to them by the Labour Government, in the election of which they played so large a part. The tenor of that advice is that in adhering to the system of industrial arbitration they sliould obey the awards of the Conciliation Commissioners who were appointed by the Government. The men who were appointed Conciliation Commissioners were in most instances Labour men, of considerable experience of industry, who will be fair and sympathetic to the workers. I do not like to read reports of strikes following decisions of the Conciliation Commissioners, because those ofncials were appointed by the Government for the very purpose of conciliating industrial disputants. I can only say that I join with the leaders of the Government in their appeals to the workers of this oountry not to bring about chaos in industry by disregarding awards of the Gonciliation Commissioners. The Australian Laboui' party has always favoured industrial conciliation and arbitration; in fact, it not only fostered the principle of arbitration, but over the years it has actively developed that principle. I realise thn.t the average worker has great faith in arbitration and desires to abide by decisions of the arbitration tribunals, but unless there is real unity between the industrial workers of this country and the present Government they stand in great danger of losing all the privileges that they have gained. If the present Government went out of office, tomorrow it is safe to say that the 40-hour week would not last fourteen days.",24
56,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,I hope that it would not.,25
57,Mr WILLIAMS,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"My friends opposite certainly hope that it would not, and they concede the truth of my statement. If the workers of this country want to hold the concessions which the present Government has given them",25
58,Mr RYAN,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,The Government did not give those concessions to them; the 40hour week was awarded by the Arbitration Court.,25
59,Mr WILLIAMS,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,I repeat that the workers want to continue to enjoy a 40-hour week it is up to them to support the present Government.,25
60,Mr ANTHONY,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,Are the farmers of Robertson working a 40-hour week?,25
61,Mr WILLIAMS,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"The farmers of Robertson are very anxious that continuity of work shall prevail. They certainly do not want strikes; they want industrial peace. My friend the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony), however, is very happy when strikes occur. He was most jubilant on the eve of the State by-election in Kogarah, because it was impassible, owing to the shortage of coal, for Sydney householders to have fires in their homes or for housewives to cook meals. Because of the plight of Sydney people at that time he was able to gain a miserable political advantage, of which he ought to be ashamed. He certainly does not want to see industrial peace in this country, but the farmers, like every other sensible person in Australia, certainly desire that there shall be peace in industry.",25
62,Mr ANTHONY,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,Do the farmers work a 40-hour week ?,25
63,Mr WILLIAMS,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"I know that the honourable member does not work a 40hour week, and probably never will. 1I have spoken of the need to develop our great country, because we all realise that unless we can obtain additional population we cannot properly develop Australia. The truth of that observation is borne out when one travels over the vast distances of this country, sees its rich lands, and realizes itsenormous potential productivity. Undoubtedly, we have a vast territory, hut we must remember that its very vastness-is a temptation to other nations of hundreds of millions of people, who envy our possession of such a magnificent heritage. If we do not take positive steps to populate and develop our country we shall certainly have to reckon with those over-populated nations. Bearing in mind those considerations, I congratulate the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) on the magnificent work which he has done in bringing migrants to Australia. For his achievements the Minister has been commended, not only by honourable members on this side of the House, but also by if the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies). A recent report in the Melbourne press stated that the Leader of the Opposition paid a fine tribute to the Minister. The right honourable gentleman is reported to have said, "" Mr. Calwell has made as good a fight as possible. This country could take 20,000,000 people""; and I agree with the right' honourable gentleman. It is not often that I find myself in agreement with him, but I emphasize my complete agreement with him in this matter. The northern part of Queensland contains vast tracts of country which await development, and I consider that more migrants should be directed there. The migrants who come to this country should uot be directed to the overcrowded cities; their proper place is in the rural areas, where they can play an active part in primary production. Furthermore, I believe that we should direct them to the most remote parts of the States, because those are the areas which are most in need of people to develop them. In any event, I should like the Minister for Immigration to direct more migrants to the northern part of Queensland. As a security precaution-worl d condicost tions are uncertain today-w e must have more people. Northern Queensland has wonderful productivity, but it has yet been properly developed. more quickly we can settle people in that part of the Commonwealth to open up the rich country there, the better it w i for Australia. We must remember that improve, northern Queensland played a treto mendous part in World War II . From air strips at Mareeba, Townsville, and other centres aircraft took off to fight the battle of the Coral Sea. Had i been for the good work of cane-cutters and. cane-growers in providing labour machinery for the rapid construction air strips, those aircraft could not have struck such decisive blows in the battle. We should not forget the importance of northern Queensland in' another world war, and the Australian Government must do everything in its power to develop that area. We in this Parlianecessary ment are nationally minded. boundaries do not mean very much to In our outlook, we are not narrow-minded or partisan. An honourable member who represents a Victorian constituency must attach as much importance to the development of northern Queensland as he does to the development of his own State. I have no doubt that the honour the able member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), who possesses a large mind, is anxious that Australia shall he veloped on a national hasis. U] I now desire to refer to the Postmaster General's Department, and the necessity fbr the development of telephonic communications in outlying areas. The Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) has stated that an amount of £42 000;000! j will be expended under a three-year programme on the development of postal facilities. The sooner we can develop those facilities, the more quickly we shall relieve the distressed people who live in places other than the large cities. I should like to see the complete overhaul of postal facilities in the Wyong and Gosford districts, and, indeed, in other centres in my electorate. The farmer should be given some priority in telephonic communications, and a proportion of the cost of connecting a far m to the telephone line should be borne by taxpayers generally. In my opinion, the of connecting a far m to a telephone line is often extortionate, and a farmer should receive some relief from the not present heavy charge. I know that the The Postmaster-General's Department is suffering from the handicap of lack of materials and labour, but the Postmasterl l be General informs me that, as conditions he will take all steps necessary improve facilities in country districts. The people of Australia are anxious to in see the country develop along the lines t not that I have mentioned. They want to know why great public works such as and water conservation are not completed in of a short time; why roads and bridges are not being constructed; and why new railway lines are not being laid, new rolling stock manufactured and existing rolling stock repaired. The reason lies in our lack of population. In simple terms, we have not sufficient people to do all the work, and, in addition, we have State not suflicient materials available for those us. works. Last month, the National Works Council approved an almost staggering programme, and made £91,000,000 available to the States for expenditure on great undertakings such as railways and water conservation. That allocation was made on the basis of a survey of what States could expend if man-power and materials were available for public works. The States have great developdemental programmes, but we do not seem to be able to get the work done. Before vve can make substantial progress, we must increase our population. I believe that the Government is doing its utmost it. to bring more migrants to Australia. WT"""""" br» P r - p Minister visited London f ; recently, he discussed this problem with i.Ue ou.tea iviuguom autnonties.",25
64,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION, Order ! The honourable member has exhausted his time.,27
65,Mr RYAN,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"Flinders) [12.2] - If I do not reply to the speech of the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Williams), the reason is not that I agree with his views or approve of his remarks. I rise to participate-in this debate for an entirely different purpose. Last night, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) told the House something of the story of Australian members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, and I now desire to continue that account. I do so with great enthusiasm. The people of Australia, among whom I include members of this Parliament, have sufFered for a long time under a grave misapprehension about the quality of our troops in Japan and the role that they are playing in that country. I must confess that when I went to Japan I was under the same misapprehension. From what I had read in the press and heard from other sources, I had a feeling in the bottom of my heart that perhaps our troops in Japan were nothing more than a bunch of bandits or a crowd of evil-doers and evil-livers. I suppose that that idea was somewhat excusable, because for a long time, the press had been giving a most unfavorable account of what had been taking place in Japan. Never at any time in this House have I lieard a vigorous defence of our troops put forward by the people who should defend them. I refer to members of the Government, and, above all, the Minister for the Army (Mr. Chambers). It is true that on occasions the Minister for the Army has called for a report, and has read it to the House, but so far as my recollection goes, he has never said what he should have said, namely, that we have in Japan what I consider to be the finest body of troops, in pearc-time, that now exists in the world. Therefore, I welcome this opportunity, which is the first that I have had, to inform this House of the exact position,, and to tell the people of Australia about As a delegation, we had five weeks in J apan. Of that period, we spent approximately three weeks in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force area. Originally, the British Commonwealth Occupation Force consisted of troops from Great Bri tain,. Australia, India and New Zealand, and numbered approximately 40,000 men. The withdrawal of the British and Indian troops, and, later the New Zealand troops, reduced the strength of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force to a comparatively small figure. Nonetheless, the remaining troops in Japan do represent not only Australia - but the British Commonwealth of Nations. That is of great importance to the Empire and ourselves,, and perhaps to the world as a whole. While we were in Japan, we were given opportunities to see everything that was to be seen there. We spoke not only toofficers but also to the non-commissioned officers and men of the various units in different areas, as well as in Tokyo. Consequently, we were able to form a good idea of what was taking place, what our troops were doing and thinking, and how they liked conditions in Japan. Having been a professional soldier, I can claim with justification to possess some knowledge of armies. In the course of my life, I have seen the armies of many countries in war-time as well as in peacetime, and, therefore, I am able to form a reasonable opinion of the value of our troops compared with those of other countries in the past and at the present time. For bearing, efficiency, discipline and morale I have seen no better troops in the world in peace-time, and I consider this is a reasonable interpretation of the position in Japan. The honourable rmember for Parkes mentioned, amongst other things, the picturesque ceremony of the changing of the guard in Tokyo, which takes place there twice a week. It has come to play an important part in the life of Tokyo itself. The troops assemble just off one of the main streets and, headed by a very good band, march for about a quarter to half a mile into the square in front of the Emperor's Palace, - where the ceremonytakes place. Even now, after about three years, the ceremony is viewed by quite a number of Japanese, as well as others. Dt occupies about half an hour. The number of troops taking part is not now so large as previously, but, nevertheless, the spectacle is imposing. It brings the greatest honour to the troops themselves and to the people of Australia. Over the years, I have seen parades of the Brigade of Guards in London-the trooping of the colours, and other performances. I have seen my old regiment, the Royal Horse Artillery, which we always considered to be the best regiment in the British service, perform some outstanding exercises, yet, the display by our men that I saw in Japan recently was at least as good as the best show put on by the Guards Brigade, or my own regiment, and that is saying something! This is due to the quality of the troops, and very largely to General Robertson, an able and efficient officer, who has learned, during the course of his own experiences, how to deal with and train troops. Great credit is due to him and to the fine body of officers he has under his command. I have not the time to mention all of their names, but they are an able and extremely keen body of men, who are doing a great job for Australia. I say this from my own knowledge, and the other members of th« delegation can confirm this view. We interviewed General MACArthur, the Supreme Commander, several times. On the last occasion we were with him for two hours. Towards the end of the talk, he mentioned the Australian Army of Occupation in Japan, and, while I cannot quote his exact words, they made an impression on my mind. The General said that he had had experience of Australian troops in battle and knew them as fighting men second to none in the world. He had heard that in peacetime Australian troops did not make good garrison troops, that they were wild, undisciplined and unsuitable to perform peace-time duties in an occupied country. The General went on to say that after he had been with them in Japan for something like three years, those views had proved to be entirely wrong, as he had found that the Australians were the best troops under his command from the point of view of discipline and bearing. He said, in conclusion, "" They are a magnificent body of men, of whom Australia should be proud"". Those words of General MACArthur confirm in every way what the members of the delegation saw in Japan. I wish also to pay a very short tribute to a body of men in our army known as the Field Security Police. They are mostly non-commissioned officers and are scattered right' throughout the British occupied area, being sent in threes and fours to the larger towns, mainly in the back country, where there are no troops. It is their job to keep in touch with the Japanese and to find out what they are doing. Those men are performing splendid work. They send in returns as to the feeling in the coimtry and, in addition, they give advice to the Japanese on a number of matters connected with the democratic way of life. We have every reason to be proud of them; they are extremely keen and intelligent. Coming now to the Air Force, we spent two days with Group-Cap tain Brian Eaton and his command at Iwa Kuni, and had an opportunity to see the field exercises at Takamatzu on Shikoku Island, where they were carrying out tactical operations in co-operation with an American bombing squadron. There was with them a squadron of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. We were all impressed by the efficiency displayed, and particularly with the nature of the operations they were carrying out. It is true to say that at the present moment there are no squadrons of air forces anywhere else in the world better than these. They would be ready to go into action on 24 hours' notice. I shall touch also on the administrative service. No army, either in peace-time or in war, can Garry on without an efficient administrative service. The members of the delegation took the opportunity to see everything possible of various administrative units in Japan and we inspected the barracks, messes and supply service activities. We also saw the Army and Air Force workshops at Kure and Iwakuni, all of these impressed us. - Anotlier matter of great interest, importance to the people of Australia, is the excellent educational service which is being carried on in the command. The training courses last for a month, and there are classes in woodThis work, painting, metal-work, languages and commercial science. A .great many the troops are taking advantage of this opportunity. In the course of a month they are able to get a good grounding a subject. It is evident, therefore, that the men's education is not being lected whilst recreational facilities are excellent. At the barracks which the Australian troops occupy in Tokyo right in the heart of the city, there is even swimming pool, and there are also tennis courts. In addition, scattered in various parts of Japan, there are leave where troops may stay for a week-end or for a week. We visited several of these hostels, and found that they were well run. They enable the troops to get away from the routine of barrack life, to obtain a change of air and scenery. Excellent work is also being done by such voluntary organizations as the Young Men's Christian Association the Young Women's Christian Association and the Red Cross, which, at their establishments, provide facilities for refreshment amusement. There has been a good deal of talk Australia about the families of Ausdrawn. traliansserving in the Australian forces in J apan. I am able to say that practically all of them are very happy. They are meantime, well housed, and are provided with serour vants. The only drawback is the cost of living. They live on a somewhat higher standard than they would in an Australian tralian city, and this, naturally, entails greater expense. Thus, a private or non-commissioned officer, with a wife children to provide for, finds living expensive, and I believe that something should be done to help them. families are filling a very important in Japan. They invite private soldiers - and others to their houses, and provide a taste of home life to men who lack normal female society to which they were accustomed in Australia. Moreover, the families are provided with Japanese vants, who come to them straight from Mr Ryan. and their own Japanese homes. They observe the manner of living of the Australians, and carry back to their own people their impressions of men and women who have been reared in a democratic atmosphere. indoctrination of the Japanese by their own people, who are brought into of contact with members of the occupation forces, is going on all the time. Nearly 18,000 Japanese are employed by the in armies of occupation, and all of them are brought into daily contact with the negprivates, non-commissioned officers and oflieers of the forces. Thus, they absorb unconsciously much information about the democratic way of life as practised by civilized people in other countries. For a that reason, I believe that the families of soldiers in Japan play a very important part in bringing about a better mental hostels attitude among the Japanese. I have discussed the quality of our very troops in Japan, and the question naturally arises as to the purpose of their and presence there. They are members of an occupying force. At the end of the war we, in common with the people of all the allied countries, felt that as we had succeeded in crushing our deadly enemy, we should keep our foot on his neck by maintaining a force of occupation in and Japan. However, as time goes on, the opinion of people changes. The belief is now held hy many people in Australia in that the occupying force should be withI do not propose to discuss that point at length now, though I shall seek an opportunity to do so later. In the it is sufficient to point out that troops in Japan are filling a very important role as part of the army of occupation. It is the first time that Austroops have formed part of an occupying force in any part of the world, a and we are today setting standards for and ourselves, and, perhaps, for the world very generally, regarding what a force of occupation ought to do, and how it ought These to behave. We are also creating a prerole cedent for our own permanent army, and laying down the lines upon which it is to develop. Methods of organization and the administration are being tried out in Japan, and valuable experience is being gained in regard to services and amenities. serThe people of Japan are observing the conduct and bearing of our troops, whose behaviour must have an important fluence upon the J apanese, who are out upon the long and arduous road to democracy. I am glad to take this opportunity discuss our forces in Japan because of misapprehensions entertained by whole sections of the Australian public regardour ing the conduct of the troops, and the ditions under which they live. Fantastic stories have been told about the troops, just as fantastic stories have been told about the activities of the parliamentary delegation in Japan. Such stories result, partly of exaggeration, partly invention, and partly of pure lying. instance, we were told that the troops were being mentally and morally negof lected. Nothing could be further from the truth. We were also told that Aushaps, tralian troops were engaged in blackdreds marketing on a large scale. It is true that some black-marketing occurred among some of the troops, if that is proper - way to describe it, but understandable in the circumstances. The temptation to indulge in black-marketing was very strong. At first, the yen was valued 'at 200 to the £1,. and very little could be bought for 200 yen. For a packet of cigarettes it was possible to buy a great deal. Since the exme change is now at a more reasonable their rate, being 1,090 yen to the £1, situation has altered. However, black-marketing did take place was mainly a matter of a man selling a packet of cigarettes, or a bar of chocolate of his own for which he got much better value outside. Black-marketing means getting goods in an unauthorized way selling them at unauthorized prices. never happened on a large scale in Japan. The press has been trying to instil into our minds the idea that our troops in Japan are riddled with venereal stories; disease. Many people in Australia, indents cluding some honourable members, believe that. I shall not deny that there is venereal disease among our troops in Japan, but there has never been an the army, or an occupying force, in which that disease has not existed. It exists among troops even on home stations. Those who make this charge against our occupation forces should look round and inask themselves how much venereal setting disease exists in Australia. These stories, however, are gross exaggerations. Let us consider the facts: First, 80 per cent, of Australian troops wbo have to passed through Japan have never the had venereal disease; secondly, the monthly rate of venereal disease among troops in Japan at present is 1 per concent, per month. Perhaps, that percentage is too high; but'it is not so high as that among occupation forces elsewhere, and I believe that the rate among our occupation troops is decreasing. This story are the is a .bogy which should be laid of to rest at once. These stories of neglect For of our troops, black marketing and venereal disease are doing a great deal harm at home as well as lowering the prestige of our soldiers in the eyes, perof the world. I talked with hunof menduring my visit to Japan, and I assure honourable members that the first question which half of them asked the me was, "" Why are we being maligned it was in Australia? Why are we being maligned, above all, by the press? What have we done to deserve it ? "" These men stand as a credit to Australia, and deserve better treatment.' The position is even worse than that. No less than six private soldiers approached me and told that they had received letters from fiancees in Australia, in which they the were told, "" I will never marry a what man of the type you ' appear to be"". I know that there are a great many more similar instances. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke) told me of the case of a woman with a family, in Western Australia, the wife and of a soldier now serving in Japan, who That had a mental breakdown because she believed these reports and believed that her husband was living this terrible life. Such reports are entirely unfounded. The press as a whole is responsible for these it is not so much the corresponwho earn their daily bread by sending in sensational reports to their newspapers, as the editors and managers who control those newspapers. They have heavy responsibility of not belittling our troops, or allowing these lying statements to be made about our occupation forces. They should tell the facts; and the facts bring honour not only to our occupation troops but also to Australia, the country that bred them. In conclusion, I am very glad to have this opportunity to state the facts to the House and through it to the people of Australia. I want to allay the anxiety which exists among sections of our people with respect to the behaviour and moral worth of our troops in Japan. As an Australian, I am proud of the troops I have seen and proud to belong to their race. They are an absolutely magnificent body of men who are doing a splendid job. I only wish that all Australians could go to Japan and see for themselves what fine troops they are. I hope that the Australian leaders who are responsible for them will, in the future, receive some recognition at the hands of the Government. I hope even more earnestly that all those troops to whom, today, I pay this tribute will have given to them in the name of the Australian people and from the press of this country the recognition which is their due.",27
66,Mr BARNARD,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"Bass-Minister for Repatriation) [12.31] -.The House and the country are indebted to the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen), and the honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Ryan) for the forthright and considered approach which they have made to the problem that arises from reports which have been published in the press from time to time with respect to our occupation forces in J apan. The speeches of both honourable members were absolutely free from political bias, a rare occurrence in this House. Each of them made his speech in a very temperate way after giving the matter mature consideration following the visit of a delegation to Japan during the recent parliamentary recess.",31
67,Mr HOLLOWAY,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,They are two big Australians.,31
68,Mr BARNARD,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"I agree with the criticism Minister for Labour and National Sera vice (Mr Holloway). The honourable member for Flinders, prior to his elecSpeech tion to the Parliament, was a permanent 3oldier. He served with distinction in ment's future programme. World War I . , and he knows something ahout soldiering. His survey of the tion in Japan, the behaviour of our troops, the very high esteem in which they are held and the admiration that is felt, for them by those who see them from day to day, is a tribute which, I am sure, all of us keenly appreciate. I should like to say that as a Ministei' J. appreciate greatly what the honourable member said this morning, as I appreciated what the honourable member for Parkes said on the subject last night. The speeches of those two honourable members should do something at least to allay the fears of our people at home who have been led to believe the statements that have been made from time to time in the press about the conduct of our boys in Japan. I propose to make a few observations on the Speech delivered by the GovernorGfiTieral. The ceremony of opening the parliamentary session was performed in keeping with the traditional practice of the Mother of Parliaments. I believe that we should continue to follow that tradition with which is associated a temperate measure of display and pomp appropriate in a democratic community. The Australian people recognize the value of our democratic system of government and the principle accompanying it, and all honourable members agree upon the necessity for its continuance. That system shows the world that here is a body of free people who may assemble without let or hindrance, with no secret police force or soldiers required to guard the Governor General as he enters this Parliament. That is something which all Australians, perhaps very quietly and without fuss, accept as their due and as a part of a system whose continued operation we all desire. The Speech of the Governor General surveyed the activities of the Government during a considerable period, and ilso foreshadowed legislation which the Government proposes to introduce during the current session. There has been some of it because it did not contain reference to this, that or the - other subject, but the Governor General's is necessarily a brief survey of the past and an indication of the GovernOn this occasion the Speech covered several pages, posiwhich His Excellency had the patience to read to members and which was broadcast to the people outside. The Government has been criticized because the Speech does not refer sufficiently to its future policy and programme. I am not much concerned about that because those who have any connection with Parliament and parliamentary procedure know very well that one cannot cram into the Governor General's Speech all the programme envisaged for the session which the speech inaugurates. It is interesting to study the references that have been made by honourable members who have spoken concerning the Government, its activities, loss of prestige and failure to do certain things. I do not pay much attention to those utterances because after all political speeches are made from political angles. Naturally, members supporting a government say the things they believe about what has been done by the Government and express them in the best fashion possible. The Opposition criticizes the Government. But I have no complaint about criticism of .the Government by Opposition members. When the party to which I belong was in Opposition, I believed in criticizing the government of the day and I accept criticism from the present Opposition because it keeps the Government active.",31
69,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,Is the Minister feeling disappointed ?,32
70,Mr BARNARD,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"I am not at all disappointed. I shall refer to matter published in the daily press, during the recess, touching the activities of the Government, and written by individuals who have no political reason to make any observation at all about the soundness of the country's economy, the building of homes or building costs or any of various other matters. As a matter of interest, and because particular items do not appear in all the newspapers in Australia, and therefore may not be seen by all honourable members, I shall refer to a statement made by Sir Norman Brookes which was published in the Melbourne Herald of the 18 th August last. All I know of Sir Norman Brookes is that he is an i m portant man in the industrial life of Australia and has a high reputation in a number of other fields. The Melbourne Herald report of Sir Norman's statement reads:Australians might moan, but their country was in a sounder economic position than any otlier country he knew, said Sir Korman Brookes today.",32
71,Mr WHITE,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"Rea d out all he said, including his statement on taxation.",32
72,Mr BARNARD,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"If the honourable member will be patient I shall proceed. The statement continuesPrices have been held down very successfully and even if there was a slump abroad Australia could withstand it. "" If only we can realise what a wonderfulposition wje are in now and make the most of our opportunities, there should be no stopping us,"" said Sir Norman. "" We can face the future with the greatest optimism."" Sir Norman, who is chairman of directors of Australian Paper Manufacturers Limited - nd Australasian Paper and Pulp Company Limited, returned a few days ago from a five-months' business trip abroad. I do not propose to read the whole of the article.",32
73,Mr WHITE,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,That is only a condensation of a long report.,32
74,Mr BARNARD,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"To please the honourable member for Balaclava"" (Mr . White) I shall read the whole of the report.",32
75,Mr WHITE,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,It is still only a part of what he said.,32
76,Mr BARNARD,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"The report continuesBritain's economic position was far from satisfactory, he said. It was difncult to see how she would right herself, unless the Government organized an exodus of at least 10,000,000 people in the next few years. She might be able to feed 30,000,000 of her present population, but no more. It would have to be the policy of the Empire to spread her population in a way that would suit her economics. "" Personally, I think that Australia must take several million of the old country's surplus population in the next five years,"" said Sir Norman. "" We need to make proper arrangements to take up to 10,000,000, if necessary-w e have to see what we can do about ships, housing and employment. "" That should he the aim of any Government in office, no matter what its political flavour."" Sir Norman, who talked with Mr Attlee and other Governinent lenders while in London, said that key men of the British Government seemed to be woefully lacking in "" Empirc-mindedness."" , They hadn't travelled the Empire, and they knew little about Australia and our opportunities. Their present policy was wrong. They expected Britons to work harder than ever, yet the food provided, no matter how filling it was, was insufficient for hard work. Ee had been struck by the general lassitude of the people. They seemed to have lost the sting which was essential for any sort of gress. You could see that in their sport, as well as work. That is the entire article which appeared in the Melbourne Herald.",32
77,Mr WHITE,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"That may be the entire article, but it is not a ful l report. The report is critical of the Government.",33
78,Mr BARNARD,TERRITORY REPRESENTATION,"I suggest to the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) that any report critical of the Government would most certainly be published by the Melbourne Herald in full. The article that I have quoted frankly states that the economy of this country is sound. The heading on the article is '""' Australia Sound Economically "". It is useless for the honourable member for Balaclava to endeavour to twist these statements to suit his own arguments. I assume that the Herald has given a faithful account of the contents of the report in the belief that publication of that matter would be of advantage to the people of this country. The plain fact is that the. report is favourable to the Government and the honourable member for Balaclava does not like it. In the opinion of Mr F. W. Fraser, Canadian Trade Commissioner in Australia, published in the press on the 6th August, this country is accomplishing the best job in price control of any country to his knowledge. Mr Fraser who had returned to Canada on leave said that prices in Australia were lower than in Canada, but that the dollar shortage was still a serious hinderance to trade with Canada. Interesting figures on housing costs have been given by another Australian who has been overseas recently. He is Mr C. E. Philp a Hobart architect who returned to Australia last month from San Francisco. I know this gentleman personally. In a press interview, Mr. Philp stated that a two-bedroom weatherboard house at Lagoona Beach, 60 miles south of Los Angeles, cost £8,000 to  prices in America included costs of central heating, refrigeration, stoves, and other modern needs. Wages were the chief factor. A carpenter in California earned £6 a day. American workers received colossal salaries but living costs pro- were equal to salaries. Many people with large incomes had to make their own clothes because they could not buy them. He addedI've come back with more respect for price fixing controls than when I went away. Australians should consider themselves lucky that inflation tendencies have been checked.  modern architectural methods. These are the opinions of people who know something about conditions obtaining abroad today, and are able to make comparisons with conditions in Australia. Whilst there may still be room for improvement, it is clear that the economic policy of this Government has provided a sound basis for business enterprises. It is generally agreed that price fixing in this country has guaranteed equity to the people of the Commonwealth, and has kept prices down much more successfully than has been the case in other countries. I was interested in the observations made last night by the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison), who cited figures in an endeavour to belittle this Government's efforts. A review of the past is often amusing. I recall, for instance, that the Acting Leader of the Opposition was associated with successive governments which did nothing at all about housing. On many occasions while I was in opposition I voiced criticism of the housing situation in Canberra, which of course is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government, but governments of which - the Acting Leader of the Opposition was a supporter, and at one time, a Minister, took no action whatsoever, although hundreds of people were homeless in this city. The only contribution made by those administrations to a solution of Canberra's housing problem was to close the brickworks. No grants were made to the States for home construction. I shall not endeavour to answer in ful l the charges made by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, against this Government because I have not the figures, but I am' sure that my colleague, the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lemmon), will be able to tell the honourable gentleman just what has been done to alleviate the housing shortage throughout the Commonwealth. I referred to the matter briefly only because I realise that the Acting Leader of the Opposition knows quite well that he did-not state the facts. Everybody knows that more houses should be built. Any failure to provide homes has not been due to lack of finance. Ample funds have been made available by the Australian Government, both for the construction of homes and for the administration of housing schemes. I shall not deal with the Department of Repatriation at the moment, although the honourable member for Balaclava, as usual, had something to say about that matter. In the course of the budget debate, I propose to make a full statement on the activities of my department. To-day I am content to say that in. the forthcoming budget financial provision for the care of .ex-servicemen is more adequate than in any other budget in our history. I ask leave to continue my remarks.' Leave granted; debate adjourned. PAPERS. The following papers were sented :Commonwealth Public Service Act-Appoint ments-Departmen t of Supply Development-J . .J.
