0,NA,Unknown,"Wednesday, 24 August 2011 The SPEAKER (Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 09:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA Pairing Arrangements",17
1,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (09:01): I seek leave of the House to make a statement relating to pairing arrangements. Leave not granted.,17
2,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House from making a statement relating to pairing arrangements for a period not exceeding 10 minutes. In moving this motion before the House, I wish to draw the attention of all honourable members to the way that this parliament functions in a mature way and in the national interest. Today there is a funeral of a great Australian, Margaret Olley. The Australian government was to be represented at that funeral, as is appropriate, by the Hon. Simon Crean, the Minister for the Arts, and also represented was the opposition by her friend Malcolm Turnbull. Last week in this chamber we acknowledged Margaret Olley's passing. In that, the Prime Minister moved the motion of condolence. It was supported by the Leader of the Opposition. That Leader of the Opposition had this to say: I rise to support the eloquent words of the Prime Minister. Shethat is, Margaret Olleydid habitually what we all find difficult: doing good without being found out. The member for Wentworth gave an extraordinary contribution. His eloquent words are, I think, worth quoting for all members. He said: I do not know whether death surprised Margaret Olley or indeed that anything could surprise her, but when death came to take her they took her as full of life as she had been when William Dobell painted her, working right to the end-a great Australian never to be forgotten ... It is indeed extraordinary that the Australian government will not be represented at her funeral today. I say to the opposition that they should have a good look at themselves for the way that they are determined to wreck proper processes, wreck parliamentary conventions and wreck common decency, when it comes to their behaviour. Also, this morning we have the visit of the President of the Seychelles. The Prime Minister will greet the President, as is normal practice for our nation; yet, just as the pair for the arts minister was withdrawn, despite it being agreed to in writing, the pair for the Prime Minister has been withdrawn. Why has this occurred? This has occurred so that the Manager of Opposition Business can yet again engage in part of his grubby and hypocritical attempt to tear down proper parliamentary processes. The government believes in due processes. We know that there is only one member of the Australian parliament currently under charges-that we know of, because we do know that that member was charged in May and no-one found out anything about that until July. So much for the transparency nonsense that those people opposite argue. Of course, we know that there is a history on that side of the chamber. …… … They lost nine ministers and parliamentary secretaries over various issues and scandals while they were in office. Indeed, there were multiple police investigations into members opposite, including the great 'printgate' affair, with the member for Bonner, the member for Bowman and the member for Moreton, over allegations of misusing public money. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said about the member for Bonner at the time-and the member for Bonner has returnedMr Hockey interjecting",17
3,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"I will get to you, Joe.",18
4,Mr Hockey,MOTIONS,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. I kindly request that you bring the Leader of the House back to the actual motion before the House.",18
5,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,I remind the Leader of the House that this is a motion for the suspension of standing and sessional orders to allow him to do something. He cannot do the something before he gets that motion up.,18
6,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Indeed, Mr Speaker. I am arguing why we need this suspension of standing ordersMs Saffin interjecting",18
7,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for Page should really consider her position in this place. I am giving her the option and saviour of warning her, because I believe that she would be in desperate strife if I gave her 94A. She should be very careful and she perhaps should read House Representatives Practice to know that this is a suspension motion, where the Leader of the House will convince the chamber why there should be a suspension. She should stand as an example to other members if they wish to participate in what might be a crucial vote.",18
8,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Indeed the standing orders should be suspended because I should be permitted to make a statement about exactly what is at stake here in terms of the proper functioning of the parliament. People would be aware that we have processes of pairing such as the Australian government and opposition sending a representative to the United Nations in New York, and yet the opposition's representative, the member for Moncrieff, has been told that he will have to come back from that visit representing Australia. I would hope that he would have the decency to not suggest that Australian taxpayers' funds should be used to fly him back for a vote on the carbon price, in which the outcome has already been made clear because 76 members of this chamber have indicated their support for it, and then fly him back over to New York. I would hope he would have the decency to not even request that taxpayers' funds be usedMr Chester interjecting",18
9,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"Order! The same warning applies to the member for Gippsland, which would make him popular with his colleagues.",18
10,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"in that way. The fact is we have had a history in this House of people arguing due process. The Leader of the Opposition said this on the matter about the member for Bonner: The matter is really now before the police and perhaps the Criminal and Misconduct Commission in Queensland, and let's let those authorities make their investigations and come to of any conclusion. He's a backbench member of parliament and I think he's entitled to stay in the parliament until these bodies have come to their conclusions. The former Prime Minister had this to say: …a lot of people who are under investigation end up having nothing to answer for. It's a police investigation and the appropriate thing for me to do is to let the police investigation run its course and then if it is appropriate I have something to say.  order: this is a debate about whether the standing and sessional orders should be suspended to allow the Leader of the House to move a motion to speak for 10 minutes about pairing arrangements. The debate that he is currently engaging in could not possibly be relevant to that and, if he intends to have that kind of debate, he should have moved an entirely different motion.",18
11,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Leader of the House will relate his remarks and material to the reasons requiring the suspension of standing and sessional orders.,19
12,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"I will indeed, because the reason I should be permitted to make a statement about pair arrangements, which are agreed to, and the reason given by the opposition for breaching those arrangements and the reason why we should have a debate about it is the opposition's obsession in a hypocritical way with the issue in which they have indicated publicly they want to move a motion this morning. George Brandis had this to say in the past: I think people who let us remind ourselves [that we] are entitled to the presumption of innocence… Particularly since these people are Members of Parliament … That is what George Brandis said. Brandis on Brandis-he likes quoting himself in terms of his legal advice to his own political party as shadow Attorney-General. He had that to say on ABC online on 5 September 2007. That is appropriate because we know that those opposite are just driven by this relentless negativity- (Time expired) Question put: will That the motion (Mr Albanese's) be agreed to.

13,Mr Albanese,NOES,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: regarding the count that you have just read out, is it correct that the Prime Minister was not paired during that vote, contrary to the written agreement that was given by the opposition?",20
14,The SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! As people would understand, the pairing arrangements are private arrangements between political parties within the chamber. I am not aware. They will be listed in the Votes and Proceedings when that is produced. NOES Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (09:22): I seek leave to move a motion to require the member for Dobell to make a statement to the House. Leave not granted.  That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Sturt from moving forthwith the following motion: That the Member for Dobell attend this Chamber without delay to make a personal explanation for a period not exceeding ten minutes with respect to the following matters: (1) reported widely in the press but claimed by him to be misrepresentations, that: (a) during the period he was national secretary of the Health Services Union he misused the union's funds to purchase airline tickets, accommodation, restaurant meals, electronic goods, liquor, artworks, running shoes and escort services and took cash amounts totalling $101,000; (b) during the period he was national secretary of the Health Services Union he misused the union's funds to pay for his campaign in Dobell in 2007, spending $39,454 that he then failed to NA declare to the Australian Electoral Commission in breach of the Electoral Act; and (c) he misled Fair Work Australia in relation to the misuse of the Health Services Union funds by creating an alibi that a third party was responsible for the misuse of the union's funds and by failing to reveal the extent of the misuse; (2) to provide the factual basis for his statements on 1 August 2011 in the press that these allegations are a misrepresentation because while he had authorised payment of these transactions he did so on behalf of a third party who had stolen his credit card, his driver's licence, his mobile phone and forged his signature; and (3) to explain to this House why he did not register the payment of a substantial gift to him by the NSW Branch of the Australian Labor Party, reported as being either $40,000, $90,000 or $150,000 towards the costs incurred in abandoning defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media Ltd in the Register of Members' Interests until at least 77 days after his receipt of those funds. The motion speaks for itself.",20
15,Mr Albanese,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: that was like the motion that was read out the other day. Firstly, I move a point of order relating to the length of the motion. Motions should not be written in a way as to subvert the standing orders. In the past, motions which have been overly lengthy have been ruled out of order by the Speaker.",21
16,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! First of all, no other motion is being considered by the House and, secondly, that was a much shorter motion than was in the previous procedure. The length would not be something that would trouble the chair; it would be the amount of argument and material. In this case, it would be something that would be allowed.",21
17,Mr Albanese,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, on another point of order going to a matter already determined by the parliament: the Manager of Opposition Business moved a very similar motion just two days ago. I would ask you to consider that the government has not been given the benefit of having access to the motion. It appears that the Manager of Opposition Business is conceding that it is the same",21
18,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The Leader of the House will resume his seat. As I stated earlier, there is no decision by the House on this matter. We will attempt to circulate the terms of the motion as soon as possible. Is the motion seconded?",21
19,Mr Keenan,PAIRS,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,21
20,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (09:27): It is somewhat difficult to speak to this motion, not having a copy of it, but",21
21,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,It was actually difficult for me to make learned rulings to your point of order without a copy as well.,21
22,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"Nonetheless, Mr Speaker, your ruling might change when you read the motion.",21
23,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,No-I doubt it.,21
24,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"The hypocrisy of those opposite in coming in here and moving this motion, which directly contradicts everything that they said when they sat on the government benches, is just extraordinary. I have already indicated the examples of the member for Moreton, the member for Bonner and the member for Bowman. What they said then-the former Prime Minister, the shadow Attorney General and the now Leader of the Opposition-was that it was entirely inappropriate for the parliament to consider matters which are under investigation. They could not have been clearer. The shadow Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, said: I think people who let us remind ourselves [that we] are entitled to the presumption of innocence ... Particularly since these people are Members of Parliament ... I ask you to compare that rhetoric with what is in the motion moved by the member for Sturt. It has argument and it purports to find outcomes relating to the member for Dobell without any process whatsoever. We in this country have a separation of the judiciary from parliamentary processes. It is a very dangerous slippery slope when the parliament sets itself up for the sort of engagement and grubby behaviour that we are seeing here.",21
25,Unknown,PAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,21
26,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,Slow learners! Worry about what is important.,22
27,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"The fact is that former Prime Minister John Howard had this to say about the investigation into his three MPs, one of whom, the member for Bowman, is back in the chamber today, having been investigated by the police, who found no findings against him, and then running for parliament and being duly elected-he had proper process",22
28,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I remind the Leader of the House to relate his remarks to the suspension.,22
29,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"I will, Mr Speaker. He said: A lot of people who are under investigation end up having nothing to answer for. It's a police investigation and the appropriate thing for me to do is to let the police investigation run its course, and then, if it is appropriate, I will have something to say. If this suspension motion is carried, it throws that process out the door completely. We know, of course, that the mob opposite were involved in many issues that were raised over the years, but nothing happened in terms of sacking them even from senior front-bench positions. Wilson Tuckey used a ministerial letterhead to ask the South Australian police minister to review his son's conviction on a traffic charge. Do you remember Peter Reith's $50,000 phone card bill? The family and friends were making thousands of phone calls and taxpayers' money was being used, but he was not sacked over that; he was allowed to sit there. This is what Peter Reith had to say at the time on the ABC PM program: 'I did give the card to my son and I should not have done so.' And John Howard did not sack Peter Reith for misleading the public about 'children overboard'. There is a bit of a history of cards and issues being debated in the parliament. Peter Reith was allowed to sit here as a minister in the cabinet-indeed, as the Leader of the House in the cabinet-but that did not seem to matter. Also, when he was Prime Minister, John Howard did not sack someone for setting up a farm accommodation business at their original Malanda cattle farm just two days after the then Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Mr Hockey, launched a taxpayer funded ad campaign for farm stays. That was back in May 2004. Now the member for North Sydney has sought to engage in this debate. We had Alexander Downer. He said that he was ignorant about kickbacks with regard to the AWB scandal. We know that the member for Wentworth handed out $10 million to the speculative …… … Australian Rain Corporation whose chairman, Matt Handbury, was a member of Mr Turnbull's fundraising body. This motion before us also speaks about payments from the Labor Party to the member for Dobell. That is what this motion says.",22
30,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! Again, I remind the Leader of the House",22
31,Mr ALBANESE,PAIRS,"That will be debated if this suspension motion is carried. Yet I am surprised, actually, that there is nothing about the payments this year by the Victorian Liberal Party to one of their senior people, who is now a minister in the Victorian government. He had his legal fees paid for by the Victorian Liberal Party. What did the parliamentary Liberal Party of Victoria, of which the shadow finance minister is a prominent member, have to say about it? 'Oh, that's normal.' I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has not moved this suspension motion, and that is not surprising. To have the Leader of the Opposition stand up and move a suspension of standing orders to speak about late declarations would indeed be problematic for the Leader of the Opposition, because we know that the Leader of the Opposition was also twice extremely problematic with his late declarations about a range of issues, and just said, 'Oh well, don't worry about that.' We know that the Leader of the Opposition has a great deal of form when it comes to these issues, because he established a fund when he was part of the government. This is what he had to say about where the money, the $100,000, came from to go into that fund. Did he come in here and give an explanation to parliament? Did he say that everyone should have a right to know? No. The Leader of the Opposition told the Sydney Morning Herald on 5 September 2003 'there are some things the public has no particular right to know'. That is a mantra he lives his life by. But we also know that he told the ABC that he did not give Terry Sharples a loan guarantee for his costs, even though the Sydney Morning Herald had a copy of a note witnessed and dated 11 July 1998, which had the statement 'My personal guarantee that you will not be further out of pocket'. We never found out where all that money came from or what it was used for. The Leader of the Opposition thought that was fine. But it has carried on. On 20 June this year the Australian newspaper ran a story about jeweller Peter Dracakis, a shop owner in Mr Abbott's electorate, who was complaining about having to pay workers overtime rates-this is something I have raised in parliament before. Peter's father, Paul, was listed as President and Financial Controller of the Warringah Club, which is the Leader of the Opposition's personal fundraising group, the same group that has raised $110,000 for the Leader of the Opposition since August 2008, probably something that he thought no-one needed to know about. Certainly the Australian newspaper was not told about this before it was splashed on the front page of the newspaper-this innocent small-business owner just having a view out there, not connected to the Liberal Party, not connected to the Leader of the Opposition whatsoever. Once again, this shows the Liberal Party's response and hypocrisy. This is a very dangerous road that the opposition go down. They go down this road because they are absolutely desperate to trash any convention whatsoever. This is not a conservative leading the opposition; this is a reactionary who is prepared to tear up due process, to tear up our parliamentary conventions and to tear up the principles of innocence which everyone is entitled to under the rule of law. As he said himself: 'You do not have to judge me by my words; you can me judge by my actions.' (Time expired) Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:37): I take the call as Deputy Leader of the House. The issue before the House is whether standing orders should be suspended to enable the member for Dobell to address the House. That is in the context of two very important factors which the House needs to bear very carefully in mind. Firstly, there is a Fair Work investigation under way with respect to those matters. Secondly, the New South Wales Police have indicated that they are contemplating an investigation in this respect. That must cause the House to proceed very carefully so far as a suspension is concerned. For the reasons the that the Leader of the House has outlined, any number of executives in this place have always cautioned the House that when an investigation is on foot, when an investigation is under way, when an investigation is possible, the House must proceed very cautiously and very carefully before inveigling itself into such a matter. This is not the first occasion this year this parliament has had to consider such a matter. We know in the other place there is a senator who is the subject, firstly, of a criminal investigation and, secondly, of criminal charges. The parliament, generally and quite rightly, has been respectfully silent about that matter because the senator concerned is entitled to the presumption of innocence and is, of course, entitled to see those processes go to their logical conclusion. The same should occur here. When the House knows that an investigation is underway it should be cautious and very careful about suspending standing orders to inveigle itself into those procedures. There is, of course, an appropriate action which the member for Dobell has already taken. The member for Dobell has made a change to his declaration of interest to reflect a contribution made to his lawyers by the New South Wales branch of the ALP. On his own acknowledgement he has said that in making that declaration he was late. As members know, he is not the first person in this place to be late with the declaration. That is regrettable. It is not the first time has occurred. I suspect it will not be the last time it will occur. The Leader of the Opposition well knows the regret which comes from being late in a declaration or disclosure. That is an appropriate parliamentary response which does not require the House to suspend standing orders, and that has already been effected. Secondly, the member yesterday indicated that it was appropriate for him to resign from the position of chair of a committee of the House of Representatives so as to ensure that the deliberations of that committee would not be caught up in any controversy. So the two appropriate parliamentary responses have already been effected: firstly, a change to the register of interests and, secondly, a that resignation from the relevant House committee that the member chaired. The suspension of standing orders suggested by the Manager of Opposition Business would take the House into very risky and dangerous grounds, which previous occupants of high office, in particular former Prime Minister John Howard, have made crystal clear in the past to the House. We have two investigations clearly underway: firstly, an investigation by Fair Work Australia looking at the issues which relate to a registered organisation under the Fair Work legislation-namely, the Hospital Services Union; and, secondly, an indication yesterday by the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police that the New South Wales Police were contemplating whether an investigation was warranted in these circumstances. In that context, as the Leader of the House has outlined, it is very dangerous for the House to seek to inveigle itself into these matters. When the House comes to contemplate whether standing orders should be suspended or not, we need to look very carefully at it precedents and practice in the past. I regret on this occasion that what motivates those opposite is not respect for the standing orders, it is not respect for the practices and the procedures of the House, it is not respect for the presumption of innocence, it is not respect for the separation of powers and not seeing a merging between the parliament, the executive and the judiciary; it is crass political opportunism. Why would that surprise us? For the reasons that I have outlined, which reinforce submissions made by the Leader of the House. The House should not suspend standing orders on this occasion and should let those investigations underway or contemplated by the New South Wales Police take their natural course.",22
32,Mr FITZGIBBON,PAIRS," There are many things about the so-called new paradigm that make this chamber a more challenging place. Some of them are interesting in a positive way. For example, the additional time private members in this place have available to them to make important contributionsnot only about important matters of national policy but also about matters in their own constituencies. There are other aspects that are dragging this chamber down. You have to be asking yourself what those in the electorate are thinking about the behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition today. Some of those changes, of course, include the denial of question time, for example. These days we have fewer question times because of the Leader of the Opposition's propensity for stunts. Question time is the most important feature of this chamber. It is the period each day when members of the executive are held to account. The Leader of the Opposition does not think that is all that important any more. He prefers the sound bites; he prefers his 10 minutes on ABC television every day. He takes the view, and uses that opportunity to promote it, that if he cannot run the country then no-one can. If he cannot be in charge, he will simply wreck the place and therefore, by definition, wreck this country. This matter before the House today is about the member for Dobell. The member for Dobell is entitled to natural justice, the rule of law and the presumption of innocence. We should not sit here as a Star Chamber, particularly given that the Leader of the House and the Deputy Leader of the House have pointed out this has not been the approach of oppositions in the past and, of course, this was not the approach of former Prime Minister John Howard. It was not his approach when the member for Moreton was in trouble, it was not his approach when the member for Bonner was in trouble and it certainly was not his approach when the member for Bowman was in trouble. The Australian people expect high standards of us. They expect us to behave in this place, they expect us to maintain legal standards and they expect us to respect one another. More particularly, they expect us to run this place in the interests of the country. No-one on the other side-and I note so far we have not heard from anyone on the other side on this matter-could possibly argue that what is being played out in this place this morning is in the national interest. But the Leader of the Opposition sees another political opportunity. This is one of the great features of the so-called new paradigm. Every time the Leader of the Opposition sees an opportunity to muster 76 votes in this place, to wreck this place and to get his political message out there to promote his political message, he does so despite the consequences. On this occasion, the consequences are very grave indeed. They set a very dangerous precedent in this place. I note the Leader of the Opposition has chosen not to speak on this matter-not surprising-has chosen not to cast judgment on the member for Dobell-not surprising because he does not know what is around the corner. On many occasions, members of his party have been in trouble-sometimes guilty, sometimes innocent. The fact is you do not know until the court has come to its conclusions. In this case, Mr Thomson has a number of legal processes under way. He maintains his innocence. It is a very dangerous game for this place to sit as a star chamber, as I said, and to begin to cast judgment on those processes before they have run their course. I am not surprised that Leader of the Opposition is not on his feet this morning. I am not surprised the Leader of the Opposition has not cast judgment, very wisely, on the member for Dobell. Having said that, it is not surprising he has come in here once again and used this place as a way to promote his stance. They say people in glass houses should not throw stones. The Leader of the Opposition should be reflecting on that old adage. He should start looking behind him and think what might be sitting behind him now and in the future. Mr Thomson paid a heavy price yesterday when he stood down as Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics. (Time expired) Question put:  The House divided.

Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Bill First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Swan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
33,Mr SWAN,PAIRS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office The Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Amendment Bill 2011 establishes a new Parliamentary Budget Office as a fourth parliamentary department. This bill will enhance the credibility and transparency of Australia's already strong fiscal and budget frameworks. It will promote greater understanding in the community about the budget and fiscal policy. And it will ensure that the Australian public can be better informed about the budget impacts of policies proposed by members of the parliament. The bill is consistent with the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Parliamentary Budget Office and the government's response to those recommendations, which has been tabled in the parliament. The PBO will be independent and dedicated to serving the Australian parliament through the provision of nonPAIRS partisan and policy neutral analysis of the budget cycle, fiscal policy and the financial implications of policy proposals. Accordingly, the bill seeks to provide for the BILLS appointment of a Parliamentary Budget Officer who will be:  appointed by the Presiding Officers 2011 following approval by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit;  employed under conditions in line with provisions in the Auditor-General Act 1997; and  accountable to the parliament via the Presiding Officers, not to the executive. The functions of the Parliamentary Budget Office will be to:  prepare election policy costings upon request of authorised party representatives and Independent members of parliament;  prepare policy costings outside of the caretaker period upon request of individual senators and members of parliament;  prepare responses to budget-related nonpolicy costing requests of individual senators and members of parliament;  initiate its own work program in anticipation of client requests, including research and analysis of the budget and fiscal policy settings; and  provide formal contributions on request to relevant parliamentary committee inquiries. The election costing service of the Parliamentary Budget Office will be fully transparent and consistent with similar processes under the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998. The Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit will have oversight of the officer and the Parliamentary Budget Office in respect of its annual work plan, draft budget estimates and annual report. Amendments to the Charter of Budget Honesty This Bill also amends to the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998, so that all parties with at least five members in the parliament will be able to request election costings from Treasury and Finance under the charter. Previously this was a service currently only afforded to the government and the opposition. Independent members of parliament and parties with less than five members in the parliament will be able to have their policies costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office, both during and outside of caretaker periods. Amendments to other Acts This bill also amends the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976, and the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) to encompass the Parliamentary Budget Office and the officer. Conclusion The Parliamentary Budget Office is an important new institution that will further strengthen Australia's fiscal and budget frameworks. It will bring greater accountability and transparency to policy costings processes, particularly during election periods. And it will ensure that no party or member of parliament will have an excuse to avoid the scrutiny of its policy costings. It will ensure that the Australian public can be better informed about the costs of election policy proposals before they cast their vote at the election. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. National Health Reform Amendment (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time.",27
34,Ms ROXON,PAIRS," I move: That this bill now be read a second time. I am pleased to introduce this legislation which will bring into effect a key part of the government's national health reforms. The establishment of the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority will help to deliver a more sustainable, efficient and transparent health system for Australians. The introduction of this bill and, once enacted, the establishment of the Pricing Authority build on this government's strong track record in delivering health reform and will complement the work of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and the National Health Performance Authority. This bill is a direct result of the government's Council of Australian Governments agreement with all states and territories. The final terms of this agreement were signed on 2 August. There are a number of critical elements of these reforms-including 1,300 more sub acute beds across Australia, new targets and reward funding for emergency departments and elective surgery, transparent performance reporting through the MyHospitals website and the establishment of local hospital networks and Medicare Locals to improve local governance. In total the agreement will mean an additional $19.8 billion for hospitals over this decade from the Commonwealth government. $1 billion of this has already flowed to states for new sub acute beds and faster access for patients to services. The Commonwealth will be a true partner in the hospital system with a commitment to funding 50 per cent of the growth funding for hospital services. This will be fully implemented from 1 July 2017, with a 45 per cent commitment from 1 July 2014. This extra growth funding will apply to the increase in the cost of services-as well as the increasing demand for new services with the ageing of the Australian population. This commitment to growth is vitally important as the states would not have the capacity to fund the increasing cost of services on their own-particularly since the Commonwealth's share of hospital funding has been dropping over the past decade. This agreement will once and for ever put that to an end. This also creates a better incentive for the Commonwealth to invest in primary and preventative health services to keep people healthy and out of hospital. However, we were not going to agree to extra funding without critical reform. Currently, the Commonwealth provides funding for public hospitals through a block grant, negotiated through health care agreements. It is up to the individual states to determine how this funding is distributed across public hospitals and health services. The previous health agreement negotiated in 2008 provides $64 billion-which is a lot of money for the Commonwealth not to know what services are being funded, or the level to which they are funded. It is without significant levers to drive change and improvement across those public hospitals. So in this new health system there will be no more billion dollar block grants: no more blank cheques with no accountability for where that money is spent. This is why the reform agreement will deliver activity based funding across the country from 1 July 2012. Local Hospital Networks will be paid for the services that they actually provide. This is a major microeconomic reform that will help to increase the efficiency of services because the introduction of price signals will mean there is an incentive for hospitals to maximise the services they deliver at or below the efficient price. This will ensure that more services can be delivered locally. It will also be important for growing areas of Australia where often under the old system public hospital funding does not catch up with the demands that they have. And it is important for taxpayers that their funding is transparently reported, with funding according to services provided paid directly to local hospital networks through a new national health funding pool. This means Australians will know what is being bought through our massive investment in hospitals-what services are delivered, by which local hospital network they are delivered, and at what cost. The reform will also help to identify underperforming hospitals so that those causes can be remedied and the lessons of highly performing hospitals can be shared. The introduction of activity based funding was a key recommendation of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission. They concluded that the introduction of activity based funding would result in efficiencies of between $500 million and $1.3 billion-the equivalent of which would be hundreds of extra hospital beds. It is also of interest to the private health sector where activity based funding has been in operation for some time. Once in national operation across public hospitals there will be an unprecedented amount of information available. In the future this will help to consider smarter deployment of resources. This is a system that has been successfully deployed in Victoria and South Australia previously. However, a key difference from the system currently in place in Victoria and South Australia is that the price will be determined independently from government and health department bureaucrats. That means that the decision will be based on an assessment of the costs, facts and projections-rather than the political or budgetary interests of the government at the time. This is done by creating a new authority-at arm's length from all levels of government-to independently determine the efficient price. The authority will have strong independent powers: it will be for public hospitals what the independent Reserve Bank is for monetary policy. This is unprecedented for the public hospital system. The result will be a thorough and rigorous determination without fear or favour to governments. The government is confident that the authority will provide the health system with the stability and robustness that the Reserve Bank has provided for monetary policy for decades. And because the government will fund growth at a fixed percentage of the price that the pricing authority determines, the funding that hospitals will receive will not come down to the traditional blame game negotiations but rather what is actually needed to be invested. The umpire's ruling will be final and the Commonwealth will pay its share of growth on that basis. In deciding the efficient price, the authority will take submissions from the public, stakeholders and governments and then make its own determination of what is an efficient price. It will have regard to core principles such as access, clinical safety and quality, efficiency and effectiveness and the financial sustainability of the system. It will also consider the actual costs of delivering services in a wide range of hospitals and the expected changes in the costs of services for services from year to year. These reforms will help to ensure that hospital financing can dynamically adjust to:  shifting populations;  local demographic characteristics;  changing costs of delivering medical services from technological and clinical innovation; and  the complexity and location of delivering hospital services. The hospital pricing authority will also have a role in determining amounts for block funding, which will be used in hospitals that have low levels of activity and therefore would not be able to meet their community service obligations on activity based funding alone. This will provide important protection for rural hospitals, and for specialised units such as bone banks. The authority will also determine loadings to apply on top of the national efficient price-taking into account factors for legitimate and unavoidable variations in the cost of service delivery, including those driven by hospital size, type and location. The bill outlines specifically the functions of the authority that give effect to the COAG agreement. These include:  determining the national efficient cost and price for health care services provided by public hospitals;  developing classification systems for health care and other services;  determining adjustments to the national efficient price to reflect legitimate and unavoidable variations in the costs of delivering health care services;  formulating data standards requirements relating to public hospital functions and costs, to be provided by states and territories; and  providing assessments recommendations in regards to health care cost-shifting and cross-border disputes. The last point is particularly important as the Australian health system has never had a mechanism before to help resolve costshifting and cross-border issues in a definitive, long-lasting and nationally consistent manner. The membership of the authority is prescribed in this legislation. The chair will be appointed by the Commonwealth, the deputy chair appointed with the agreement of the states and territories, and seven remaining members appointed on agreement of the Commonwealth, states and territories. COAG agreed last Friday to two important appointments to this authoritythe chair, who will be Mr Shane Solomon, and the deputy chair, who will be Mr Jim Birch. Both have extensive experience in health administration and in activity based funding in Victoria and South Australia respectively. At least one member of the authority will have particular healthcare expertise in rural and regional areas. This will ensure the pricing authority understands the challenges that our country's expanses pose as we strive to deliver world-leading health care to all Australians. There will also be two important committees established under legislation-for clinical expertise and for jurisdictional representations. appropriate clinical expertise will be crucial to classifying hospital activity in clinically meaningful ways. Likewise it will be important for the authority to have dialogue and with representatives from the states, territories and the Commonwealth, particularly so that the implementation of the new arrangements happens successfully. or As specified in the COAG agreement, there will be an interim authority established as a Commonwealth executive agency. This will be until the permanent body is established as a statutory authority through this bill. Both the chair and deputy chair will start work with the interim authority to ensure a smooth transfer to the statutory authority once that starts operation. Consistent with COAG's original decision in April 2010 and reaffirmed in the National Health Reform Agreement, the pricing authority is to be established as an independent, statutory authority under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, providing assurance as to its operational autonomy and integrity. A chief executive officer will be responsible for the day-today management of the pricing authority, appointed by the pricing authority in consultation with the minister. The chief executive officer will serve on a full-time basis for a period of up to five years and is eligible for reappointment. In carrying out its primary functions, the pricing authority will inevitably come into possession of confidential material, including personal information. The bill establishes stringent safeguards to protect that information by creating an offence for unlawfully disclosing that the information. This recognises the potential seriousness that flows from improper use of Having such information. This legislation is already a bipartisan bill, as it comes to the parliament based on the COAG agreement reached with three states with Liberal premiers. However, the government also hopes that this can be a bipartisan bill in this federal parliament and that the Leader of the Opposition will see the importance of reforming the health system. We know that he is already a supporter of activity based funding. We know this because he said so just last week to the dinner of the Australian Medical Association in Parliament House: 'I'm pleased that we are moving towards a system of case mix or efficient price funding because in the end it's important that if people do more, they get more. We have to fund activity, which is what case mix funding does. Block funding tends to fund inactivity.' That was not the only time either. On 15 February this year he described it as 'a positive step', and on 5 August 2010 he said that he would implement such a system if he won the last election. However, that last pledge has to be taken with a grain of salt since he also promised to cut all the funding we had allocated to make this happen. But even earlier than that the Leader of the Opposition supported these reforms way back when he was the health minister, saying on 18 September 2007 it meant a 'focus on services rather than on global budgets'. So this legislation will be yet another test for the Leader of the Opposition. Does he support what he has been clear he thinks is the right policy or will he continue with his cheap and cynical approach of opposing all reform that this government works on? I hope for the sake of the millions of Australians who rely on public hospital services that he chooses the former. Patients, doctors and nurses have been waiting too long for the efficiency, transparency and proper funding that this bill will help to deliver. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned.

(8) Page 111 (after line 24), after Schedule 3, insert: Schedule 3A-Quarterly credits Part 1-Introduction 1 Definitions (1) In this Schedule: net refund assessment position: an entity is in a net refund assessment position for an income year if: (a) an excess remains after the entity's tax offsets for the income year are applied against its basic income tax liability for the income year; and (b) that excess is wholly or partly refundable. Note: The excess will be wholly or partly refundable if some or all of the tax offsets are refundable tax offsets. quarterly credit means a credit referred to in item 3. refundable R&D tax offset: an entity is entitled to a refundable R&D tax offset for an income year if: (a) the entity is an R&D entity that is entitled under section 355-100 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to a tax offset for the income year; and (b) that tax offset is a refundable tax offset. refundable tax offset means a tax offset that is subject to the refundable tax offset rules. relevant Acts means the following Acts: (a) the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; (b) the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; (c) the Industry Research and Development Act 1986; (d) the Taxation Administration Act 1953. total credits: an entity's total credits for an income year is an amount equal to the sum of the entity's quarterly credits for the income year. (2) Subject to subitem (1), an expression used in this Schedule that is also used in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 has the same meaning in this Schedule as it has in that Act. Part 2-Power to make regulations to modify operation of Acts 2 Regulations may modify operation of Acts to allow quarterly credits (1) The Governor General may make regulations modifying the operation of one or more of the relevant Acts for the purpose of achieving the objectives set out in this Part. The regulations have effect accordingly. (2) The Minister must recommend to the Governor General that the Governor General make regulations under subitem (1) before 1 January 2014. 3 First objective-quarterly credits in anticipation of refundable tax offset (1) The first objective is that an R&D entity will be credited by the Commissioner quarterly amounts for an income year if particular requirements are satisfied. Note 1: These requirements include the R&D entity satisfying eligibility criteria and other matters (for example, see Part 3). Note 2: Receiving quarterly credits may result in the R&D entity being paid an amount out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund (see section 16 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953). (2) Three of the eligibility criteria for a quarterly credit for an income year are: (a) that it is reasonable to expect that the R&D entity will be entitled to a refundable R&D tax offset for the income year relating to R&D activities conducted during the income year; and (b) if Innovation Australia makes one or more findings about the R&D activities or purported R&D activities-that those findings are positive; and (c) that the quarter begins on or after 1 January 2014. Note: There may be additional eligibility criteria (for example, see subparagraph 5(1)(a)(ii)). 4 Second objective-tax neutral consequences (1) The second objective is that, as far as practicable, there be tax-neutral consequences for an R&D entity receiving quarterly credits. Note 1: This objective is for the R&D entity to be in the same position, for income tax purposes, whether: (a) the R&D entity receives quarterly credits for an income year; or (b) the R&D entity does not receive those quarterly credits, and becomes entitled, after the end of the income year, to the refundable R&D tax offset for the income year. Note 2: Achieving this objective could include providing for a reconciliation and other integrity measures (for example, see paragraphs 5(1)(l) and (p) and subitem 5(4)). (2) For the purposes of subitem (1), disregard consequences relating to time. Part 3-Modified Acts may provide for certain matters 5 Some matters the modified Acts may provide for (1) As a result of the regulations, the collective operation of the relevant Acts may provide for any or all of the following matters: (a) eligibility criteria for including: (i) matters relevant to working out when paragraph 3(2)(b) is satisfied; and (ii) additional criteria to those mentioned in subitem 3(2); (b) how applications for quarterly credits may be made, including that: (i) applications must be in an approved form; and (ii) applications may be varied; (c) that Innovation Australia may make findings (the IA findings) about the activities that relate to an application, or proposed application, for quarterly credits; (d) how IA findings may be made, including that IA findings may be made on application in an approved form; (e) fees relating to applications for quarterly credits or applications for IA findings, and a method for indexing the fees; (f) how applications for quarterly credits or IA findings are considered (and approved or rejected); (g) that applicants for quarterly credits or IA findings are notified of specified decisions or matters; (h) that further information may be requested from applicants for quarterly credits or IA findings; (i) deadlines for doing things in relation to quarterly credits or the making of IA findings; (j) how amounts of quarterly credits are worked out; (k) that each quarterly credit is a credit the R&D entity is entitled to under a taxation law for the purposes of Part IIB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953; (l) that an R&D entity's total credits for an income year become a debt due to the Commonwealth at a specified time after the end of the income year; (m) that each of the following may be varied or revoked: (i) an approval of an application for quarterly credits, quarterly credits; (ii) an IA finding; (n) that internal review may be sought of specified decisions relating to quarterly credits or the making of IA findings; (o) that review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may be sought of internal review decisions relating to quarterly credits or the making of IA findings; (p) integrity measures; (q) that specified findings, decisions or requests made by Innovation Australia relating to quarterly credits are binding on the Commissioner (or vice versa); (r) that Innovation Australia is authorised to disclose to the Commissioner (or vice versa) information relating to quarterly credits or the making of IA findings; (s) matters of a transitional, application or saving nature; (t) matters of a consequential, ancillary or incidental nature. Note 1: Innovation Australia's findings (see paragraph (c)) could be made before, during or after the consideration of an application for quarterly credits. Note 2: Innovation Australia could make decisions on its own initiative or on application. For example, Innovation Australia could make a finding, or vary a finding or an approval, on its own initiative. (2) Without limiting paragraph (1)(a), examples of additional eligibility criteria include the following: (a) that it is reasonable to expect that the R&D entity will be in a net refund assessment position for the income year; (b) that the R&D entity has been assessed as being entitled under section 355-100 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to a tax offset (whether a refundable tax offset or not) for an earlier income year. (3) Fees referred to in paragraph (1)(e) must not be such as to amount to taxation. (4) Without limiting paragraph (1)(p), examples of integrity measures include the following: (a) if an R&D entity's total credits for an income year exceeds the amount of the R&D entity's entitlement to a refundable R&D tax offset for the income year-that the R&D entity may be liable to pay a penalty on the excess; (b) if the approval of an R&D entity's application for quarterly credits for an income year is revoked-that the R&D entity's total credits for the income year become a debt due to the Commonwealth at a specified time. (5) As a result of the regulations, the operation of the relevant Acts may provide that a disclosure referred to in paragraph (1)(r) may be made despite: (a) subsection 47(1) of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986; and (b) sections 355-25, 355-155 and 355-265 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953. (6) This item does not limit item 2. 6 Other matters the modified Acts may provide for (1) As a result of the regulations, the collective operation of the relevant Acts may make different provision for a matter for different kinds of entities. Note: For example, different provision could be made for members of consolidated groups or MEC groups. (2) As a result of the regulations, the collective operation of the relevant Acts may make provision for a matter by: (a) empowering a person to make a decision of an administrative character; and (b) if appropriate, requiring the person to make that decision in accordance with decision making principles. Any decision-making principles must be legislative instruments. (3) This item does not limit item 2. Part 4-Alternative constitutional basis 7 Alternative constitutional basis (1) Without limiting its effect apart from this subitem, the modified operation of each relevant Act as a result of the regulations has the effect it would have if: (a) subitem (2) had not been enacted; and (b) the relevant Act applied so that quarterly credits could only be worked out for an R&D entity that: (i) is a constitutional corporation; or (ii) has its registered office (within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001) or principal place of business (within the meaning of collective that Act) located in a Territory. (2) Without limiting its effect apart from this subitem, the modified operation of each relevant Act as a result of the regulations has the effect it would have if: (a) subitem (1) had not been enacted; and (b) the relevant Act applied so that quarterly credits could only be worked out in respect of activities, or parts of activities, conducted or to be conducted: (i) solely in a Territory; or (ii) solely outside of Australia; or (iii) solely in a Territory and outside of Australia; or (iv) for the dominant purpose of supporting core R&D activities conducted, or to be conducted, solely in a Territory. Part 5-Other matters 8 Varying the regulations The Governor General may vary, in accordance with subsection 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, regulations made under item 2. However, the Governor General must not repeal those regulations. Note: Those regulations may be varied on or after 1 January 2014. 9 Another way of dealing with transitional, application or saving matters (1) The Governor General may make regulations dealing with matters of a transitional, application or saving nature relating to the making of regulations under item 2. Note: This is another way of dealing with these kinds of matters. These kinds of matters could also be dealt with under item 2. That is, as a result of regulations made under item 2, the collective operation of the relevant Acts could make provision for some or all of these kinds of matters (see paragraph 5(1)(s)). (2) Item 7 applies to regulations made under subitem (1) in a corresponding way to the way it applies to the modified operation of a relevant Act.

Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with a requested amendment. Ordered that the amendment be considered at a later hour this day. Senate's requested amendment(1) Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (line 21), omit ""1 July 2010"", substitute ""1 July 2011"". Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",32
36,Mr ROBERT,BILLS," I rise to lend some brief comments on the government's Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. Whilst the coalition broadly support the bill, a range of concerns have been raised that coalition speakers have previously moved through. In its simplest form, the bill seeks to require carriers and carriage service providers to preserve the stored communications telecommunications data for specified persons when requested by certain domestic agencies; to ensure agencies are able to obtain and disclose telecommunications data and stored communications for the purposes of foreign investigations; and to provide for extraterritorial operation of certain offences. It will amend the computer crime offences in the Criminal Code Act and create confidentiality requirements in relation to authorisations to telecommunications data. The Joint Select Committee on Cybersafety's review of the bill came up with omit a range of recommendations in their final report. The committee took the approach of ensuring that thresholds that applied to domestic investigation are equally applied to foreign countries seeking access to Australian communications materials. One of the recommendations is that the Australian Federal Police guidelines on police-to-police cooperation in possible death penalty scenarios be tightened and only occur in exceptional circumstances and with the consent of the relevant ministers-in this case, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice and Minister for Home Affairs. A range of recommendations like that have Bill 2011 been put forward. Whilst we support the objectives of the bill and are broadly satisfied with the safeguards the Attorney General has put forward, we remain concerned and will watch with great interest to see if the legislation operates as the Attorney-General intends. There was a range of submissions to the committee, which complained that the convention did not contain sufficiently robust privacy and civil liberty protections to offset the increased surveillance and information-sharing powers it implements. The powers governing the real-time and collection and preservation of computer data were identified as being of some concern. However, powers for mass surveillance, such as wire-tapping and eavesdropping-the black arts-are not enhanced by this legislation because the amendments are limited to telecommunications legislation which still requires the issue of a warrant and does not extend to surveillance devices. I will make the point that, whilst the disclose coalition broadly support the direction of the bill, we believe that the government must continue to address the issue of cybersecurity not just on a legislative basis but also in terms of our capacity to protect. There is no question that the art of cyberattack is growing and is one of the most pervasive and fastest growing asymmetric means of attack, not only globally but within our region. The Cyber Security Operations Centre, when the then minister-who was two ministers ago; we are now on our third Minister for Defence in four years-launched it in May 2009, was broadly supported, the intent being to maximise the government's ability to detect and rapidly respond to fastevolving, aggressive cyber attacks. The original funding was something like $14 million. The intent was to have a continually staffed watch office and an analysis team able to respond immediately to cybersecurity threats as they are detected. The new centre was established in DSD, which incidentally possesses its own significant cybersecurity expertise. It would be good if the government would report back on exactly how the Cyber Security Operations Centre is going, how the 24-hour watch is progressing. It would be good to get some statistics on amount of asymmetric cyber attack the nation is experiencing. I am concerned, however, that the former head of the defence department's military cyber unit, Tim Scully, has called on the government to 'speed up its response to the emerging cyber arms race', saying more funding is needed for key civilian agencies. Those comments were reported by Dylan Welch, the Sydney Morning Herald's National Security Correspondent. It does bring to the fore the question: is the government doing enough to protect the nation from the threat of cybercrime and to ensure law enforcement agencies and others have access to the legislation they need able to do their job? In terms of the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill, I have taken the Attorney General at his word that the safeguards are place and the necessary provisions are indeed there in the legislation for the purposes of law enforcement, among others. But I would stress to the Attorney-General, who is sitting at the table, that we need to continue to stay at the forefront when it comes to cybersecurity and cyberlegislation to be able to defeat the asymmetric attacks that cybercrime and foreign espionage services will use in this space. It is fundamental that Australia maintains a leading technological edge in dealing with cybercrime and the threat it poses to our national security and our national interests.",37
37,Mr MCCLELLAND,BILLS," I thank all speakers for their contribution to this debate. I must say I was impressed by the substance of all contributions, and I think that does credit to all those who did speak. Just to address some of the matters raised by the member for Fadden, yes, certainly I can obtain for him some statistics from the Cyber Security Operations Centre. That is actually under the the responsibility of the Minister for Defence; nonetheless, it is a multi-agency task force and I will obtain details. In addition, the member for Fadden should be aware of the activities of AusCERT, the Australian Computer Emergency Response Team, based in the Attorney-General's Department. That essentially provides a one-stop shop for businesses and members of the community who have concerns about cybersecurity incidents. In turn, AusCERT can obtain expert advice from the Cyber Security Operations Centre. I would also advise the member for Fadden of the fact that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has established at its headquarters a to be dedicated cybersecurity espionage centre dealing with state-sponsored espionage. More broadly, I refer him and members generally to those matters that may affect our in constituents, and I would recommend as a first port of call, at least, the website Stay Smart Online, which www.staysmartonline.gov.au. The site has reference to a number of useful links in respect of the variety of circumstances that our constituents might confront in the cybersecurity area. I will comment on a number of other matters that members raised and address those issues, as well as some that have been reported in the media. With Australian families, businesses and governments conducting more and more activities online, cybercrime has already overtaken the drug trade as the most profitable form of crime in the world, and addressing this requires a consistent international framework that deals with the global nature of cybercrime by supporting cooperation between jurisdictions. I would like to acknowledge the outstanding work of all agencies in investigating cybercrime and, in particular, the Australian Federal Police. In addition, in response to matters honourable members have commented on in the course of the debate-for instance, the member for Richmond, who is at the table, and the member for Canberra in their contributions yesterday-I can report that at a recent meeting of Commonwealth law ministers, represented, I think, by 44 law ministers from around the Commonwealth, we were briefed on an international police operation that smashed the largest child sex abuse case in world history. After three years of investigation into a website entitled boylover.net, police agencies identified some 70,000 persons who were using that site, and the investigations resulted in the rescuing of some 230 children from situations of horrific abuse as well as the successful prosecution of a number of perpetrators. The successful police investigation into this site would not have been possible without cooperation between overseas agencies and their modern, online crime-fighting capabilities-and, I is should say, the voluntary cooperation of internet service providers and carriers. Child abuse is one aspect of cybercrimeunquestionably, its most abhorrent-but there are also other aspects that have the potential to affect any citizen. These include identity theft, online fraud or even using the internet to plan an organised criminal activity in the real world. I note, for instance, that evidence of electronic communication has been a feature of virtually all terrorist prosecutions in Australia. The Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime is in fact the only binding international treaty on cybercrime. It sets out the procedures that support cooperation among its signatories. By acceding to the convention, Australian law enforcement agencies will be able to access and share information necessary to support local and international cybercrime investigations. While many of the convention's obligations are already provided for in Australian law, the bill makes amendments that ensure Australia's full compliance with the convention. This will mark a significant step forward in our efforts to address the growing threat to the Australian community posed by cybercrime and the need to protect the community from internet abuses. For cybercriminals, our accession to the convention will mean that there are fewer places to hide. The bill has recently been considered by the Joint Select Committee on Cybercrime, which reported to parliament late last week. I note a number of contributors have referred to the report. I would certainly like to thank the committee members for their detailed work on the bill, particularly the chair, Senator Bilyk. I am currently considering the committee's recommendations and will respond in time for the debate to proceed in the Senate. In the meantime, the passage of the bill through the House is a significant step forward and a clear sign to our international colleagues that Australia is committed to pursuing its proposed accession. I appreciate the bipartisan support for that. Amendments to the Telecommunication (Interception and Access) Act, the interception act, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and the Criminal Code are needed to fully comply with the convention. Under the interception act, state and territory enforcement agencies can apply for a warrant to access communications held by carriers on their networks. However, carriers' business practices differ and they often mean that communications are deleted before agencies have the opportunity to exercise a warrant to obtain access. One carrier, for instance, deletes messages within 24 hours of a message's creation. Whilst other carriers have voluntarily provided assistance in the past-and I have referred to the international paedophilia law enforcement action-the bill amends the interception act so that an agency can formally require a carrier to preserve stored communications by reference to an individual or telecommunications service. This formality is desirable both from a law enforcement perspective and from the point of view of the service providers and carriers. The approach will mean that computer data, SMS messages, emails and communications stored by the carrier will remain available while ensuring the interception act remains technologically neutral. Importantly, access to these communications will continue to be and only be available by way of warrant. The bill will rely on Australia's existing mutual assistance frameworks to enable the improved exchange of communications and non-content data to assist in the investigation of certain foreign offences. The grounds for refusal in the mutual assistance act, including dual criminality and a ground to refuse assistance where the request would involve abuse of process or relates to a political offence, will continue to apply to requests for both access to stored communications and for access to prospective telecommunications data. Whilst not including new offences in the Criminal Code, the bill does expand the scope of the Criminal Code so that it can deal with criminal conduct outside of its existing limitations. The Criminal Code already contains saving provisions that ensure the continued operation of state laws in a number of areas. Importantly, the amendments contained in the bill will achieve Australia's full compliance with the cybercrime convention and support our effort to counter cybercrime. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify some concerns that have been raised relating to the proposed amendments. I note there have been concerns expressed that the government is going beyond its convention obligations in requiring the broad retention of telecommunications data. The explanatory memorandum clarifies, however, that preserving the contents of a stored communication will also mean that details such as the name and number of the senator other or recipient will also be preserved. This is to ensure that a communication can be linked to a person. The bill does not provide for a regime like the European Data Retention Directive where a carrier would be asked to retain information about every phone call, email or other types of communications passing over their networks. I think that point needs to be made. stored I note some have expressed concern believing or alleging that the bill does not sufficiently clarify what communications can be preserved and, as a result, it has been asserted that it may permit the preservation of all communications over a network. This is, in fact, incorrect. The reality is that existing interception act enables warrants in relation to a telecommunications service, that is, a phone number or an email address, not-I repeat not-an entire system. It is important that that point be understood. In relation to the concerns about the access of information by foreign agencies, it is also worth reiterating that assistance to foreign agencies is subject to the protections of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. This includes grounds for refusal to provide information where it would involve abuse of process or other injustice or would be otherwise contrary to the national interests or national security of Australia. The bill will not add any layers of bureaucracy. In fact, it will aid and improve cooperation between agencies in exchanging this electronic form of information. The mutual assistance act also includes grounds for refusal relating to the death penalty. The act states that a request for assistance must be refused where a person has been charged with or convicted of a death penalty offence unless there are special circumstances that warrant the provision of assistance-that is, section 8(1A). Also a request may be refused where it may result in the death penalty being imposed on a person: for example, where the request is made at the investigation stage-that is, section 8(1B). Those provisions are administered by me and the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice on a pretty regular basis. The bill also requires that information provided under the mutual assistance arrangements occurs only if it is used for the purpose for which it is requested and that it is destroyed once it is not necessary for that purpose. I also point out that significant protections exist to ensure the privacy and integrity of any information while it is preserved. The interception act contains a general the prohibition on the use or disclosure of information obtained by telecommunications interception warrant, stored communications warrant or authorisation to disclose telecommunications data. The interception act also contains protections about the existence of telecommunications interception and stored communications warrants. It will be an offence, subject to certain exceptions in the interception act, to use or disclose preserved information or information about preservation notices. In addition to this criminal mechanism, preserved information will also need to be managed in a manner that is consistent with the National Privacy Principles as set out in the Privacy Act. This applies to those provisions bound by the Privacy Act, including to manage the information securely. With respect to this matter, I reiterate that cybercrime is an offence that applies literally right around the world. It can be perpetrated by a computer system sitting in the northern regions of Siberia, to choose an example, as easily as it can be perpetrated by a computer at the nextdoor neighbour of any citizen. It applies in areas that include, most abhorrently, as I have indicated, the exploitation of children, but its tentacles extend to the daily lives of all citizens, including obviously the issue of identity theft. The figures that have been recently released show that literally every Australian has either some experience or knows someone who has experienced identity theft. Equally, the use of the internet and other electronic communications to perpetrate fraud is a growing element. In terms of our nation's national interests, research that has been undertaken in the United Kingdom shows that the United Kingdom is losing intellectual property each year via electronic extraction at the rate of about £16 billion. Similar research has not been undertaken in Australia. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired) Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",38
38,Mr MCCLELLAND,BILLS," by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be considered immediately.

(7) Schedule 1, item 1, page 38 (line 23), omit July 2010"", substitute ""1 July 2011"". (8) Page 111 (after line 24), after Schedule 3, insert: Schedule 3A-Quarterly credits Part 1-Introduction 1 Definitions (1) In this Schedule: net refund assessment position: an entity is in a net refund assessment position for an income year if: (a) an excess remains after the entity's tax offsets for the income year are applied against its basic income tax liability for the income year; and (b) that excess is wholly or partly refundable. Note: The excess will be wholly or partly refundable if some or all of the tax offsets are refundable tax offsets. quarterly credit means a credit referred to in item 3. refundable R&D tax offset: an entity is entitled to a refundable R&D tax offset for an income year if: (a) the entity is an R&D entity that is entitled under section 355-100 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to a tax offset for the income year; and (b) that tax offset is a refundable tax offset. refundable tax offset means a tax offset that is subject to the refundable tax offset rules. relevant Acts means the following Acts: (a) the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; (b) the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; (c) the Industry Research and Development Act 1986; (d) the Taxation Administration Act 1953. total credits: an entity's total credits for an ""1 income year is an amount equal to the sum of the entity's quarterly credits for the income year. (2) Subject to subitem (1), an expression used in this Schedule that is also used in the Income ""1 Tax Assessment Act 1997 has the same meaning in this Schedule as it has in that Act. Part 2-Power to make regulations to modify operation of Acts 2 Regulations may modify operation of Acts to allow quarterly credits (1) The Governor General may make regulations modifying the operation of one or more of the relevant Acts for the purpose of achieving the objectives set out in this Part. The regulations have effect accordingly. (2) The Minister must recommend to the Governor General that the Governor General make regulations under subitem (1) before 1 January 2014. 3 First objective-quarterly credits in anticipation of refundable tax offset (1) The first objective is that an R&D entity will be credited by the Commissioner quarterly amounts for an income year if particular requirements are satisfied. Note 1: These requirements include the R&D entity satisfying eligibility criteria and other matters (for example, see Part 3). Note 2: Receiving quarterly credits may result in the R&D entity being paid an amount out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund (see section 16 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953). (2) Three of the eligibility criteria for a quarterly credit for an income year are: (a) that it is reasonable to expect that the R&D entity will be entitled to a refundable R&D tax offset for the income year relating to R&D activities conducted during the income year; and (b) if Innovation Australia makes one or more findings about the R&D activities or purported R&D activities-that those findings are positive; and (c) that the quarter begins on or after 1 January 2014. Note: There may be additional eligibility criteria (for example, see subparagraph 5(1)(a)(ii)). 4 Second objective-tax consequences (1) The second objective is that, as far as practicable, there be tax-neutral consequences for an R&D entity receiving quarterly credits. Note 1: This objective is for the R&D entity to be in the same position, for income tax purposes, whether: (a) the R&D entity receives quarterly credits for an income year; or (b) the R&D entity does not receive those quarterly credits, and becomes entitled, after the end of the income year, to the refundable R&D tax offset for the income year. Note 2: Achieving this objective could include providing for a reconciliation and other integrity measures (for example, see paragraphs 5(1)(l) and (p) and subitem 5(4)). (2) For the purposes of subitem (1), disregard consequences relating to time. Part 3-Modified Acts may provide for certain matters 5 Some matters the modified Acts may provide for (1) As a result of the regulations, the collective operation of the relevant Acts may provide for any or all of the following matters: (a) eligibility criteria for quarterly credits, including: (i) matters relevant to working out when paragraph 3(2)(b) is satisfied; and (ii) additional criteria to those mentioned in subitem 3(2); (b) how applications for quarterly credits may be made, including that: (i) applications must be in an approved form; and (ii) applications may be varied; (c) that Innovation Australia may make findings (the IA findings) about the activities that relate to an application, or proposed application, for quarterly credits; (d) how IA findings may be made, including that IA findings may be made on application in an approved form; neutral (e) fees relating to applications for quarterly credits or applications for IA findings, and a method for indexing the fees; (f) how applications for quarterly credits or IA findings are considered (and approved or rejected); (g) that applicants for quarterly credits or IA findings are notified of specified decisions or matters; (h) that further information may be requested from applicants for quarterly credits or IA findings; (i) deadlines for doing things in relation to quarterly credits or the making of IA findings; (j) how amounts of quarterly credits are worked out; (k) that each quarterly credit is a credit the R&D entity is entitled to under a taxation law for the purposes of Part IIB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953; (l) that an R&D entity's total credits for an income year become a debt due to the Commonwealth at a specified time after the end of the income year; (m) that each of the following may be varied or revoked: (i) an approval of an application for quarterly credits; (ii) an IA finding; (n) that internal review may be sought of specified decisions relating to quarterly credits or the making of IA findings; (o) that review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may be sought of internal review decisions relating to quarterly credits or the making of IA findings; (p) integrity measures; (q) that specified findings, decisions or requests made by Innovation Australia relating to quarterly credits are binding on the Commissioner (or vice versa); (r) that Innovation Australia is authorised to disclose to the Commissioner (or vice versa) information relating to quarterly credits or the making of IA findings; (s) matters of a transitional, application or saving nature; (t) matters of a consequential, ancillary or incidental nature. Note 1: Innovation Australia's findings (see paragraph (c)) could be made before, during or after the consideration of an application for quarterly credits. Note 2: Innovation Australia could make decisions on its own initiative or on application. For example, Innovation Australia could make a finding, or vary a finding or an approval, on its own initiative. (2) Without limiting paragraph (1)(a), examples of additional eligibility criteria include the following: (a) that it is reasonable to expect that the R&D entity will be in a net refund assessment position for the income year; (b) that the R&D entity has been assessed as being entitled under section 355-100 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to a tax offset (whether a refundable tax offset or not) for an earlier income year. (3) Fees referred to in paragraph (1)(e) must not be such as to amount to taxation. (4) Without limiting paragraph (1)(p), examples of integrity measures include the following: (a) if an R&D entity's total credits for an income year exceeds the amount of the R&D entity's entitlement to a refundable R&D tax offset for the income year-that the R&D entity may be liable to pay a penalty on the excess; (b) if the approval of an R&D entity's application for quarterly credits for an income year is revoked-that the R&D entity's total credits for the income year become a debt due to the Commonwealth at a specified time. (5) As a result of the regulations, the collective operation of the relevant Acts may provide that a disclosure referred to in paragraph (1)(r) may be made despite: (a) subsection 47(1) of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986; and (b) sections 355-25, 355-155 and 355-265 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953. (6) This item does not limit item 2. 6 Other matters the modified Acts may provide for (1) As a result of the regulations, the collective operation of the relevant Acts may make different provision for a matter for different kinds of entities. Note: For example, different provision could be made for members of consolidated groups or MEC groups. (2) As a result of the regulations, the collective operation of the relevant Acts may make provision for a matter by: (a) empowering a person to make a decision of an administrative character; and (b) if appropriate, requiring the person to make that decision in accordance with decision making principles. Any decision-making principles must be legislative instruments. (3) This item does not limit item 2. Part 4-Alternative constitutional basis 7 Alternative constitutional basis (1) Without limiting its effect apart from this subitem, the modified operation of each relevant Act as a result of the regulations has the effect it would have if: (a) subitem (2) had not been enacted; and (b) the relevant Act applied so that quarterly credits could only be worked out for an R&D entity that: (i) is a constitutional corporation; or (ii) has its registered office (within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001) or principal place of business (within the meaning of that Act) located in a Territory. (2) Without limiting its effect apart from this subitem, the modified operation of each relevant Act as a result of the regulations has the effect it would have if: (a) subitem (1) had not been enacted; and (b) the relevant Act applied so that quarterly credits could only be worked out in respect of activities, or parts of activities, conducted or to be conducted: (i) solely in a Territory; or (ii) solely outside of Australia; or (iii) solely in a Territory and outside of Australia; or (iv) for the dominant purpose of supporting core R&D activities conducted, or to be conducted, solely in a Territory. Part 5-Other matters 8 Varying the regulations The Governor General may vary, in accordance with subsection 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, regulations made under item 2. However, the Governor General must not repeal those regulations. Note: Those regulations may be varied on or after 1 January 2014. 9 Another way of dealing with transitional, application or saving matters (1) The Governor General may make regulations dealing with matters of a transitional, application or saving nature relating to the making of regulations under item 2. Note: This is another way of dealing with these kinds of matters. These kinds of matters could also be dealt with under item 2. That is, as a result of regulations made under item 2, the collective operation of the relevant Acts could make provision for some or all of these kinds of matters (see paragraph 5(1)(s)). (2) Item 7 applies to regulations made under subitem (1) in a corresponding way to the way it applies to the modified operation of a relevant Act. (9) Schedule 4, item 1, page 112 (line 7), omit ""1 July 2010"", substitute ""1 July 2011"". (10) Schedule 4, item 1, page 112 (lines 9 and 10), omit ""1 July 2010"", substitute ""1 July 2011"".

39,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (10:41): I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 and Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 passed the House on 22 November 2010 and were introduced into the Senate the following day. The Senate has made amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 that will allow firms that will receive a refundable tax offset to apply to effectively anticipate that offset for quarterly credits from 1 January 2014. This will omit provide more timely assistance to those firms through increased cash flows. This is another omit example of the Gillard government acting to assist business. At this point, I would like to 28), omit acknowledge the assistance of the crossbench in advancing industry views on (line 17), omit quarterly credits. The amendments moved by the omit government show that the government has continued to listen to industry throughout the omit development process to frame the best program possible. The precise rules omit governing whether and how a particular firm will be available to receive quarterly credits omit and the most efficient and effective means of providing quarterly credits in general will be omit determined in light of the experience with operation of the new R&D tax incentive. Consequently, it is not feasible to include those details in these amendments, which 24), omit instead provide for the regime to be implemented for regulations. However, the amendments demonstrate the government's 2011"". clear commitment that a quarterly credits regime is to be part of the new R&D tax incentive. The government also moved amendments in the Senate to defer the start date for the new R&D tax incentive by 12 months such that the new tax incentive will apply for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2011. I share the disappointment of many businesses over the delay in starting the program, especially those small businesses who might have hoped that the program would start from 1 July 2010. However, businesses will now be able to plan their research and development activities with confidence, knowing their entitlement to access increased benefits is available from 1 July 2011. In relation to those amendments, the Senate has requested a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill, deferring its application by one year. I regime. commend these amendments to the House. Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (10:44): This legislation is yet another example of the extraordinary disconnect that government has with industry. The Assistant Treasurer spoke about delays. That is right. The bill was passed in last November. Why was it not presented to the Senate for debate and discussion until after 1 July this year? That is because the industry minister lacked the advocacy skills to convince the crossbenches, as they existed before 1 July, and the courage to argue his case. From the very first time these changes were mooted the government asked industry for input. There were discussion papers, there were drafts, and industry took time from its business activities to assist the government. In return for that goodwill, what did the government do? It utterly ignored the advice and the suggestions of industry. We know that the ideas for changes to the R&D regime did not come from the minister; they came from Treasury. We know; we were in government and they had similar proposals. They were in the bottom drawer and they wanted to pull them out because they claim that these changes would be revenue neutral, but in fact this is a revenue-raising measure. There is a fundamental problem with the changes that the government wants to pursue. Those fundamental changes will mean that, by restricting access to the regime, by changing the definitions, for example, as they relate to dominant purpose and feedstock, the very industries that this week this government says it wants to assist, says that it still wants manufacturing to survive, are going to be hardest hit. So the changes the government is making to the R&D tax regime will make it far more difficult for the manufacturing businesses, the manufacturing industry and the mining industry to actually access the new tax We have heard great praise from the other side about the crossbenchers-that is, the Greens. The Greens voted for this to pass in this the Senate, but do they actually understand what these changes are all about? Obviously, from their comments, they do not. We have had Senator Milne talk about those big, bad, large companies who dominant the scheme. Senator, it is not a competitive scheme; it is an entitlement scheme. Under the old regime, if you satisfied the requirements to be eligible, you got the concessions. Because a large company or a small company may have been eligible and successful did not preclude others from doing the same. A very important assumption on which the Greens have based their support for this bill is based on a lack of fundamental understanding of what the regime actually was, and at a time when the member for Melbourne, another member of the Greens, goes around touting the importance of R&D, one has to wonder what they are doing in supporting this legislation. When I was made shadow minister for innovation, industry and science, the very first topic, the very first issue, I was bombarded with from dozens of industry players, large and small companies across the country, was changes to the R&D tax regime. We would not be standing here opposing it if it were an actual improvement and industry across Australia told us it would be to their benefit. But they have told it is to their detriment, and the government have never been able to provide the modelling to show that their changes to the R&D tax regime would improve investment in R&D, would be good for small business. They cannot prove it because Treasury, in demanding this, never conducted the modelling. It is not their concern whether there is actual investment in R&D in the manufacturing sector, in the mining sector. The government cannot prove that this legislation is a good thing because that what they have been told by industry. They do not have the evidence. They have not done the modelling and the hard work. At a time that the domestic manufacturing industry is suffering all sorts of other economic issues, why would the government make it even more difficult for them to take the important steps of investing in new technologies?

40,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (10:49): I do not doubt the member for Indi's interest in R&D issues, but there a couple of points which I must briefly take issue with. There is a general discussion in her comments about consultation. The government consulted extensively in developing the new R&D tax incentive. It published a consultation paper and two exposure drafts of legislation. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee held a public inquiry into the bill. In addition, there have been extensive discussions with key industry representatives and advisers over the last three years. The government has made some significant changes where stakeholders have made constructive suggestions for improvement, as well as minor clarifying changes in response to concerns raised by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. Our budget announcement in 2009 us that followed an independent review of the National Innovation System, and most recently, between 11 July and 5 August 2011, interested parties were invited to review exposure draft regulations, the decision-making principles and their accompanying explanatory statements. Submissions were generally supportive of the regulations and decision-making principles, and in fact there were a total of 17 submissions received as part of the consultation from groups of various sizes, is not registered research agencies and firms. Again, I take issue in terms of manufacturing. The purpose of what we are doing is to help manufacturers minimise the risk involved in research and development. We believe that Australian firms that innovate are more productive and profitable than those firms that do not. Finally, whilst I noticed the member for Indi be very critical of the Greens, it begs the question why the Liberal Party preferenced the Greens ahead of the Labor Party in Melbourne if they are so concerned about the Greens. Question agreed to. Income Tax Rates Amendment (Research and Development) Bill 2010 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be considered immediately. Senate's amendment(1) Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (line 21), July 2010"", substitute ""1 July 2011"".",48
41,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (10:51): I move: That the amendment be agreed to. I refer the House to the words I spoke when speaking to the earlier amendments to the previous bill. This amendment is a consequential change to the income tax rates following the changes which have just been passed by the House. Question agreed to. Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,49
42,Dr SOUTHCOTT,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. Despite the way the Minister for Health and Ageing has portrayed this issue, I would like to state from the outset that the coalition has always supported sensible measures to reduce the rate of smoking in Australia. The coalition therefore supports plain packaging and the public health intent behind this proposal. The coalition will be supporting the plain packaging bills at the second reading stage. I would like also to remind the House of the strong track record the coalition has with regard to reducing smoking rates in Australia. Robert Menzies first introduced a voluntary tobacco advertising code for television in 1966. It was the Fraser government in 1976 that first implemented a ban on the advertising of tobacco products omit ""1 on TV and radio. In May 1989 the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, comprising representatives from all major political parties, unanimously recommended to parliament that tobacco advertising be completely banned. In opposition, the Liberal Party supported the prohibition on tobacco advertising in 1992. Dr Michael Wooldridge announced as health minister in June 1997 what, at the time, was the biggest ever national advertising campaign against smoking, with a federal government spend of $7 million over two years. It was the Howard government that reformed cigarette taxation from a weight basis to a per stick basis as part of the New Tax System in 2000. This was a recommendation of many health organisations at the time-ASH, the Cancer Council and the peak health bodies. It is something that I personally pushed for within the Howard government. Under the Howard government Australia signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in December 2003 and ratified this in October 2004. As Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I supported the ratification of the framework convention. The committee in its recommendations stated: The FCTC will have a positive effect on public health within Australia, and enhance Australia's leadership role in relation to tobacco control internationally. It was the Howard government, and Tony Abbott as health minister, who introduced the graphic health warnings on tobacco products in 2006. This constituted warnings of 30 per cent on the front of the pack and 90 per cent on the rear of the pack. These are the same graphic health warnings that the government is now expanding. In opposition it was the coalition who first proposed an increase in the tobacco excise in May 2009 a measure later adopted by the government. As recently as this year the coalition supported an amendment to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act to facilitate the banning of tobacco advertising on the internet. The results are there for all to see. The coalition presided over the biggest declines in smoking rates whilst in government. Under the coalition government the prevalence of smoking declined from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 16.6 per cent of Australians over the age of 14 by 2007. This was amongst the lowest rates of smoking in the world. The decline in smoking rates in Australia-a fall of 40 per cent for men and 44 per cent for women between 1989 and 2007-was among the biggest in the OECD. The fall in smoking rates amongst women was the biggest in the OECD. Only Sweden and the United States have lower smoking rates than Australia. It is worth noting that a time when Australia's smoking rates have been decreasing several European countries such as France and Germany have seen rises and Greece has seen a dramatic rise in smoking rates during the same period. So the message is: it is not all one-way traffic, there is no cause for complacency. But the suggestion that the coalition is soft on tobacco companies is just plain nonsense. Most public health experts in Australia understand that tobacco control has been a bipartisan affair in Australia for a long time. It should be a national goal to see the smoking rates in Australia fall below 10 per cent. I agree with the Preventive Health Task Force of 2009 which suggested this as a goal. This goal has been adopted by COAG. Australian researcher Melanie Wakefield has produced a number of research papers on plain packaging and its impact on consumer choice and consumer perceptions. Dr Wakefield's research has shown that tobacco packets with increasingly fewer brand design elements are perceived increasingly unfavourably. I believe that plain packaging will have an impact on the smoking rates within Australia. I believe it will reduce the number of people who take up smoking and it will increase the number of people thinking of quitting to take the next step and give it up for good. It is supported by the public health research. On tobacco control more broadly, it is very clear that for tobacco control to be successful it needs to be part of a comprehensive tobacco control strategy. There is no silver bullet. California demonstrates what a concerted tobacco control strategy can achieve. Its current smoking rates are below 10 per cent. I have looked extensively at the research on the effects of plain packaging and the effects of graphic health warnings on consumer choice at and behaviours. There is no doubt that plain packaging will have some impact on smoking rates and there is no doubt that increasing the graphic health warnings will have some impact. In fact, increasing the graphic health warnings is a measure that I support. My reading of the research is that increasing the graphic health warning on the front of the packet from 30 per cent to 75 per cent will have a much larger impact on reducing the smoking rate in Australia than plain packaging itself will. After all, when more than 80 per cent of the front and back of the cigarette package is graphic health warning and less than 20 per cent is plain packaged in drab brown what is having the greater impact on your eyeballs? We must remember that plain packaging is only one tool in the armoury in the push to reduce smoking rates in Australia. I want to turn to concerns with the bill. There are broadly three concerns which have been raised with the bill before us. There have been issues raised as to the legal grounds of this proposal, there have been comments made as to the impact on small business and small retailers, and there have been comments made as to the effect of plain packaging on illicit and counterfeit tobacco. I would like briefly address these issues. Firstly, on the legal issues, there has been much discussion as to the impacts of the plain packaging proposal on intellectual property rights and the use of trademarks. The minister's office has on many occasions assured the opposition that its legal advice surrounding their plain packaging proposal is robust and that they are on strong legal ground. We have accepted the government's assurance on face value. We have had to accept the government's assurance on this, as they have refused to release or provide us with a copy of their legal advice. It is, however, interesting to note that, despite claiming that they are on strong legal ground, they have drafted a 'get out of jail free' clause into the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill. The government claims that the bill has been drafted so as to avoid any potential for any acquisition of property on other than just terms, because to do so would be contrary to section 51 of the Constitution. However, the government must not be too confident in their drafting skills, as clause 15 of the bill provides that the bill would not apply to the extent that it would cause acquisition of property on other than just terms. What this means is that if this act is found to constitute acquisition of a tobacco company's trademarks on other than just terms then those trademarks can again be used but their size and location will be governed by the regulations. There have also been concerns raised that the government's proposal may violate article 20 of the TRIPS agreement and/or the 1993 Australia-Hong Kong investment treaty. Mr Chris Reid, the general counsel for the Department of Health and Ageing, stated during the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing's public hearing: … we are confident that, should proceedings of to that kind be taken, we would expect to win those proceedings. Once again, I would like to make it clear that we have accepted Minister Roxon's assurances that the government stands on strong legal ground with regard to these issues. I would like to turn to the impact on small retailers. One of the main reasons that plain packaging has not been adopted in any other jurisdiction has been the concerns of small retailers. The government's consultation of small business and especially small retailers has been lacklustre at best. Simon Cotterell, the assistant secretary of the tobacco control task force in the Department of Health and Ageing, stated during the health and ageing committee's public hearing: … we have agreed to meet and discuss this legislation with any retailer or retail organisation that has approached us. Unfortunately, you would have thought that, considering the expected impact on retailers, the department would have been a little more proactive in consulting with them. It is really easy to sit back and say, 'This is what we're doing; come and complain.' It was obviously too much effort to engage with small business and small retailers. It was too much effort to be proactive in the government's consultation of small retailers. Mr Cotterell also went on to say during that hearing that he was not aware that the minister had personally conducted any consultations with small business, and it seems as if this has been left entirely to the department. In fact, until the opposition started asking questions about this in estimates, the government maintained that its consultation with small retailers had been conducted by the Preventative Health Taskforce back in 2009-not even by the government itself. It was only when the coalition started asking questions about this in Senate estimates that the department actually went out and started consulting with small business. Based on the concerns raised by small business during the coalition's consultations, the coalition will be moving an amendment to the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill. This amendment seeks to address some of the concerns raised by small business and small retailers-the same concerns which have fallen on the deaf ears of this government. The Department of Health and Ageing have treated the concerns of small business as not core business for them. They have really been blind to the issues regarding small business and counterfeit tobacco, and the minister has been deaf to them. It seems as if the government have lumped these issues into the 'too hard' basket. The coalition's amendment seeks to allow the use of a tobacco company trademark on one of the two smallest outer surfaces of a cigarette carton. It is intended that this will aid in stock management concerns of retailers without undermining the public health impact of the plain packaging proposal. Cartons of cigarettes are used almost exclusively in retailers' storerooms and, with the exception of duty-free stores at airports, are almost never on public display. Cartons of cigarettes are very rarely purchased by consumers, and they are not carried around by consumers. It is hoped that this measure will go, at least in some small way, to helping retailers who will be inconvenienced by this measure. Turning to the issue of counterfeit tobacco, while Australia is generally seen as a country which has a low rate of illicit and counterfeit tobacco, there are concerns that plain packaging may increase the rate of illicit and counterfeit tobacco. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service annual report shows that over the last three years it has seized 743 tonnes of tobacco and 217 million cigarettes. The 2010 National Drug Strategy household survey report run by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and released last month claims that illicit tobacco in Australia is smoked regularly by 4.6 per cent of smokers. The World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control recognises that illicit tobacco is a public health concern. I do not for a minute accept the claims which have been made by the tobacco companies on the levels of chop-chop, illicit or counterfeit tobacco that we may see under this proposal; however, I do feel that the government has not adequately addressed this issue. The minister has always been quick to point out that Australia was the first signatory to the framework to implement the WHO recommendation for plain packaging. What the government never says is that Australia signed the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control during the the Howard government years, in 2003. Turning to the point of illicit tobacco, this is really the blind spot in the government's proposal. The government are inexplicably silent on the fact that article 15 and article 20 of the WHO framework recommend implementing a track-and-trace regime for tobacco products and strengthening the legislation against illicit trade in tobacco products. This is something that the government have just not done. The Department of Health and Ageing have regarded this as too difficult; they have not addressed it properly. They have not made any reasonable attempt to actually deal with the issue. Articles 7.2 and 7.12 of the Draft Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, as published by the World Health Organisation, also states that the obligations of each party of the FCTC shall not be performed by or delegated to the tobacco industry. Unfortunately, the government have completely ignored the WHO recommendations on the control of illicit tobacco, and as their own plain packaging of tobacco products consultation paper states, on page 14, they are proposing that any alphanumeric code markings can be used by tobacco companies on a voluntary basis. Not only is the scheme not compulsory but it runs contrary to World Health Organisation best practice in this area, and it runs explicitly against the World Health Organisation recommendations that you do not put the anti-counterfeit measures in the hands of the tobacco industry. WHO recommends that you do not put any track-and-trace measures in the hands of the tobacco industry. Even the tobacco companies requested, during consultation with the government, that a unique alphanumeric code on each pack be generated by a government-endorsed and licensed machine, a suggestion which the government subsequently rejected. The opposition calls on the government to implement a neutral track-and-trace system for tobacco products. This scheme could be managed by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service in conjunction with the Australian Taxation Office. Along these lines, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, on page 18 of their report on these bills, noted that there were: … a range of sophisticated anti-counterfeiting measures which could be adopted. So the opposition offers this as a constructive suggestion to the government and encourages the government to this. Do what the framework says; do not put your counterfeit measures in the hands of big tobacco but actually establish a neutral trackand-trace scheme. Look at what is done in California, in Massachusetts and in Canada. They are all jurisdictions which have an excellent reputation in the public health area. We encourage the government to move towards this because it is not good enough to implement plain packaging without having the counterfeit and illicit side squared off. In turning to the House of Representatives inquiry into these bills, these bills were referred off to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing with a wide-ranging brief to inquire into them. They were sent to this committee with an exceptional wide-ranging brief to avoid having to refer these bills to three different committees. The coalition did not want to hold up or delay this legislation, and that is why we did this. It is disappointing to note that the committee paid very little attention, none really, to the issues I have raised their earlier: the issues of the impact on small business, the legal standing, the IP issues and the issues around counterfeit and illicit tobacco. There was really no consideration of these. The committee focused solely on the health impacts of this bill, which are not the subject of any dispute or disagreement. Even the chair of the committee has suggested that there were issues that needed dealing with by other committees, and these are the same issues that the minister has ignored. What it comes down to is that it is really like an old-style Labor trade union demarcation dispute. They are saying, 'Look, it's not health; we will not deal with it.' It is really disappointing that the House committee has not done its job here. Let us be very clear: this is a health bill. The Minister for Health and Ageing has carriage of it. All of the material has been prepared by the Department of Health and Ageing. They have prepared the exposure draft and the discussion papers. The notion that it needed to be sent to three committees to get to the bottom of the legal, IP, small business and counterfeit issues is just a cop-out, but it is consistent with the approach that the government has taken from the very top, from the minister and from the Department of Health and Ageing. If the Department of Health and Ageing are competent to conduct the consultation with small business and to address the counterfeit, IP and legal issues then I think the health committee could have given this a go. From opposition I am not sure how robust the government's interdepartmental committees are or how robust the cabinet system of government is, because this was a bill that needed input in lots of different areas. It is fair to say that even members of the government feel that there have been times when the normal processes of government have ceased to function with this government. In this case, it will be small business who have not been listened to by this dysfunctional government. I want to touch briefly on the minister's conduct. It is disappointing, again, that the minister has sought to politicise the issues surrounding plain packaging and tobacco control for her own political gain, rather than taking an approach where the nation's health interests were at its core. She seems to have the attitude that no-one took any interest in tobacco control before she came along. If the minister had spent 10 per cent of the time that she spent talking about the coalition competently and properly implementing this proposal then we would be in a much better position today. The Minister for Health and Ageing has taken the attitude that if you do not agree with her 100 per cent then you must be in the pockets of the tobacco companies. This is puerile. Let us be clear: this is the first opportunity the opposition have had to vote on this issue, and we will be supporting the bill at the second reading stage. The minister has had a lot to say about the coalition but has been silent on her own relationship with big tobacco. What we now know is that her own relationship with big tobacco was much closer and cosier than anyone ever realised. The minister has never fully disclosed to parliament the extent to which she was involved with big tobacco. It was not all that long ago that she was going to the football as a guest of Philip Morris, and she has never been up front to the parliament about that. In the minister's Register of Members' Interests she has declared a number of football matches she has attended, but she has never declared the one she attended as a guest of Philip Morris. I would like to turn now to the drafting of these two bills. Given that the government have had more than two years since they first received the Preventative Health Taskforce recommendation to implement plain packaging, there has been no shortage of time to draft these bills. Considering that the government have, from the outset, claimed that they expected this proposal to be the subject of legal challenges, I would have thought that every possible care and attention would have been paid to the exact and proper drafting of these pieces of legislation. They released their exposure draft in April of this year, almost two years after the Preventative Health Taskforce handed down its recommendations. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills have reported on both of these bills, and I would like to take a moment to inform the House of their findings. In brief, they found a lot of problems with the drafting of these bills. The committee has pointed to clause 27 in the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 as potential inappropriate delegation. There was a concern from the committee that too many of the important details regarding the plain packaging proposal have been left to the regulations, rather than being included in the primary legislation. There was also concern raised that the various penalties in chapter 3 part 2 of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 may be considered to trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties due to the strict liability nature or the fact that of proof has been placed on the defendant for certain elements of the offence. Thirdly, clause 83 of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 partially abrogates long standing principle that there is a privilege against self-incrimination. The committee was concerned that the public benefit which is to be achieved may not decisively outweigh the resultant harm to the maintenance of civil rights. Finally, the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee also pointed out the presence of a Henry VIII clause within the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011-the second bill. I would like to make some specific comments on the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill. The first we saw of this bill was when the minister introduced it into the House on 6 July. It was not flagged or issued as part of the government's exposure draft or consultation paper. This is a bill which, until 6 July, was not seen as necessary by the Department of Health and Ageing or the minister. On this specific bill the opposition has four simple questions for the minister. When did she realise that there were problems with her Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill that were in the exposure draft from April? What were the problems that were identified with the exposure draft? The third question is: why did she decide not to draft legislation which trumped regulation in the normal way as has been done by every other minister since Federation? And, fourthly: is the purpose of the bill to clarify the interaction between the bill and the Trade Marks Act, as said by the Department of Health and Ageing's submission to the inquiry, or is it so the government can quickly remedy any unintended interaction between the new Tobacco Plain Packaging Act and the Trade Marks Act, which is in the EM, or is it to the onus ensure that applicants for trademark registration and registered owners of trademarks are not disadvantaged by the practical operation of the plain packaging the act-again in the explanatory memorandum-or is it, as the minister said in her press conference of 17 August, that it is an important component of making sure that the trademarks are still able to exist? The Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill has been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to consider the specific provisions within this bill, any issues they create and, ultimately, their constitutionality. The bill, as I said, contains what is known as a Henry VIII clause; it is in section 231A of the amendment. It is a clause that allows for regulations made by the minister under an act of parliament to override the act itself. In this situation, regulations under the Trade Marks Act could override the Trade Marks Act. It is exceptionally uncommon, and it goes against the basic legal principle that an act trumps regulations. These clauses are exceptionally rare, and only used as a last resort when there is no other option. That is not the case in this situation. The minister did have an alternative and the Department of Health and Ageing had an alternative: they could have drafted the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill properly. The coalition does not believe that this second bill is necessary for the government to implement their plain packaging. We think that this second bill is a sign that the government have botched the drafting of this bill. If the minister had taken the time to draft the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill properly, the trademarks amendment, using an extraordinary power, would not be needed. It is for these reasons that the coalition cannot support the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Packaging) Bill. It goes against long standing parliamentary convention and principles. Government speakers on these bills may use the precedent of a similar amendment to the Trade Marks Act back in 2000-to implement the provisions of the Madrid protocol-to argue that the current trademarks amendment bill before this House should be supported. This was the last time. I am aware of that a Henry VIII clause was used in this parliament. I would like to take the time to differentiate its use back then from the current situation before the parliament. The Trade Marks Amendment (Madrid Protocol) Bill 2000 was drafted to implement an international protocol: the Madrid protocol. It was a treaty to protect the rights of trademark owners, and it had a clearly defined purpose. My understanding is that it was used in this situation because there was no other alternative to implement our obligations under the international protocol. This plain packaging situation is completely different. The minister could have protected these rights by drafting her original bill properly. This is the reserve parachute-the escape hatch-if the minister has bungled the original bill. Hypothetically, this bill could be used to amend, to protect or to extinguish trademark rights for tobacco products, if the minister so chose. The department itself has said it is for 'any unintended consequence'. This is not a power we are willing to give this government. I reiterate that the coalition supports the packaging proposal and the public health intent behind it. We will be moving an amendment to the legislation. But we cannot support the second bill because the principle that legislation trumps regulation should be upheld. (Time expired)",49
43,Mr MITCHELL,BILLS," I rise to support the Gillard government's Plain Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the related trademarks amendment bill. As a legal long-term smoker, I believe that we must do everything we can to deter and prevent people from taking up the habit in the first instance. The facts are very clear and speak for themselves. Smoking is one of the leading preventable causes of death and disease in Australia. When the sickness and disability caused by tobacco are taken into account, as well as the tobacco related deaths, tobacco caused more disease and injury in Australia in 2003 alone than any other single risk factor. Tobacco itself is responsible for about 90 per cent of drug caused deaths and has had a $31.5 billion toll on both our economy and our society. Given these alarming facts, you would think that those opposite would immediately support plain-packaging legislation rather than remain silent for so long, maybe in fear of upsetting some of their biggest donors, because the Liberal Party are more than happy to take money from them. As they say, you choose your friends. We on this side of the House long ago ended that friendship. Unfortunately, for too long, smoking was more of a normal practice; in fact encouraged in days gone by. It was almost accepted by society because Big Tobacco, to give them credit, have been very clever and successful in selling and marketing their products as being no different from any others and with no-one stopping them. Think back to football, cricket, motor racing and many other events, right around the world: plainthere was the prominent advertising. For decades, cigarettes were placed alongside bread, milk and lollies in milk bars and convenience stores, with a visibility and presence equal to that of any other ordinary product. They were not treated as the harmful, deadly product that they actually are. By introducing this legislation we are seeking to end one of the remaining forms of advertising and promotion of tobacco products, which will no doubt ultimately result in fewer Australians, particularly young Australians, taking up the habit. Plain packaging is part of the range of measures the Gillard government is taking to discourage, deter and prevent smoking. We all know that packaging is a fundamental part of market strategy for all consumer goods, particularly cigarettes. As other forms of advertising for cigarettes have been banned over the years, the importance of packaging to big tobacco companies is all the more relevant and important to their business. Packaging establishes a brand identity and its purpose is to promote the goods both at the point of sale and while the product is being used, which for cigarettes generally numbers a few times a day. Big Tobacco knows this and on numerous occasions, for a long time, they have admitted how important the packaging of cigarettes is to their sales. John Digianni, a former cigarette package designer, said: A cigarette package is unique because the consumer carries it around with him all day a part of a smoker's clothing, and when he saunters into a bar and plunks it down, he makes a statement about himself. Similarly, British American Tobacco stated in 1978: One of every two smokers is not able to distinguish in a blind … test between similar cigarettes … for most smokers and the decisive group of new, younger smokers, the consumer's choice is dictated more by psychological, image factors than by relatively minor differences in smoking characteristics. British American Tobacco documents have stated that, given the consequences of a total ban on advertising, a pack should be designed to give the product visual impact as well as brand imagery. The pack itself can be designed so that it achieves more visual impact in the point of sale environment than its competitors. Philip Morris executives have also stated how important packaging was under increasingly restrictive advertising environments: Our final communication vehicle with our smoker is the pack itself. In the absence of any other marketing message, our packaging … is the sole communicator of our brand essence. Put another way-when you don't have anything else-our packaging is our marketing. Despite all the huffing and puffing, it is evident Big Tobacco knows that plainpackaging legislation will work. That is why you can ask: why would they kick up such a stink? They know that it will affect their profits. But, in our view, it will decrease the smoking take-up and increase the benefit to the nation's health, both socially and economically. Plain packaging will increase both the noticeability and the effectiveness of health warnings and messages by standardising cigarette packages which will reinforce the consequences of smoking. The passage of this legislation will prevent tobacco … it's advertising and promotion on tobacco products and tobacco product packaging in order to reduce the attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products to consumers, particularly young people. It will increase the noticeability and the effectiveness of mandated health warnings. And it will reduce the ability of the tobacco product packaging to mislead consumers about the harms of smoking. Plain packaging along with a range of other tobacco control measures will assist in reaching the performance benchmark, set under the internal COAG National Healthcare Agreement, of reducing the national smoking rate to 10 per cent of the population by 2018 and halving the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking rate. This bill is a world first and it sends a clear message that the glamour is gone. The Marlboro Man has ridden off into the sunset. No longer do we see Ronald Reagan advertising Chesterfield cigarettes. Nor do we find that living 'Alive with pleasure!' is part of Newport cigarettes-because after all, if smoking is not a pleasure, why bother? These were the things we had in days gone by, like the Peter Jacksons down the beach with all the happy young people. Most of those people are now old and probably coughing away as they go about their daily business because of the direct effects of cigarette smoking. The new packs have been designed to have the lowest appeal to smokers and to make clear the terrible effects that smoking can have on your health. Research has illustrated that plain packaging significantly reduces the attractiveness of cigarettes to young people. That in turn should translate into fewer young people taking up smoking and more young smokers attempting to quit. We know that quitting is very difficult option. I have had a couple of cracks at it myself, and I will again in the near future. But it is very, very hard. And that is one of the worse factors about smoking-how hard it is to quit. Plain packaging will increase the impact of health warnings and reduce the appeal of tobacco products to existing and would be smokers. Since taking office, Labor has implemented a range of measures to decrease the smoking rate, and smoking rates have substantially fallen. A large number of public health organisations and experts have expressed their support for plain packagingorganisations such as the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, the Public Health Association, the Cancer Council, the Heart Foundation and the National Stroke Foundation. The World Health Organisation has also welcomed this legislation, stating: … implementing the proposed legislation aiming to prevent tobacco advertising and/or promotion on tobacco product packaging will achieve its stated goals of: reducing the attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products to consumers … increasing the noticeability and effectiveness of mandated health warnings; and reducing the ability of the tobacco product packaging to mislead consumers about the harms of smoking. The World Health Organisation Secretariat goes on to say: … this legislation will contribute to curbing the initiation of tobacco use, reducing tobacco consumption, and decreasing incidences of relapse in those who cease to consume tobacco. … … … … the WHO Secretariat strongly supports the proposed legislation. But, of course, there are those who have finally caved into the pressure. The Leader of the Opposition for so long remained silent-the visionless man, as we have come a to expect, once again putting himself and his own interests before those of the nation. The British Tobacco charter states that political donations are given to 'influence the debate on issues affecting our company'. It is a nobrainer. The Leader of the Opposition loves his Big Tobacco-or anyone else who will donate to the Liberal Party, because he is not choosy where he gets his money from. Labor has introduced many other initiatives to reduce smoking and its harmful effects. These reforms have been undertaken in the context of the government's commitment, as I said earlier, to the target of reducing the smoking rate among the Australian population to 10 per cent by 2018 and halving the smoking rate among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. These targets are consistent with the national preventative health targets contained in COAG's National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health. In order to achieve these goals we have increased the excise rate applying to tobacco products by 25 per cent; introduced legislation for plain packaging of tobacco products; introduced legislation to impose restrictions on internet advertising on tobacco products, in line with advertising in all other media; invested $61 million towards a national tobacco campaign, 'Every cigarette brings cancer closer', and $27.8 million over four years for social marketing campaigns targeting high-risk and hard-to-reach groups, and invested $14.5 million towards the Indigenous Tobacco Control Initiative. We have invested over $100 million towards COAG's National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes and the Tackling Smoking measure and introduced the first ever Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander specific national anti-smoking television campaign, 'Break the chain'. We have provided $5 million in one-off funding to Quitline in 2009-10 and invested $102.4 million to support the provisions of nicotine replacement therapies and other quitsmoking supports through the PBS. We will continue to work in the national interest and not work to benefit Big Tobacco, which profits at the expense of Australians, the Australian economy and our health system. I noted earlier the opposition member talking about the retailers. I have spoken to many retailers in my electorate who have also raised the issue of cigarette plain packaging and the extra time it may take their staff. But every one of them. I have spoken to and asked, 'Have you had a look at ideas such as putting them alphabetically?' has seemed to agree that that would end the problem that has been raised in the email campaign across the nation. Putting them alphabetically would make it far easier for them to pick up, and would take half the time of what they are doing now. So there is a lot of support. Many retailers I have spoken to-many in our milk bars and local convenience stores-have said that these sorts of measures are important to decrease the rates of smoking. I notice the shadow minister laughing over there. I think that says more about his inability to do his work and his ineffectiveness and his lack of an understanding of the rates of impact of tobacco on health in general, which probably explains why he has not asked the minister a question in two years. Mr Dutton interjecting",56
44,Mr MITCHELL,BILLS,"You call it simplistic! Mate, you have not done a thing for two years. You have got cobwebs on your shoulders from sitting there.",59
45,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The members will stop interjecting across the table. Mr Baldwin interjecting,59
46,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"The member for Paterson, who would know that, should probably not interject.",59
47,Mr MITCHELL,BILLS,"I spoke about Philip Morris, in 1984, lamenting on the best way to address the decreasing sales of its flagship brand, Marlboro, in Australia and saying that the key problem seemed to be its lack of appeal to younger smokers and that this was the area that needed to be addressed. I think that is an important remark because it shows that it was advertising pushed directly to and aimed at encouraging younger smokers to take up the habit and line the company's pockets and the pockets of those opposite. Now I think it is time that the Leader of the Opposition stood up and actually stood for something and quit his dirty habit of taking tobacco donations. With that, I will conclude by saying that I think it is important that we commend this legislation to the House and wish it a speedy passage.",59
48,Mr DUTTON,BILLS," I want to firstly commend the contribution by shadow parliamentary secretary Southcott, who I think gave a very wise contribution to this debate. I want to address some of the issues which have been raised by others in this debate. Before I do that, I want-and I think it is important to do so in this process-to inform the public of how we got to this point. There has, for generations, been bipartisan support to address the issue of tobacco usage and uptake, in particular in Indigenous communities and among young Australians. That has matured over a period of time to a sensible point now where all stakeholders in this debate want to see a reduction wherever possible in smoking. We do not want to see increasing numbers of young people in particular take up smoking. They know cigarettes are a scourge and the health outcomes of smoking in a much better and a more informed way than did their parents or grandparents. One of the remarkable aspects of this debate has been how the government has, in its desperation, in its flapping about from one issue to the next, tried to politicise this issue. I agree with much of what the health minister has said about the aspirations of this government to reduce smoking rates. It was the aspiration of her predecessor, the current Leader of the Opposition, and health ministers back as far as any of us can recall. But what has been different in this debate has been the way in which the current health minister has sought to denigrate the position of others in this debate, both in this chamber and outside, and the way in which the health minister has sought to discount views which might differ even slightly from her own. It has been quite unhelpful because the opposition, when we were in government and as far back as the Fraser government, introduced measures and reforms in this area which we can be rightly proud of. The fact that smoking rates have declined over that period make us stand out in the western Dr world in how low our smoking rates are. I have said in this place and to the media before that it is unfortunate that this government would seek to try and distract from other deficiencies-and there are many-that they have on their books at the moment. This is a government that by anybody's account has been the most incompetent, the most unable to implement change since the Whitlam government. Ms Plibersek: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: I am wondering whether the shadow minister intends to talk about the legislation at any stage.",60
49,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Everybody at the table should understand that I get to determine if the member is being relevant. There has been some wide-ranging debate allowed on this bill but as he is the shadow minister with coverage of it, I hope he will get to the bill before the chair.",60
50,Mr DUTTON,BILLS,"The point is that the government has strayed away from the bipartisan position and it is sensitive about it, as the minister demonstrated at the dispatch box here.",60
51,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member for Dickson should not impugn the minister. He is treading into other dangerous territory there. I ask you return to the bill.,60
52,Mr DUTTON,BILLS,"Her actions speak loudly because this is the government that has taken an issue where there was bipartisan support, where there remains bipartisan support, and has sought to turn it into a political issue. I think that is unfortunate. It reflects poorly on the government. To try to use the issue of tobacco control or reducing smoking ratesas I say, an admirable cause-to distract from other political issues is without precedence and it is unfortunate. It is worth bearing in mind some of the outcomes in this area over the course of recent years. We do know that by 2010 the proportion of daily smokers in this country of 14 years and older had declined to 15.1 per cent. It was a downward trend that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare says began in 1995. From 1989 to 2007 smoking rates in Australia declined by 40 per cent for men and 44 per cent for women. They were among the biggest declines in the OECD. For women, it was the biggest decline in the OECD. It was under a coalition government that the biggest decline in smoking rates occurred. In 1995, 23.8 per cent of Australians were smokers. By 2007 that had declined to 16.6 per cent. In the early 1990s smoking rates were declining by seven per cent annually. That rose to 10 per cent from 1997 onwards. The biggest decline in cigarette sales in Australia, we now know, came in the years between 1998 and 2002. In that three-year period, total sales declined by 18 per cent and on a per capita basis by about 20 per cent. Many people rightly ask why did these significant outcomes come about? We know that in June 1997 the then Liberal health minister, Michael Wooldridge, began the biggest ever advertising campaign against smoking. In 1999 the Howard government reformed cigarette taxation from a weight basis to a per stick basis. This ended the unique situation where in our country tobacco companies could offer bonus cigarettes at discounted prices in packs of 25, 30, 40 or even 50. In 2006 then Liberal health minister, Tony Abbott, introduced the graphic health warnings on cigarette packets. In 2009 the coalition proposed a further increase in tobacco excise, perhaps the most effective means of lowering smoking rates. It took the Rudd government a further year to actually act. It is also important to recognise in this debate that the first ban on advertising of tobacco products on TV and radio was introduced by the Fraser coalition government in 1976. We know that only now in America are they moving to institute the type of graphic health warnings on packets of cigarettes that the Liberal government introduced in 2006. Australia does rank as a world leader. There are few nations who have lowered smoking rates further than our country has. We are considered a world leader and rightly so. Most of that action, as I say, was taken over the period of the previous coalition government. The point I come back to is that it was made in a bipartisan way and it was not used as some sort of a political axe to bang over the head of the then opposition, which is now in government. There has been a respectful debate up until this point. It is a very important point to make because there will be further actions that will be required both by this government and the incoming government, whoever that might be at the next election, to further reduce smoking rates. Like other health groups, interested stakeholders, people who have written to me and people who have expressed public support for the government's actions, we stand as one to make sure that we can reduce smoking rates and better inform consumers about the perils of taking up smoking. And we will continue to do that. I pledge in this debate that, if the coalition win at the next election, as health minister I will not use this as a political tool to assault the Labor Party. I accept that the Labor Party has, as does the Liberal and National parties, a bipartisan view that we should reduce smoking rates. I was the shadow health minister when we first recommended to the government, before they acted, to increase the excise on tobacco. We did that because there was clear evidence that increasing the price was a deterrent, particularly for younger people, to continuing or to taking up smoking. We will continue those good endeavours to make sure wherever possible we can reduce smoking in this country. I think that is evident in the speech also, as I mentioned before, of Dr Southcott. We have amendments to this bill that we think will strengthen the situation. The government want people to believe that they were the first to introduce measures to try to reduce smoking rates. I hope that today as part of this debate I have dispelled that myth. If you repeat a lie often enough, sometimes people will fall for it, but the fact is that Liberal coalition government had a proud record which led to significant declines in smoking rates. We will continue to support measures which do that. It is important that this government recognise that the Australian people have called their number. The Australian people understand that this is not a competent government in the area of health. This is not a government, regardless which area of health you talk about",60
53,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Dickson has been given a great deal of latitude and now he is testing my patience. I draw him back to the bill before us in this debate.,62
54,Mr DUTTON,BILLS,The point we make in this debate is that they do not have a good track record of implementing health policy.,62
55,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member is now defying,62
56,Mr DUTTON,BILLS,"This is a health policy, Madam Deputy Speaker.",62
57,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"Yes, and I would really like you to address the bill.",62
58,Mr DUTTON,BILLS,Can they effectively introduce these changes? How can that possibly be out of order? Can they introduce these changes? I am asking the question: how is that out of order?,62
59,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,You are not being relevant to the bill.,62
60,Mr DUTTON,BILLS,Asking whether they can implement this bill is not relevant to this bill?,62
61,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member for Dickson has actually not at any stage addressed the bill. I have allowed him 10 minutes of ignoring the bill to make his point.,62
62,Mr DUTTON,BILLS,"Plain packaging tobacco the is the bill we are discussing, Madam Deputy Speaker.",62
63,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"That is exactly right and you went through not the actual bill, the legislation before us, but the history of the Liberal Party. I thought that was reasonable. I have allowed that for 10 minutes. I think in the last remaining three minutes you could actually refer to the bill and the position in your amendments. I ask the member to return to the bill.",62
64,Mr DUTTON,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I am happy to forward you a copy of the Hansard post this to aid the process, but the point is, in relation to this bill: can the government get it right? Has the government got the right mix in the black letter law that it provides in this bill? Can the government implement policy in this area that is going to be effective? That is the question in relation to this bill that is before this House. This government has taken a particular course of action. I have outlined the history in this area of public policy. I do think it is incredibly important for the House to consider whether they believe this government can introduce the changes they have before the House. When we examine clause by clause every aspect of this bill, the questions need to be: is the government opening the taxpayers up to liability and will we see the reduction in smoking that we all want? These are the questions that need to be asked. It is rightly put in terms of the historical context because these are the very issues that the minister herself raised in relation to this bill. Why are we at a point in history where we do have low smoking rates? What has contributed to low smoking rates? These are issues which the minister has publicly discussed and which we have debated in this chamber and in the public eye otherwise. These are issues which are rightly addressed as part of this debate. Can the government get it right in terms of plain packaging? Is this the start of plain packaging, as the government might like us to believe? No, it is not. As I said before, when the graphic health warnings were introduced in 2006 by a Liberal government that was in effect taking away from the bling of packaging that young people saw when they purchased packets of cigarettes. This is a reasonable question to ask as part of this debate: do the Australian public believe that the Gillard government has the ability to introduce these changes, however well intentioned they may be? We want to assist in every way possible the government to reduce smoking rates. I think it is for the public to judge whether there is a case for the political way in which the government have conducted themselves in this debate. I think it has been a shameful exercise. We want to make sure when we get into government that we do not use the issue of reducing smoking rates, particularly for young people and in Indigenous communities, as some sort of a blunt political axe. I think all of that will be for the people to judge at the upcoming election. I ask people to judge this government by their performance so far.",62
65,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I speak in support of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. The contribution of the member for Dickson was the most innocuous and ineffective I had ever heard since I have been in this place. That goes to show how those opposite are all over the place on this legislation. I want to quote from the Australian Medical Association's submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing which inquired into these two pieces of legislation. They support what we are doing here and in their submission to the inquiry they said: There is evidence that attractive, decorative and brand-recognisable tobacco packaging is intended by the tobacco industry to sustain smoking and encourage its uptake, and that it does have an effect on these behaviours. The AMA, in its submission into these two pieces of legislation, makes it critically clear that it supports what we are doing with respect to banning all forms of promotion of tobacco products, including at the point of sale, and increasing the taxation on tobacco products, and it outlines the reason for it. This is important legislation, and I commend the AMA for its submission. I note also that there is a letter which has been sent to all federal parliamentarians from the Cancer Council and the National Heart Foundation, signed by 260 health and medical professors, again making this point: There is compelling evidence that plain packaging will make an important contribution to reducing the appeal of smoking, particularly to children and young people. The cigarette pack is the last remaining vehicle through which tobacco companies can legally promote their products in Australia and the move to plain packaging has been recommended by key health authorities such as the World Health Organization, the National Preventative Health Taskforce, the AMA, the Cancer Council, the Heart Foundation and the Public Health Association of Australia. And why are they all coming out in support of this? Because there are real consequences to the use of tobacco in this country. In my home state alone, each year nearly 21,000 Queenslanders are diagnosed with cancer and over 7,000 Queenslanders die of the disease. This legislation that is here is part a matrix of measures we are undertaking-a package that includes the 25 per cent increase in tobacco excise which we introduced on 29 April 2010. The use of tobacco has serious consequences to Australians. In terms of the social cost, it costs Australians $31.5 billion each year, including health costs, and on average people who smoke lose 10 years of life expectancy compared to lifelong nonsmokers. Sadly, we still have about three million Australians smoking; that is about 16.6 per cent of the population. Smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease among Australians, killing about 15,500 Australians a year. So there are good reasons why we are taking this particular measure. The legislation here regulates the retail packaging and appearance of tobacco products to improve public health and give effect to our obligations under the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It makes it an offence to supply, sell, purchase, package and manufacture tobacco products for retail sale, other than products and packaging that comply with the plain requirements. The effect of these amendments is to remove tobacco branding, logos, symbols and other images which may currently be used in such a way as to appear to glamorise the sale of tobacco. The only feature permitted to distinguish one brand from another will be the product name in a standard colour, position, font size and style. This is a world first and it will make a difference, we believe. It has the support of the peak bodies that I have quoted, and I will listen to them rather than to the tobacco companies, who have undertaken a campaign and organised front organisations to simply protect their profits. Why would we protect what they have to say? These companies of have a history of not actually accepting the responsibility that they undertake; also, they cannot be trusted with the facts-from Philip Morris hiding second-hand smoking harm for 20 years to the British American Tobacco website, in 2010, belatedly acknowledging worldwide health concerns about smoke causing harm but arguing that the relative risks were weak and did not reach statistical significance. They argued that non-smokers and smokers could be accommodated. So the health of Australians should not be left to the whims, wishes and aspects of health policies adopted by tobacco companies who are pursuing profits alone and simply want to get Australians more hooked on their addictive products. The reality is that we need to support our young people. If we are going to be involved in the National Preventative Health Strategy, making sure young people live healthy lives and protecting our future generations, we need to undertake measures such as the measures that are before this particular chamber. These bills enable the development of regulation to specify plain packaging requirements and the conditions for packaging appearance of products. Of course, there are sanctions. As I said before, they are based on penalties set out in the Competition and Consumer Act, and they are quite significant penalties. When I looked at those penalties and at the legislation, I found that they are very substantial. We hope they will act as a real disincentive to breach the law. There is an infringement notice provision that allows infringement notices to be issued to an individual or a body corporate susceptible of committing a strict liability offence. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars-penalty units of that nature-and I think that is warranted. The second aspect of this particular strategy we are undertaking deals with trademarks. This is where-despite the platitudes, the barking of banalities by the member for Dickson in relation to this and the soothing words-the true facts are that the coalition are all over the place on this and have been. I do not think they have ever had their heart in this particular reform. The Leader of the Opposition has never really been a believer in plain packaging; I do not think he really has. We know that he made this statement on ABC AM on 2 July 2009: One cigarette I am told does you damage but it does you so little damage. It is only when you start smoking a lot of cigarettes for a long time that it starts doing very serious damage. So hard hearted to your kids, not encouraging them to be their best, I think are probably much more serious parental crimes and so I personally would not get hung up on something, in my view, as trivial as smoking while the kids are in the car. The coalition have been all over the place. We saw the member for Dickson not even addressing the amendments that they are putting or this legislation, because they are playing every side of the street on this. You do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha. This legislation-particularly the second aspect, in relation to trademarks-makes it clear that if necessary the government will quickly remedy any interaction between the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Act 1995 that cannot be dealt with under the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011. The bill amends the Trade Marks Act to permit regulations to be made in relation to the operation of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011, including the power to deem conditions to be met and to make regulations that are inconsistent with the Trade Marks Act 1995. We have heard people opposite talk about this. They have made some comments that this would avoid parliamentary scrutiny, but any regulation made under the legislation could be disallowable by the parliament. It is not as if the coalition government did not do this when John Howard was the Prime Minister. They did this in relation to the Trade Marks Act in 2000. The coalition are just playing politics in relation to this. They claim we are, but in fact they are playing politics in relation to it. They used the same regulatory power when they were in government and now they are just simply showing their true colours by saying one thing to health groups and saying another elsewhere. They have not addressed this front and centre. These are important amendments because being they send a very clear message. Cigarette packs will now only show the death and disease that comes from smoking. Too many people have undertaken smoking, and I am sure all of us have been in rooms and places where smoking has simply diminished the enjoyment of that particular space. The new packs are designed to have the lowest appeal to smokers and to make it blatantly obvious of the impacts and consequences of use of tobacco on your health. These are tough tobacco advertising laws and we do not resile from that. We were the first signatory, the first country in the world to commit ourselves to making sure that we carry out the recommendations in relation to plain packaging. We do it on good national preventative health grounds. We believe it is appropriate to do this and we believe that the necessary legislative framework ought to be undertaken. I will end shortly in relation to this issue but I want to say that, whether it is by accepting donations from tobacco companies or it is with this sort of legislation, the coalition cannot be trusted on this. For them is it black or is it white-no. This legislation is important and they should support it. If they are going to be consistent with the Australian public and they are going to be consistent in this place, they should support it. They have no good record on which to stand. They have tried to make out that they do, but this legislation is particularly important",63
66,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," I am going to try to be consistent and ask the member for Blair to talk to the bill. If I gave it out to the member for Dickson, I am going to give it out to you as well.",66
67,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS,"Mandating packaging in a standard dark brown colour will be good for smokers in my electorate, in Ipswich and the Somerset region, because of the lower appeal. We should make sure that the health of Australians is promoted and that people do not die unnecessarily, contract cancer unnecessarily, get bronchial problems unnecessarily, have pulmonary disease unnecessarily or have heart problems unnecessarily. Anything we can do to improve the health and welfare of Australians should be what this parliament is all about. This legislation does it; this legislation goes in accordance with our target. We have a COAG national health agreement aimed at reducing national smoking rates to 10 per cent of the population by 2018 and halving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking rates. We should support that legislation, and the coalition should hang their heads in shame by playing every side of the street in relation to these bills.",66
68,Mr TRUSS,BILLS," I am a nonsmoker; in fact I have never smoked. I have never contributed a cent to the government's cigarette excise tax, and I certainly have no intention of starting. But I guess I have, like everyone in my age bracket, spent quite a bit of time in smoke-filled rooms-particularly before I came into this parliamentattending meetings and functions and just participating in everyday life. Of course in my early days in this parliament, whilst no-one smoked in this chamber to my knowledge, people certainly were able to smoke right through the rest of the building. There was something of a tortuous campaign over quite a lot of years for smoking to be ended in this place. I can still, I guess, smell the memories of Alexander Downer's cigars wafting down the ministerial corridor. Of course, he was not the only one. There is no doubt at all that the nation's attitude towards cigarette smoking and the perils of smoking has changed. Indeed, I spend a lot of time in my own office and in other places encouraging people to give it up. I suppose I am not coming from very sound ground in that I never had to give it up myself because, fortuitously, I never started. But certainly it is beyond question that cigarette smoking has damaged the health of many Australians and that the decline in cigarette smoking is welcome. Having said that, this legislation is not going to do anything to reduce the number of people who smoke. As a National I believe first and foremost in the freedom of the individual, and that governments should stay out of the lives of people where there is no clear reason to be there. Australians do not like to be preached at by politicians or anyone else about how they should live their lives. Sometimes when governments intervene the cures end up being worse than the problem. This legislation to impose plain packaging on cigarettes has been described by some as a 'nanny state initiative' and by others as a waste of time. My chief criticism is that for all the cost and the inconvenience it will not deliver any result. The government, like many previous governments, came into office promising to get rid of regulations: 'one in, one out' was the slogan at the 2007 election. Since Labor have been in office they have created 1,235 new regulations on the last score that I saw and they have repealed 58-another broken promise. This is another piece of regulation that is going to be added to the network; a piece of regulation that will achieve no worthwhile benefit. As proposed, the legislation represents a significant problem for small retail operators and consumers. It threatens to drive customers from small business into the arms of the retail giants. To cap it all off, as a smoking prevention measure, as I said before, it simply cannot work. Cigarettes are already required to be stored in places in shops out of the sight of the purchasers. They have to be in closed cupboards-doors in front of the cigarette displays-so people cannot see the cigarettes. They cannot see the packets, let alone what is on the label. So how is this change in the labelling arrangement supposed to deliver monumental reform? In the shops where people might be tempted to buy they cannot even see the packets-it is against the law to display the packets-so why does the colour of the label make a difference? I heard the previous speaker talk about decorative packaging attracting people to smoking cigarettes. Putting aside the fact that the packaging is not very attractive even now, and assuming that this takes a little attraction away from the decorative appearance of the packs, who would know? They are hidden at the key time away from the customer's sight. They are hidden behind doors so that they cannot be attractive to customers, no matter how decorative the packaging might be. Wrapping cigarettes in olive coloured plain packets has been proudly proclaimed by Minister Roxon as a world first. That is true, but it is also just Labor-speak for 'untested, untried, unnecessary and with no evidence that it can possibly work'. It is a smokescreen. It is legislation introduced simply to claim some moral virtue but which will achieve absolutely nothing. It is designed more to change the subject away from the carbon tax and Labor's other administrative failures-in particular, Labor's fundamental promise to deliver health reform. Former Prime Minister Rudd said that, if that promise could not be delivered, there would be a referendum to ensure that the Commonwealth had the powers to deliver it. But that has now been abandoned. The Commonwealth walked away from delivering any kind of reform in health. Its fundamental agenda in delivering better services in health to the Australian people has been abandoned, and instead we have this smokescreen, this issue put up in lights which will make no practical difference to people's health. It is only to take their minds away from Labor's failures on matters that really count. Smoking rates are falling and they will continue to fall, regardless of this legislation. It was the coalition in 1997 that launched what was at the time the biggest ever national advertising campaign against smoking. It was something people could see, something that made them aware of the issues; not something hidden behind closed doors in a retail outlet. It was the Howard government and Tony Abbott as health minister that introduced the graphic health warnings on tobacco products in 2006again, something that people could see, that was ever-present, when they chose to buy cigarettes and when they took a cigarette from the packet. Under the coalition government the prevalence of smoking fell markedly, from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 16.6 per cent by 2007. The decline in smoking rates in Australia, a fall of 40 per cent for men and 44 per cent for women between 1989 and 2007, were among the biggest in the OECD. The fall in smoking rates among women was the biggest in the OECD. So there have been significant achievements. There has been progress made in reducing cigarette smoking. From my perspective I say that is welcome. But this measure will make no contribution to actually reduce smoking rates that can in any way match the rhetoric that is being delivered by government members. The coalition have said that we will support the bill, but there will be provisos and some amendments because we are concerned that the interests of small retailers are protected. Specifically, the government's consultation with small business has been mismanaged to the point where small business has simply been shut out. Small retailers are concerned that the government's plain packaging proposal will adversely impact on their stock management and complicate their point-of-sale dealings with their customers, causing difficulties in differentiating between packets that look almost identical. The legislation will cause damage to small business. It will add to their costs, reduce their profitability and In June a report by Deloittes commissioned by the Alliance of Australian Retailers found that plain packaging of cigarettes would have a detrimental impact on service stations, convenience stores, newsagents and milk bars: 'It will result in creating a new competitive advantage in favour of the major supermarket chains.' This is not just an inevitable consequence to small business of a decline in cigarette smoking; this is an initiative which will actually result in people instead of buying their cigarettes from a small local retailer, buying them at the major supermarket chains. So the effect of the lost business for small retailers does not improve smoking rates; in fact it transfers more of the custom, more of the retail sales, to the large supermarkets. This study had really quite incredible figures: a staggering 61 per cent of tobacco consumers and 71 per cent of non-tobacco consumers would choose a supermarket over a small retailer rather than experience the inconvenient delays which this legislation will create at smaller shops. We know that small retailers are already doing it tough. They are mired in an industrial relations mess; they are forced to lay off staff due to inflexible hours and the work provisions that are legislated. They have the additional cost of a carbon tax ahead of them as well. Under the legislation as drafted, staff will be tied up with longer and more confused customers, not sure whether they have the brand they choose, wanting to bring them back later when mistakes have been made, spending extra time identifying which brand is which in a shelf where every packet is supposed to look as near as possible to the same. When your primary business driver as a small retailer is the convenience that you cost jobs. provide-you set yourself up as a convenience store-anything that impedes that valued proposition is a killer. In fact, according to Deloittes research, a 34 per cent reduction in tobacco customers coming through the doors of small retailers would see small businesses lose up to $1,880 a week; $942 a week for the average service station. Small business is the backbone of our economy. We rely on it so much in regional Australia and they are all feeling pinch. For many, this will be the straw that will break that backbone. These legitimate concerns did not even get a look in. These bills were both referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. The committee's sole focus was on the health impacts of the bill. Small retailers were denied the ability to even present their case. This has been a glaring fault in the government's entire process. Even the committee's chair, Labor's Steve Georganas MP, stated his view that those aspects of the bill should have been referred to the economics committee and the legal affairs committee. He noted that his committee did not have the scope to deal with retailers' concerns, so they were effectively shut out. Based on the concerns raised with me and my colleagues by small businesses during the consultations with them, the coalition is moving an amendment to the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 that will allow the use of the tobacco company trademark on one of the two smaller outer surfaces of the cigarette carton. That will at least help them with their stock management but will make no difference in drawing attention to the particular brand's trademark at the retail level. The intention is to help overcome these stock management concerns without undermining the public health intent of the packaging proposal. Australia's bulldust barometers are well tuned, and they have been red hot on this government for a while. In May of this year a Galaxy poll commissioned by the Institute of Public Affairs found that 55 per cent of Australians believe we have become a nanny state and that government intervention and control in our lives has gone too far. The figure in regional areas is 59 per cent. The poll showed that 73 per cent of people think governments are preoccupied with making the regulations and imposing control over people's everyday lives rather than focusing on more important issues such as genuine health reform, crime, education, roads and transport. Mr John Roskam, Executive Director of the IPA, said the polling showed that Australians are fed up with governments making rules that overly interfere with their lives. He said: An important part of the Australian way of life is the freedom to do what you like as long as it isn't hurting anyone else. But at the moment, governments are trying to create rules for everything from where I can fly a kite with my children, to how I can enjoy a quiet beer or what sort of food I can eat. I guess his complaint is illustrated by the latest new campaign to try and put health warnings and cigarette package-style labels on Australian wine. Imagine buying your bottle of Grange-a once-in-a-lifetime investment for most people-and having it all covered up with appalling pictures which make the product look unattractive. This government have never found a tax they do not love, and they have certainly added significantly to cigarette taxation. That was a tax grab masquerading as health reform. Today we have labelling regulations which are all designed to give the impression of health reform but in fact will do absolutely nothing to reduce the level of cigarette smoking in our country or to improve the health of the nation.",66
69,Ms ROWLAND,BILLS," I am very pleased to rise in support of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. I would especially like to acknowledge the Minister for Health and Ageing for her steadfast commitment to removing one of the last bastions of advertising and promotional opportunities for the tobacco industry, an industry that is responsible for a product which accounts for over 15,000 premature deaths in Australia every year-a product that is accountable for the single largest cause of preventable morbidity and mortality. We on this side of the House have a proud record of both instigating and supporting anti-smoking, which I would like to reiterate: in April this year, announcing plans to increase tobacco excise by 25 per cent; investing record amounts in anti-smoking social marketing campaigns; implementation of world-leading graphic health warnings; supporting smoking cessation tools and programs; and prohibiting tobacco advertising online. Smoking rates in Australia have not dropped by magic. It is as a result of such policies. This bill continues this government's commitment to reducing smoking rates and stopping the very preventable deaths caused by smoking. As outlined in the explanatory memorandum, this bill will prevent tobacco advertising and promotion of tobacco products in order to reduce the attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products to consumers, particularly young people; increase the noticeability of mandated health warnings; reduce the ability of tobacco companies to mislead through advertising; and contribute to efforts to reduce smoking rates. We all know why we must tackle smoking rates. Smoking is a known killer, despite what some members opposite have espoused in the past and, not so long ago in this place, interjected in some parts of this debate, with cries of 'Where is the evidence?' It costs the economy $31.5 billion per year in social costs, including $5.7 billion per annum attributed to absenteeism and a reduction in the workforce. This government is committed to reaching the COAG National Healthcare Agreement target of reducing the rate of smoking in the Australian population to 10 per cent by 2018. Currently, the rates of daily smoking are at around 15.1 per cent of those aged 14 or older. This bill will also work towards achieving article 11 of the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control: 'Packaging and labelling of tobacco products'. For the WHO FCTC to materialise, the drive and commitment which were evident during the negotiations will the need to spread to national and local levels, and I am confident this bill will contribute to delivering the WHO FCTC goals in our own local communities. I would like to turn to some of the main provisions of the bill. This bill will make it an offence to sell, supply, purchase, package or manufacture tobacco products or packaging for retail sale that are not compliant with plain packaging requirements. Chapter 2 of the bill sets out the detailed requirements relating to the packaging of tobacco products and the products themselves. The most notable effects of this bill will be that tobacco company branding, logos, symbols and other images that may have the effect of advertising or promoting the use of the tobacco product will not be able to appear on tobacco products or their packaging. So as to identify the particular brand or variant of the tobacco product, the brand name and variant name will be allowed on packaging in specified locations with a specified plain appearance. Information which is required by other legislation or regulations such as trade description and graphic health warnings will be allowed to appear. Many years ago as a young smoker, I smoked the glamour brands. I could not afford their jewellery, their clothes or their accessories but I could afford their smokes. So I speak from personal experience about the power of the brand for young people and for young women in particular. I want to talk about one of the main reasons that this is such an important policy area because it will save lives and it will save lives locally. As indicated by the Cancer Council Australia advocacy director, Paul Grogan: Plain packaging for tobacco products has the potential to be one of the most important policy measures in Australian history for reducing cancer deaths from smoking. The Cancer Council goes on: Reforms to how tobacco products are promoted through packaging are essential to reducing the unacceptable level of death and disability caused by smoking in Australia. I also have a special responsibility to support this bill due to an unfortunate reality that exists in my electorate of Greenway. According to the New South Wales Department of Health, Western Sydney where my electorate lies experiences some of the highest rates of avoidable deaths from causes amenable to health care. This research shows that in every 100,000 males under the age of 75, 77.4 per cent of them will die of avoidable deaths. A study undertaken by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2007 compared lung cancer mortality rates amongst people living in Western Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales and Australia. This study found that people in Western Sydney experienced the highest lung cancer mortality rate when compared to the aforementioned regions, and that is why, as I said, I have a special responsibility to my electorate to support these bills. The Blacktown Local Government Area also has the largest urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population in New South Wales and one of the highest in Australia with over 7,000 people making up 2.6 per cent of the population. This compares with 1.4 per cent for Greater Western Sydney and only 1.1 per cent for Sydney. Unfortunately, smoking rates among Indigenous Australians are considerably higher than those for the non-Indigenous community in every age group. I am confident this bill will work to reduce smoking rates and work to save lives in my electorate. This government has listened to the experts in social and health policy and formulated the most effective and efficient way to reduce smoking rates in Australia. In his paper entitled, 'Plain packaging' regulations for tobacco products: the impact of standardizing the color and design of cigarette packs, Dr David Hammond writes: The evidence indicates three primary benefits of plain packaging: increasing the effectiveness of health warnings, reducing false health beliefs about cigarettes, and reducing brand appeal especially among youth and young adults. Overall, the research to date suggests that 'plain' packaging regulations would be an effective tobacco control measure, particularly in jurisdictions with comprehensive restrictions on other forms of marketing. Becky Freeman and others writing for the journal Addiction in 2008 note: Plain packaging of all tobacco products would remove a key remaining means for the industry to promote its products to billions of the world's smokers and future smokers. Governments have required large surface areas of tobacco packs to be used exclusively for health warnings without legal impediment or need to compensate tobacco companies. This is how successful health policy is formulated; unlike some of those opposite we listen to the medical and health experts and develop policy accordingly. Recently, big tobacco has been running what I believe is an extremely disingenuous campaign around Australia decrying the government's reforms as an example of the nanny state imposing itself on the free will the Australian people. Even a select few on the other side of the chamber continue to champion big tobacco's nanny state crusade. We know that they are supporting this bill under duress and I am sure they think they are real heroes, but I would challenge them to watch someone die of cancer and then see how brave they are. As Professor of Global Health at the University of Melbourne, Rob Moodie, highlights: Closer to home, governments have been accused of nanny statism in the process of implementing all of our greatest public health reforms. Government interventions in health have resulted in some of the most outstanding public health successes. Interventions to reduce road trauma with seatbelts and speeding restrictions have saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians. In this debate I have heard arguments of so-called nanny statism going back to complaints about things such as random breath testing, which states introduced so that drunk drivers do not kill innocent people. We have complaints about designated smoking areas in licensed premises. The reason for that is that hospitality workers were dying of passive smoking inhalation. In the 1950s, 75 per cent of Australian men smoked. Since then Australia has prohibited tobacco advertising, removed sponsorships, restricted point of sale displays, and outlawed smoking in restaurants and bars and many public spaces. As a result smoking levels, as I have mentioned, are now below 16 per cent. But, I am sure the very select few on that side of the House who have spoken out against this plain packaging reform would decry all of these public policy successes as more examples of the hand of the nanny state impinging on our personal liberties. As well as running a nanny state scare of campaign, big tobacco has said, using a curiously illogical argument, that these reforms will not curb the rate of smoking amongst Australians but will still ruin small retailers because they will sell less product. The previous speaker quoted research by the Alliance of Australian Retailers, a body set up by big tobacco. You only need to go to their own website to see that. This is utterly disingenuous and you cannot have it both ways. The writing is on the wall for big tobacco. This bill continues this government's resolute commitment to improving the health outcomes for all Australians. It is not about impinging on the rights of the individual, but improving the health outcomes of the community. This bill sends a clear message that the glamour is gone-that cigarette packs will now only show the death and disease that can come from smoking. In closing, I would like to echo the words of the Minister for Health and Ageing regarding this debate: Big tobacco are fighting to protect their profits, but we are fighting to save lives. In the words of World Health Organisation's Director General, Dr Jong-wook Lee: The WHO FCTC negotiations have already unleashed a process that has resulted in visible differences at country level. The success of the WHO FCTC as a tool for public health will depend on the energy and political commitment that we devote to implementing it in countries in the coming years. A successful result will be global public health gains for all. I think it has been evident to see that this government does have this commitment to achieve the WHO FCTC goals and I am certain we will see public health gains for Australians overall. I am confident in the research. I am confident that this bill will reduce smoking rates in our community, especially amongst our younger people. If we all agree that smoking is undesirable, we need to do everything we can to curb people taking it up and encourage people to quit. That is why I urge all members to support this bill.",69
70,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. I follow on from the speech from the member for Greenway, which she just read out to the parliament. This is an issue which the Labor government and the Minister for Health and Ageing, 'nanny-state Nicola', have tried to make completely",73
71,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member will refer to the minister by her appropriate title. This is not debate that should be so willing.,73
72,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"I thank you for your advice, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I agree very much",73
73,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,It is not my advice; it is my ruling. It is the standing orders and I would like you to follow them. Thank you.,73
74,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"I will follow your ruling, Madam Deputy Speaker.",73
75,Mr Dreyfus,BILLS,Withdraw!,73
76,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"Coming from you, Minister? You complete hypocrite!",73
77,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Order! The parliamentary secretary at the table is not assisting.,73
78,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"This is a debate that we have seen the minister politicise, day in and day out for over three years, with promise after promise of legislation to be presented, and finally we see a bill. What a surprise that the Labor Party introduces a bill, the cognate bill, which we think is fundamentally flawed at law. That is why we will be opposing the bill. Who could trust this government to implement world-leading reform in the first place? This is an issue which I think the parliament should be very conscious of in considering both of these bills. As the shadow parliamentary secretary for health has indicated, the coalition will support the first bill, and we do so with some reluctance, it must be said-or I do so with some reluctance. I think that what we are seeing here is politics being played out through health policy. We are seeing the politics of the nanny state take over effective consideration of what reasonable health policy should look like. We just heard the member for Greenway, when reading her speech, moralising that we allegedly run scare campaigns in relation to a this issue and then suggesting that those of us on this side should watch people die of cancer. I think that highlights just what the Labor Party are seeking to do in pursuing this legislation. The coalition's record in relation to health outcomes on tobacco is second to none. The Leader of the Opposition, while he was the Minister for Health and Ageing in the Howard government, with the member for Sturt introduced substantial legislation in relation to graphic health warnings on labels. They implemented this measure and it was part of a series of measures that contributed to a reduction in the smoking rate in our population. It was an important health reform that informed people about the dangers they face if they consume tobacco, which today is still a legal product. What we are now seeing is a step into quite dangerous territory, where the state is beginning to remove the opportunity for people to make decisions about how they live their own lives. This is a step down a path which will lead to several outcomes which the health lobby and people who wish to see a greater role for government in people's lives will use as an example in their pursuit of their aims. Those include putting warning labels on alcohol products and removing people's right to choose what food they eat and how much time they spend watching television-how they live their lives in general. It is a difference between those who sit on this side of the parliament and those who sit on the other side. Those who sit on the other side of the parliament believe that the government has the right and the ability to tell people how to live their lives and how they should regulate their every minute of the day. They know better than the individual about how to go about living their lives! The fact is that people know, and have every opportunity to know, that smoking causes health damage. It causes cancer. It is written on the packet. It says on the packet: 'Smoking kills'. I have never smoked and have never been inclined to smoke, but I defend the right of people to engage in what is a legal practice. With this legislation, we have moved towards an area which raises questions. If the government are willing to do this, think this issue is so serious and want to take this action, why don't they simply ban the activity? Some people suspect that the vast amount of revenue that they receive from the sale of tobacco is probably the reason that they do not just ban the consumption of tobacco. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this is an issue which has been overtly politicised by those on the other side. Day after day, we have seen the minister for health come into this place and try and politicise political donations and make politics with this bill. Earlier this year and late last year, during question time on most days the minister for health would draw links and abuse the Leader of the Opposition for allegedly being in the back pocket of big tobacco. That went on until early June, when it was revealed that the minister for health herself had been keen on tobacco company donations. We know that because we have a copy of a letter from the now Minister for Health and Ageing, written when in opposition in 2005-and I understand there was a letter the year later, which was after the Labor Party had decided to no longer accept donations from tobacco companiesto Philip Morris, a tobacco company, seeking donations and seeking their company at a dinner to introduce them to none other than lives the member for Kingsford Smith. The now minister for health wrote: Once in every electoral cycle, I approach local businesses, friends and supporters asking for their support so I can continue the work I do as the federal Labor member for Gellibrand and the shadow Attorney-General. That was the role that she was in at that point. The letter continues: It is therefore my pleasure to invite you to support my re-election by attending an interesting evening in beautiful Williamstown. On this occasion I am pleased to introduce you to two distinctive members of the Labor front-bench team, Peter Garrett and Stephen Conroy. Peter Garrett really needs no introduction. Elected last year, Peter is known for his time as Midnight Oil's lead singer and his passion as a committed environmentalist. Peter is currently Labor's spokesman on arts and reconciliation. The letter then goes on to sing the virtues of having dinner with Stephen Conroy-virtues I do not see-and then says: I hope that you will be able to attend this evening to gain a new perspective on Labor, the West and the Bay and I look forward to your continuing support. That just bells the cat on the absolute and utter hypocrisy that we see from the Minister for Health and the Labor Party when it comes to this issue. The minister for health was also not averse to accepting corporate hospitality from tobacco companies, attending the tennis with Philip Morrisaccording to her own register of interest. This highlights exactly what this bill is all time. about-trying to be political with health policy, trying to create a political wedge, trying to create an issue that the Labor Party can campaign on against our side of politics. It says everything about the Labor Party when one of the bills that they have drafted raises serious questions in relation to whether it is even possible to implement itthat is, the bill relating to the trademarks amendment-which is the very reason that we seek to oppose it. This is not about standing up for so-called big tobacco; it is about standing up for the rights of people to live their lives the way they wish to. As I said, to ensure that this political campaign being run by the minister for health is no longer able to continue, we will reluctantly allow this bill to pass. We do not think it will make a difference to the health outcomes for people. We believe there are better and more efficient ways to ensure that people do not take up the habit of tobacco smoking. There are of course good health reasons not to take up the habit-and I certainly wish people would not. I have never seen the attraction in doing so, but I do see the attraction in ensuring that the spot government sits in our society is not one where it takes responsibility away from people to the extent that this government seeks to. I say again that this is the first stop on a bus which is designed to unduly restrict the way that people can live their lives. I think is a dangerous direction that the country is taking. It is sending the wrong signal to people. It is sending a signal that the government will fix your problem and the government will always make the decision for you. It is taking away people's personal responsibility. It is taking away the right of small business to be able to run their business at what is, in any event, a difficult This is the Labor Party writ large. It is about politics. It is about what their genuine view is about their role in people's lives. We take a different view. We take the view that people can be trusted to make decisions in their own best interest and that the government should not be there to tell them what to do and what not to do, except in the limited circumstances in which a state has a role in our society. This is, I think, a major step across that line. We raise issue with it. I am happy to raise issue with it. I am sure those on the other side will again link us to cancer, as the member for Greenway didnot that they ever run scare campaigns! Recently we saw the Minister for Human Services on the Q&A program accuse us of running scare campaigns and then turn around and say that we would not have any food left in the country in 20 years time. Of course, they on the other side do not run scare campaigns!",73
79,Mr Morrison,BILLS,And the Central Coast is going to flood.,75
80,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"That is right: the Central Coast is going to flood is another one. 'It is the all factually based information driven by a good health policy,' we heard from the member for Greenway, 'and if you do not support it you support cancer'. I do raise issues with this bill and I do raise issues with the direction that the government is taking in this respect. I am it sure those on the other side will try to make cheapjack politics out of that. But it is the role of this place to question the direction of government policy, and I do question the direction that we are taking in this country where we tell society, 'The government knows better than you.' We do not and we should not. People should be left to make their decision on the consumption of legal products. This is a legal product. If the government are serious about the rhetoric of the member for Greenway, they will ban its use. That would be a more consistent position for the Labor Party to take. To be lectured to by a minister who, quite frankly, is the biggest hypocrite in this debate-writing to cigarette companies and asking for donations at the same time as trying to get into this place, and abusing us and alleging that we are supporting big tobacco purely for donations-sums up exactly where the Labor Party are at. As I indicated, we will support the first bill, Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011-with reluctance, I do-and we will be opposing the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011.",75
81,Ms HALL,BILLS," It is no surprise to anyone on this side of the House that the opposition is opposing the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill and Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill, because the one thing that the opposition in this parliament does, and does really well, is oppose absolutely everything. I was very interested to hear the previous member's comment when he said that individuals need to make decisions in their own interest and they are the best people to take that decision, so when it comes to consuming legal products that individual can make the decision as to what they should do and no-one should interfere in any way. I would assume, then, that the member opposite would be opposed to random breath testing. He would believe that people can consume as much alcohol as they like and drive cars. It seems to me as though the member that spoke previously",76
82,Mr Briggs,BILLS,I bet you wouldn't go up to the clubs and say this.,76
83,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Shortland will be heard in silence.,76
84,Ms HALL,BILLS,"has a very skewed vision on this particular issue. I find it interesting that this legislation was referred to the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing by the Selection Committee. I know it was not referred to the health and ageing committee by any of the government members. Those people that referred the bill should make sure that they refer it to the right committee. They referred it to the health and ageing committee to look at the trademarks amendment part of this legislation, and the bill was referred to the wrong committee. I the think that those people that referred the legislation to that committee should take a little bit more care as to where they refer legislation. I will just share with the House the recommendations of the committee. It recommended that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill pass the House. This was a unanimous report of the committee. The chairman-and I know he is to speak in this debate-pointed out in his foreword that he would like a lot more care taken when referring legislation. The bill that we have before us regulates the packaging and appearance of tobacco products to improve public health and give effect to certain obligations under the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The bill makes it an offence to sell, supply or purchase packaging or manufactured tobacco products from retail other than products and packaging that comply with the plain-packaging requirements. These offences apply to manufacturers, packagers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers of tobacco packages in Australia who fail to comply with the plain-packaging requirement. The effect of the proposed requirements will be that branding, logos, symbols and other images of tobacco companies that can currently be used to advertise tobacco products will not be able to appear on the packaging, and the brand will be the only thing that can be put on the product. It will be of a standard colour, in a standard position, in a standard font size and in a standard size. We do have to look at why these steps are being taken by government. It is not to deprive people of personal liberty; it is a health initiative, and it has been widely embraced by people that work within the health sector. The Cancer Council in particular has embraced this legislation. The Cancer Council wrote to all members of parliament and sent a letter to us signed by 260 health and medical professors, and this was to all federal members of parliament. The crux of this letter is that plain packaging will make an important contribution to reducing smoking, particularly among children and young people. So it is designed to remove the incentive for young people to take up smoking. I think that that is a really good outcome if this legislation can prevent young people from taking up smoking, because smoking is exceptionally addictive. I was a smoker, and one of the hardest things that I have ever had to do was give up smoking. That was after my father died as a direct result of smoking. He had his voice box removed. He had cancer throughout his body. Yet I tried to give up smoking and I failed. It was because I was so addicted to this product. There are many people that do not finally succeed and that end up dying as a result of this habit. It is not only cancer; it is heart disease, stroke or a variety of other illnesses that are associated with smoking. In this letter that the professors from universities throughout Australia have signed, they point out that the cigarette pack is the last remaining vehicle through which tobacco companies can legally promote their products in Australia, and plain packaging will remove this legal avenue. I wonder whether I would have started smoking when I was younger if it had not been portrayed as such a glamorous thing to do-if there had not been the packets of cigarettes with bright pictures and sophisticated people on them. This legislation will remove that incentive for young people to be encouraged to smoke simply because of the packaging of those cigarettes. I am going to refer to a media release from the Cancer Council about the letter sent to all members of parliament from the 260 health professors calling for tobacco plain packaging. It points out that four former Australians of the Year, Professors Sir Gus Nossal, Ian Frazer, Fiona Stanley and Fiona Wood, are all signatories to that letter. They, along with other distinguished experts in health and medicine, support this initiative. We have the health professionals supporting the initiative; on the other side we have the tobacco companies and the opposition opposing it. So we have health professionals who have studied, who treat people suffering from the effects of smoking or who do research into the causes of the diseases I have spoken about who are supporting this legislation, while on the other hand we have an opposition who oppose everything and say that this legislation should not be supported, that we should leave it up to the individual to determine whether or not they smoke. This legislation does not impinge on that, but it does act as a disincentive for young people to take up smoking. The media release from the Cancer Council emphasises that there is 'compelling evidence' that plain packaging would make 'an important contribution to reducing the appeal of smoking, particularly to young people and children', a fact I highlighted a moment ago. If we can stop young people and children from smoking that is a fantastic step forward. I mentioned this has the support of the four former Australians of the Year. With scientists of that calibre supporting a health policy initiative such as this one, I urge members on the other side of this parliament to think about it seriously because they have an opportunity to make a real difference to health outcomes in this country. They can stand up and say: 'I supported legislation when it was introduced that is groundbreaking, legislation that is unique, legislation that makes Australia a leader in this field.' I do urge those on the other side of the House to think very seriously about it. Professor Ian Olver, a medical oncologist and CEO of the Cancer Council of Australia, said restrictions to tobacco advertising were 'a critical part of a comprehensive approach to reducing consumption'. He said plain packaging is: … a restriction to the last main legal avenue promoting tobacco products to young people in Australia. Those words are very powerful and very convincing. I say to members on the other side of this House: listen to those words, because you have the opportunity to join with us here in the parliament, vote in favour of this and put out a united message to Australians on this issue. A campaign has been conducted in which we have received postcards on this issue. But, to me, the most moving piece of correspondence I received was written by a woman who lived just outside my electorate. She was sitting beside the bed of her husband who had been diagnosed with lung cancer. He was recently retired, and when he retired they had had plans to go for a trip around Australia-they had actually bought the caravan. But he started to feel unwell, he visited the doctor and he was subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer. She said she sat beside his bed as he was dying and she said, 'I wish there had been plain-packaging legislation introduced when he was young.' She wished that he had not taken up smoking, because they would then have had their retirement years together and could have done all the things they had planned to do. I feel that says a lot in relation to this legislation. I will conclude by urging members on the other side of the House to join with us. This is a world first and it sends a clear message that the glamour is gone. Cigarette packets will now only show the death and disease that come from smoking. The new packs have been designed to have the lowest appeal to smokers. I ask those on the other side of the House to ask themselves this one question: why are the tobacco companies opposing this legislation? They are opposing the legislation because they know fewer people will smoke. That will end up in better for health for all Australians, so I urge all members to support this legislation.",76
85,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," I rise to make a contribution in this debate on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011 following on from the member for Shortland. Sometimes I think I am cursed to follow the member for Shortland. I do think this legislation is bad law. I do think there has been no credible argument made by the government about how plain packaging will reduce the rates of smoking in Australia today. For us as a parliament to take away the intellectual property of legal corporations and entities in Australia today, I think we ought to pause and think very seriously about the ramifications of doing this sort of thing by law. I refer to what has happened in Canada. Yes, it is true that we are the first jurisdiction looking at implementing plain packaging in the world today. Canada considered this in detail. Indeed, in 1995 when a health study When Packages Can't Speak: Possible Impacts of Plain and Generic Packaging of Tobacco Products appeared, the government considered it and there was some evidence that there would be some change. However, the Canadian government did not proceed with plain packaging. They believed it would violate Canada's international obligations with respect to intellectual property. Despite the fact that the government did not proceed with plain packaging following the consultation, during the parliamentary debate the Minister of State for Public Health, Gillian Merron, noted that the government chose in 2009 not to proceed with plain packaging because of lack of convincing evidence. I quote: No studies have been undertaken to show that plain packaging of tobacco would cut smoking uptake among young people or enable those who want to quit to do so. Given the impact that plain packaging would have on intellectual property rights, we would undoubtedly need strong and convincing evidence of the benefits to health as well as its workability, before this could be promoted and accepted at an international level Amen to that. She makes great sense. This is an intellectual property issue. We have a serious issue before us today because there is no proven evidence that demonstrates this will have any impact on health-none whatsoever, and certainly none that is convincing. Listening to the arguments of the Labor Party backbench is mind-numbing in itself. They do not speak about the impact of alcohol, which kills more people in Australia every day. They do not speak about illegal drugs. We all know, for example, that alcohol will increase the rate of loss of brain cells. Every single drink has a negative health impact on you, yet there has not been a word about it from the Labor Party. Listening to the ALP backbench trying to explain how their bad legislation will work is enough to make you want to go back to your office and lose some more brain cells, because I can tell you, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is badly thought out law. From any angle you approach this question, it is obvious that the government is engaged in a political question and not in a trade serious attempt to improve health in Australia today. They have railed here today against the nanny state campaign that is being run against them. But that nanny state campaign is tapping into something that I regard as extremely important going on in Australia today. The Minister for Health and Ageing is the flag-bearer of this government for the nanny state. I have a confession to make to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and to this House: I do not like the term 'nanny state'. I think 'nanny' is quite a benign term for what we are really talking about, which is the government's intentions and what is actually going on with its series of ill-thought-out and badly planned legislative responses to ... challenges that it faces. The alcopopsincreased taxation produced a spike in the sale of hip flasks in Australia by 21 per cent. The hip flask industry thought all its Christmases had come at once because this government came up with an ill-thought-out, badly proposed piece of legislation. How much money do we think has actually been returned to alleviate the impact of alcohol on health today? If we looked into that, I wonder what we would find. There is not any suggestion in this legislation before us today that there will be any impact on smoking rates. The member for Greenway said we need to do everything we can. If the government wanted to do everything it could to reduce the rate of smoking it could ban it today; it could outlaw this product. There is a good reason why governments will not do that and why the minister for health, who repeatedly talks about this product killing people, will not do that. It is because of the billions of dollars revenue collected from tobacco excise. In fact, there is a net benefit to the health system from the money collected from tobacco excise compared to the money expended in dealing with problems created by tobacco. I do not support smoking and I do not smoke myself, but I do support the rights of Australians to do what they like in their free time within the law. This is a legal product. I say to the member for Greenway: when we were on the stage together in front of 900 workers at the Blacktown Workers Club she should have made her remarks about tobacco plain packaging there. There was a woman there with a sign that said, 'I am an adult. I do not need the government to make my choices for me.' Amen to that, because that woman with her sign and those workers at the Blacktown Workers Club all know what is going on in this country today, and that is the scope of government is going too far, intruding into the lives of ordinary Australians. This legislation is another good example of it. How will plain packaging reduce the rates of smoking amongst young people? How will it do that? Nobody on this backbench has told us. Not one person has advanced an intellectual argument about how this will practically work. That is because there is not one. What we are doing in Australia today is paying committees and bureaucrats to determine if the drab and dull colours and the sizes of different words will have an impact upon people's choices in smoking, ignoring the fact that all cigarette packets are already concealed behind counters; they cannot be seen. There is no tobacco advertising in Australia today. This is not a strong, powerful step of a government committed to actually doing something about the rate of smoking in Australia today. Every member of this place knows this is a political of wedge by a government desperate to change the conversation from anything that is dragging it down, which is basically its whole legislative agenda. I have grave concerns about the provisions of this bill. When you look through it you see what it is attempting to do with the different divisions. Chapter 4 refers to powers to investigate contraventions of this act and chapter 5 refers to enforcing compliance with this act. I want to stand up for those small and independent retailers all around the country who will suffer the detrimental impact of this bill. Once again, we are going to ask the very small business sector to handle the consequences of a piece of legislation that is ill thought out and will not achieve its objectives. Once again, we stand in this place with a bad attempt to do very little on a question that will affect the ability of small business to survive. Not only do a lot of small petrol stations rely on trade from people coming into buy cigarettes, not only do small corner shops rely on them, but a lot of small businesses in this country get significant proportions of their trade from people who buy cigarettes. A study by Deloitte Australia, an independent accounting firm, shows us convincingly and compellingly that the outcome of this legislation will favour major retailers and major supermarkets. I take that very seriously. Once again, we are hurting the people at the very end of the equation that have nothing to do with this, the small business owner, with no thought and no regard to how their operation will continue to function. 'Just deal with it somehow' is the approach of this government to small business on every occasion. They do not take into account stock management, shrinkage, the loss of customers and the loss of business. The Alliance of Australian Retailers is perfectly right to stand up for itself and point out that this is a violation its rights. Once again, this is a government that has a careless and utterly thoughtless approach to the carnage it creates in the economy. The intellectual property questions relating to this bill will be tested at law. We have heard from tobacco companies that there will be legal action taken in relation to our WTO obligations-and, yes, Australia has world trade obligations. Of course these should be tested at law. It is not outrageous that a company having its intellectual property and branding removed by the government should take this to the court and have it tested. In fact, when you look at the Paris convention in 1883, the rounds that the WTO has been engaged in around the world, the North American Free Trade Agreement and all the different agreements and pieces of legislation around the world protecting intellectual property, you can see that this is a serious question for consideration. The government will have to demonstrate the efficacy of this proposal in court-and so it should under WTO obligations. No government should be allowed to rip property from any corporation or any entity without using just terms acquisition. I would certainly stand up for the right of any farmer, any landholder and any property owner in this country not to have a government remove their property rights, whether they be physical or intellectual property rights, without just compensation. Yet we are proposing a bill here today that is in effect removing the intellectual property rights of these corporations. If any member of this place thinks that this is the last time we will see such a proposal, I think that is complete and utter nonsense. I warn every member here: we will see this again. Not only will the public health lobby move on alcohol and fast food of if this works but they will continue to seek the removal of intellectual property rights from corporations engaged in the production of other things in our society today including fast food and alcohol. I do not believe that that is the right approach either. In fact, the whole public health mentality of the government is ridiculous. The health of people relates to individuals. There is the person's individual health; there is no such thing as the public health. You cannot give a pill to the public health. The Labor Party's backbench is trying to say that if we pass plain-packaging legislation cancer will be removed from Australia-a completely ridiculous contention. There is no law that we can pass in this place to remove cancer. There is no law we can move in this place to say life is not dangerous. There is no law we can move to prevent bad choices by individuals in our economy. There is no law we can pass saying, 'Be healthy.' There is no law we can pass in this place to say to people that they will live a long and prosperous life. In fact, we have a better system in Australia than many other free countries in the world and we ought to recognise that. People are free to make their own individual choicesgood ones and bad ones. Yes, I think we should pass laws where smoking impacts upon other people. Yes, of course we should do those things to ensure that when you engage in an activity you are not having a negative impact on someone else. But, if the government determines that this is a legal product, which it does; and if it determines that you are allowed to manufacture it, which it does; and if it allows the industry to employ, produce, manufacture, sell, distribute and, yes, then taxes it, it ought not to go in there and say, 'Well, at the end of the day we have got a committee of bureaucrats that the Minister for Health and Ageing has put together and they have decided that your product is going to be olive green, because we do not like your product.' That is exactly what has happened in Australia today. I do not think that is right. All the important decisions have been made. When the minister for health says, 'This kills people,' if she believes that this kills people, she should come in here and propose a law banning the product. That is what she should do. I have got news for the minister for health and the government: life kills people. Life is a dangerous activity. There are no laws that we can pass to prevent that. There are no laws we can pass to change that. And it is disturbing to listen to the Labor Party backbench attempt to articulate some sort of argument that having a drab colour on a packet of cigarettes will prevent cancer or stop people dying. There are all sorts of stories. There are very compassionate circumstances and they are very difficult for the people involved, but a law will not remove those circumstances from happening. It will not alter them. People will still make bad choices. People will still be free to do those things, and so they should be in a free society. There is a way to improve the public health and that is by making people responsible for their individual health choices, making them more responsible for their own health. That must be the focus of good and effective government policy. The criticism I have of this legislation is not that am pro smoking and want to see smoking everywhere in Australia today. It is that there is no evidence based policy that suggests that this will have an impact on the rates of smoking, yet that is the reason stated in the objective of this bill. There is no argument credibly advanced by those opposite that this is the approach that will stop smoking. There are ways of stopping smoking in Australia today, but of course this is the misnomer of Australian politics in this sort of question-the government is addicted to the revenue. The government wants this revenue and it cannot say no to it. That is the hideous position we are in in passing a law removing the intellectual property rights of corporations in this country, legal corporations providing legal products: because we cannot live with a situation where the government takes the revenue and will not do anything about a product that the health minister herself says is killing people. I will also say in the final minute that I have that I reject this approach to law. I think it is poor. I think that it will lead to more unintended consequences for small retailers, and small businesses all over the country will suffer as a result. It will not have a great impact on smoking at all. It now threatens to undermine one of the key tenets of the rule of law in our society today, and that is property rights. Without property rights, there is no law-that is a famous quote-and if we attack intellectual property rights in a way that is not justified, and I do not believe it is justified under this legislation, we are undermining the rule of law in our country today and in a way, I think, that will not produce better health outcomes for Australians. So why are we doing it?",78
86,Mr SYMON,BILLS," I speak in support of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. These I bills will enact important and, I say, overdue changes to the packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products. As a former smoker, I must declare my interest in this debate. I am fortunate that I gave up nearly 20 years ago and, although it makes me feel somewhat aged, I can report that at the time packet of cigarettes cost $2.28. I do not think that I would be in the same health I am today had I kept that habit up. Even when I was young and smoking, the effects of it, although I did not notice them at the time, were certainly not good for my health. Over the decades of health reform, tobacco advertising has been phased out and warnings against smoking now take up 30 per cent of the packaging. Tobacco companies now have one place where they continue to advertise and market their product, and that is the packet itself. Research has shown that the packaging style, logos, fonts and colours develop brand loyalty and market cigarettes for the tobacco companies. If I think back to when I used to smoke, I certainly think that was the case-I wanted the pack that looked the best. Now I am older and maybe some would say not wiser I have got over that and that is a good thing, but many more people need to. The Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 will prohibit the use of all tobacco industry logos, brand imagery, colours and promotional text on the retail packaging of tobacco products. The bill will mandate that the brand name is in a standard colour, position, font size and style and that the packaging will be a standard drab dark brown or olive colour. Again thinking back to when I used to partake, that was certainly not the case. I used to like the ones that in a gold packet. To take that away I think is a good driver. This bill makes it an offence to sell, supply, purchase, package or manufacture tobacco products in retail packaging that does not comply with the requirements. The Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011 seeks to amend the Trade Marks Act 1995 to enable regulations to be made in relation to the use of trademarks under the Tobacco Plain I gave up a Packaging Bill 2011. Importantly, this legislation will establish the first ever plain-packaging laws in the world. It is great to be first when it comes to public health. I know the world will be watching us. I think that is why we have had such interest from big tobacco in this debate. We are taking this action because tobacco is not like any other legal products. Ian Olver, the CEO of Cancer Council Australia, said: We have argued very strongly that tobacco is a unique product, because it kills 50 per cent of people who use it as it was meant to be used. The Australian Medical Association said: Tobacco smoke contains many poisonous chemicals, some of which cause cancer. It includes:  Nicotine-which is addictive,  Tar-which is the main cause of lung and throat cancer in smokers, and  Carbon Monoxide-which is a toxic gas that increases the risk of heart disease and other circulatory problems. Tobacco remains one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease among Australians. Every year tobacco kills over 15,000 people in Australia. On average, I know that that is 100 people each and every year per electorate, including my own electorate of Deakin. Let us do a comparison with the national road toll, a figure we see quite often in the news. It is good that we are came making progress and that number is down. The national road toll is now 1,368 deaths per year, which is less than one-tenth of the number of deaths from tobacco. This is where this debate sometimes gets a little lost. We are talking about 15,000 people. Of course, they are only the ones who die. There are also those who become chronically sick and require great amounts of funding to remain alive, whether they be in hospital or need treatment with drugs or surgery. That is something the Australian public pays for. That cost is estimated to be around $31.5 billion a year. It is obvious that the government needs to act to cut smoking rates and to cut the number of Australians dying from tobacco related health issues. These bills are part the government's antismoking action package aimed at delivering on our commitment to reduce the smoking rate to 10 per cent by 2018. It is also worth looking at the statistics in this debate. From the mid20th century to the mid-1960s, a majority of males aged 16 and over were smokers and around a quarter of females aged 16 and over were smokers. The latest 2010 National Drug Strategy household survey data indicates that in 2010 around 20 per cent of males and 16 per cent of females aged 14 years and over were smokers. Overall, just over 15 per cent of the population aged over 14 were smokers in 2010, or around three million Australians. On the basis of these figures, Australia has the third lowest overall prevalence of smoking in the world, behind Sweden and Canada. But, as I said before, we still have over 15,000 Australians dying from tobacco related disease each year and we as a nation have to do more to bring down the rates of smoking. The government has introduced a comprehensive package to reduce smoking rates. This Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill is just one part of the package. Other elements of the package include the 25 per cent increase in the tobacco excise in April last year that has seen tobacco sales fall by 8.8 per cent since that time, additional funding for the Quitline, more than $87 million in antismoking campaigns on television and through other mediums and in February this year for the first time the government introduced subsidies for nicotine patches on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That has been widely appreciated by many constituents who had been writing to me and calling me for a long time to get that included on the PBS. Certainly they are happy that the government is able to assist them to give up the habit. With nearly 100,000 scripts issued so far, I know it is of happening in other electorates as well. The initiatives I have listed are some help for smokers to give up and help reduce the substantial health costs of smoking to the nation. The Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill is the latest step in the government's fight to reduce rates of smoking in Australia.By restricting tobacco industry logos, brand imagery, colours and promotional text, the packaging will be drab, which is a good thing. The packaging of cigarettes and other tobacco products is the key way tobacco companies market their products, develop brand loyalty and create what they hope is a desirable image. One Philip Morris executive is reported as having stated: In the absence of any other marketing messages, our packaging … is the sole communicator of our brand essence. Put another way-when you don't have anything else-our packaging is our marketing. Tobacco packaging is a highly effective marketing tool in the sense that cigarettes have a high degree of social visibility. Tobacco researcher David Hammond notes: Unlike many other consumer products, cigarette packages are displayed each time the product is used and are often left in public view between uses. There is substantial evidence that the tobacco industry employs packaging as a means to influence sensory and health perceptions of tobacco products. Through descriptors such as light, mild and low tar on tobacco packaging, the industry conveys the false perception that certain brands deliver less tar, lower health risks and are less addictive than regular or full-flavour brands. The colour and design of packaging are used to impart false beliefs about both the taste and the risks associated with different tobacco brands. David Hammond argues: Different shades of the same colour and the proportion of white space on a package are commonly used to manipulate perceptions of a product's strength and potential risk. Consumers tend to perceive white and lighter colours as being healthier. Research shows that adults and adolescents in scientifically controlled studies perceive cigarettes in plain packs to be less appealing, less palatable, less satisfying and of lower quality compared to cigarettes in current packaging. Plain packaging would also affect young people's perceptions about the characteristics and status of the people who smoke particular brands. An expert panel commissioned by Health Canada in 1994 investigated the potential impact of plain packaging. Based on the mostly converging results of five different studies, the expert panel concluded: Plain and generic packaging of tobacco products … through its impact on image formation and retention, recall and recognition, knowledge, consumer attitudes and perceived utilities, would likely depress the incidence of smoking uptake non-smoking teens, and increase the incidence of smoking cessation by teen and adult smokers. The World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco recommends that parties to the convention introduce plain packaging. The WHO advises: Packaging and product design are important elements of advertising and promotion. Parties should consider adopting plain packaging requirements to eliminate the effects of advertising or promotion on packaging. Under the government's plan the only thing to distinguish one brand from another will be the brand and variant name in a standard colour, standard position and standard font size and style. This legislation will also ensure that the current graphic health warnings will increase the coverage on the front of the pack from the current 30 per cent to 75 per cent, along with updated imagery and warnings. The government's intention is that, rather than being a marketing tool, the pack will serve as a stark reminder of the devastating health effects of smoking. In 2008 the federal government commissioned the Preventative Health Taskforce to investigate reducing tobaccosmoking rates in Australia. Its report, released in September 2009, concluded that there can be no justification for allowing any form of promotion for this uniquely dangerous and addictive product including on the packaging. In line with the international evidence, the task force said that plain packaging would increase the impact of health warning messages, reduce the ability of tobacco companies to mislead consumers into believing that some cigarettes are less harmful than others, make cigarettes look less attractive and reduce the and appeal and desirability of smoking generally. Since the government announced its by intention to introduce plain packaging, the Department of Health and Ageing has undertaken targeted consultations with organisations representing large and small Control retailers, with cigarette and cigar importers and with the major tobacco manufacturers; and the government held a 60-day public consultation period on an exposure draft of this bill. Consultation on the exposure draft of the bill showed overwhelming support for the measures we are proposing, from public health groups both within Australia and internationally. In addition, we have listened to concerns raised with our proposals during these consultations-and legitimate concerns have now been taken up in the final bills that we are now debating. For example, to assist in identification of illicit tobacco products, manufacturers will be permitted to include certain design features that do not run counter to the public health objectives of the measure. The brand name will be permitted on the top, front and bottom of cigarette packs to assist retailers in handling tobacco products. All product manufactured in Australia will need to comply with plain packaging as of 20 May 2012. This will allow retailers time to restock and ensure that they have disposed of non-compliant product before 1 July 2012. To assist small-scale importers and small business with compliance, imported tobacco products will be able to be repackaged after importation into Australia. The response from the health community to this legislation has been very positive. The AMA fully supports the introduction of plain packaging. It said: The plain packaging will probably be a more effective deterrent for new and prospective smokers than established smokers. It should help prevent children and young people from taking up smoking in the first place by decreasing the attractiveness of the packaging. The Cancer Council of Australia said: Plain packaging for tobacco products has the potential to be one of the most important policy measures in Australian history for reducing cancer deaths from smoking. They also said: Plain packaging is predominantly about deterring young people from becoming addicted to tobacco products. But what has been the response of the tobacco industry? Unsurprisingly, they have done everything possible to stop this legislation, spending millions of dollars on TV and print media campaigns and serving legal action on the government. It all goes to show that they are very concerned about the positive effects that this legislation can have. The federal government's actions are being applauded by the medical community and will have a real impact on the take-up of smoking by young Australians. I think this is a wonderful measure and I certainly commend these bills to the House.",82
87,Mr ALEXANDER,BILLS," I rise to speak on the plain packaging in reinforcement of the coalition's position to support the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 with amendment, and to oppose the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. I speak on this legislation as someone with a lengthy track record on the promotion of health, fitness and preventative medicine, and also as a proud member of the Liberal Party that has a strong history and proven track record on the issues of tobacco control and reductions in smoking rates in Australia. The first tobacco advertising code for television was introduced by the very first Liberal Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, in 1966. Ten years later Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser introduced a ban on television and radio advertising of tobacco products. More recently, the Howard government, under the stewardship of the member for Warringah as Minister for Health and Ageing, introduced the graphic health warnings on tobacco products, reformed cigarette taxation to a per-stick excise, and presided over the biggest decline in smoking rates whilst in government. Under the coalition government, the prevalence of smoking by Australians over the age of 14 declined from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 16.6 per cent by 2007, giving us one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world and the largest fall in smoking rates amongst women across member countries of the OECD. I make this point in recognition of the Labor government's misleading public relations campaign to paint the coalition as soft on tobacco companies. After all, it was the coalition who first proposed an increase in the tobacco excise in 2009. This measure was soon adopted by the Rudd government. The issue of tobacco control is not a religious matter. The legislation being debated today does not call for a philosophical position on 'you are either with us or against us'. There is total agreement and acceptance in this place and in the broader community that tobacco products are bad for one's health. Cigarettes are an addictive product that will hasten the likelihood of an individual contracting one of our nation's greatest killers: heart disease, lung disease, emphysema or other related diseases. These facts are not challenged. This is not the issue that is up for debate today. Due to the addictiveness of nicotine, there is no silver bullet or magic potion that can make a smoker see the light, embrace the error in their ways and never smoke again. One of the enduring errors made by wellintentioned anti-smoking individuals and institutions is a lack of genuine empathy for the difficulties that a smoker faces in freeing themselves of this awful addiction. All smokers know the habit is bad for them and most of them wish they had never started. Changes to advertising and the addition of warning labels can assist in getting the message out and preventing the historic imagery of heroes, from Frank Sinatra to the Marlboro Man, with a cigarette in hand. These changes can affect those at the edges, but the science is also clear: long-term heavy smokers will smoke their cigarettes regardless of the colour of a package or the lack of pictures of their favourite stars doing the same. Throughout this debate we must keep in front of mind one essential fact: the manufacture, retail, purchase consumption of cigarettes are all legal activities regulated by the government and contribute considerably to the general revenue through excise duties. Until legislation passes this place to prohibit these activities, as we do with other recreational drugs, we need to be very careful that we do not infringe upon the commercial rights of those pursuing a legitimate business activity that we permit through regulation. Certainly, this activity may be demonised and lead to considerable financial burdens on society through our generous public health system but, regardless, it still remains a legal business activity. For those ardently campaigning for any form of punitive measure to be applied on the tobacco companies, a debate on prohibition may well be a more appropriate discussion, but that is not the issue at hand today. A reduction in smoking rates, particularly amongst our youth, is a worthy goal to which all members in this House aspire. The question that remains is whether this particular bill is the right means to that end. As I stated earlier, there is no silver bullet to resolve this question. It is clear from domestic and international experiences that a concerted focus and a well-managed tobacco control strategy is the best way to achieve this goal. There is a fear amongst many that this particular legislation measure, like so many other initiatives by this government, is designed more towards the attainment of headlines of action and creating the perception that something is being done on this issue rather than acting as a legitimate exercise in reducing smoking rates in our country. There have been some legal concerns raised about this bill. These relate to the legislation equating to an acquisition of and property on other than just terms, which contravenes section 51 of the Australian Constitution, article 20 of the Trade Related Aspects of the Intellectual Property Rights Agreement, to which Australia is a party, through to World Trade Organisation claims that 'The use of a trademark in the course of trade shall not be unjustifiably encumbered by special requirements.' There is dispute on whether this legislation is covered by the health exception to this agreement. Also, is it a violation of the 1993 Australia-Hong Kong investment treaty? The coalition has been forced to accept on face value the minister's claims that the legal advice surrounding her plain packaging proposal is robust as the government has refused to provide us with a copy of the legal advice on which these assertions are based. I can only assume that the government does indeed have some doubts about the robustness of the advice as they have felt it necessary to include a specific provision in this bill to assert that it will not apply to extent that it will cause acquisition of property on other than just terms under section 51 of the Australian Constitution. The government's consultation with small business and retailers on this legislation has been found to be lacking, despite the sizeable regulatory and administrative burden that this will put on these already struggling small businesses. I have received countless amounts of correspondence from affected retailers in my electorate of Bennelong who are concerned about the way this proposed legislation will impact upon them, from stock management through to the point of sale. The obvious concern with generic plain packaging is the difficulties this will give the small business owner in differentiating between packets that look almost identical. This issue has not been addressed by the government and will be assisted by the coalition's amendments, and I will talk to those shortly. Another valid concern arising from the change to plain packaging is the ease with which counterfeiters will be able to imitate and mass-produce generic plain packages. Australia has a strong reputation on customs and border control on this issue, with 743 tonnes of tobacco and 217 million cigarettes seized by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service over the past three years. Articles 15 and 20 of the World Health Organisation framework recommend the implementation of a track-and-trace regime for tobacco products. The government have failed in considering these issues in this legislation, instead preferring the tobacco companies to manage their own tracking of tobacco products on a voluntary basis, despite this being in contravention of articles 7.2 and 7.12 of the draft protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products which states that the obligations of each the party 'shall not be performed by or delegated to the tobacco industry'. In short, the government has completely ignored the counterfeit tobacco issue which will no doubt arise from this legislation. Any increase in counterfeit tobacco means less tax revenue to pay for the health implications that result from tobacco smoke and will therefore enable this to be yet another piece of government legislation that weakens our nation's economic position. As is common practice with controversial and far-reaching legislation like this, the two bills being discussed today were referred to an inquiry. Despite the coverage of these bills across a range of policy areas, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing was the only committee to inquire into this bill, and it focussed solely on the health impacts of this bill. The committee did not deal with the impacts on small retailers or on illicit tobacco, leading the chair of this committee, a government MP, to make a specific suggestion that concerns over these issues should see these bills referred to other committees as he did not have the scope to look into these matters. Instead of following the correct processes of inquiry and a reasonable amount of consultation and transparency with stakeholders and the opposition, the minister has instead sought to politicise the issues surrounding plain packaging and tobacco control for her own political gain. The Minister for Health and Ageing has promoted the attitude that if you have any concerns with this bill then you must be in the pockets of the tobacco companies. This is a reprehensible approach to take to a serious piece of legislation, and shows the disrespect that this government has for the intellectual capacity of the common voter. I can certainly declare from a personal perspective that the last time. I came even close to a financial or professional association with a tobacco company was when I competed in the Marlboro Australian tennis open during the seventies.",86
88,Mr Matheson,BILLS,You won that?,89
89,Mr ALEXANDER,BILLS,"Semifinals. According to this minister's definitions, that would place me squarely in the pockets of big tobacco. It is an irony not lost on me that this is the very same minister who was found to have accepted hospitality from big tobacco at the Australian championships just a few years ago. As I mentioned earlier, while the coalition is broadly supportive of the intention of this bill, the devil is always in the detail and we have some concerns to which we will be moving an amendment to improve this legislation. This relates to concerns raised by small business during consultations we have had with the industry-concerns that have fallen on the deaf ears of this government. The coalition's amendment to the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill will allow the use of tobacco companies' trademarks on one of the two smallest outer surfaces of a cigarette carton. This is designed purely to assist in the retailer's ability to effectively manage their stock that often consists of cartons piled high in a storage facility. This trademark or logo will not be added to the individual packets, which is what the consumer purchases, but just to the packaging of the carton that contains a number of packets, usually eight or 10. This is a common sense initiative. It is an improvement to this legislation that cannot be seen in any way to adversely affect public health and it should be supported by this government. The second bill, the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill, was first seen by the opposition when it was introduced into this House by the minister on 6 July. Contrary to standard practice, it was not flagged or issued as part of the government's exposure draft or the legislation's consultation paper that was released in April. As a result the coalition has referred this bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to consider the specific provisions, to investigate any issues they create and ultimately to consider their constitutionality. The grave concern we have for this amendment bill is contained in clause 231A, Open known as a Henry VIII clause-an exceptionally uncommon clause that gives the minister the power to override the legislation that has been agreed by parliament, through a regulation that requires no parliamentary scrutiny. In this particular scenario, a regulation made by the minister could override the Trade Marks Act, going against the basic legal principle that an act trumps regulations. In the past these clauses have only been used when there are no alternatives, and the lack of inquiry or scrutiny into this rushed legislation has certainly not convinced the coalition that is the case. The trade marks amendment bill is not a necessary piece of legislation for the government to continue to implement its plain packaging agenda, and therefore we will be opposing this particular bill. We do not agree with the minister being legislated to receive the power to alter or remove trademark rights in relation to the government's plain packaging legislation by overriding the Trade Marks Act through regulations. As I stated at the start of this speech on this very serious issue, both I and the coalition more broadly have a proven track record on the issues of tobacco control and reductions of smoking rates in Australia. Yet the importance of an issue should not be used as an excuse for the rushing through of ineffective and inappropriate legislation that is designed to create a headline rather than achieve a genuine outcome. The best legislative response on this matter will be one based on consultation with stakeholders, particularly with the retailers and small businesses directly affected, and not on a grab for power so the minister can fix her mistakes later on.",89
90,Mr GEORGANAS,BILLS," I rise to support the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011, but at the outset I will make some remarks regarding the member for Bennelong's speech on the referral procedure and the health and ageing committee's investigation into the inquiry. The members opposite are complaining that there was no proper inquiry or that the processes did not take place as they should have. I can only assume that those on the selection committee who referred the bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing would have been opposition party members. I say that because on this side of the House we were very satisfied with this particular bill, with its this implications and what its outcomes would be. A member of the opposition on that particular selection panel referred the bill to the House Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, so for the opposition to then complain that it did not look into the trade practices aspects when it is clearly a health and ageing committee-it is outside our parameters to have a look at other issues. The committee looked at this particular bill and held the inquiry to look into the impact on people's health, and that is exactly what it did. If members of the opposition are going to criticise the inquiry perhaps they should have a good look at themselves and go through the processes to work out what they want to achieve before they refer bills to standing committees. I have to say standing committees in this House have always had something of a non-political nature. People to have worked very well together from all sides of politics to achieve good outcomes. What we are seeing is the politicisation",90
91,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Child Care,90
92,Mr FRYDENBERG,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to call on the Gillard government to immediately reinstate federal funding for occasional child care. Occasional child care is a low-cost, high-impact program providing critical support for 9,000 children and their families in Victoria alone. In the Boroondara area, which virtually mirrors the boundaries of my electorate of Kooyong, eight community centres, including in Camberwell, Canterbury and Hawthorn, stand to lose more than $92,000 in funding, directly affecting vital services provided to 800 children under the age of six. Occasional child care is fundamentally different to kindergarten or normal child care. Services are typically provided by community houses as with the Take a Break program in Kooyong, where parents and guardians can access affordable care, providing them with just a few valuable hours of respite to undertake other activities in either the voluntary or paid sectors. The coalition has promised to provide the $12.6 million necessary to fund occasional child care, and the Gillard government should waste no time in reversing its inexplicable decision to cut support for this vital community program. Gyari, Mr Lodi Gyaltsen",90
93,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," We have an important visitor in the parliament today: Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, who is the special envoy of His Holiness the Dalai Lama based in Washington, DC. Mr Gyari was born in Tibet in 1949 and fled with his family to India in 1959. Realising that Tibetans needed to publicise their struggle the world, he became an editor for the Tibetan Freedom Press and founded the Tibetan Review, the first English-language journal published by Tibetans in exile. Mr Gyari was a founding member of the Tibetan Youth Congress, an organisation of over 10,000 members. He was subsequently elected to the Tibetan Parliament in Exile and became its chairman. In 1988 he became senior cabinet minister for the Tibetan foreign ministry. Mr Gyari will address the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade this afternoon. I am sure fellow committee members will be interested in the fact that, in addition to his current role as special envoy for His Holiness, Mr Gyari is the lead Tibetan negotiator for discussions with the Chinese government. These discussions in the past have been cordial and frank, but they are currently stalled, and I would like to take the opportunity of Mr Gyari's visit to Australia to again urge Chinese and Tibetan representatives to engage in further dialogue. It is in everyone's interests, including China's as an emerging global power seeking international respect, that there be a peaceful resolution of Tibetan claims in accordance with the constitution of the PRC-to genuine autonomy in terms of the preservation of the Tibetan culture, language and religion. As Mr Gyari says, 'We cannot rewrite history, but together we can determine the future.' Logan City: House Fire",91
94,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today, in my role as shadow parliamentary secretary for citizenship and settlement, I wish to express my wholehearted sympathy and to pay respect to the family, friends and neighbours of the victims of last night's horrific house fire in Kingston, which claimed the lives of 11 people, including to seven children. The home was occupied by two Pacific islander families, and the victims were three generations of a Tongan family. This is a tragedy of unimaginable scale, and it is critical that community support, assistance and healing becomes an immediate priority. It highlights the critical nature and the role of immigration and resettlement services, which are able to immediately respond to the needs of a community and the provision of emergency relief. I have been really fortunate to work closely with organisations in this area, and I wish to commend the role of MultiLink, which is engaged in coordinating a response and today hosted a meeting at 1 pm which was attended by relevant state agencies and NGOs. The immediate response to last night's event highlights that MultiLink plays an important role in the Pacific Island Advocacy Project. Today our thoughts and prayers are with these communities. I want to thank Director Helen Coyne and her team at MultiLink for their dedication and support, particularly to the Pacific islander communities in the Logan area. Kingston Electorate: Noarlunga Hospital Parking",91
95,Ms RISHWORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to raise concerns that many of my constituents have regarding standardisation of car parking fees at metropolitan hospitals in Adelaide at commercial rates. In particular, local residents have been concerned with SA Health's announcement that parking fees will be introduced at Noarlunga Hospital, and this move may impose extra financial burden on some of our community's most vulnerable, including pensioners and patients with chronic disease who need to visit regularly for hospital treatment. In addition, there frequent visitors to the hospital, including carers and the hospital staff, who may be caught by this. While SA Health has announced that some groups of patients and volunteers will be able to apply for exemptions and that staff will receive a discount, local residents are concerned that some of the most vulnerable in our community will not necessarily qualify for this exemption and discounts may not be enough. Some local residents believe that automatic exemptions from car parking fees for those who hold a pension or healthcare card would go a long way toward ensuring that those who can least afford it can still access services at Noarlunga Hospital. Noarlunga Hospital provides important services to southern Adelaide, and I welcome the state government's commitment of $31 million for the redevelopment of this hospital, expanding the bed capacity and redeveloping theatres and day surgeries. However, it is important that those that need this service, especially those with chronic disease, the elderly and staff, can access it without a huge financial impost. Education",92
96,Mr MCCORMACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," When it comes to inequity, this government and its leader know no bounds. They will say anything, do anything and even be anything the to retain power. The Treasurer opened his budget remarks on 10 May saying it was a Labor budget. Indeed it was. Communities right across Australia are struggling under the burden of having a Labor government which taxes more and spends money it does not have. All the while regional students continue to be hurt, classed somehow as second-best or not at all by Labor's unfair independent youth allowance rules. Fixing youth allowance immediately was are high on the agenda at the recent Isolated Children's Parents' Association annual federal conference in Darwin. Here is what the Rankins Springs branch of that association had to say: Families are still struggling with the financial costs of supporting their children while they study, and/or work to gain ""independence"". Many courses are not able to be deferred and require students to commence study straight away. The eligibility requirements to gain independent Youth Allowance place significant obstacles in the way of students and their families. If Labor cares anything about education and this nation's future why does it continue to disadvantage country students? Petition: Asylum Seekers",92
97,Mr WILKIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to present a petition in condemnation of the so called Malaysia solution. It was compiled by Amnesty International and has been found by the House of Representative Standing Committee on Petitions to be in accordance with the standing orders. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, This petition, by concerned citizens, draws to attention of the House : That Malaysia has not signed the UN Refugee Convention and does not offer genuine protection to refugees or asylum seekers. Amnesty International research shows that in Malaysia these vulnerable people are subjected to inhumane detention conditions, torture and serious abuse. As a signatory country, Australia must fully uphold its obligation to protect refugees. We therefore call upon the House to stop plans to expel 800 asylum seekers from Australia to Malaysia. from 1,821 citizens Petition received.",92
98,Mr WILKIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I have spoken in this place before to voice my strong opposition to the government's unethical and unnecessary plan to trade asylum seekers with Malaysia, and today I add the voices of more than 1,800 Australians to my objection. Vulnerable people, including unaccompanied minors, will be sent to Malaysia under this agreement and in doing so Australia will breach its international obligations under the refugee convention as well as the Convention on the Rights of the Child. With this petition I call again on the government to not trade people with Malaysia and instead to heed the plea of the many Australians demanding we live up to our moral and legal obligations-in other words, to protect those who seek asylum, process them on the Australian mainland and give them refuge if their claims are upheld. To paraphrase a line I heard on television last night: I love this country; I just sometimes don't recognise it anymore. Small Business",93
99,Ms ODWYER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Small business is the font of so much innovation and enterprise and is one of the key drivers in our economy. In Australia there are more the than 2.3 million small businesses. The last ABS stats said that the contribution small business makes to the economy, industry value added, is around $300 billion. Small business though is doing it tough right now. We see that with consumer confidence. We see that with the worse retail figures since the 1960s. We see that as a result of the government's changes to workplace flexibility. In my electorate of Higgins I have 19,524 small businesses. Small businesses employ people. They take risks. They put their money on the line. They make a very important contribution to our economy. I would particularly like to congratulate one of the small businesses in my area, the Malvern Hotel, that recently was recognised for its achievement in the National AHA awards for top hotels. The hotel was recognised as Best Bistro (Metropolitan) and I would particularly like to congratulate the owners, Ken Price and Michael and Susan Burke for their great achievement since taking over this business in 2009. Like so many people in small business they work very hard and it is terrific that they have now been recognised. Volunteers",93
100,Mr MITCHELL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," There are many unsung heroes in our communities who have served us for so long and asked for nothing in return. Many of these people are volunteers and I want to put on record my thanks to the volunteers in my community who have dedicated years to protecting us from bushfire-most significantly, the devastating Black Saturday fires. I want to thank Helen Kenney, who has stepped down as captain of the St Andrews CFA after four years. However, she continues to give up her time, as she has done for the past 12 years, to protect and serve the community. I also want to thank David MCGahy, who is stepping down as captain after more than nine years with the Strathewen-Arthurs Creek CFA and has been involved with the CFA for over 40 years. David gave evidence to the Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission and stated, 'We can never forget our firefighters.' He continued to do what was requested on Black Saturday and helped other people, with no idea if their houses were still there or if their families were alive. The same things I said of Helen can be said for David. Helen and David, like many others in my community, took on herculean tasks with strength, determination, passion and courage. These qualities have been invaluable and their distinguished commitment to their roles second to none. They both knew the responsibilities would be great, particularly in such fire-prone areas, yet never shied away from what needed to be done or said. They put their lives on the line, lost friends to the flames but continued to serve and protect the community to the best of their abilities. On behalf of the people of MCEwen I want to thank both Helen and David and wish them the best in their future endeavours. I know they will continue to play both leading and salutary roles in the community. It is people like this whose ongoing voluntary service strengthen our communities. Hicks, Mr David",93
101,Mr CHRISTENSEN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to express my utter disgust in the book by convicted terrorist David Hicks being short-listed in the Queensland Premier's Literary Awards. Hicks was not a man who took an overseas holiday and ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time; he was exactly where he wanted to be. He knew where he was and he knew what he was doing. Hicks converted to Islam and joined the Lashkar-e-Taiba, or 'army of the righteous'. He trained in weapons, landmines, basic explosives, marksmanship and ambush. They are not holiday pursuits. He was associating with the likes of Osama bin Laden, whom he met at least eight times. During his training with al-Qaeda, he was interviewed about his willingness to go on a martyr mission. Maybe the Premier of Queensland should have read the first book by David Hicks, his travel diary. He kept a journal. He wrote that he was trained to carry out armed raids and ambushes. He described how to gun down a six-strong security detail. He wrote that Satan was aligned with western society, which is full of poison introduced by Jews. 'Muslims fight against Jews and they kill them', he wrote. The Premier tries to justify her book nomination by saying that in her view it is a reaffirmation of values, which distinguish us from the terrorists. No, it is not, Premier: it is the Premier giving affirmation to a book by someone who sided with an enemy on the day that an Australian soldier was killed in the country where that mongrel went. Australian Industry",94
102,Mr KATTER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It was announced last week that CMG, the manufacturer of electric motors in Australia-the last manufacturer of electric motors in Australia-is closing its doors. There will be no more electric motors made in Australia. One-third of Australia's electricity goes into electric motors; a country not able to make an electric motor is like a country not able to make a wheel. I watched with considerable pain and shock the announcement by Qantas that half to two-thirds of their international operations will be going under the control, effectively, of foreign operators. They should not be allowed on the runs that are allocated to Australian operators. It will not be an Australian airline. Two-thirds of it will be overseas owned. The pilots will be overseas based and the maintenance will take place overseas-almost all of the maintenance. In the same period, we had the announcement by BlueScope that they were also going overseas. We are watching the haemorrhaging of the Australian workforce. There will be only two industries left: iron ore and coal quarrying. That is all that will be left in Australia. expired) Convoy of No Confidence",94

104,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 pm, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Logan City: House Fire",95
105,Dr EMERSON,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," On indulgence, I wish to make a short statement about the house fire in Kingston. A well-known Tongan-Samoan family has suffered a great loss in Logan City this morning where, it is believed, 11 members of their immediate and extended family passed away in a fire. The family has been in Australia for more than 25 years and have been Logan stalwarts for the past 15 years. The family are respected by the Tongan, Samoan and wider communities in Logan for their commitment to making Logan a better place. One survivor is in Logan Hospital with severe burns. He is well known for assisting local families with migration matters and has had some pretty good success. His wife was a devoted wife and mother, a person who cared deeply for her family, her church and her community. She will be missed and mourned greatly by the Logan community. Although I cannot confirm the other members who perished in this horrific fire I can confirm that students of Mabel Park State High School and Mabel Park Primary School are today mourning the loss of this family. Flags are flying at half mast. I wish to thank emergency services, all the other support services and the local community for rallying around the family at (Time this terrible time. I thank members from other areas for the concerns that have been expressed and I will pass on their condolences to the family.",95
106,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,"I am sure that members would want me to associate the House with the remarks by the Minister for Trade who is also, more importantly, the member for Rankin. We pass on our condolences to the family and friends and, importantly, to the Rankin community.",95
107,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," As the shadow parliamentary secretary for immigration and citizenship, I also wish to add my respect and my wholehearted sympathy for the sad loss of 11 family members. I spoke just a few moments ago about that tragic loss. I think the House would share in expressing our heartfelt sympathies for the members of the Tongan and Samoan communities. I understand the MultiLink Community Services organisation called a meeting today. I want to acknowledge the great work that Helen Coyne and her team are doing to help the family and the community and the neighbours of this tragic loss. NA",95
108,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will be absent from question time today because she is attending a meeting of the full council the Central Land Council. The Minister for Human Services and Minister for Social Inclusion will answer questions on her behalf. NA Member for Dobell",96
109,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, In light of the member for Dobell's resignation as chairman of the House Standing Committee on Economics due to a New South Wales police investigation I ask the Prime Minister: does the member still have her complete confidence?,96
110,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I have made many statements about that in this House. I stand by every one of them but what I am not going to stand for is the Leader of the Opposition in his question verballing and his presumptions about the motivations of the member for Dobell in determining to resign from the chairpersonship of a committee. I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the statement he made, which was about the best workings of that committee. NA Member for Dobell",96
111,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS, I seek leave to move a motion requiring the Prime Minister to make a statement to this parliament in connection with the member for Dobell. Leave not granted. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders,96
112,Mr ABBOTT,BUSINESS," I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders of be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediately: That this House immediately suspend proceedings for a period of not more than ten minutes to require the Prime Minister to make a statement explaining the nature of discussions she or her office has held regarding the loan provided by the NSW Labor Party to the Member for Dobell to cover his legal expenses and any discussions she or her office may have had with the Member for Dobell regarding the allegations against him. It is with considerable reluctance that I move this suspension of standing orders motion, because",96
113,Unknown,BUSINESS,Government members interjecting,96
114,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Order! I remind members of my comments of this morning. These are matters on which there will end up being a vote. If you want to remain around for the vote I think that you might sit there quietly.,96
115,Mr ABBOTT,BUSINESS,"As I said, I move this motion with considerable reluctance, because outside this House the Australian people are interested in jobs and the threats to their jobs, particularly the threats that are now existing to the jobs of manufacturing workers in the Illawarra. But I regret to say that inside this House all members of the government appear to be interested in is the job of the member for Dobell and, more importantly, the job of the Prime Minister, which rests upon the continued job of the member for Dobell. This is why standing orders must be suspended. As long as this government is preoccupied with defending the member for Dobell, it will not be addressing the issues of vital importance for our nation. As long as members of this government stonewalling and obfuscating and as long as they are defending the indefensible and justifying the unjustifiable to protect their own position in government they will not be properly protecting the interests of the Australian people. This is why standing orders must be suspended. There are more than 1,000 jobs in the Illawarra right now that are under threat because this government has not adequately been able to defend the manufacturing industries of this country. The only jobs that this government is interested in are its own jobs and protecting the position of the member for Dobell. This is happening because this Prime Minister is not prepared to take the steps to preserve the integrity of the government that any of her recent predecessors would clearly have protected. Standing orders must be suspended so that the integrity of this parliament can be preserved and protected. It is extraordinary that the Prime Minister of this country thinks so little of the need to protect the integrity of this parliament and thinks so little of the need to uphold the proper standards of behaviour amongst members of parliament that she is not even prepared to sit in this parliament and listen this debate. I am prepared to have a wager that she will not respond to this motion. This is a Prime Minister who is so determined to stonewall, who is so determined to ignore issues of integrity in government that she will not listen to the debate and will not respond to the allegations that her member must face and the questions that she herself must answer. For more than a week this Prime Minister has been asserting that the member for Dobell has her full confidence. On no fewer than eight separate occasions she has done so. Standing orders must be suspended for the Prime Minister to explain, because if this are Prime Minister has full confidence in the member for Dobell, given the issues that the member for Dobell needs to address, it is very, very difficult for the Australian people to have full confidence in her. How can the people have full confidence in the Prime Minister if the Prime Minister continues to have full confidence in the member for Dobell? This is why standing orders must be suspended. I am dismayed that this Prime Minister and this government, in particular, has resisted this motion for the suspension of standing orders, because isn't this the same Prime Minister that said that Labor was the party of truth telling? Isn't that what she said? What about a bit of truth telling from the member for Dobell and what about a bit of truth telling from this Prime Minister. Isn't this the Prime Minister who said at the beginning of this parliament that it would be a parliament of openness and accountability? Didn't she say repeatedly that there would be a new era of openness and accountability under the new paradigms? Didn't she say that we should let the sunshine in-that sunshine is the best disinfectant? So I say to all of the members of this parliament: the best way to to let sunshine in is to suspend standing orders so that the Prime Minister can explain herself in this parliament. This morning this parliament voted-not by absolute majority but by a majority- for the member for Dobell to make a statement. I regret to say that he did not make that statement. He was not legally bound to make a statement, but I would have thought that he was morally bound to make a statement by the vote of this parliament. Similarly, I would think that this Prime Minister in the absence of a statement by the member for Dobell is morally, if not legally, bound to make a statement to this parliament about what she knew and when she knew it. This ought to be the essential criteria for being Prime Minister of this country-that she is straight and honest with the parliament and through this parliament to the Australian people about what she has done. That is the minimum if the Prime Minister is to have any standard for integrity. I am not asking the Prime Minister to explain the apparent misuse of credit cards. That is a subject that needs to be dealt with by the relevant member and that is, after something that is now being investigated by the New South Wales Police. But I do think that the Prime Minister should tell us what she thinks about the misuse of credit cards, because as things stand her stonewalling suggests that she does not think it is very important at all. There are 70,000 members of the Health Services Union-70,000 low-paid workers whose fees, it seems, may well have been misused. The Prime Minister owes them an explanation of what she thinks about this kind of conduct. $90,000 has apparently been spent by the New South Wales Labor Party to pay the member for Dobell's legal fees. That is $90,000 in money that belongs to the Labor members of New South Wales. These are the members that buy Johno Johnson's raffle tickets; these are the members who believe in the light on the hill, which is not protecting the job of any particular member or any particular Prime Minister, but working for the betterment of mankind. That is what they believe and they are owed a decent explanation by their Prime Minister, particularly when they do not get one from the member for Dobell. That is why standing orders should be suspendedso that this Prime Minister and her government can put this grubby business behind it. Until this Prime Minister and this government can put this grubby business behind it, this government will not be able to address any other issues. As things stand we have a Prime Minister in hiding on this issue, we have a member in protection and we have a government in paralysis. We have a government in crisis. I say to the Prime Minister: people with a reasonable explanation have nothing to fear from the facts. The facts is what this motion seeks to get-facts from the Prime Minister and ultimately facts from the member for all, Dobell. That is why this motion for the suspension of standing orders should be supported.",96
116,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS," I second the motion. I say to the House that standing orders should be suspended in order to allow the Prime Minister the opportunity to come back into the chamber and make a full explanation to the House about her involvement and that of her officers in the gift of at least $90,000 to the member for Dobell from the New South Wales ALP to settle his defamation action with Fairfax Media Ltd and about any discussions she has had with the member for Dobell about his remaining in the House or as Chair of the House Standing Committee on Economics. Since last Tuesday we have asked eight questions in this place of the Prime Minister or other ministers about what they knew and when and about their confidence in the member for Dobell. All we have had in response from the Prime Minister is stonewalling and obfuscation. Any other prime minister worth their salt–whether it is the current member for Griffith or the former Prime Minister John Howard or Malcolm Fraser, Paul Keating or Bob Hawke-would have understood the necessity to take action today, or in fact weeks ago, to restore integrity to this government. If the Prime Minister was worth her salt, she would come into the House, she would make an explanation about everything she knows and she would clear the air. She would do so to restore integrity in this government in the eyes of the public. But we know what she has said about how much she loves power. She told the Sydney Morning Herald in 2005: 'I'd cheerfully kill several hundred people to get the opportunity to be a minister in the short term.' We know that she was prepared to assassinatepolitically assassinate-the member for Griffith when he was the Prime Minister. Goodness knows what she will do to cling to power.",98
117,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"The member for Sturt must relate his remarks to the suspension.  Speaker, is that the Prime Minister has spent the last week obfuscating and stonewalling in this House, because we know she will do anything to avoid having to go to the people from losing the member for Dobell. If she had the integrity that she claims, she would come into the House and put this issue behind her, clear the air and restore integrity into a government that is struggling. The controversy surrounding the member for Dobell is paralysing the government. The government is utterly distracted by it. For weeks allegations, claims and supposed misrepresentations have dribbled out through the press and have now become an avalanche of stories every day for the last week. The issue has paralysed the government, a government that was already struggling and already showing it was incapable of occupying the government benches. Whether it was the live cattle export issue or the protection of our borders, the Malaysian solution, the announcement of the carbon tax or the breaking of the promise on the carbon tax that she made before the election, restoring confidence in the economy or protecting Australian families from rising cost-of-living pressures, these are the issues the Australian public cares about and these are the issues the government cannot and will not address while it is paralysed and distracted by the controversy surrounding the member for Dobell. We move this motion to suspend standing orders to give the Prime Minister the opportunity to give a 10-minute speech, because we in the opposition want to give the Prime Minister the opportunity to clear the air, to put this matter behind her government-to move on so that ministers and backbenchers, the opposition and the government can all focus on what matters to the Australian people, which is their jobs and their livelihoods in a collapsing international economy. With the crisis of confidence among the community in this government and in the economy and with daily stories about job losses-whether it is at BlueScope or OneSteel or Westpac or Qantas-these are the issues we want to get on to, but until we get answers from the Prime Minister and the member for Dobell about the controversy surrounding him the government is paralysed and distracted, and that is why the Prime Minister must come into the House and give a full explanation of her involvement.

118,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:19): If there were any doubt that the Leader of the Opposition was unfit for high office, we have seen it demonstrated yet again today in this debate for the suspension of standing and sessional orders. The Manager of Opposition Business outlined a range of real issues of import to the Australian community-the issue of the pressure created by the high Australian dollar, the issue of the global economic situation and the issue of jobs. These are the issues that this government is focusing on but the opposition could not care less about. After one question from the Leader of the Opposition, they end question time by moving a suspension of standing and sessional orders. We have seen it all played out in the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition: one standard for himself and another standard for everyone else. Hypocrisy writ large. There is only one member of the Australian parliament who has charges against them-and it is not just shoplifting-and that is a member of the opposition. When did that occur? In May. When did we find out about it? In July. For two months they said absolutely nothing to the Australian people or in their party room. She is still chairing a committee; she has just stepped aside so she stays on the payroll. What hypocrites we see of those opposite. There is no process, there is no convention, there is no tradition, there is no norm that this Leader of the Opposition will not trash. This man is not a conservative; he is a reactionary who has been determined from day one, in what is the longest dummy spit in Australian political history, to trash the parliament, to trash its institutions and to drag everything down. You never see those opposite happier than when an Australian loses their job. They are only concerned about themselves, and we see it day in, day out. Just look at their hypocrisy. The Leader of the Opposition spoke about parliamentary standards, but last year, on 17 September, he said: … what we envisaged with the Parliamentary reform … was that the House of Reps would have a pairing system very much like the system that's operated effectively for years in the Senate, where typically the government hasn't had a majority … He went on to say, later that same day: I also support doing what's reasonably necessary to ensure that the Parliament can function given the closeness of the vote in the parliament. What a farce. Today, we saw the Prime Minister's vote not counted because she was doing the job of a Prime Minister-a job that this man will never do because he is incapable of holding high office. We saw the Minister for the Arts and the member for Wentworth prevented from attending the funeral of Margaret Olley. Last week, we stood as one in this House for the condolence motion on her death; yet today, in spite of the fact that it would have no impact on the result-no chance did the opposition have of getting an absolute majority-they chose to make a petty, mean-spirited act, lacking in old-fashioned decency. Then they came in and moved a motion to override the separation that exists between judicial proceedings and the parliamentary process. We had the shadow finance minister's speech last night-an outrageous attack under parliamentary privilege. We had a motion this morning and now we have another one. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said about the member for Bonner, when there were investigations taking place: ""The matter is really now before the police and perhaps the Criminal and Misconduct Commission in Queensland, and let's let those authorities make their investigations and come to any conclusion,"" … ""He's a backbench Member of Parliament and I think he's entitled to stay in the Parliament until these bodies have come to their conclusions,"" he said. We also have Senator Brandis, of Brandis on Brandis fame. This is what he had to say today, as reported in the Australian online: … while the Thomson matter ""has potential important political ramifications, from my point of view this is not primarily a political matter, it is primarily a legal matter"". That is what the shadow Attorney-General said just today. Of course, he has also said about his own side: I think people ... are entitled to the presumption innocence … Particularly since these people are members of parliament … What a farcical situation we have. Former Prime Minister John Howard had the same thing to say on 7 March 2007. He said, 'A lot of people who are under investigation end up having nothing to answer for.' The Leader of the Opposition's hypocrisy is perhaps best exemplified by his actions in the establishment of Australians for Honest Politics. Remember the slush fund? When David Oldfield set up One Nation out of his electorate office, along with Pauline Hanson in Warringah, he said, 'A hundred thousand dollars in the fund-we still don't know where it comes from.' When the Leader of the Opposition-the same person who is now moving a motion that the Prime Minister should respond, and there are no allegations against the Prime Minister-was asked, 'Where did the money come from?' he said in the Sydney Morning Herald on 5 September 2003: ""There are some things the public has no particular right to know."" That is what he said. But, of course, he was part of a government where there was barely a day in its 12 years that one of their front-bench was not under investigation or under threat of having to resign. They lost nine ministers and parliamentary secretaries. It was a revolving door over there because of the accusations and the proven circumstances which led to the resignation of minister after minister, parliamentary secretary after parliamentary secretary, day after day. We know that they then stonewalled. They had a position whereby, no matter what you did, you were going to get defence. We had Wilson Tuckey providing references to police on his letterhead and Peter Reith giving his credit card to his son, conceding of that he should not have done so, and his son giving it to someone else, with the public picking up the bill for all of that. We had the misrepresentation to the public about 'children overboard'. We had scandals involving the former Minister for Foreign Affairs over AWB. We had the member for Wentworth with his rainmaker grants. We had the member for North Sydney launching tourism campaigns for farm stays a couple of days after he opened his own farm stay business-a bit of insider knowledge there. So, day after day, we had those sorts of circumstances occurring, but what we heard from the now Leader of the Opposition was: ""There are some things the public has no particular right to know."" Earlier this year, on the front page of the Australian, one of his mates who helps run the group that has raised over $110,000 for Tony Abbott was talking about Work Choices, but he made no declaration of interest whatsoever. The Leader of the Opposition gave an interesting speech last week to the AMA. He said: 'You don't have to judge me by my words; you can judge me by my actions.' Well, we do judge the Leader of the Opposition by his actions. His actions are those of someone who is absolutely desperate because they cannot engage in a policy debate about the future of this country because they are too busy trying to dig themselves out of a $70 billion black hole. That is why those opposite have gone away from the policy debate on the economy; they have no interest whatsoever. They are just interested in slurs and digging dirt on members of parliament. It is important that due process be upheld.",99

Mrs PRENTICE: Mr Speaker, would you please advise or make appropriate inquiries as to whether the Tennis Australia event held yesterday evening at Parliament House was a government funded event or a Labor Party funded event? If it was a government funded event, representatives of Tennis Australia explicitly requested not to mention the event to members of the coalition? I ask this because, when I stopped to greet some of my friends from Tennis Australia, a staff member of the Minister for Small Business asked me to leave, as it was 'an ALP function'.",103

128,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE," What an extraordinary players, scene we have just witnessed: the Prime Minister of this country and all her ministers walking out at the very beginning of question time after taking only one question for the day. They have run away from any kind of questioning-any scrutiny-by the Australian parliament. They are so worried about the personal affairs of the member for Dobell that they are not prepared to be here to stand up and answer the simplest of questions. The Prime Minister is not prepared to take the 10 minutes offered to her to explain her situation to the people of Australia. They have run out of this parliament and closed down question time. Have we ever seen anything like it? But have we ever seen a government anything like this one? It is a disgrace to the Australian people. It is a disgrace to the democracy of our land-a bad government with bad policy delivering bad outcomes. And now they run away from scrutiny. Over the last couple of weeks, people have been travelling in convoys from all across our continent to Canberra to have their voices heard. They were angry. They had been lied to. The government was not listening to what they had to say. They came from the Kimberleys, from North Queensland, from Darwin, from Victoria, from Western Australia and from all over this country at considerable personal expense and considerable personal inconvenience. They used money that they do not have. They came here because they were angry. Many of them had never been to Canberra before in their lives. Most of them had certainly never been in a protest before in their lives, but they know that the future of our country is at risk because of this government and its policies. They endured the personal expense because they wanted to have their voice heard in the national capital. But they received the same treatment from this government as the parliament has today in question time. The government would not go out and talk to them. The government would not listen to them. The government would not hear what they had travelled from the far corners of the continent to say. This was a convoy that had no confidence in this government-and didn't they have every good reason to have no confidence in this government and the way it has performed. Not only would the government not talk to them, not only would the government not listen to what they had to say; the government actually ridiculed them. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport called them 'the convoy of no consequence'. This is the man who used to be minister for regional development. How much does he care about regional Australians? How much does he care about the delivery of infrastructure in this country when he dismisses those people who have come from all corners of the continent to have their say as being a convoy of no consequence? The member for Wills was even worse, shamefully worse, ridiculing the older people in this convoy and calling them a 'convoy of incontinence'. What sort of language will these people use to denigrate those who have come here to have their say? They were a convoy that had no confidence in the government, and, of course, this is a government that is itself a convoy of incompetence, stumbling from one disaster to another. Not only will it not listen to the constructive suggestions of people who want our country to be better; it ridicules and insults them and will not talk to them. The Prime Minister was going to wear out her shoe leather across the country explaining the carbon tax, but she put the shoes away in two or three days and quickly got back to the comfort of the carpets. She was never willing to explain her tax. She walked away from it. Is it any wonder that the people of Australia are a convoy with no confidence in this government? I received a number of letters, and I know other members have, from some of the people in this convoy, who expressed their dismay and their annoyance at the way in which they were treated by the government. Let me read part of a letter to you: These participants are not just the visible contingent who braved the back roads, and the time, the expense, the early starts and cold showers at truck stops, to make it all the way to Canberra. They also include all those who stood by the roadsides to wave, all those who cooked up sausages in small country towns, decorated their streets with coloured balloons and took a hat around for petrol money, all those who grieved that they couldn't make it but sent their best wishes and words of support, all those who walked the streets to collect petition signatures. short, this convoy includes all those who wanted to say, 'We have no confidence in the current federal government.' Instead today, all these people, ordinary Australians, were labelled as being of no consequence and were metaphorically spat upon. I ask you: how dare our elected representatives treat these people with outright contempt? Will Julia Gillard and Bob Brown have the courage to meet with the participants in Canberra? The reality is that they have not been prepared to meet. These people who travelled all the way across the country to deliver a clear message to the federal government that they were unhappy were not listened to; they were scoffed at, they were talked down and they were metaphorically spat upon because this government will not listen to what the people have to say about the carbon tax and its impact on ordinary Australians. The Prime Minister promised us all-she promised them; she promised Australians-that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led, but then Bob Brown, Christine Milne, the member for Lyne and the member for New England handed her government. A part of the price was that she had to institute a carbon tax upon which they had long campaigned. The Greens wanted an 80 per cent cut in emissions by 2050. They got it. The Greens said in January 2010 that they wanted a transitional carbon tax to start at $23. After the charade of the multi-party committee, the Greens got exactly what they had asked for in 2010: a $23 per tonne price. The member for New England wanted to legislate an 80 per cent target even earlier than the Greens, back in 2008. So he got what he wanted as well. The member for Lyne simply repeated his call during the CPRS debates to 'let the markets rip'. They got what they wanted. Due to its weakness the government was In held to ransom, and now the Australian people will pay right across the country. Other countries have exempted their industries from any responsibility to pay this tax. They wanted to save local jobs. This government has offered little or no protection in Australia, and what protection that there is will quickly be eroded. This is a recipe for economic and social disaster, which the Prime Minister has been prepared to inflict it upon Australian business and Australian families. Is it any wonder that the people are angry? Is it any wonder that there were people who were prepared to spend, in some cases, their last dollar to come to Canberra and have their voices heard-only to be spurned by a government that simply does not care? There is going to be an enormous impact on state and local governments as a result of this carbon tax. Their costs will go up. Just as the cost of electricity will go up for all households, the cost of electricity will go up for state governments and councils. For instance, if we work only on the $20 cost of carbon that was proposed, according to the Dubbo City Council, the extra cost of electricity to light the streets of Dubbo will be about half a million dollars. Tamworth, in the electorate of New England, says that it will cost $300,000 a year more to light the streets of Tamworth. So there will be higher rates. The reality is that, if we are going to get a warm inner glow from having a carbon tax, it will also light up the streets at a much greater cost. Let me talk about another impact on local government. They have a lot of responsibility in caring for rubbish. So let us talk about some rubbish other than government policy. Of the 500 emitters who are going to have to buy carbon permits, we are told that perhaps 190 of them are likely to be landfills. We know the list is a state secret as to who will pay and who will not have to pay. Only 70 actually emit the 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that would essentially bring them into the target, but the government intend to rope in another 120 of these landfill sites. These are the sorts of tips and dumps that we all go to every so often with our load of rubbish, and the government are dragging all of these in. Because they would not want the price to be cheaper at one dump than another, they are putting the carbon tax on others. It does not seem to worry them that one dairy factory has to pay and another does not or that carbon tax is not charged on imported cars but it is on Australians cars, but they want to make sure the dumps are all treated the same. What is worse-and the Prime Minister could not explain this the other day-is how they have to calculate how much carbon tax they have to pay. When you turn up with your load of garbage, somebody will have to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions there are going to be from your truckload or ute load of garbage for the next 30 years and then estimate the cost so they can calculate what they have to charge you for the carbon tax on the delivery of your rubbish. So there will be a council officer there with his computer and he will have to go through each piece and measure it all up and try to calculate how long it is going to be there so he knows how much to charge. Then of course you will have the government inspector from the new carbon tax police there to make sure that the council has not got it wrong. This is the kind of bureaucratic nonsense that the government propose to put in place. And, once more, in the process, they are going to kill off the methane electricity generation industry that is currently making a significant contribution to our renewable electricity generation-that will no longer be eligible for subsidies under the New South Wales greenhouse gas reduction program. Now let us turn to roads. Victoria and Western Australia have both done studies on road cost increases. They estimate that it will add around five per cent to the cost of building roads. And that is only in the first year-after that it goes up again and again and again. So $400 million will have to be added to the national building program if it is just going to deliver what the government originally said. There are no proposals to increase Roads to Recovery money-so important for local government to be able to build their roads-so they will just build fewer roads. I notice that the member for Lyne is here. He is a very keen supporter of the Pacific Highway. As a result of the tax that he is supporting, the government will have to find hundreds of millions of dollars extra to be able to build the Pacific Highway because of the extra cost of building roads in Australia. There is no proposal by the government to provide additional road funding. There are no proposals to provide additional local government grants. There are no proposals to increase Roads to Recovery funding. That means fewer roads and less infrastructure. And, of course, if you drive on a better road up the Pacific Highway, one of the benefits is that you emit less CO2. If the government are really serious about reducing carbon emissions, why do they put these penalties on road building and make it so expensive for councils to be able to deliver their services? There is no doubt that this government has been a convoy of incompetence ever since it was elected. There has just been one thing after the other-the refugee policy, the pink batts mess, the incompetence in dealing with live cattle, the incompetence over renewable energy and the incompetence of school halls. The incompetence just goes on and on. This convoy of incompetence deserves to be brought to account. People have come from across the nation to deliver the message. If the government was not satisfied with the numbers who were driving around Parliament House that day, maybe it could look back a week to when there were 5,000 people assembled on the lawns with exactly the same message. They may not have travelled as far, but their message was just as strong and just as powerful. In addition to the government promising that there would be no carbon tax while they were in government, they said that they would not introduce a carbon tax unless there was a consensus of the Australian people. I have been watching the crowds on the lawns of Parliament House, I have been listening to the media coverage and I have been reading the letters that I receive from my constituents, and I have to say that there is a consensus in Australia, and the consensus is that we do not want a carbon tax. The people do not want it. And no convoy of incompetence, no closing down of question time, no avoidance of the issue and no unwillingness to speak to people on the laws will get away from that fact. The people do not want the carbon tax. It will not be good for Australia. It will hurt Australian jobs. It will make sure that the economic prosperity of this country stalls. That is not a price that Australian people are prepared to pay.",107
129,Mr CREAN,IMPORTANCE,"Hotham-Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (14:58): That was a struggle if ever I have heard one, from the bumbling Leader of the National Party, who claims credit and representation in terms of regional Australia. They have not asked a question on the subject in this parliament, and when they were in government they said there was no constitutional role for the Commonwealth when it comes to regional development. If the National Party do not stand for regional development, what do they stand for? They are a disgrace, and yet we have got this MPI led by the faltering leader who now looks after that once proud party. But it is a rump, because it is a branch office of the Liberal Party. Let me just deal with the issue we are debating here today. We are not just debating the question of the price of carbon and the impact that is having on the Australian economy. What we should be debating is that we are an economy in transition and we are being confronted by many challenges. Putting a price on carbon is one of the solutions to facing up to those challenges, but there are many challenges, including the high Australian dollar, the fluctuating commodity prices and the devastation wrought by the floods. This is what economies have to face up to. That is what leadership is about, and you can either treat those challenges as opportunities or treat them as threats. We on this side of the House see the opportunities; on that side of the House they only see them as threats. They go around preaching gloom and doom; they go around with a fear campaign. They have never come forward with a constructive thought in their life. This is not the first time we have had to face up to challenges. The last time we did, it was also a Labor government that rose to the charge-a Labor government that understood in the eighties that what was needed for this economy to come through was to embrace an economy that needed to restructure itself, an economy that needed to open itself up to the rest of the world and an economy that recognised that it is such a small market that you simply cannot produce for your own market. We had to engage the world, and to do that we had to become competitive. That is why we floated the dollar, that is why we cut tariffs, that is we opened up to foreign bank entry and that is why we undertook the hard decisions. And what did that achieve, because we were prepared to face up to the hard decisions? It achieved the circumstancesMr Frydenberg interjecting Mr Laming interjecting",111

131,The SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Kooyong and the member for Bowman!,112
132,Mr CREAN,IMPORTANCE,"What it achieved was that Australia was the only developed economy in the world to have avoided the recession. We did it because we faced up to the hard challenges then and we are facing up to the hard challenges now. On the question of carbon pricing, I had the opportunity over the course of the break that we have just come back from to visit much of regional Australia. On the question of carbon pricing, I conducted forums in at least 10 communities and invited the stakeholdersAn honourable member: And they loved it!",112
133,Mr CREAN,IMPORTANCE,"They did love it because they had a government that was prepared to engage them. These were local governments, these were regional development bodies and these were community action groups that knew they had to face up to this challenge. The common theme for all of these regional development forums was that they knew they had to face up to two fundamental challenges. The first was the recognition that they had to diversify their economic base. They looked around and saw the regions which had diversified their economic base and they were the ones that were succeeding. The ones that had the narrow base, the ones that were reliant on one industry alone, were why the vulnerable ones. Think about Cairns, built around tourism. The dollar is hurting them, just as much as it is hurting manufacturers. But look at Townsville, just down the track, which has a diversified economic base, and it is not suffering the same level of high unemployment. That is the difference: economies that have embraced economic diversification. The second key ingredient that all these communities were embracing was the need to face up to a cleaner energy future. They express it in different ways: they want a cleaner environment in which their kids and grandchildren can grow up and they want to leave a legacy for them in the future; they want liveability; and they see opportunities-opportunities in green jobs and opportunities in terms of renewable energy options-and they were embracing them.",112
134,Mr Chester,IMPORTANCE,You cut 11 million bucks out of Landcare!,112
135,Mr CREAN,IMPORTANCE,"As to the member who interjects, the member for Gippsland, I attended his electorate and the forum there had a raft of initiatives that his community has embraced. Monash University, through ClimateWorks, is working on a low-carbon action plan. Six Gippsland local government authorities are working on projects focused on promoting energy efficiency. The Gippsland Trades and Labour Council and the Gippsland TAFE are looking at identifying skills needs in terms of the clean energy future. Also, the RMIT and Monash University are working on regional partners to establish a set of sustainable technologies. Mr Chester interjecting",112
136,Mr CREAN,IMPORTANCE,"The member for Gippsland interjects. If he wants to ridicule what his local community leadership stands for, let him get up and honestly state that in this House.",113
137,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! The minister will resume his seat. Does the member for Gippsland have a point of order?,113
138,Mr Chester,IMPORTANCE,No. Will the minister take a question?,113
139,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,No. There is no point of order. The member for Gippsland will resume his seat or I will deal with him. The minister has the call.,113
140,Mr CREAN,IMPORTANCE,"Not only is the member for Gippsland out of touch with his own community but he does not have a clue about parliamentary procedures. Why doesn'the go off to a training program, actually learn something and engage with his community? I was also in Whyalla. I mention Whyalla because the Leader of the Opposition went there to give them the rosy news that they were going to be wiped off the face of the earth when the climate change package came in, and yet when we went there we were shown opportunities in terms of solar, rare earths and a green-grid strategy in which they were committed to finding an additional 1,300 jobs if those projects come off. hardly wiping them off the map; that is expanding their economic footprint on the map. As far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned-talking about local government having their prices and things put up-I also went to Wagga during the break and announced an initiative with the Wagga council where, in conjunction with the Low Carbon Australia initiative, they were funding, with up-front, low-interest loans, initiatives to lower the energy footprint of the council. That is a council that sees the need to keep the energy costs down because, if they do not, it will transfer into higher rate bases. They are working with initiatives that the government is funding to help them lower that footprint. They know it, they get it and they are doing it. The only people who do not get it in this chamber are those who sit opposite. When it comes to the carbon pricing initiative we have got bipartisan support in this chamber for what we are trying to achieve. You would not believe it from the misrepresentations, untruths and fear that get spouted from the other side, but both major political parties have a commitment to lowering greenhouse emissions by five per cent by the year 2020. In other words, we agree on the what. The difference is we disagree on the how. The proposal that has been put forward from the other side has been ridiculed by any objective observer that you ask because it is costly, because it does not work and because it actually puts a huge cost on households. In fact, as the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency indicated the other day, it is a cost per household of $1,300 a year. Yet they are talking to us about cost-of-living pressures. Before the last election the member for Goldstein was saying that the opposition's proposal, which it does not even talk about That is these days, would take Hazelwood in Victoria out of the equation. However, when the Leader of the Opposition went down there and confronted the Latrobe Valley workers he said, 'Oh no, we're not closing Hazelwood.' So how are they going to implement the policy that they turn against as soon as they come to another audience? The Leader of the Opposition is the chameleon of Australian politics. With every audience he speaks to he changes his spots and he changes his language. He says what he thinks they want to hear but none of it is consistent. He is caught out on climate change wherever he goes. We are committed to achieving that five per cent reduction and we have the package of measures that will help us do it. That is why all of those community forums I have talked about have engaged in the discussion, because they have wanted to hear the package of measures that we have available to help them do it. This is also an interesting contrast because when the former Kennett government in Victoria privatised the Victorian electricity industry it had no assistance package to help people make the transition. The Liberal Party does not believe in assistance packages. It is even worse, because the other day when the current Premier of Victoria, Ted Baillieu, put out that shonky report to show that our package would cost jobs, when in fact the analysis even indicated there would be an increase in jobs, he ignored the assistance package that we had put in place. The Liberal Party does not believe in assistance packages and when we announce ours it wants to ignore it. What sort of honesty is that, Mr Speaker? What sort of commitment to leadership is it that they would have you believe that they could give? What sort of leadership is it where, in the face of all these massive challenges to us as an economy in transition, having to make the structural changes and face up to the important challenges, its view is that you do it on your own. That is not the Labor view, Mr Speaker, and it never has been. Our view is that we are better off understanding the challenges ahead of us and seeing them as opportunities but developing the assistance packages that are going to help us get there. One of the other important things that comes from this package-and I would have thought this was important to the National Party because it affects farmers-is that farmers can be the big winners out of this climate change package because the tax does not apply to them in the first place. In other words, they do not pay it. The second thing is that they get the benefit in two ways. They get the benefit because we have significant assistance for them on carbon farming, which is not replacing other farm activities but enhancing them. In its simplest formand I saw this down at Mount Gambier when I was there a couple of weeks ago-it is biological farming to enrich light, sandy soil by trapping the carbon in the soil. This makes that soil more resilient, particularly in drought. It retains water better and it holds more nutrients. In other words, it lifts the productivity of the industry base that is agriculture. And if that can be measured, and we believe it can, they can also trade it. That is what a market is. The greatest irony in this debate is that when it comes to creative solutions to the challenge of climate change it is the Labor Party that is advocating the market and it is the Liberal Party that is advocating direct intervention. Robert Menzies would be turning in his grave today if he were listening to this rabble advocating its approach. The market works because the market rewards better behaviour. It rewards cleaner energy options. It rewards cleaner fuels over dirtier fuels. This is where Australia can play at its strengths, but it will not realise those strengths unless it has a market that reflects those comparisons. It is for that reason that Australia has to take an important lead in influencing the shape of that market, a market that reflects good behaviour, smarter practices in agriculture and cleaner energy options over dirtier energy options. That is how we should be doing this. When I was Minister for Trade those who sat on the other side were always saying, 'Do your best, Minister, in terms of opening the markets.' Here we have the opportunity to have an influence in the newest market of the lot and they are saying: 'Ignore it. We don't want more markets. We don't want open markets. We want to turn on our own traditions because we want to run a grubby, negative fear campaign. We haven't got any ideas. Our way back to office is to run the fear campaign, play to all the people's worse prejudices, play to their fears, and rather than give hope and opportunity, give them fear.' We are the party of opportunity and we will succeed. Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) (15:14): Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on the matter of public importance about the impact of the carbon tax on governments. At least the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government speaks with passion and belief even though much of what he says is complete rubbish. In terms of an audition speech for the leadership, mate, I am worried the odds are slipping away. I hear the Minister for Defence's name coming up more often than yours and I want to put money on you because I have already seen what you can do when you are leader. The minister for local government said Australia is facing many challenges, and it is. Then he said the solution is a new tax: a carbon tax.",113
141,Mr Crean,IMPORTANCE,"No, I didn't. I said the market. Mr IAN MACFARLANE: What he said was that the solution is a new tax. If the solution is a new tax, I want to see the question, because I cannot believe that someone of his experience would think that when you have an economy under pressure and a global economy going backwards the solution is to slap a tax on your industriesMr Crean interjecting Mr IAN MACFARLANE: The GST reduced taxes. He reminds me with that interjection-which I gratefully accept-of his accusation of scare campaigns. I remember the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government standing here with a pair of children's pyjamas. He would stoop to whatever level necessary to try to scare the pants off children. He could not help himself! Mr Crean interjecting",115
142,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," The minister will resume his seat unless he has a point of order. There is no point of order. The member for Groom has the call. Mr IAN MACFARLANE: I think we need to be tough on frivolous points of order and eject the member from the House! The most insidious aspect of the Gillard government's carbon tax is that there is no sector of our economy and no corner of the Australian community that will be exempt from its reach. The minister for local government is simply wrong when he says farmers will not pay the carbon tax. He knows I was a farmer. He knows that farmers will pay the knock-on effect of this tax on every consumer item they buy on their farm, including the costs in bringing their inputs to that farm through transport. The carbon tax is designed, quite simply, to make everything more expensive. That is the way it works. It is designed to make sure that it is impossible to escape. It puts up the cost of consumables to the community because it has at its heart a belief that if you increase the costs then people will use less and, therefore, emit less. Those on that side cannot deny that. Key to the increasing costs is the increase in the price of electricity. The price of electricity will go up to households, businesses, local governments, state governments and even the federal government in running this building. It is simply impossible to escape any of these increases in cost. The minister for local government suggests that local governments are not already doing everything they can to lower their power bills. We know that that statement is incorrect. We know that local governments are already, because of the substantial increases in the price of electricity over recent times-since 2007, electricity prices have gone up by 50 per cent-doing everything they can to be more efficient, like installing more efficient lighting. But the savings of all those efficiencies will be lost as the price of electricity to local government goes up. So we will see higher water rates, higher sewer rates, higher costs in maintaining roads within the local government areas. This is a tax that will affect local government and, in doing that, will affect the ratepayers of that local government authority. This is a government addicted to new taxes. We have seen a flood levy, a mining tax, a $2.5 billion tax on condensate in the North West Shelf and, just recently, a tax on those people who have taken the responsible step of converting their vehicles to LPG. Those quarter-million families who used a government incentive-a subsidy-to convert their vehicles to LPG have now been caught in the ultimate honey trap. The government opposite encouraged those families to convert to LPG on the basis that there was no excise. Once they converted their cars, the government brought in a new tax. Those people will not only pay higher prices for LPG but will also see the price of electricity at their homes go up 20 per cent. The transport industry-after the next election, we understand from what the Prime Minister has said-will see a 6.5c rise in the cost of fuel. That rise has already been targeted to hit the resource industry as soon as the tax comes in, but the transport industry will see a 6.5c rise in their fuel costs. That again will pass on to local government. Local government run their own trucks. They run their own machinery as they repair roads in their authorities. As I said at the outset, this tax will reach into every corner of our community, and local government will pass those costs back on to the household. It is all going to end up in one place: families facing higher and higher cost-of-living pressures. I heard the member for Wide Bay and Leader of the Nationals talk about the impact street in terms of the disposal of rubbish at municipal dumps. I had the opportunity when I was up at Maitland a few weeks ago to meet with the local mayor, who said this was going to cost ratepayers around Australia over $200 million just in disposing of their rubbish. In the municipality that I was in, that equated to about $35 a household. That is on top of higher electricity prices, higher water prices and the increases that we are going to see right across the board because this tax reaches into every household. It will affect not only electricity and gas prices but grocery prices and all cost-of-living pressures that are put on a family. And why? Because the Prime Minister broke her promise. 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' She said so brazenly, as did the Deputy Prime Minister, in the leadup to the last election because they knew that if they were honest with the community and said, 'We're going to introduce a carbon tax,' they would not have been elected, because the community knows the impact of this tax is higher costs on the community, higher costs on their families and less money to spend on their children. This is a bad tax and it will not achieve any sort of outcome. For state governments the hit will be just as substantial. The New South Wales government will have a substantial hit on the value of its power stations, already estimated at $5 billion in write-down on those values. The Queensland Labor government-and I would not trust their figures as far as I could kick them-are estimating the loss there will be $1.7 billion, but in reality it is probably double that. On top of that, the Queensland Treasury modelling shows that the state's gross product will be down by about 3½ per cent as a result of this carbon tax in the ensuing years to 2049-50. This is a hit on the bottom line of economic growth and the state governments will feel it. A study by Deloittes shows that a carbon tax of $33 a tonne will drop economic growth by 4.11 per cent over the same period. This is a bad tax. This is a tax which will achieve nothing. This is a tax that will not cause the conversion of coal fired power stations to gas fired power stations. This is an attack on the living standards of everyday Australians and everyday families. That is why the opposition is opposed to this tax. That is why the people of Australia are opposed to this tax. That is why thousands of people have been massing in front of this parliament. They now feel that the only way they can be heard by this government is to come down and confront it. So out of touch are the people on that side of the House that men and women of Australia feel they have to come down here to ensure that this government gets its message that they do not want their everyday activities costing more as a result of this tax.",115
143,Ms GRIERSON,IMPORTANCE," I rise to speak on this matter of public importance on carbon tax-and it certainly is important-but let us not fool ourselves that the issue being debated here today by the opposition has anything to do with their concern for state or local government or for regional communities like the one I represent. Instead, it is just a smokescreen for the opposition's continued denial of the basic facts of climate change and their lack of ideas to guarantee prosperity for the future of regional electorates like mine in Newcastle. The most basic difference in this debate is that, unfortunately, the Abbott led coalition are still in a state of denial. They behave like the dinosaurs of the past and would condemn us to a very uncertain future. In contrast, that is not what we are doing. We do not think, like the member for Warringah does, that climate change is 'absolute crap'. We are not, as he has said, 'hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate change'. We know it is real. We believe the science. We respect the science. I am very pleased the member for Wentworth has come out in defence of science too. We are a great country, a country of great knowledge, great ability and great capacity. We should never talk that down or take it for granted. We will introduce a plan for the future. We will introduce a clean energy future for this nation-a package that will be introduced in the Labor way, in a way that creates opportunity, takes on the challenges of hard reform, taxes major polluters and not ordinary people, assists households and the most vulnerable in our communities, and sustains employment and jobs. We are proud of our record on sustaining employment and jobs. It will also position our economy, in international and global challenges, in a way that will bring prosperity. It is something that Labor does and does proudly. I cannot believe the opposition's mantra of 'the sky is falling' and doom and ruin. It is reckless and undermines economic confidence of the people we represent-and it is deliberate. Our price on carbon is modest; $23 per tonne, and gives three-year certainty for industry, which is exceedingly important. The Abbott led coalition and their recently elected friends in New South Wales and Victoria, on the other hand, continue to expose the Australian people to the most scurrilous, deceitful and ludicrous scare campaign in recent political memory. They claim a carbon price will damage state governments and destroy jobs in my state of New South Wales. These claims are not only reckless but also irresponsible. They are untrue. In late May Premier O'Farrell peddled out some core modelling to claim that 18,000 jobs would be lost under a carbon price in New South Wales. To once again paraphrase Mr Abbott, this claim was absolute crap. To make this claim, Premier O'Farrell relied on a discredited and outdated piece of research by the Liberal Party's favourite consultant, Frontier Economics. The costings and assumptions underlying that particular piece of research have been disputed. He talked about so-called job losses when in fact all available evidence demonstrates that jobs growth will continue in New South Wales under a carbon price. For example, reputable modelling by the federal Treasury shows that coal mining in New South Wales is projected to grow by 118 per cent to 2050. Let me tell you about that because I represent the city that has the biggest export port of coal by volume in Australia. We currently export 100 million tonnes of coal the world. It is projected that in the next years we will increase that to 200 million tonnes per annum and then to 300 million tonnes per annum. There is no lack of investment or confidence in my electorate for the coal industry. This discussion and debate on carbon and a lower carbon energy future has not dissuaded or deterred investment. Two hundred thousand new jobs in the mining boom are projected over the next two years. The federal Treasury also projects that the economy of New South Wales will grow strongly under a carbon price-growing by 27 per cent to 2020 and by 164 per cent to 2050. The simple reality is that all credible evidence and modelling suggests that the state of New South Wales and the Hunter region would be better off under Labor's Clean Energy Future package. We have learnt very quickly, though, in the five months since the New South Wales Liberal government was elected that they have no credibility when it comes to dealing with the facts or exercising responsible leadership. This is the very same state government which, just two weeks ago, took more than 56 hours to inform residents in my electorate that 10 kilograms of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium had been leaked over their homes. This is the government that is quick to trumpet exaggerated figures about fictitious job losses but utterly negligent in its responsibility to warn citizens about a very real and very carcinogenic chemical cloud affecting the neighbourhood. So I think the coalition's hyperbole falls particularly short. Our Clean Energy Future package also applies very responsibly to the region I represent. We have been watching the steel industry struggling with some of the economic pressures of the high Australian dollar and low international demand, and I to hear nothing from the other side of the 10 chamber about supporting that industry. Yet our $330 million steel package, which is already projected to support BlueScope Steel, sits there on the table. The package has been well received by people like Geoff Plummer, the national general manager of OneSteel. He said: We believe that on balance, the sectoral approach announced today by the Prime Minister for the steel industry, including the introduction of the STP is both appropriate and sensible. We are pleased that the Government has responded by adopting this approach. The member for Groom just spoke. He comes to Newcastle quite a lot and always comments on how wonderfully well we are doing. The growth of our economy has been outstanding. But you come to Newcastle and tell steelworkers that they will not get any assistance, or come and tell our coal industry that they will not get assistance from the coalition! I do not see that happening, because the people who sit on the opposite side of the chamber just want a fear campaign; they do not want facts and figures. And they certainly do not understand about sustaining economic growth and jobs. This motion suggests that local government will be doomed. I think it was 20 years ago when Newcastle City Council hosted the first Pathways to Sustainability conference. We have now rolled out programs across the whole country on energy conservation, preserving water and making that transition to a clean energy future. We have been doing it for over 20 years through a program called Together Today, with every school and industry in my electorate working together for a clean energy future without having to wait for government. Similarly, I think people know how hard we have worked in my region to create a clean energy future through the federal government's investment in the Australian Solar Institute, which is headquartered in Newcastle; the national Enterprise Connect Clean Energy Innovation headquartered in Newcastle; the Smart Grid, Smart City $100 million program based in Newcastle; and the new Newcastle Institute for Energy and Resources at Newcastle University, which is doing the most wonderful work. The package that the federal Labor government has put out will advance those cleaner technologies. It is finally the signal needed for investment. We have been waiting for the Finance Corporation component to progress to commercialisation of these technologies. China currently is investing one per cent of its GDP in renewable technologies. We want a part of that; we have to be a part of that. Our Clean Energy Future does not prejudice the prosperity of national, state and local governments-it builds it. It is a great policy and one that I am very proud of. I also say to the opposition: let's look to some economic certainty in this country, let's look to some bipartisanship. I know that it is a lot to ask but that is what the people of Australia want. Let's be part of creating a prosperous future for them. Let's be part of taking on the challenges of sustaining employment in existing industry and in new industry. Let's be part of positioning this country as a leader, where it should be, in clean energy and jobs of the future. I would like to see less obfuscation, less recklessness and certainly less misleading information coming from the other side of this parliament. I am pleased to follow Simon Crean, the Minister for Regional Development, Local Government and the Arts, in this debate because his recent visit in my electorate was so well received because of his track record in Labor politics of job creation and protection. People came up to him with great affection. Steelworkers of the past, who Centre know that in this challenge they can feel secure. (Time expired)",117
144,Ms LEY,IMPORTANCE," I am very pleased to speak on today's MPI, which is about the impact of a carbon tax on state and local governments. I would like to pick up on some remarks that the member for Newcastle made in her contribution. She started off by saying that the opposition denies the basic facts of climate change. That is not what this debate is about. It is certainly not what rural and regional members and constituents of mine are about, member for Newcastle. This is about considering the question: if you take action on climate change, what sort of action do you take? There has been so much talk from the government about transition and transformation in our patchwork economy. There has been so much jargon on this subject. Transitions are all very well. Of course we would support them if they were in the interests of the country and the interests of the planet, but they are not. We have to look at what this government is doing with its carbon tax and the effect that it has on the people that we represent here in this parliament. Those effects are not good. The member for Newcastle spoke about the steel industry-and, coming from Newcastle, she should know the steel industry well-and said that the opposition has no plan to match the government's steel transformation plan. But the point is that if we did not have the government's carbon tax we would not have the need for the steel transformation plan. Admittedly, in one respect $100 million is good help for the steel industry, but it is coming from a carbon tax adjustment fund. By what convoluted logic can the government then say to us, 'You're not supporting the steel industry'? Of course we are supporting the steel industry. We do not want to see a situation where every piece of steel in Australia is manufactured overseas. recently visited an engineering shop in my electorate of Farrer, in Corowa on the Murray River. They provided the bridgework for some magnificent steel bridges over the Yarra and won awards for it. I asked the proprietor, 'Do you think that in five years time the steel you use in your metal fabrication shop will come from Australia?' He said, 'Not a chance-not the way this government's heading with its carbon tax.' How ashamed we should feel to live in a country with the resources we have and to import often second-grade steel from China. How ridiculous that is. We had the lecture from the member for Hotham about the opening up of the Australian economy, becoming competitive, floating the dollar, tariffs, and recognising our place in the integrated globalised modern world. Sure, we all know that stuff, Member for Hotham. But it is an insult to link the reforms that were made-some by Labor governments, some by Liberal governments-to this carbon tax and to try to suggest that this is part of that, that this is also one of those great reforms. The member for Hotham also said that economic diversification is the key to success. He has worked that out, because he has travelled around regional Australia. He has not been to my electorate, but he has been to the electorate of the member for Riverina and conducted one of his forums in Wagga and he appeared on an ABC TV program in my electorate. He has even been to some more remote parts of Australia. I recognise that he needs to do that. He has come back with the message that economic diversification is the key to success! So tell me why would we be attacking our manufacturing sector and shrinking the diversified base of our economy down to something that we will as members of communities struggle to deal I with, particularly in regional areas? If economic diversification is the key to success, the next logical thought that the government should have is how we maintain, strengthen and sustain that economic diversification, and the last thing we should be doing is taxing it. I started by talking about the need for action on global warming. It is something I support. I am on record as supporting it and I am proud to do so. I do not agree with all of my constituents. Sometimes I have very vigorous conversations with climate change sceptics and I say: 'You could be right, I could be right, but I am adopting the precautionary principle that we need to take action to prevent the warming of the planet. That is a good thing.' But if this government is serious about taking that action then what they should be doing is encouraging the rest of the world. The foreign minister has been tripping through Africa and the Middle East. He has been doing good work there, I recognise that. He has made a fantastic number of visits to foreign countries, but where on his agenda has been the encouragement for the next global conference following Copenhagen? Does anybody even know where it will be? I probably should but I don't, because it is never mentioned. It is not mentioned by the government. If they want to see action on climate change that we can be a meaningful contributor to then they should be encouraging the next global conference on climate change, and the Foreign Minister should be using his good offices and his links with so many of his counterparts throughout the world to make that happen. But it is not even talked about. Everything has shrunk back to the Australian agenda. So somehow we can be this small, isolated piece of action on climate change at the end of the world. Does anybody think that the American government-America being the biggest emitter of carbon so-called pollution-is going to go to the next election with a policy of a price on carbon of $30 a tonne? Of course they are not. Does anybody think that we should be taking action without the most industrialised countries going forward at the same time with us? Of course they don't, if they think about it. This tax has a terrible effect on state local governments. I happened to bump into a councillor from the City of Shoalhaven in my office this morning. Shoalhaven is a beautiful part of the world and has 95,000 residents. I asked the councillor, 'What do you think the effect of a carbon tax will be on the people you represent?' He said, 'Well, our electricity bill is $400,000 a year."" I said, 'Wow!' And he said, 'But that is just for running the street lights.' $400,000 to run the street lights for the City of Shoalhaven of 95,000 people is quite a lot of money and it will be quite a big impost if that goes up by what the estimates are, which is between 10 and 20 per cent-so let us say 15 per cent. The other cost that he mentioned and other councils have mentioned to me is the cost of landfill. Unfortunately, landfill is one of the top 500 polluters being attacked by this government. Not everything makes sense in this area. When it comes to landfill everything that you have dumped in the ground for years is taxable all of a sudden to your local council. They have to make calculations and you would assume they would pass on those costs to their ratepayers, except in New South Wales, where they face rate caps and cannot pass on the costs to ratepayers. Where will they go? Reduce services, reduce staff, shed more jobs. You think of the services local governments provide. We drive through towns in the middle of the drought and everybody who comes into a small local town often sees it as an oasis of green, calm and tranquillity. The worse thing that happened is that you could not water the lawn. You think of the energy that will go into pumping water to water the green spaces in our towns and our cities. That is extremely energy intensive. You think of the cost of electricity on every single council provided service, whether it is the public library, the maternal and child healthcare service or the and council offices themselves and it is a relentless, impossible burden that is facing local government. And it is one which the minister for local government, who has spoken in this debate, should really be ashamed of. This tax will hit regional Australia harder than any other area. We know as members of this side of the House because we come from regional Australia, we go home to regional Australia and we feel the pain of regional Australia. Much has been made of the state governments' reports and investigations into the cost on states of a carbon tax. They have been ridiculed by members of the government. In all my experience of watching state premiers in their dealings with Canberra, if they do not agree with Canberra they say so, and if they do agree with Canberra they say so. So when you have the Premiers of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland stand up and show results that say there will be increasing burdens on their states with this carbon tax and what is the government going to do about it-job losses: 24,000 in Victoria and 31,000 in New South Wales. They are easy numbers to say but we know the pain of every single job loss when we see it in our own community. Those are very big numbers. State governments, of course, are going to be hit incredibly hard by this carbon tax and those premiers should be saying to Julia Gillard: 'Sort this out. Do something different.' Our own fabulous Parliamentary Library has produced some information that suggests that the price on carbon that would have to be put that would make the difference that that government says will be made is a price that is well above what we are actually seeing. Which means that, in spite of all this pain, it is still a fraud on the Australian people and it is not going to achieve the things that they have said that it will. expired)",119
145,Mr MURPHY,IMPORTANCE," I very much regret that the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government has not been here to hear the member for Farrer completing what can only be described as a scandalous and scurrilous serial scare campaign run by the opposition in relation to our putting a price on carbon. Putting a price on carbon is in the interests of our country and the future of our children. Yet the opposition maintain this massive fear campaign, because that is the only campaign they know. If the member for Hotham were still here he would describe the contributions by the members for Wide Bay, Groom and Farrer as a national disgrace. It is just a complete fear campaign. Later in my contribution I will pick up on the comments that have just been made by the member for Farrer in relation to statements by Victorian cost Premier Baillieu and New South Wales Premier O'Farrell, because they, too, are monumentally dishonest and maintaining that scurrilous scare campaign in the states. The time has never been better for us to transition from an Industrial Revolution economy to a new, green economy. Australia is very, very well placed to do so. We are an island continent. We have unlimited access to solar, wind, tidal and geothermal power. On the subject of solar power, I want to put the Howard government in the frame, because I knew well Dr David Mills, who ran the solar energy project in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney, some years ago when he was looking for support from the Howard government in relation to his establishment of solar collectors adjacent to the Liddell power station in the Hunter Valley, with a view to providing solar power to that coal-fired power station. He came to Canberra to look for support from the (Time Howard government. And what did he get? Absolutely no support-and it was a national disgrace when we lost Dr Mills, and $40 million in potential export revenue, to California. In the area of wind power, we do not have to travel very far outside the national capital to reach Lake George and have a look at the wind turbines that have been established there. That is a very important step that the local community is taking to make a contribution to moving to a greener, healthier, cleaner economy. I also remember some years ago travelling to New York and meeting Mr Trey Taylor of Verdant Power, who was running a very interesting clean-energy project on the East River. Mr Taylor and his company had something like half-a-dozen wind turbines submerged about a third of the depth of the water in the East River immediately adjacent to the United Nations building. He has demonstrated at this stage that the energy from tidal power-which, as you all know, is constant, unlike solar power and wind power, which at times can be inconstant though still there-generated by the tide running through the East River and powering those bidirectional turbines produces enough supply to power a six-storey car park and a delicatessen. It just shows you what a bit of creativity can do, and Australia is well placed in that area. We also have unlimited access in Australia to geothermal power. As I say, the time has never been more right for us to move to a cleaner, greener economy and get out of the dirty, carbon-polluting economy that we have had for so long in our country. I would like to just trace some of the history of our first-term government, the Rudd-Gillard government, in relation to our engagement with the regions that the member for Hotham alluded to in his contribution to this very important debate. We established a whole new structure to get the best possible strategic advice and to strengthen our engagement on the ground. We set up a dedicated department. We also revitalised and strengthened the nation's network of 55 regional development committees, and we not only provided $4.3 billion for regional health, hospitals, education, infrastructure and skills development programs but also put in place the programs and mechanisms that would enable local communities to find local solutions to local issues. By encouraging the regions to come up with creative solutions we get a better targeted and more efficient result on the ground, and that is good for those communities and good for our nation. This is not the first time we have gone through a transition like this. The reforms of the eighties and nineties, in the days of Keating and Hawke, meant that Australia was fundamentally positioned as a more competitive and productive nation, and one which was starting to seriously engage with Asia. That foresight, in the face of all the challenges those reforms confronted, positioned Australia as the only developed economy in the world to have avoided the global recession. Often it was the regions that responded best to these challenges and learnt to diversify their economic base. Regions have not asked the government why they need to cut emissions; they have asked how they can do it. Our regions are already moving to a more sustainable future and have been doing so for some time, long before we announced the carbon price. I noticed the member for Farrer alluding to comments by the Premier of Victoria and also the Premier of New South Wales. They too have been making very baseless and dishonest claims in relation to the carbon pollution tax that we want to introduce because we know that it will change the behaviour of the world's worse emitters, particularly in our own country. I just want to remind the House that, in 2009, then opposition leader and now Premier, Mr Baillieu, said: Carbon transition is one of the biggest issues that will face Victorian businesses and families over coming years, but I have no doubt that we will in a few years be living in a carbon-managed economy. We will have reduced our personal and industrial carbon footprints. I also have no doubt that in the very same way we have adapted to significant structural and legislative change in the past, there will come a time when it will simply be the norm. As I said previously, it will not be scary or a threat but just the way it is done. The Victorian government's modelling does not include the key assistance measures we have put in place. We stand by the comprehensive independent modelling by federal Treasury. It projects the economy of Victoria will grow by 30 per cent by 2020 and by 162 per cent by 2050 with a carbon price in place. Apart from 1.6 million new jobs nationwide by 2020, it also shows Victoria will maintain strong growth under a carbon price, with the agricultural, construction and service industries growing by 120 per cent,170 per cent and 246 per cent respectively to 2050. New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell has also exaggerated the impact the carbon tax will have on New South Wales. Claims by Mr O'Farrell that thousands of jobs would be lost across the Hunter and Illawarra regions due to the introduction of a carbon price are causing unnecessary and unjustified concerns about job security and future growth. Not only did Mr O'Farrell use dodgy numbers; he also failed to release information that shows that New South Wales in fact benefits from a carbon price. Mr Husic interjecting",122
146,Mr MURPHY,IMPORTANCE,"Federal Treasury modelling shows employment will grow, with an extra 1.6 million jobs being created nationwide by 2020 under a carbon price. I appreciate the interjection by the member for Chifley, because he knows exactly what I am talking about-unlike Mr Industries like coal mining and aluminium manufacturing, which are vital to the New South Wales economy and to regions like the Hunter and Illawarra, will continue to grow under a carbon price. The fact is that New South Wales will benefit from our move to a clean energy future, as will the whole of Australia. This opposition stands and sits condemned for its opposition to our carbon pollution tax. (Time expired)",124
147,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,124
148,Mr GEORGANAS,BILLS," I will pick up where I left off on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011 just before the 90second statements. I was talking about the Selection Committee and its referral of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. Those on the other side have been very critical of the process and the way that we looked into this particular bill. But the fact is that whoever on the Selection Committee referred this particular bill would have been a member of the opposition, because I know that on this side of the House we are all in agreement that the bill will have positive effects out in the community. So, when those opposite complain that the inquiry did not look into the Trade Practices O'Farrell. Act, the economic side of things and the retail side of things, I can only say that they should have thought through a bit more which committee to refer this bill to, instead of just referring it off, to play politics, to of the committees and then complaining that the inquiry was not extensive enough because it did not look into the economic side or the constitutional and legal side of the bill. Again I say: it is the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing; it was our duty to look at the impacts on health and ageing, and no more. As I said, I tabled the report in the House of Representatives this week. I am pleased that the report shows that all members of the committee, which was comprised of members of both the government and the opposition, affirmed the harmful effects of tobacco and smoking, and we affirmed the positive effects of decreasing the incidence of smoking in our communities via this bill. When I tabled the report, I made a brief statement that was fit for that particular occasion. What I did not say was that the committee was presented with evidence from people on the health side of the conflict and from people on the tobacco side. It is a conflict, and I am sure we are all aware of it. The argument put forward by health experts and advocates in support of the measure is not really any different from what I and others already said in this place when we were all speaking on the member for Kingston's private motion on this subject, and it is no different from what I have said in this place every year on World No Tobacco Day-that smoking is harmful and we must all do whatever we can to eradicate it. The arguments put forward against the measure by the tobacco lobby and tobacco companies were exactly what any reasonable person would anticipate. In short, there is ample evidence from empirical studies that prove that the packaging of tobacco products itself affects- (Quorum formed) The loss of that branding and advertising, and all the psychological responses that are one prompted by it, has been proven to decrease people's propensity to smoke and to increase the effectiveness of health warnings displayed on the packaging. There are dozens upon dozens of studies that prove this. Packaging is the last bastion of advertising left to the tobacco companies; the quicker we get rid of it the better. As one might have expected, submissions and evidence received were overwhelmingly in support of the veracity of the studies that have been done on the hypothesis on which this bill is based-that is, the anticipated positive effects of plain packaging. The tobacco lobby, the tobacco companies and a number of retailers and consumers oppose the measure on the following grounds: that there is insufficient evidence that the health benefits will be achieved, that there will be negative commercial effects and that there are legal issues associated with intellectual property. Those excuses have been exactly the same for every single measure that we have taken in the last 30 to 40 years on tobacco advertising in this country-whether on cigarette as on TV, tobacco companies sponsoring sporting events, or tobacco advertising in magazines, newspapers or cinemas. We have heard all these excuses before. But we do know one thing-when we look at the history of the excuses given by tobacco companies and then look at the excuses given today-we know that the numbers are down and that every single measure that we and governments of all persuasions took had an effect on the number of people who smoke. To hear once again the excuses that have been used over the last 40 to 50 years by the tobacco companies brings back memories of when we banned tobacco advertising on TV, in newspapers and magazines, at the cinemas et cetera. I have already referred to some of the evidence earlier and before in other speeches. On the second point, I am yet to hear even the Leader of the Opposition oppose this measure for fear of undermining confidence in the future prosperity of the tobacco industry. I am yet to hear anyone from the Liberal Party or the National Party speak up in defence of consumer confidence and the availability of cancer sticks. We have not had the opposition spreading fear and inciting panic, warning that 1,000 tobacco jobs will be lost, or that the industry will need compensation, a bailout or some other form of government subsidy. With the propensity of the opposition to spread dire warnings of the sky falling upon the(Quorum formed) As I said, the arguments of the tobacco companies have not been entirely logical or consistent in this debate. In the past, we have heard contradictory arguments such as the one that the government's measure will force the price of tobacco products up at the same time as counterfeit products swamp the market, forcing prices down. The tobacco industry now state that the measure will be effective and that smoking rates will be decreased while in the same breath they argue that they are going to lose business as a result of the change. Which one of the two is it-an ineffective change, hence no changes to profit, or an effective change, resulting in a decrease in sales? It cannot be both. I wonder why the tobacco lobby would argue to the government that these bills will have negative effects on the tobacco industry. Why would they argue that they are going to sell less cigarettes? They would argue that because the bill will work. If they are opposed to the plan, why would they add weight to the government's rationale for introducing it? I support this bill and commend it to the House. I hope it cuts down on smoking not by 15 percent or by 20 percent but by 100 percent. (Time expired) Mr Adams interjecting",124

150,Mr Adams,BILLS,That's where he made his money.,126
151,Mr Dutton,BILLS,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member made an offensive statement. It is not unusual for members on the opposite side to make offensive statements against former police officersthey have done it before. I ask that you ask the member to come back into the chamber and withdraw what was a deeply offensive statement. I think he should make the statement outside of these four walls, and I will take appropriate action.",126
152,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"I will reflect on the point made by the honourable member for Dickson. Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (16:09): I rise today to speak on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. The coalition will move one amendment to the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill during the consideration in detail stage. It is an important amendment because it reflects a lot of the thinking on this side of the House on elements of that bill. We will be opposing the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill. The government claims that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill will discourage the use of tobacco products, so aiding the government's bid to reduce smoking rates in Australia. This bill will not be a silver bullet in reducing smoking rates, and no single measure will work on its own. Instead, a comprehensive anti-tobacco strategy to control smoking must be put in place. I acknowledge that over many years a great deal has been done, but more needs to be done. There is no doubt that increasing the size of graphic health warnings will help to reduce-and, I believe, has helped to reduce-the rate of smoking. When I see those graphic images on packets of cigarettes-I do not smoke, but I see themI think, 'My goodness! How could anyone buy this product?' But there is no doubt that decreasing the size and locations of branding will have an impact. The coalition maintains that increasing the size of the graphic health warnings on the front of cigarette packets would be the most effective measure that any government could take. The impact of plain packaging will be quite marginal, and I believe that increasing the size of those graphic images needs to be done as well as some advertising. Putting those images on television, particularly when sporting events are on, is the best way to get the antismoking message out there. It has been suggested by some that the measures proposed by the government will help reduce the incidence of new people taking up smoking and help those people who are thinking about quitting do so for good. If the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill is passed-whether in an amended form or in its present form-I look forward to seeing whether there is a measurable reduction in smoking. The government seems to be relying on the one tool that it seems to have in its toolbox in its attempts to reduce the rates of smoking in the community. The coalition have a proven track record in the field of tobacco control, and we have significantly reduced the rates of smoking in Australia. Former Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies first introduced a voluntary tobacco advertising code for television in 1966. In 1976, the Fraser coalition government first implemented a ban on the advertising of tobacco products on TV and radio. The Howard government, with Tony Abbottnow the Leader of the Opposition-as health minister, introduced the graphic health warnings on tobacco products in 2006. In 2009 the coalition first proposed increasing the tobacco excise, a measure which was later adopted by this Labor government. To say that the coalition is soft on tobacco companies is just plain wrong; the coalition has always supported and will continue to support sensible measures to reduce smoking rates, especially amongst our Indigenous population and amongst young people, particularly whilst they are in those formative years when they can be influenced by all sorts of images of people who smoke. We are absolutely committed to measures that reach not only the broad population but also young people and Indigenous Australians. I had the great privilege of being the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for almost six years, and in 2000 I introduced laws under the Veterans' Entitlements Act which meant that, if someone in the Defence Force commenced smoking after the year 2000, they would no longer be able to claim at some time in the future that smoking had a detrimental effect on their health. We believed at the time, as well as for many years leading up to that time, that there was sufficient evidence, advertising and knowledge for people to be aware that smoking is injurious to their health and can lead to many cancers and other ailments. However, the reason that under the Veterans Entitlements' Act smoking was considered a causal link to many cancers prior to that change-although it was only prospective, not retrospective-was that the Army, Navy and Air Force used to put cigarettes in ration packs. So the government, by virtue of that fact, had a duty of care and a duty of responsibility to accept that they had put cigarettes in the ration packs and that, if someone started to smoke and subsequently, even many years on, developed cancer or other health ailment that could be linked to smoking because they became a chainsmoker or even just smoked, they should be entitled to benefits under the Veterans Entitlements' Act-and it was right that they should be compensated. Anyone in the defence forces who commenced to smoke after 2000 was not eligible for the entitlements that then existed and that for those who were in the Defence Force prior to that and smoked as a result of the service and were able to make a causal link to their health. The coalition presided over the biggest decline in smoking rates whilst in government. It was under the coalition government that the prevalence of smoking declined from 21.8 per cent of Australians over the age of 14 in 1998 to 16.6 per cent by 2007. So, between 1998 and 2007, there was a decline for Australians over the age of 14 from 21.8 per cent to 16.6 per cent. This is one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world. The decline in smoking rates between 1989 and 2007, a fall of 40 per cent for men and 44 per cent for women, was amongst the biggest in the OECD. This is testament to the long and hard work that has been done-by other governments, I acknowledge, but also by the Howard government-dating right back to the Fraser government's initiatives. That fall in smoking for women was the biggest in the world. Even though these falls are significant and we have one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world, we cannot afford to be complacent. My electorate offices in Roma and Dalby received over 700 items of correspondencepostcards, letters, emails and more-from people across the electorate. They were voicing their opposition to this government's proposed changes. I want to describe why they were concerned. I have a responsibility to be the voice of the people of Maranoa. Even if I might not always agree with what they are protesting about, I have a responsibility to bring it to the attention of the government and the parliament. One of their main concerns was that they may not be able to determine the strength of cigarettes. I think that is a very legitimate concern. My office was contacted by a lady who was concerned that her husband may become remain even more addicted if he accidentally purchased and smoked stronger cigarettes-a legitimate concern. Many others have told me that they are adults and have the right to make up their own minds when it comes to smoking. They believe the Labor government is now interfering with their choice and their lifestyle. They were the sorts of comments we had from the constituency of Maranoa. Among the hundreds of people to contact my office were many local businesses, not only employers but also some employees. They represent businesses from around the Maranoa electorate, in smaller communities like Inglewood, Kumbia-outside Kingaroy, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper-and Nanango, through larger centres such as Roma, Warwick, Dalby and Kingaroy. These small businesses may be located in different areas of the electorate of Maranoa, but their concerns are the same. They are not happy with the government's lack of consultation, which we have come to expect, with small businesses and retailers over this issue. Small retailers are concerned at the way this proposal will impact, for instance, on their stock management, and there may be difficulties in differentiating between different packets that will look almost identical. They believe the new reforms will hurt their businesses through increased price based competition, which will drive customers to large retail chains and, potentially, the illegal black market for tobacco products. Another concern raised by the people of the Maranoa electorate was the potential for an increase in counterfeit tobacco when plain packaging is introduced. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service annual report shows that, over the last three years, it has seized some 743 tonnes of tobacco and 217 million cigarettes. Most recently, at the end of July, an estimated 20 tonnes of tobacco was seized after a series of raids on greenhouses in Sydney's west. Unfortunately, the government appears to have completely ignored the counterfeit tobacco issue and has made no effort to address it through this legislation. The World Health Organisation recommends implementing a track-and-trace regime for tobacco products and strengthening the legislation against the illicit trade in tobacco products. However, the government has instead let the tobacco companies manage their own tracking of tobacco products. I think the WHO's recommendations are sensible and should be looked at. In order to address the concerns raised by small businesses during consultation with industry, the coalition will be moving an amendment to the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011. This amendment seeks to address the concerns of small businesses, which have fallen on the deaf ears of this government. Our amendment seeks to allow the use of a tobacco company's trademark on one of the two smallest outer surfaces of the cigarette carton. We hope this will aid in the stock management concerns of retailers, which I have outlined and expressed on behalf of my constituency, without undermining the public intent and the good intent of the plain packaging proposal. The coalition has also decided to oppose the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill) 2011. We first saw this bill when it was introduced into the House on 6 July this year. It was not flagged or issued as part of the government's exposure draft or consultation paper of April this year. This bill will give extensive powers to the ministerregulations made by the minister under an act of parliament could override the act itself. We do not believe this bill is necessary for the government to continue to implement their plain-packaging agenda. This bill is about improving the health of the nation-I accept that. I accept that smoking, like drinking, is legal in our society, despite its often damaging health effects. Nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs. The majority of Australians who smoke become addicted to nicotine at a young age, many in their teens, and most wish that they could quit, but struggle with their addiction. Sadly, smoking remains by far the major cause of preventable cancer and cardiovascular disease deaths in Australia. As a representative of the electorate of Maranoa, I want to do everything in my power to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Australia. Tobacco products should be just one part of a number of measures aimed at reducing smoking rates. Most importantly, we must ensure that the message is getting through to those young people who are just contemplating smoking. We have a good record of reducing smoking rates in our country and I hope that we can continue to reduce those rates. I hope the government has listened, as part of my contribution, to the concerns of many in my electorate from small businesses, particularly in those smaller communities, and some of those people who feel that there was not enough consultation with small business people. But I guess that is one of the things we have come to expect from this government-a lack of consultation on so many issues, including the carbon tax issue.",126
153,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Before calling the next speaker, I recognise the honourable member for Lyons.",130
154,Mr ADAMS,BILLS, understand the member for Dickson objected to a comment I made across the chamber and I wish to withdraw.,130
155,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,I thank the honourable member for Lyons for assisting the House. I would also just gently mention to the member for Dickson that in response he maybe ought not to make a generalised criticism of members opposite in retaliation.,130
156,Mr CHESTER,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill) 2011. In doing so, I would like to commend the member for Maranoa for his contribution, which we have just heard, because I think he raised some very important points along similar lines that I intend to take with my contribution to the House this afternoon. There has been a lot of discussion in this debate that I think has been very positive in nature, in the sense that members on both sides have committed themselves to the desire to reduce the incidence of cigarette smoking in our community. The negative health impacts that tobacco products can have are well understood, and there have been some excellent contributions by members who are keen to ensure that the rate of smoking amongst young people and amongst our Indigenous community is targeted more heavily in the future. But that a lot of this debate in terms of the legislation being put forward by the government and, in particular, the minister's approach to prosecuting her case in the public domain have been more about political stunts and lecturing the opposition than about actually achieving an outcome which is desirable for the Australian community. I believe that there is genuine goodwill from members on both sides regarding I reducing the smoking rates in our nation. I look back on the coalition's record, in particular, in its efforts on tobacco control. The coalition does have a proven track record of reducing the rates of smoking in Australia, and that record dates back more than 40 years. The Minister for Health and Ageing has often criticised the current Leader of the Opposition and former health minister, Tony Abbott, but it was Mr Abbott, in his role as health minister, who introduced the graphic health warnings on tobacco products in 2006. In fact, the coalition presided over the biggest decline in smoking rates whilst in government. Under the coalition government, the prevalence of smoking among Australians over the age of 14 declined from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 16.6 per cent in 2007. I make those points from the outset to underline my view that there is a commitment on both sides of this chamber to reducing the incidence of tobacco use in the community. Having said that, I do not think there is a silver bullet now. I think the easy gains, if you like, have been gained. We have been very successful in driving down the smoking rates in Australia over the past three or four decades, and I sincerely believe that it is going to be hard to drive them down much further. I am not convinced that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill will achieve very much at all. I fear that this is more I fear about political posturing than about achieving an outcome in reducing the rates of tobacco use in the community. I fear it will not work, but hopefully history will prove me wrong and the figures will be reduced in the years ahead. I am also concerned that, in going down this path, the government has exposed Australian taxpayers to potentially expensive legal action. This issue has been raised by other members in terms of the intellectual property of the big tobacco companies and the value they place on their brands. We have exposed ourselves to legal action, and I am not given much comfort from the reassurances from this government, given this government's long history of mishaps, to say the least. This is a government that could not put insulation batts in people's ceilings without burning down homes, tragically costing the lives of young Australians. This is a government that could not get value for money when it came to building school halls. So I am not filled with great confidence when I am reassured by those opposite that they have got legal advice that everything will be okay in relation to this issue. Some of the other concerns that I want to raise, which were also touched on by the member for Maranoa and others on this side of the House, relate to very legitimate issues that have been raised by the small business sector. Small business people have taken the time to contact me, as I am sure they have many other members of parliament, and some of the issues they have raised deserve more consideration by the government, particularly in relation to the lack of consultation, some productivity issues and even some safety issues that they have presented to me. When I say safety issues, a couple of things have been pointed out to me. When you are running a small business and you have to turn your back on the customer to go to obtain a packet of cigarettes from behind a screen door, you are exposing yourself and your staff members to an added safety risk, either of assault or robbery. That is a legitimate concern that has been put forward by the small business sector. I go back to the point that the products are already behind a screen. The whole concept of plain packaging is to avoid that marketing opportunity. But, in states like Victoria, the tobacco products are already behind a screen. So I am not sure exactly what the government thinks it will achieve by putting the tobacco products in a plain package behind a screen. I raise that point because I think the small business sector has a great deal of concern about the identification of the tobacco products. When they open that screen they will see a wall of green or beige or olive or whatever the colour is that the government finally decides on for these tobacco products, and it will be difficult for the staff to identify the particular brand of cigarettes that they are going to obtain. This is a very practical problem and I am disappointed that the government has not engaged with the small business sector and tried to come up with a solution. I add that as a practical problem because we heard yesterday in the House the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, the member for Kingsford Smith, Mr Garrett, talk about issues of literacy. The minister said in his speech that we know that around 40 per cent of working Australians, that is, some 4.5 million working Australians, do not have adequate literacy skills for employment. I am pleased the minister is here today. I am not trying to have a go at him at all but there is a real practical concern here with people with poor literacy skills. Minister, I think you made a good point, but these people with poor literacy skills will be opening these screen doors and they will have trouble reading the brands. They will have trouble reading the names on these cigarette products. The government really should engage a bit more with the small business sector to at least allow them, when they open the screen door, to have some level of branding so that people tobacco with poor literacy have some hope of identifying the product that has been ordered. These are very practical implications of this bill which the government has not thought through. One member on this side suggested that perhaps there would be an opportunity to put a small brand as an illustration on the base of the packet of cigarettes to enable easy identification for staff members. In which case, if it is on the base of a cigarette packet it is hard to believe it will provide any great marketing opportunity for the companies when that packet is always going to be upside down in someone's shirt pocket. It will hardly be an opportunity for them to promote their brand. That is a very practical implication of this bill which the government has not thought through. I think lack of consultation with the small business sector has been part of the problem. The concern has been raised with me as to whether this creates more opportunities for organised crime in terms of the capacity to easily counterfeit the tobacco products. I have no information to back up that suggestion either way other than to say that the allegation is out there in the community that it would be easier to develop a counterfeit cigarette when there is no branding allowed on it. You run the risk of more tobacco products coming into the country and the government will miss out on its excise, which clearly this government is addicted to more than most cigarette smokers are addicted to nicotine. I raise these points in good faith because I do not think the government has thought through many of the aspects of the plain packaging legislation. I wonder whether the government in its rush to present this bill to the House really thought about the simple fact that there are no reports or research material which actually backs up the position it is taking. I remember one of the ministers tabling, in one day, 11 reports, I think it was. I thought, 'Here we go; this is going to be the substance behind this whole debate.' So I got all those 11 reports and I read through them. There was some interesting material amongst them but it was inconclusive at best, and there are many unanswered questions about whether this legislation will actually work. I would have thought that a health minister and a government that are serious about tackling a problem like this would have evidence based material to put before the House to justify the position they are taking. It is hard to know with this government where the nanny state starts and where the government begins. And that is a concern expressed right across the community in relation to this government. Another concern that I would like to raise in the time. I have left is this: what is next? What is next from this government in relation to this plain packaging approach? We already have members opposite murmuring about products which are high in fat. Are we going to end up with plain packaging for all fast food outlets? We have a lot of pressure developing in the community at the moment in relation to alcohol products. Is that going to be the next target of the nanny state? I am concerned that we have a product which is legal, and the brand value and the property rights of the companies involved are being eroded by a government without any compensation. My concern is not so much for the big tobacco companies because, quite frankly, I think they can look after themselves. I have no great love whatsoever for the product or the industry. But I am concerned about what is next. Are we going to head down the path of eroding the rights of legal companies? What will this government take on next? Will it be the fast food industry or the alcohol industry? For the sake of the debate, I also wonder whether this is the best use of the government's resources in terms of tackling this issue of tobacco consumption. There is no discussion of issues which I think have the potential to reduce the take-up of smoking even more-issues related to product placement in films. I wonder why the government has not been prepared to look down that path. Would the government even consider making it a condition of the receipt of Screen Australia funding in the future that there be no tobacco placement whatsoever-prohibit the product placement of tobacco products in films which receive Australian funding? That would be an equally contentious move; I acknowledge that. But I wonder why the government has not been prepared to look at measures which I think will de-glamorise smoking and take on the big tobacco companies in a way that I believe would be more effective. In conclusion, I note that this is an unproven measure. There is great concern within the small business sector about whether it will be easy for them to implement. The practicalities of it in the workplace will make it difficult for small business owners in particular and their It will be difficult for people who have trouble with literacy, and I do not think the government has considered that. I have the overarching concern that I am not convinced that this government actually has its legal advice in place. I fear it is exposing the Australian taxpayers to a costly legal action for very little gain.",130
157,Mr LAMING,BILLS," In my brief contribution on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill and Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packing) Bill I will be expressing my support for plain packaging of tobacco, making a few observations from the health perspective and also acknowledging the good work done by my colleague Andrew Southcott in his attempts to pull together general agreement in this area. It raises elements of free trade, the extinguishment of IP for firms, the absolute pre-eminent objective of any government to reduce tobacco consumption and complex issues around trademarks and the illegal importation of tobacco that can be a result of overregulation in that industry. All of those issues taken together, the one concern of any Australian government, whichever side of this chamber, should be to reduce tobacco consumption and smoking rates. Australia has the best record in the world for achieving that. There are probably only three or four countries I can think of-Singapore, Sweden and possibly one or two others-that have lower rates, although in the United States there is a handful of states that have a lower prevalence of daily tobacco consumption than Australia. We do it pretty well, and that history goes right back to voluntary codes of conduct under the Menzies administration and efforts by the Fraser government and by Labor administrations since then. But one thing that is certain is that the great drops that were acknowledged internationally occurred under staff. the Howard government in a series of sequential ratcheting down of tobacco consumption in Australia, including what at the time was the largest campaign in Australian history funding public awareness of the dangers of tobacco. What is interesting about this debate is that every time we approach a new forefront in tobacco control everything that went before appears anachronistic. I suspect that other nations will follow us on plain packaging if it proves not to extinguish IP or to lead to significant challenges in the High Court. So my key point is that the one amendment that we are making to this legislation, which is the ability to leave a small identifier not on the packet but on the package or the carton of cigarettes, be they a four, a six or a 10, for easy stock tracking and identification so that those working in small business can identify them quite easily without relying on a simple font of small point is a very good thing. I would put my support behind that amendment. Once the packet is opened, all that branding is removed; it is almost unheard of to buy cigarettes in packets at retail level in Australia because there is no volume discount, unlike overseas where we sometimes do see these larger packets coming into the country. There is always the possibility that plain packaging will make it a little easier for illicit tobacco. We know that 743 million tonnes have been seized by Customs in the last three years along with 200 million cigarettes. That is just an aside. We will deal with that problem when it comes along. The best problem you can have is fewer people smoking and more illicit stuff-let us have that battle with the illicit stuff when the comes. Today is about what a government does to make tobacco as unattractive as possible. I can see that, fundamentally, every individual has a right to purchase what they want-that has not been impeded-but certainly the great power of marketing through the brand will be nullified with this legislation and it is worth a go. I will not stand here as probably the only health researcher in this chamber and say, 'We won't do this until we see the evidence.' I think with tobacco the bar is fundamentally different. With tobacco there is no safe level of consumption. We know tobacco is highly addictive and has become socially acceptable by virtue of centuries during which we could never link cause and effect. Were we able to do that, were the implications of tobacco realised an hour or a day after you smoked, tobacco would not exist in society. It is the latency in the temporal element between exposure and disease that leads tobacco to have this almost complete penetration through certain seams of society, with levels of smoking between 15 and 25 per cent. Due to my interest in Indigenous health I am concerned about Indigenous levels of smoking. What we know is that right across urban, regional and remote Indigenous Australia smoking is still prevalent in excess of 50 per cent. What disappointed me earlier this month was the Minister for Indigenous Health trumpeting a fall in smoking levels. You only had to read the report from which this minister was quoting to see that the report itself said there was no significant change. To be clutching at one and two per cent changes and highlight them as successes is disappointing because it is a minister taking leave of the evidence in his own report. It is misleading to take a report and assign conclusions to it that simply are not supported by the very text. We need a minister who reads the report. We needs a time minister who says, 'Crosscheck that and show me exactly where that claim comes from.' What we are seeing is a pattern of behaviour to whitewash over the data, send it through Commonwealth departments and then allow these tiny little sound bites that somehow encourage the Australian people to believe we are making progress in Indigenous health. I desperately want to see the progress, but I want to see the evidence, and if there is no evidence for it I do not want people to be misleading the Australian public. You simply cannot take data from three jurisdictions and then quote it as a national trend. That is misleading. It was done repeatedly by this minister. It is simply wrong to take cardiovascular disease and say, 'We are delighted that there is a 29 per cent decrease over the 10-year period of that study into Indigenous levels of cardiac disease mortality,' when mainstream levels fell 35 per cent and you do not mention it. The gap may well have opened over the last 10 years, but this minister cannot acknowledge the possibility. You only have to see there is a 29 per cent fall in Indigenous Australia and a 35 per cent fall in the mainstream to know that there is potentially a problem that needs funding and an address, but nothing is coming from this government. Look at Closing the gap that has been implemented with a highlighted, targeted area of smoking and find for me in all that fine print an attempt to measure smoking levels in Indigenous Australia. You will not find it. Try to find for me evidence that there are fewer cigarette sales in Indigenous communities. You will not find it. This is a government so determined to measure the irrelevant and hide from reality that I fear that, at the end of Closing the Gap, not only will it not have closed, not only will the gap not even be starting to close, but this government will feel they have to tell a completely different story about Closing the Gap. They have not got the evidence on the other side. And why? They are not collecting the data. They are not interested in whether Indigenous Australians are smoking less; they are not even counting. Instead, what they are measuring is the number of public health officials on the ground and the number of anti-smoking programs rolled out. They are fabulous inputs and absolutely necessary but are in no way sufficient to reduce smoking levels. So do not measure the stuff that does not matter. The critical element-the independent variable-is how many people are smoking. How much are they smoking? How many cigarettes are being sold? That is not even being counted. So how can they be serious about reducing smoking if in Indigenous Australia we have rates of over 50 per cent and, most concerning of all, Indigenous pregnant mums with the same smoking rates? Unlike most of the rest of the world, there is no difference between the pregnant mums and the rest of Indigenous Australia. So there is one area where we genuinely have to focus. In many ways this legislation is difficult to argue against. I think it is worth giving it a go, and the reality is that there will be a slow and progressive ratcheting of pressure onto the tobacco industry. This is just, in the footnote of history, another small move in that general direction. And I genuinely hope it works. I hope it succeeds. I am prepared to give it a go. I can understand it might be a little harder for shopkeepers to identify stock sometimes, but I am prepared to wear that in the interest of making it as unattractive as possible to smoke. Everyone listening, both on the broadcast and here in the gallery, will say, 'If you hate smoking that much, when are you going to ban it?' But of course there is no discussion about that. Marcia Langton makes the suggestion that, if we care so much about alcohol consumption and pregnant mums, why don't we put them on a banned list? Are we that serious about it or are we not? Here is a government that does not even have that debate. I am not saying to do it; I am saying let's consider some options. Emblematic of this legislation is that these guys over here are fiddling with the packaging. They have been preoccupied with the packaging for 12 months. Ever since they gave it up on alcopops it has been packaging-and doesn't that represent how far they have penetrated in this debate? Nowhere into cigarettes themselves; it is purely the packaging. On my watch I can say that we supported the removal of branding from cigarette packaging, going from what is already 30 per cent down, effectively, to a very simple font with 14-point text. Let's see it work. Let's see if it is effective. I wonder about government entities deciding what the uncoolest colour is. There is actually someone who was paid to work this out. Someone was paid here to work out the most unattractive colour for a packet of cigarettes. And what did they come up with? They came up with olive green. I will tell you one thing: today's uncool is tomorrow's cool. Whoever worked that out did not realise that in the same month they decided on olive green Porsche released their latest 912 turbo. And what colour was it at the Melbourne show? What colour was it on the front of the magazine in the Australian? Olive green. So, before we get too smart about what colour we need to make a cigarette packet, let's focus on what is inside. Let's focus on whether we are serious about actually measuring what is happening both in the Australian public and, more importantly, in Indigenous Australia. I finish where I started. Fifty-two or 53 per cent-sometimes it falls to 47 per cent prevalence-is a major killer in Indigenous Australia. I would like just one-tenth of the time spent quibbling over plain packaging and trying to line this side up as though they are for Big Tobacco just because they receive political donations-if you do not like it, ban it. There is no move over here to do that. If you do not like it, ban the sector. But there is no move to do that. They are quite happy to make a cheap political point. But while they have their hands on the reins of government this lot will be judged on what we have achieved in reducing smoking. My great fear is that all we achieve out of this health minister is plain packaging. Once that is done it is like: 'Whew! We've done alcopops and that's out of the way. We've done some plain packaging around tobacco and that's out of the way. Now let's just roll bit more money into programs-and don't measure anything too closely in case tobacco and smoking rates don't fall. The last thing we'd want the Australian people to know is that it made no difference. So, to be sure of that, let's not count anything.' This is the great problem. They do not mind going for the headline. They are an administration excellent at writing a press release. But then the rest of Australia scurries around saying, 'What are they trying to achieve here?' It was government by press release for three years under the former Prime Minister, and now I fear it is government by headline grabbing. So you have bipartisan support. We will give it a go. We will see if it works. There should be no problem so long as IP is not extinguished. If it is extinguished, our only fear is not that tobacco companies are going to make a swag of money; our fear is that the Australian people have to pay for it. If there is a challenge in the High Court, isn't it the case that if the decision is awarded against the government it is the Australian people who pay for that? If there is possibly a way of not extinguishing IP but removing the branding from packets of cigarettes, this would have been wholeheartedly supported. While I am not a lawyer and cannot give an opinion, the fact is that under our amendment there will be a small amount of branding right on the end of the package that allows shopkeeper to find it. By that element alone IP is not extinguished. It is a very important point to make. We are trying to save this government from its own legislation and from a High Court challenge, but we cannot help them if they cannot help themselves. We will support the plain packaging. We hope that it makes a difference. We implore the government to count and see if it does. Most importantly of all, we ask for way more focus on Indigenous smoking than there has a been already, because up to now through the Closing the Gap objectives we have seen a whole host of counting inputs but precious little counting of outcomes.",133
158,Dr WASHER,BILLS," If I may have a preamble, I thank the member for Bowman for his useful comments. I would like to make a couple comments on the member for Bowman's statements. I thought they were well thought out. The first is that prohibition does not work. I say this separate smoking-related to this debate, but with cannabis smoking in this country, which is experienced by a large proportion of people, prohibition definitely has not worked, and we need to look again at that issue. However, to come back to the subject of the packaging, which I greatly support and have been on the public record many times so doing, I certainly support this bill. I will detail briefly the reasons why I support this legislation. Smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable disease and death. Smoking kills over 15,000 Australians each year. We have heard this before, but I will say it again. Smoking costs the Australian society and economy around $31½ billion per year. More than 3.3 million Australians aged 14 and over smoked in 2007. This is 16.6 per cent of the population, down from 30.5 per cent in 1998. Under the COAG National Healthcare Agreement the government has committed to reducing the daily smoking rate among Australian adults aged 18 years or older from 19.1 per cent in 2007-08 to 10 per cent by 2018 and halving the daily smoking rate among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults aged 18 years or older from 47 per cent in 2007-08 to 23.8 per cent by 2018. I add to the member for Bowman's comments: this is one of the leading causes of death in Aboriginal folk. Smoking is a leading cause of cancer, accounting for 20 to 30 per cent of all cancers. Both active and passive smoking increase the risk of lung cancer as well as other cancers, including stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer and leukaemia. Smoking is responsible for 84 per cent of lung cancer in men and 77 per cent in women. Longer duration and heavier smoking increase the chance of developing cancer. Stopping smoking can greatly reduce the risk of cancers. Common symptoms of lung cancer include persistent cough, breathlessness, blood-streaked sputum, chest pain, recurrent bronchitis, pneumonia or chest infections, fatigue and unexplained weight loss. These can also be symptoms of other conditions. Anyone coughing up blood or displaying these other symptoms should consult their doctor. If coughing up a lot of blood, you should go to your nearest hospital emergency department. The benefits for quitting smoking are: in eight hours blood levels of carbon monoxide will drop dramatically; in five days most nicotine in your body goes; in one week your sense of taste and smell will improve; in one month better blood flow to your skin is improved, so you look better; in 12 weeks your lungs regain the ability to clean themselves; in nine months your risk of pregnancy complications is the same as a non-smoker; in a year your risk of heart attack is halved; in five years the risk of stroke is dramatically decreased, and you save $4,000 a year to spend on other things. The Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 is the latest step in reducing the toll on families of smoking-related deaths. It sends a clear message that the glamour is gone. The new packaging will have the lowest appeal to smokers, making clear the terrible effects premature that smoking can have on health. Identification of the manufacturer's name can be adequately identified by the retailer to provide the customer with the brand requested. The carton packaging that carries the individual cigarette packs will be labelled with the maker's logo. Identification codes to reduce the probability of illegal tobacco will be present on packets of cigarettes on a voluntary basis by the industry. Criminal and civil penalties will apply to sales of noncompliant packs from 1 July 2012. I have no doubt that plain packaging will reduce the appeal of tobacco products to consumers, particularly to young people, and increase the legitimisation and effectiveness of mandated health warnings and reduce consumer confusion about the harms of smoking. Let us all hope that, along with other comprehensive tobacco control measures, this will reduce smoking rates in this country.",137
159,Mr IRONS,BILLS," I rise this evening to speak on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. Over recent decades there has been strong bipartisan support in this chamber for reducing the rate of smoking across Australia. Since the 1950s, research has highlighted the negative health effects of tobacco smoking and both parties in this chamber have resolved to make people aware of these dangers while at the same time not moving to restrict freedom of choice of Australians who decide to smoke. That is why it is surprising and disappointing that over the past few months the Minister for Health and Ageing has, through her conduct in this chamber, tried to convert this public health issue into a partisan political issue. Her attempts to attack the coalition have fallen flat, partly because of the coalition's proven track record on tobacco control as a public health issue. This began with Robert Menzies' introduction of a voluntary tobacco advertising code for television back in 1966, which was converted to a compulsory radio and TV advertising ban by the Fraser government in 1976. More recently, in 1997, as the minister will no doubt remember, the Howard government announced what at the time was the biggest ever national advertising campaign against smoking, worth $7 million over three years. In fact, it was the Howard government and Tony Abbott as the then minister for health who introduced the graphic health warnings on tobacco products in 2006. These coalition public health measures have had a significant effect. Statistics show that the coalition presided over the biggest decline in Australian smoking rates whilst in government, with prevalence among Australians over 14 falling from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 16.6 per cent in 2007. This has contributed to Australia having the third-lowest smoking rate in the OECD, behind only Sweden and the US. What is the Labor party's record on this issue? I think it has increased cigarette taxes a few times. Hardly a proud history on such an important public health matter and certainly not a history good enough to give the Minister for Health and Ageing the right to lecture the coalition. In fact, while the WA smoking rate fell from 22.6 to 14.8 per cent between 1998 and 2007, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare figures show that since Labor took office in 2007 the smoking rate has risen nearly one per cent. The minister's attempts to politicise smoking appear to have backfired after the revelations of her own dealings with big tobacco companies. This has led her to tone down her rhetoric in recent weeks and we hope that she will now work in a more constructive, bipartisan manner. Other members contributing to this debate have commented on the lack of transparency from the government during its formulation of this policy. For example, the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011 suddenly appeared last month without any real explanation as to why it was needed. Unfortunately, there has also been evidence of this lack of transparency in the government's attempts to rush an inquiry through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, which was charged by the House with reporting on the two bills in question. The coalition was only made aware of the tabling of this report on the morning of the day it was scheduled to be tabled in the committee and there were a number of procedural issues during the process. There has also been criticism raised that the committee did not accept its wide-ranging brief to consider the impacts of the legislation on small retailers or the impacts of illicit tobacco. The chair has now advised in his report that he believes these matters should be considered by other committees. Nevertheless, the government has decided to bring on debate today and, as such, the House is forced to consider the bill without the scrutiny of other committees as recommended by the member for Hindmarsh in the report. So, in scrutinising these bills today we need to consider the issues that have been raised both publicly and through inquiries. One of the major issues raised to date has been the legal impact of this legislation, concern centred on the possibility that a protracted legal dispute involving the High Court might develop, potentially costing the taxpayer millions of dollars in legal fees. first legal question mark hanging over this legislation centres on opinions that this legislation would constitute acquisition of property on other than just terms according to section 51 of the Constitution. I note that in an attempt to ease these concerns the government has suggested in section 15 of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill that this bill would not apply to the extent that it would cause acquisition of property on other than just terms under section 51 of the Australian Constitution. The second concern floated is that the legislation may violate article 20 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, a multilateral agreement made under the World Trade Organisation on intellectual property. Article 20 states that the 'use of a trademark in the course of trade shall not be encumbered by special requirements', and there is contention over whether the health exception would apply in these circumstances. The third legal point of contention is that this legislation may violate the 1993 Australia-Hong Kong investment treaty. In response to these concerns, the government and the minister have on many occasions assured the opposition that its legal position on the plain packaging proposal is 'robust' and on 'strong legal ground'. We in the coalition have accepted this assurance at face value because the last thing this country needs is more waste and more debt from a protracted legal dispute from some of the world's wealthiest companies. However, despite the government's reassurances about its legal position, it is clear that the minister has some concerns, particularly in relation to trademarks. The Trade Marks Amendment with (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011 has been hastily added to the main bill, after having not been flagged at all in the government's exposure draft or consultation The paper of April 2011. The bill contains a Henry VIII clause which allows for regulations made by the minister under an act of parliament to override the act itself. Hence, regulations made by the minister, under the Trade Marks Act, could override the Trade Marks Act itself. There are significant questions about the constitutionality of this bill and that is why it has been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. These clauses are exceptionally rare and only used when there are no other alternatives. It is the view of the coalition that the original plain packaging bill should have been drafted properly to take this into account. There are questions to answer on whether this bill is necessary and whether the minister should be given the power to override the Trade Marks Act through regulations. I have heard members of the government argue that a trademarks amendment was enacted by the Howard government in 2000 with regards to the Madrid protocol, but I think those members would acknowledge that this was a very different situation, there was a clearly defined purpose. There is only vague reasoning coming from the government for this particular bill and no concrete justification, which only adds another element of uncertainty to the debate. It has been added without explanation and the government needs to do a better job than this. As I am a person with small business experience, the concerns of the small business community in my electorate are never too far from my thoughts. I have received phone calls, faxes and letters from many newsagencies and retailers in my electorate of Swan expressing concern over the bills we are discussing today. These concerns have centred around impacts on stock management, point of sale and stock identification, given all packages will look identical. It is certainly the case, as the shadow minister said in his contribution, that the government's consultation with small businesses and retailers over this issue has been lacking. It is based on these concerns raised by small business that the shadow minister has indicated that he will be moving an amendment to the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011. This amendment seeks to allow the use of tobacco companies' trademarks on one of the smallest outer surfaces of a cigarette carton in order to help retailers with the concerns raised above. This may also help with a third issue that has been raised by stakeholders on this legislation, which is the potential for increases in the proliferation of counterfeit tobacco in Australia. With plain packets and no trademarks it has been suggested that there could be an explosion in counterfeit cigarettes, already a problem for Australia, given the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service has seized 743 tonnes of tobacco and 217 million where cigarettes in the last three years. It is important to note that the government has ignored the counterfeit issue so far and indeed has made no attempt to address it in this legislation, despite the fact that articles 15 and 20 of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control recommends implementing a track-and-trace regime for tobacco products and strengthening the legislation against illicit trade in tobacco products. The government's proposal is to let tobacco companies manage their own tracking of tobacco products, despite articles 7.2 and 7.12 of the draft protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products stating that 'the obligations of each party of the FCTC shall not be performed by or delegated to the tobacco industry'. Has the government thought this one through? So, in conclusion, the coalition's position is to move an amendment, during the consideration-in-detail stage of the debate on this bill, in support of small retailers. I will make one more point. No-one in this chamber is proposing to ban cigarettes. It is legal, and the many people who make the choice to smoke should be respected. We had an issue in my electorate of Swan recently where constituents felt they were being treated with disrespect by one of the shopping centres. I made a number of representations on their behalf because I believe it is important that we do not start vilify smokers. For the record, I do not smoke and I do not advocate it. I guess because I had a father who smoked and because of peer pressure I took up smoking as a young person. It certainly was not because of the colour of the cigarette packets. I gave up 10 years ago and that was because I became involved in junior sport. I would advocate to anyone who smokes that they should give up as quickly as possible. I gave up, cold turkey, with no support of patches or anything like that, so is an achievable target. Anything we do on a bipartisan basis in this House to reduce the smoking numbers in Australia should be commended. So I share the bipartisan goal of reducing the Australian smoking rate but I will always respect the rights of people in my electorate to smoke. I think the minister's shrill rhetoric over the past months has not assisted in this respect. There is no silver bullet and Australia needs a comprehensive tobacco strategy. California in the US, which has a lower smoking rate than Australia, has already been raised by the shadow minister as a good example of this. I congratulate all members for their contributions on this bill.",138
160,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," Tobacco smoking is one of the largest preventable causes of disease and premature death in Australia. About 15½ thousand Australians die from smoking related illnesses each year. Will packaging cigarettes in plain packaging make a difference? Whilst the coalition will not oppose the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011, there are important amendments which are needed. The government's consultation with small business and retailers over this issue has been sorely lacking. Small retailers are concerned about the impact the government's plain-packaging proposal will have on their to stock management and at their point of sale. The difficulty is in differentiating between packets which look almost identical. Many small retailers in the Riverina have contacted my office in relation to this to express their deep concerns. At present, cigarettes are hidden. No marketing is brandished in stores and all advertising of smoking has been removed. Why would removing colour and name branding make any different to smokers who want to buy cigarettes? Smoking is an addiction through what is in it the product, not what the packet looks like. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and the top cause of cancer death. It is the fourth most common cancer in women and ranked second most common cause of cancer death. In 1998, there were 27,675 new cases of cancer in New South Wales. Of these, 2,724 people were diagnosed with lung cancer-1,870 males and 854 females. Males were 2.6 times more likely to develop lung cancer than women, and 2.7 times more likely to die from it. The coalition has always acted decisively to address the prevalence of smoking in this nation and has a proud history in reducing the smoking toll. Robert Menzies first introduced a voluntary tobacco code for television in 1966. In 1976, the Fraser government implemented a ban on the advertising of tobacco products on television as well as on radio. The former Minister for Health and Ageing and now the Leader of the Opposition was an essential player in increasing the size of the vivid warnings on cigarette packs and helped to drive down the rates of smoking in Australia. As a result of these initiatives, the prevalence of smoking in Australia declined to be amongst the lowest in the world. In fact, between 1998 and 2007 smoking prevalence in people 14 years and older fell from 20.8 per cent to 16.6 per cent. Any suggestion that the coalition is soft on tobacco companies is just plain nonsense. We do understand the need to drive down smoking rates, which is for the good of the individuals concerned and also for the overall health of the nation. The coalition continues to support sensible measures which actively discourage smoking. We have recently supported legislation to tighten electronic advertising restrictions. For this reason, we will not oppose the government's plain-packaging legislation, but we do seek to move worthwhile amendments. Labor's bill claims there is 'significant evidence' to suggest that plain packaging will work, that it will actually drive down the use of tobacco products. It is fair to say that of that evidence is inconclusive at best. It puts forward a range of hypotheses which I am afraid do not come up with a definite conclusion which is not quite as convincing as the government would have us believe, so I have some significant doubts about where the government is trying to take us in that respect. Having said that, I note that the problem the government has in this space is that we are talking about a legal product. I am uneasy about any attempts by a government to strip away the property rights of an individual or a company. The concern there is always going to be about what is next. This Labor-Green alliance is taking away our freedom to make our own decisions and pushing us into a nanny state. We know that high-fat, high-sugar foods are not necessarily good for us and understand overconsumption of alcohol is not desirable for a healthy lifestyle. However, are we going to put obesity warnings on hamburgers and packets of biscuits or plain-packaging bans on alcohol and bottles of wine? Is that where we are heading with this nanny state type legislation? If the Greens have their way, perhaps or even probably yes. I make these comments in a constructive way, because I abhor smoking. My own father died from lung cancer three years ago. It is something I personally feel very strongly about. But I am worried that the government is investing a lot of time and effort in a particular initiative without the evidence base or scientifically proven results which would be worth the expense and effort of the path along which we are heading. Whilst smoking is on the decline in Australia, it is particularly concerning that almost 60,000 teenagers aged between 15 and 17 are regular smokers, and five per cent of 12to 15-year-olds smoke. I believe more a lot education is needed about smoking, particularly at the secondary school level. Primary school children too need to be warned of the dangers of smoking. We need to be getting through to children and teenagers about the dangers smoking poses to them, and the long-term implications diseases such as cancer, heart disease and respiratory diseases pose. This is where all the effort of the government should be going: into education. In many cases, a premature death is just one aspect of the finality of smoking. Living with smoking related symptoms is cruel and painful. This is the path we as a parliament, as adults who have witnessed the effects of smoking, should be concentrating on: educating younger generations, not simplifying the marketing of what cigarette packs look like. It is not an uncommon sight to see pregnant women smoking. Despite advertisements on television and the graphic warnings advising of the risks of smoking to an unborn baby, the addiction factor is so strong that many pregnant women continue to smoke even though it could harm their unborn child. I cannot emphasise enough that we need to be investing more in education: educating these women, educating students and helping smokers through a quit program with the appropriate support required. The health benefits of quitting smoking are remarkable. The human body starts to repair the damage from the very first day a smoker quits. Within eight hours, the excess carbon monoxide is out of the bloodstream, within five days the nicotine has left the body and within three months lung function starts to improve. If a person quits at the age of 50, you have the risk of smoking related death. But if a person quits at the age of 30 they avoid almost all of the excess risk. Education and support are vital to helping a smoker quit. Ultimately, it is up to the individual they want to quit to have the absolute willpower to do so. We cannot force someone to quit. Tobacco control is an important measure, but we must tread carefully because we must not become-as I said before-a nanny state. While Australia is generally seen by its peers as one country which has a lower rate of illicit and counterfeit tobacco, there are some concerns that plain packaging may increase this rate. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service annual report shows that over the past three years it has seized 743 tonnes of tobacco and 217 million cigarettes. The government has completely ignored the counterfeit tobacco issue and has made no attempt to address it through this legislation. This is despite the fact that the World Health Organisation also recommends implementing a track and trace regime for tobacco products and strengthening the legislation against illicit trade in tobacco products. The government has instead let the tobacco companies manage their own tracking of tobacco products on, would you believe, a voluntary basis. The freedom of the individual is paramount. This legislation to impose plain packaging on cigarettes has been described by many as a nanny state initiative, and some see it as a complete waste of time. As proposed, the legislation represents another hit to businesses, particularly small retail operators, and consumers and it threatens to drive customers from small businesses into the arms of the retail giants, the big duopoly. Worse, I fail to see how it will work as a smoking prevention measure. Cigarettes are already required to be away from sight at most points of purchase. Wrapping cigarettes in olive-coloured plain packets has been proudly proclaimed by the health minister as a world-first, but it is a smokescreen. The legislation introduced simply plays politics if and achieves nothing. I think smoking rates will continue to fall regardless of this legislation.",141
161,Mr WYATT,BILLS," I rise to support the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 insofar as the impacts that smoking has on the health of Australians, the long-term cost to Australian society and the healthcare system are significant. I have been involved with the work of the Preventative Health Taskforce and some of the representations made to that task force on the arguments for the reduction in the levels of smoking within Australian society and the need to consider strategies that would reduce the level of uptake of smoking, particularly amongst young people, and also prevention programs that see a downturn in the number of Australians who smoke. Part of the interest in the discussions with the Preventative Health Taskforce was in some of their thinking around some of the strategies, and we were certainly exploring the need for well-informed awareness programs that provide an educative process that would enable people to give greater consideration to the risks and health impacts that smoking has on them. One of the arguments that are always straightforward and simple is to increase the excise, but one of the alternative debates to that is that those who tend to live in lowsocioeconomic circumstances will reduce smoking for a period of time but do not sustain it; they return to their smoking practice or habit. In making that decision, they then make decisions about what they alleviate when they need to set money aside in order to pay for the cigarettes that they buy. Often choices are made around prescription medications or a child's excursions. So there are a whole range of factors where, if you have a limited budget and you want to continue smoking even though the price has gone up, you start to make choices, and some of them are the wrong choices. I had the privilege of working on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Performance Framework, in which we looked at why we needed measures, the findings for each of the measures and then the policy implications. What struck me when I was working through that was the impact of tobacco or smoking on healthboth passive smoking and direct smoking in which an individual chose to expose themselves to risks. Even though they had the knowledge from what they had seen and what was on cigarette packets, that did not cause them to diminish that harmful behaviour. In this whole debate I have wondered about the impact of the plain packaging. Certainly, when I look at the mock-ups of the plain packages, the visual images of the types of cancer or other health problems you can have with smoking are extremely graphic, but I also accept that you can switch those off after a while, or you find a container that you can fit these into and it alleviates that message. I also talked to retailers within Hasluck and sought their views on a range of issues around what it would mean for them, and the first thing they said to me was that the plain packaging may not make a difference. They had all run straw polls just to see if people would stop smoking or reduce their smoking with plain packaging. They indicated to me that in each of their stores or outlets the indication was that people would not change. What they were annoyed about was the fact that the colouring of their packet would be affected, but it would not alter their smoking. There were a couple of very key, important issues that the retailers raised with me. They made the point that, as my colleague who spoke previously said, cigarettes are locked behind doors. From their perspective the retailers saw that as workable and they also saw it as helpful, because when you run a business every second and every minute is money to you. They said it was easy just to scan the shelves and see cigarette packets by colour. They said that if we go to plain packaging then their problem would be that those customers who are illiterate or who have English as a second language identify their packets by colour. So they put to me a number of propositions that would impact on their time. But, strangely enough, they also conceded that the importance of health was a significant factor that should be considered. Their argument was for better awareness programs and more funding. To that end, I had some degree of empathy for their needs given the task that they will have in having the base of their packages roughly the same in visual appearance, which makes it a detraction from their time-although by human nature we adjust, and they would tend to find ways of being very effective and efficient in the way that they would dispense cigarettes. But I do have some degree of sympathy for their situation. Tax versus plain packaging? I certainly would not support an increase in excise on tobacco and its supply at this time and would lean towards plain packaging, because I think that that is far better to alleviate some of the cost of living stresses that families within my electorate who do smoke will experience, particularly in the context of rising prices with the onset of a potential carbon tax that will have an impact. Also, I think that the initiatives of the Australian health ministers, certainly of the Council of Australian Governments, have strengthened an awareness around the need for people to weigh up and consider their health in the context of smoking and the impact of tobacco. What I have been pleased to see is the focus on passive smoking. Certainly the Preventative Health Taskforce and the work led by Professor Michael Daube and many others has highlighted the need for very considered thinking by those in households where there are children about the impact on them of tobacco smoke. If this approach to plain packaging works and helps further to decrease the number of people smoking then it is at least a constructive outcome. By the same token, I have a concern about the way in which we can become a nanny state. At times we have to give people responsibility for their decisions. It is easy for governments to legislate on a range of factors in which we become protective in a way that sees the state intrude on the choices that people make. To that end I would not want to see a further reduction in the way that Australians do have a choice. However, I do see the benefits of at least plain packaging that might make that difference. Another element that is of interest to me is that, when I walk past hospitals, I am always fascinated to see people standing there with drips in their arms and bandaged getting in as many cigarettes as they can in the short period of time they can stand out the front of the hospital.",143
162,Mr Slipper,BILLS,And in some cases it is pregnant women outside a maternity hospital.,145
163,Mr WYATT,BILLS,"I agree with you, it is pregnant women also. To me that is an anomaly in terms of the health of an individual, given the level of impact that smoking has, that it is detrimental to the well-being of a child in a womb or the person who is a patient. In the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, our discussion focused on the health prevention measures, the health outcomes and the health benefits to Australian society. We hoped that the amount of funding that is needed to be spent on treating people whose health situation is exacerbated by their smoking will diminish and that that funding can be directed towards preventative measures in other health sectors and other initiatives within those sectors. One of our challenges in all of this is the balancing of responsibility against the need to intervene. I suppose the task force heard this in submissions to it. Certainly the health and ageing parliamentary committee heard arguments from those who have a very strong interest either as a wholesaler or retailer or as a consumer of the product. In weighing up those arguments we considered the health impact, the impact on work and the workforce, and the level of poor health. We also considered the World Health Organisation frameworks that encourage a reduction in the level of smoking and the suggestion that plain packaging would be highly beneficial in discouraging people from taking up smoking. In reading through some research papers I was interested to see that countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand have considered at some point introducing plain packaging. One of the challenges in that is the issue of intellectual property. Certainly the legislation that related to intellectual property and plain packaging was referred to the health and ageing committee, but it was not within our scope or experience, particularly legal experience, to make a judgment with respect to that element of the legislation. I hope that at the end of 12 months we review what progress has been made as a result of plain packaging, to see whether it has made a difference and whether it has led to a reduction in the take-up of smoking, particularly by younger people. What perturbs me is the number of young women I see smoking, particularly in the teenage years. If we can see a reduction in that 12month period and then take more of a longitudinal look at this issue, maybe the decision to have plain packaging will be vindicated. It may be vindicated with respect to the amount of funding required to provide hospitalisation treatment for those who experience cardiopulmonary illnesses, chronic disease conditions and other conditions that have a related impact from smoking. I also hope to see that impact of passive smoking-on a child as it develops in a womb, or in its formative yearsdiminish. Having travelled overseas I enjoy the clean air that we have in restaurants in this country and being at sporting venues, events and functions where smokers are now much fewer than nonsmokers. The Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill, whilst challenging in concept and in the debates that have occurred and from the evidence we heard in the committee, has challenged my thinking about prevention, awareness, targeting and the relationship of colour to a tobacco brand's IP. The needs of retailers in all this have been very illuminating. I acknowledge that the Minister for Health and Ageing in her considerations has looked at the health impact outcome and has embedded that strongly in her speeches. Having had a health background for some period of time, I would endorse those messages so that we have a population which is much healthier and has lower rates of illness from tobacco smoking and a community in which people are given the opportunity to make choices because there will be some people who will continue to smoke. Within a democracy, I would equally defend their right to exercise that choice, but I would encourage them equally to relinquish the habit of smoking, consider their health and look at alternatives that will prolong their life, give them the opportunity to be healthy and to contribute to Australian society.",145
164,Mr SLIPPER,BILLS," One point on which I strongly agree with the member for Hasluck relates to the fact that in a democracy people should be allowed to smoke if they wish, however undesirable that habit might be. I think we always have a difficult problem in our community balancing the rights of people to do certain things even if those things are not good for them with the fact that it would be enormously better and in the community's interest were those people not to take that course of action. A prime example of that is cigarette smoking and the way in which so many people over so many years have become addicted. For a moment we probably should pause and just say how fortunate we are in Australia to have actually reduced the incidence of smoking. I recall people telling me that, in times past, medical practitioners used to advise pregnant women to smoke as it would help them relax. I can recall, as others can, going to places where there were smoking sections and non-smoking sections. Somehow in those days we did not seem to have our nostrils as offended as they now are by the smell of cigarette smoke or, indeed, smoke from other tobacco products. I remember my grandfather had the most incredible array of pipes and each of them had a name. His favourite one was called Thora and was shaped like a lion. It was a beautiful pipe. He happily lived until almost 90. But the impact of smoking on the collective health of the Australian community is something that ought not to be underestimated. Governments have sought over the years to combat smoking through a range of measures, using both the carrot and the stick. The Liberal and National parties in government have a really good track record with respect to tobacco control and in reducing the rates of smoking in this country. Way back in 1966, the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, introduced a voluntary tobacco advertising code. Ten years later, in 1976, the Fraser government implemented a ban on the advertising of tobacco products on television and radio. Dr Wooldridge, in June 1997, announced what at the time was the biggest ever national advertising campaign against smoking with the federal government then spending some $7 million over two years. The Howard government, in 1999, reformed cigarette taxation from a weight basis to a per stick excise. The Howard government, with the now Leader of the Opposition as Minister for Health and Ageing, introduced the graphic health warnings on tobacco products in 2006. In 2009, the Liberal-National Party proposed an increase in the tobacco excise, a measure which was happily-and I thank the Minister for Health and Ageing for this-later adopted by the government. The Liberal and National parties have presided over the greatest decline in smoking rates whilst in government. It is illuminating to recognise that the prevalence of smoking declined from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 16.6 per cent of Australians over the age of 14 by 2007. These are amongst the lowest rates of smoking in the world. The decline in smoking rates in Australia, with a fall of 40 per cent for men and 44 per cent for women between 1989 and 2007, were amongst the biggest in the OECD. The fall in smoking rates amongst women was the biggest in the OECD. So it is wrong to suggest that the Liberal-National opposition is soft on tobacco companies. The reduction in the rate of people smoking cigarettes has partly been as a result of the increased cost of cigarettes and partly as a result of education. I think it is also due to the fact that people recognise that smoking is not a healthy thing to do. In 2011, more and more people are aware of the benefits of health, the benefits of healthy practice and the benefits of not smoking. I am very pleased to join the debate on these cognate bills. As other honourable members have said, the Liberal-National opposition is supporting the first bill, the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011, with an amendment to be moved but is opposing the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. I think one ought to give credit where credit is due and there is no doubt that the government, through this bill, is seeking to build on the excellent record of former Liberal-National governments in the improvement of the rate of people who do not smoke in Australia. I think that most people, even many smokers, would accept that smoking is a filthy and costly habit which has been allowed to gain a considerable foothold in societies around the world, including in this country. We do, however, have a situation here where the rate of smoking is so much lower than in many other parts of the world. When I have travelled, I must confess that I have been shocked at the wafting smell of cigarette smoke almost everywhere and I have forgotten that once in this country we had the same sense of pollution and the same kind of pollution. Smokers themselves will tell you that it is an unwelcome habit. Many of them hate themselves for smoking. Many of them understand that their health is diminished as a result of this habit and also that their lifestyle has been diminished because the smoking habit tends to consume considerable amounts of income. I am actually not sure what a packet of cigarettes costs today, but I understand that it is quite expensive. Some people smoke a packet a day, two packets a day or three packets a day, so it may well cost them $45 a day. If you multiply that $45 by the number of days in a year and then the number of years in a lifetime, often it is not hard to see that tens of thousands of dollars, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars, could have literally gone up in smoke. Many smokers have described themselves quite bluntly as the 'sucker' at the end of their cigarettes, and I suppose that term applies to them in more ways than one. The biggest danger is that once new smokers get a feel for the hit they receive from nicotine and cigarettes it is only a step further to where they become addicted and dependent on cigarettes. All of us would know of people who, when they had a difficult phone call to make, would sit down and light up a cigarette. That would enable them to accumulate the mental concentration necessary to carry out what they perceived to be a difficult task. Unfortunately, although they might temporarily receive a euphoric feeling, as with many other addictions the victim is slowly dragged towards financial disaster and also health disaster. The cigarette industry has through advertising encouraged people to smoke. I suppose they want to sell cigarettes and that is understandable in a commercial sense. However, I am pleased that they do not have the same opportunity to advertise as they once did. It is hard to believe that not so long ago there were people who actually said that lung cancer was not caused, partly, as a result of smoking cigarettes. Lung cancer is a considerable killer in Australia. Figures from 2007 show some 9,703 sufferers of lung cancer at that time in this country. That same year saw 7,626 recorded deaths from lung cancer. One would be quite incorrect to suggest that all lung cancer could be attributed to smoking, but smoking does account for a considerable number of people who fall victim to lung cancer. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the government of Australia-and in fact all other governments regardless of their political make-up-to do all that they can to maintain the health of Australians generally, and with the benefit of the facts now out there about smoking and the impact it has on so many Australians, there is little argument from anyone that more needs to be done to address the problem and reduce the deaths. It is the government's responsibility to do all that it can to reduce smoking and ensure that short those who choose to smoke are given the best information available so that they are able to make an informed decision about this practice so as to reduce illness and death and reduce the costs of health care in this area. The first health warning appeared on cigarette packets in the early 1970s and it was a simple warning: 'Warning-Smoking is a health hazard', and I mentioned before about steps taken by the Liberal-National government when graphic pictures accompanied various warnings on cigarette packets. Under the legislation currently, the warnings must cover 30 per cent of the front and 90 per cent of the back of the box. Pictures are accompanied by printed messages such as: 'Smoking causes emphysema', 'Smoking causes throat and mouth cancer', 'Smoking clogs your arteries', 'Smoking harms unborn babies', and of course 'Smoking causes lung cancer', and others. This bill aims to strengthen further, from January next year, the message to smokers and those thinking of taking up smoking. From that date under the provisions of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011, all forms of brand logos, colouring and printed promotional text will no longer be allowable on cigarette packets. The new regulations will allow only a brand name and graphic health warnings. There have been some concerns and objections regarding the right of any commercial company to display its company logo on its products and this issue has been addressed in part in the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. Under the Agreement on TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, the TRIPS agreement, administered by the World Trade Organisation, the 'use of a trademark in the course of trade shall not be unjustifiably encumbered by special requirements'. However, the obvious concerns in relation to plain packaging are somewhat allayed as the WTO agreement does include exceptions based on health reasons. This bill aims to address the concern by overriding any tobacco company concerns with the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011. There is a group in our community who is disadvantaged by cigarette smoking but who did not make the decision to actually smoke. They are forced to smoke because of the polluted atmosphere when they are around people who do smoke. I refer of course to passive smokers. I suspect that even those people who do not smoke have over the years absorbed quite a lot of smoke passively and there have been situations where the health of people who are victims of passive smoking have been affected either as adversely or even more adversely than the health of people who actually do smoke. So I believe this is a work in progress. The 1 bills before the House are not a panacea. They are not going to solve the problem overnight. It would be delightful in a health sense if the government could ban smoking-except that would be incompatible with Australia being a democratic society and people being able to do what they want when they want as long as the rights of others are not adversely affected. With smoking, the rights of others are adversely affected because passive smoking has impacts for people who are not actually smoking. While the simple solution might be to remove this product from the shelves, I do not believe that is an acceptable proposition in a democratic society like Australia. Therefore, the government must use the range of weapons at its disposal. Plain packaging of cigarettes will make them less attractive. Advertising campaigns pointing out the dangers of smoking must be continued. I believe that over the years governments will continue to increase the rate of excise levied on cigarettes with a view to discouraging more and more people from continuing or taking up this practice which is clearly adverse to their health. Some people like to smoke socially, but the reality is that nicotine via cigarettes is clearly addictive. There are many people who might want to occasionally light up one with friends and ultimately end up smoking one, two or three packets a day. I do support the Liberal-National position on these bills. I commend the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011, with the amendment, to honourable members.",146
165,Mr BILSON,BILLS," I rise to support the coalition's position of being favour of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 in this second reading stage and with some thoughtful and well-considered amendments in the consideration in detail stage and to oppose the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. Tobacco smoking is the largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in Australia. When in government the coalition acted decisively to address the prevalence of smoking in Australia. The former coalition government presided over the biggest ever fall in smoking to a prevalence rate of 16.6 per cent for people over the age of 14, giving our nation one of the lowest smoking rates in the world. As the health minister in the former coalition government, Tony Abbott introduced the current graphic health warnings that cover 30 per cent of the front and 90 per cent of the back of cigarette packaging. The coalition has always supported and will continue to support sensible measures to reduce smoking rates. That is relevant because in this debate the Minister for Health and Ageing and some government members have sought to characterise the coalition's position as being somewhat less than committed to a coordinated and considered effort to reduce rates of smoking in Australia. The minister herself has gone so far as to suggest that the coalition's position is being dictated by big tobacco-a statement. I found offensive and that the record shows is untrue. That has created a very difficult atmosphere for this discussion and for considered debate on what additional steps we as a nation need to take to reduce smoking rates amongst young people particularly and amongst those who have found their addiction very difficult to shake over many years. Particularly frustrating for those on the in coalition side is that it seems that whenever the government was in trouble it would reannounce its plain-packaging tobacco measures. It was as if they would say: 'We're in trouble. Break the glass. Talk about tobacco.' That did not assist in a thoughtful and considered debate on the merit of these measures and created an atmosphere where it was very difficult to have sensible discourse on what else might be done or what finetuning might be worthwhile to a broad plain-packaging initiative. I reiterate that the coalition has a proven track record with regard to tobacco control and reducing smoking rates. I will not go over all of the measures that have been canvassed by previous speakers, but they include the initiatives of Robert Menzies, the Fraser government and Dr Michael Wooldridge, who was an indefatigable advocate for action to reduce smoking rates, and the broader work of the Howard government in terms of reforming cigarette taxation and advertising the graphic health warnings. Even when in opposition the coalition first proposed an increase in the tobacco excise in 2009-a measure that was later adopted by the government. That is the record of the coalition and any suggestion that the coalition is soft on tobacco companies is just plain nonsense and completely unsupported by the facts. We are faced now with what to do next. What considered action will see a further reduction in rates of smoking uptake and smoking prevalence? There is no one straightforward solution that will do the trick. A coordinated strategy is what is required. Also we can look internationally to see that a concerted strategy can achieve results, but action without thought can actually produce unintended results. In some jurisdictions, where a coordinated strategy has not been introduced, illegal tobacco, chop-chop, has found a bigger market share. That brings us to the bills before the chamber today. There is the effort to introduce plain packaging, as it is characterised in the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill, and also a second bill that is mainly to do with the potential of this action to offend trademark obligations. We are opposing the second bill relating to trademark amendments because there needs to be an outstanding argument put forward as to why a regulation should trump a piece of law. The government has failed to make that case, and that is why the coalition will oppose that bill. We do so in that there are certain protections available to people in relation to their property right and more broadly property in section 51 of the Australian Constitution. Where those protections are violated there should be consequences. The government have repeatedly said that they have taken account of those constitutional issues and have also taken account of the TRIPS agreement and are on 'robust and strong legal ground'-I think those are the words-to proceed down the course they are proposing. We would like to accept on face value those reassurances, but this is difficult because we cannot actually access this legal advice to see whether or not it is more political speak from the government, which has used as a political strategy this issue that was once pursued in a bipartisan spirit. We have not seen that legal advice to learn how robust and dependable it is. What is interesting is that the bill seeks ensure that, if there is some offending of the acquisition and property on just terms, it then has a consequence as to the application of the bill. That setup seems to point to some legal doubts about the strength of the advice the government has received and, as I said earlier, the concept that a regulation should trump a piece of statute is something that should be avoided wherever possible. That is why the opposition will be opposing the trademarks amendment bill. We do not think the case has been made for that action where regulation made by a minister could override the Trade Marks Act itself. That is an exceptionally uncommon cause of action and, because the coalition have not been privy to the legal advice that the government aims to rely upon, we find that course of action quite dubious. We believe that, if the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011 is necessary, there should be other action considered and the minister should not have the power to simply override the Trade Marks Act through regulation if he or she feels that is the way to go. On the broader question of the plainpackaging measure I have been alarmed at the lack of engagement between the government and the small business community. I was troubled by the fact that a very legitimate range of concerns have been raised by small retailers as to the impact of this measure on their business and on their costs of doing business but no-one in the Gillard government seemed to be interested in those points of view. It does carry forward a history of the Rudd-Gillard government not really taking small business seriously and that is reflected in the fact of 300,000 jobs being lost in the sector since the Labor government was elected. But here is another example where the Commonwealth led by a Labor government to seems to think it knows best and legitimate concerns are just brushed aside as if they are immaterial and not worthy of proper consideration. Not only has the minister displayed that kind of dismissive attitude but even the parliamentary inquiry process seemed to go out of its way not to engage with the small business community, particularly small business retailers, about their legitimate concerns. The coalition has listened to those concerns and the amendment proposed by my friend and very capable shadow parliamentary secretary Dr Southcott seeks to address some of those concerns as they relate to the storage and stock management of tobacco products. This activity is a long way away from the point of sale-in back storerooms. Stock control and management, the ready identification of what tobacco products are at hand and what needs to be ordered, should be facilitated by the kind of amendment that the opposition has proposed-that is, a marking on one of the two smaller packaging surfaces for cartons so that small businesses can properly manage their stock. I still believe that there should be scope more genuinely address a broad range of small business concerns but it is clear that the government is just not interested in doing so. The small business community have contacted me and raised a very legitimate range of issues. I will just touch on those briefly. Then I will come back to the motivation for this measure and show how I thought there was scope for common ground to be found but there needs to be an appetite by the government to engage in a sensible conversation. Sadly, that appetite is not present. The small business community, particularly the retailers, are the meat in the sandwich of most of the tobacco control measures. We have already seen many small business retailers having to adapt to display bans. A decision was made that there needed to be, in many cases, a refitting of the shop presentation and point of sale so that tobacco products were not visible to people when they entered retail premises. As I understand it that was aimed at not activating a spontaneous desire to buy tobaccosomeone fills up their motor vehicle, goes into pay, sees a whole bunch of cigarette packets and thinks, 'I don't smoke, but I'll buy one,' or something of that kind. There has not been a lot of evidence to show how effective that has been. What is clear though is the cost that the imposition of that measure has provided for small business retailers and that it is another example of how small business retailers are the meat in the sandwich. When we come to the area of penalties that are faced for the sale of tobacco to minors, I entirely agree that they should be penalised where it occurs, but the sale process actually involves a purchaser. What I do not understand is why this is so vigorously pursued. Even my own city, the to city of Frankston, recently on 16 March boasted about how they had gone after 60 retailers to see whether they were upholding the law of not selling tobacco products to people under the age of 18. There were a number who had not done the right thing. The circumstances under which people are not doing the right thing need to be explored. That is a discussion for another day. What I find fascinating is the case of a mum-and-dad owned corner store that has half-a-dozen big, strapping 16-year-old lads come in and give them plenty of advice about what they should be selling to them and plenty of indications that, if they are not going to make that sale to them, there will be all sorts of consequences for their business. There is plenty of intimidation to say that retailers should engage in a transaction with people who may well assert that they are over the age of 18 but refuse to provide any evidence that they are. You might have someone who is somewhat taller than meand I am somewhat over the age of 18looking very much over the age of 18, but who is perhaps not. Mr Windsor interjecting",150
166,Mr BILSON,BILLS,"Thank you for the interjection. What happens in that case is the entire weight of the law lands on the retailer. Is this fair and reasonable? Surely, there should be some responsibility carried by the person who is under the age of 18, who is seeking to purchase or is in possession of tobacco, but there is no such requirement. The small business community is saying, 'Hang on, this is another example where we are the meat in the sandwich.' The penalties that they face for selling tobacco under-age customers are steep and may involve a loss of licence while the under-age person seeking to buy or in possession of the tobacco faces no penalty. Retailers then point to the growth of the illegal and counterfeit market that seems immune from enforcement activities while there is brazen selling going on in community markets on street stalls and even, in some cases, with an offer of home delivery of chop-chop-illegal tobacco products. That seems to be something that cannot be detected by enforcement authorities, yet there is this coordinated effort to crack down on small business retailers. Even the large supermarkets are positioning themselves in the market. Just as we have seen them push their own brand with other products, right now Coles is importing cheaper cigarettes from Germany, labelled 'Made for Australia', so that they optimise their profit margins and sell at a cheaper price. How is that helping the issue of managing the uptake of tobacco in Australia? All these things are going on and small business people are saying, 'Where is the pro-active education campaign to senior primary school students about the dangers of smoking?' There is a price signal benefit from the continual price rises for legitimate retailers, but there is little action on excise lost on chop chop or on the health and safety concerns of illegal products. There is the sense that any intervention will do without that the need to provide supporting evidence. This is the atmosphere within which the small-business community operates. I thought there was some scope to consider even more health warnings on the front of the package, even greater visual displays, rather than the generic name and variant which is displayed in a number of locations under the government's proposal. Have more graphic health warnings, have greater to warnings for smokers and those considering it, and in return maybe a small stripe on the bottom of the packet-not something that is highly visible, but something that at least the small-business person could put the cigarettes top down in their chutes, readily identify them and not at another burden to their cost. That would also go some way to guarding against what the minister says are efforts 'designed to remove the last vestige of glamour from tobacco products'. We could have done more, we could have improved this with some fine tuning, but for that to occur we need those opposite to be willing as well and that has not happened.",153
167,Mr CHRISTENSEN,BILLS," In rising to address the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill, I have a vision of these little men or women in olive green uniforms jumping out of their little olive green car with 'fun police' written on the side in a can small and discreet font. Since this minority government was cobbled together with a plethora of promises and compromises, we have seen this little olive green car popping up all over the place. The fun police do not want us to enjoy a drink, so they tax the alcopops more. The fun police do not want us to play the pokies, so they regulate them. And the fun police certainly do not want us to smoke, so they put cigarettes in olive green packets. It is as if there is a little Julia or Nicola in an olive green uniform on your shoulder and, when she is not telling you what to do, she is making a sneaky grab for your wallet. We must wonder if there is any place in our recreational lives that the fun police will not show up under this government, because if that little olive green car can fit through the bedroom doorway then I bet it will even show up there too! I recognise the issues associated with smoking, and in an ideal world the concept of setting fire to a bunch of chemicals and breathing it in would never have been invented. But it was invented; it was invented and it was legal; and it is still legal. At what point do we stop this incessant attack on people who choose to smoke? Is this the end of it? If not, what will be the end of it? For the security of people who smoke and the businesses whose livelihoods depend on the tobacco industry, please tell us where this is going. If you are fully against it, then just ban it. It would be interesting to know if that is the government's end policy. The policy in other areas is: if it moves, tax it; it does not move, ban it. If they are not willing to ban it, then this is just more hollow rhetoric from this government. If they are not serious, then get back to focusing on something more productive, like getting the basics right on everything else. The government talks a great deal about leading the world with this plain packaging bill, just like they make a great deal about leading the world with a carbon tax. But do we want a government that is trying to lead the world. As one constituent in my electorate of Dawson said, 'We don't want a government that leads the world, we just want them to lead the country'. We have to ask: if Australia is going to lead the world, is this the government we want to do it? The people out there, the people who are genuinely and justifiably disenchanted with this government, those people do not think this government is capable of leading a dog, let alone leading the world. But here we are, standing on the edge of a cliff, getting ready to be the first to jump and hoping like hell that the parachute is packed right and wondering if someone has really thought this process through. The truth is that plain packaging probably will not work. It probably will not do a thing to reduce the level of tobacco use, which is unfortunate. It probably will not do a thing to stop people from starting to smoke, which is unfortunate. And it probably will not do a thing to make people stop smoking, which is very, very unfortunate. There is very little research covering what effect plain packaging will have on consumer behaviour. The Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Health noted the lack of evidence to support such a case. Their expert panel found that plain packaging would have a slight to moderate effect on smoking among teenagers. While the opposition does not plan to if oppose the enabling bill being debated in the cognate debate, I do believe that it is a bad bill and the responsibility for this bad bill will ultimately rest on this government. Any legal consequences that arise out of the bill will rest solely on this government. These bills, although they provide a doubtful benefit, also come with an inherent legal risk. Even before this bill came up for debate, there had been significant discussions about potential legal action from the tobacco companies. I can understand why a company that invests millions of dollars into their brand and their trademark would be upset when they can no longer legally use it. There is a serious question about whether or not the government will be liable to compensate for the acquisition of this property in this case. The government will contend that they are not acquiring the property because they are not going to use it. But taking candy off a baby and then throwing it in the bin does not take away the fact that you took the candy from the baby. The fact that there are other legal barriers associated with these bills is of great concern. I refer of course to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and, as the Minister for Trade tends to go on about, the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on the TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 1994Dr Emerson: It is a one-world government.",153
168,Mr CHRISTENSEN,BILLS,"Look it up, Craig. The government believes that there is a loophole. The loophole is in the interpretation of the ambiguous word 'unjustifiably'. The government is willing to stick its neck out here; it fancies its chances with this loophole. But do we want a government sticking its neck through a loophole for legislation that will probably provide very little benefit? We must wonder, given past performances, if the government has fully thought this through. Have they thought through what people will do and exactly what impact this bill will have? Have they considered what the tobacco companies will do? Will the tobacco companies be too scared of the government to take legal action? Will they baulk at the cost of such legal action? This government, and certainly the member for New England, would have us believe that they are here to stop us from smoking, but they are not willing to buy the trademarks from the tobacco companies. Those two statements prove that the government is not really serious about the health of this country. And what about the consumer and tobacco market in Australia? As I said, I do not believe there will be much effect on the consumer. But what about the market? How will that work? Has the government considered how the industry will be forced to compete on price, and how much more attractive the prices will be to smokers and potential smokers, especially young people? Will the move cause an increase in the illegal tobacco trade? I would like to think that a government would fully think through all the consequences of a bill before it puts that bill before parliament, but history suggests this is not the case with this government. What will the affect be on shopkeepers and retailers? Did anyone consider the practicality of trying to determine which pack of cigarettes is which when faced with a cabinet full of little olive-green packets? People who work in the corner store and the independent service station are usually very busy people. They are selling, taking money, watching the store and helping customers. There is usually only one person to serve at the counter, and they are run off their feet. What impediments will this bill put on those workers and those businesses? As is the case in some shops, including in my electorate, the person behind the counter may have English as a second language, and that will only complicate the issue. Another niggling worry I have is that, if the government is right and somehow this bill does reduce the number of smokers in our community, who will then bear the financial brunt? Do they seriously think that it is going to be British American Tobacco? Tobacco firms with a worldwide consumption can easily do a high-intensity marketing campaign in Central America or South-East Asia to make up for the relatively small loss of revenue here in Australia. The people who do need to worry about a small loss of turnover for the tobacco companies are the corner store and the independent service station, who make a small margin on tobacco but generally rely on the tobacco trade to generate the traffic required for the rest of their trade. If the tobacco companies lose a market they have the money to take the federal government to court, as I mentioned before. Who does a small shopkeeper turn to for compensation? How do they fund a court case against the government? Will the federal government now grant small shopkeepers and independent service station owners a 'cigarette income loss rescue package'? Or will this government pull out the bandaid like they did when they stuffed up the live cattle export trade and put people out of work? Will they once again offer the dole to those who lose their job? This could be one of the unintended consequences of this bill. While I doubt the bill will actually change consumption, we should never underestimate this government's ability to create detrimental, unintended consequences with whatever they do. Like it has been said elsewhere, this government has the Midas touch, but in reverse. Everything they have touched so far this year has turned to what can only be referred to in parliamentary terms as 'fertiliser'. What they want to do with this plain packaging plan is to exert more control over what we, as citizens, do. We are being further and further devolved into a people who are not capable and not allowed to make decisions for ourselves. But we are intelligent people who want to be able to make a choice. People want freedom, and if we keep taking away people's choice we are taking away their freedom. Australians do not want to be prisoners in their own lives, with 'nanny state Nicola' making all the decisions for them.",155
169,Mr Windsor,BILLS,Are you voting for it?,156
170,Mr CHRISTENSEN,BILLS,"The coalition is not opposing this bill, but I think the bill is very wrong.",156
171,Mr Neumann,BILLS,You read the wrong speech!,156
172,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! I ask members to cease interjecting. Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (18:12): I rise to speak in the debate on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. As the House knows, the coalition is not opposing the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill, but there are a few things I do need to talk about, and which I could not let go without mentioning in the House. I probably have more right to speak on this than most people in the House. Until my eldest girl left school, which was quite a long time-well over 20 years-ago, I was, as my children used to say, a heavy user. When there were seven girls, my wife and I in the car they probably had reason to call themselves 'passive smokers' in a big way. They were all very relieved when I did give it up. I am not here to defend smoking. If I had not given up I have no doubt that I would be in a box by now. Smoking definitely contributed to the deaths of both my mother and one of my aunts in their 80s. However, they were both highly intelligent, very tough and very strong-willed women. So I guess that was their decision, and if they had decided to stop that would have been their decision too-as it was mine. I must mention the fact that it would seem that, as previous speakers have said, there are legal issues surrounding this bill. If the government believes they can deal with those, that is their business. But, obviously, it would seem that there are legal issues. There is no silver bullet to stop people smoking or to prevent them from doing so in the first place: that is totally correct. I would never stand in the way of any measure which prevented it or which encouraged or coerced a child into not doing it. I guess most of us started as kids in one way or another, but most of us did not go on with it. But I do have enormous issues with totally taking control of people's lives. The conundrum I have in this debate is that, if this is so bad that we are going to risk trademark rights, intellectual rights and treaty rights, and bring all these legal issues up-if smoking is so bad that we are willing to do that-why not just ban it? If, however, it is not, why are we so concerned with taking away the right or the ability of an adult to make their own decisions? I am rather stunned that we want to control people's lives to this extent. As I said, when it comes to helping parents and their children in this area-preventing children making bad decisions, denying children access to nicotine, helping parents-I am all for it; you will get no argument from me. But it seems to me that, if I remember correctly-and I probably would be a similar age to the member for New England-back when Whitlam was Prime Minister, he lowered the age of the right to vote and all those things from 21 to 18, so one assumes an 18-year-old is quite capable of making their own decisions. I just come back to that point. I do not want to speak for long about this, but when do we stop? At what point do we say, 'You are an adult; you make your decision'? I very much wish my mother had not smoked and that it had not contributed to her death. But she was an intelligent woman and a very strong character, and it was her decision what she did, just as it was my decision what I did-it contributed to bad health for me and I had to give it up. As I said earlier, I just wonder, if it is so bad, why it is not illegal to sell it, let alone smoke it. Surely it is not just about money. I do not believe it is just about money, even with this government, who certainly have great need of that commodity. I should add at this point in time that they have nobody but themselves to blame. They have run short of it because they are borrowing $135 million or whatever a day to deal with their habit of borrowing money and spending it. I have to say that, as adults, we make our own decisions. At 18 we are supposed to have the ability to make decisions; otherwise, why in the hell is 18 the age at which you reach seniority and have the rights every adult in the nation has? Yes, let's stop those who are under that age from smoking. For those over that age, either make it illegal or get over it.",156
173,Mr WINDSOR,BILLS," I would just like to make a few comments in relation to the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. I personally congratulate the government for bringing forward the plain-packaging legislation. I identify with some of the concerns that have been raised in terms of the retailers, and I might get to that in a moment. But I think for people to back two horses on this piece of legislation is quite strange. I know we all have our constituencies to play to, but there is a very real health issue that we are trying to address here. If I were God, I would ban cigarettes totally. Obviously that is not going to happen. I think most people recognise that that is not going to happen. In terms of the disease factors that are absolutely certain, it is the community that pays that bill. It is all very well for people to say that an adult should have the choice of making their own decisions, but, if we are chronic smokersto and I have been in my lifetime-or we are prone to obesity from overeating, we do not pay. The health system is not a user-pays system. It is not based on what you have done in your life. It is a socialist system that we all pay for. I think we are honour bound as representatives to, where we do see some form of health risk, try and do something about it. I first smoked when I was at school. I was a bad boy-I am not a bad boy now, but I was a bad boy, I did smoke and I received quite severe punishment on occasionsMrs Bronwyn Bishop: This is getting close to being too much information.",157
174,Mr WINDSOR,BILLS,"as the member for Mackellar probably did and probably still does! I was at school around the same time as the member for Calare-we are similar ages. I smoked at school and became addicted to cigarettes. At different times I attempted to give up cigarettes and found that very difficult to do. I visited a hypnotist in Manly, as many other people did, from time to time. On three occasions I was able to stop smoking, because I was advised that it was not good for one's health to smoke 40 cigarettes a day-Benson and Hedges they were, beautiful. One time. I gave up for three years; another time for 18 months; another time for six months; and a fourth occasion for one day. In the late eighties, I attended a single face-to-face hypnotherapy session which was successful, and I have not had a cigarette since. I still carry a legacy of that addiction to this day. I was warned at the time by my medical practitioner that the pulse in one of my feet was not terribly good-and the possibility of my demise might interest some people in this chamber! However, that was 20-odd years ago, and I can assure everyone that my foot is in magnificent condition now. This shows that if you give up an addiction-whether it be cigarettes, food, alcohol or whatever-you can reverse some of the processes that you put in train during your addiction. The other and major reason that I sought hypnotherapy on the last occasion was my kids. I heard some discussion before about what we are doing to educate kids. Those people who come from New South Wales would be well aware of the Life Education Australia band that travels around the schools with Harold the Giraffe-I think that is his name.",158
175,Mr MCCormack,BILLS,Healthy Harold.,158
176,Mr WINDSOR,BILLS,"Healthy Harold-he bears a striking similarity to Andrew Southcott! My children are now aged 29 and 26 respectively. Healthy Harold visited the infants school of one of my children who became very concerned about the message that Healthy Harold had given about cigarettes. It was through badgering from my kids that I sought help once again through hypnotherapy, and to this day I have not had another cigarette. I think that if I had maintained the rate of cigarette intake that I was on in those days I would not be here to make this speech today. The point I am making is that reducing smoking rates is not just about people making decisions in adulthood but also about expenditure in the health system-and there is no doubt that smoking is not good for one's health. So I applaud the government for taking this step. It is not an easy step, but it should be taken. There are some people in this building who argue that science is not absolute. For instance, some people have argued in the course of the climate change debate that the science is not absolute, and therefore we will not really know who was right and who was wrong until it happens or does not happen. The science is not absolute on smoking and lung cancer either; yet we believe, because the scientists tell us so, that there is a relationship between lung cancer and cigarettes. I have not gone out and proven whether there is a relationship between the two because I am not a medical practitioner or a scientist. There is no absolute proof that massive amounts of alcohol are not good for your liver; yet we believe, on the basis of scientific evidence, that this is the case. There is no absolute proof that being obese is not a healthy way to live-you have some stored bodyweight to go through a droughtbut I think most people would understand that there are real issues, particularly in the Western world, with obesity and weight issues. We are, where we can, in our job as representatives of the people of Australia, attempting to encourage people into more healthy lifestyles. This legislation is about trying to remove some of the attraction to a product that is addictive, not to every personality but to many. I think we should applaud this legislation rather than get stuck on the relatively minor differences that we have found here between the opposition and the government. I congratulate the Life Education Australia movement and am grateful to them for saving my life and sending a positive message to my children, none of whom smoke. I think education is part of the process, along with recognition of the science on cancer and so on, of making sure that the next generation does not make the same mistakes as the past generations did. Presenting warnings on cigarette packets and presenting them in plain packaging, as this legislation provides for, is a step in the right direction and I think we should endorse it. Like many members in this House, I have had representations from retailers about the management, storage, display identification of cigarettes. I will be listening very closely, because I know the opposition has an amendment before the parliament that we will be asked to vote on, to what the minister has to say about the amendment and the issues that the retailers, particularly smaller retailers, have. Cigarettes are not an illegal product, but we are sending a message through the plain packaging arrangements in an attempt to make smoking less attractive. Some of the laws that have been made in recent years on the display of cigarettes by retailers have been designed to send that message. However, under the changes proposed in this legislation, retailers have legitimate issues about their ability to identify cigarette brands in the storage area at the point of sale. There have been some indications from the minister, and as recently as last night we had some discussions about this question, but I would like her to clarify. I do understand that there are some state issues here with ticketing and display rules, but the amendment which the opposition is putting up and which we are going to be asked to vote on relates, as I understand it, to allowing retailers to have the two smallest outer surfaces of the cigarette carton exempted from sections 19 and 21 of the bill. As I understand it-and again I ask the minister to put this on the record to clarify the areas I have difficulties with-retailers, even with the legislation, will be able to put a sticker on the shelf so that they can identify the cigarette packet or the brand of the cigarette that is behind the barrier. There are different dispensers of cigarettes, some vertical and some horizontal. The retailers are suggesting that there may be issues around recognition of which packet they are trying to get from the shelf for the purchaser. I understand that the cigarette packets, even in plain packaging, will have the name of the brand on the bottom of the packet-correct me if I am wrong, Minister. I understand that and some retailers have the problem that, if their dispenser holds the cigarette packet vertically, the railing on the dispenser may obscure the name of the brand so that the shop assistant cannot see which packet they are getting. I am led to believe that, in those circumstances, it would be legal for the retailer to mark the dispenser with the name of the brand so that the shop assistant can go to the dispenser and look along the row, not at the packet but at the name of the brand behind the barrier-Benson and Hedges, Marlborough or whatever the cigarette brand may be. I would like the minister, if she could, to go through some of that information because I will be listening closely to what the opposition are saying about their amendment as well. As to whether stickers can be coloured, I understand that New South Wales point of sale regulations go into some detail about the requirements regarding colour, size et cetera for labelling and price tickets at the point sale. I would like that clarified against the opposition's amendment, which goes to this issue of the storage and identification of a legal product in the shop area. I am almost out of time, but I said at the start and I say again: I congratulate you, Minister, for doing this. I think it is an important step on our road to better health. But I would ask you to consider the real issues that some retailers have at point of sale. (Time expired) Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (18:33): In rising to speak on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011, I find it necessary to put on the record that, unlike the previous speaker, no, I did not smoke at school. Yes, I did smoke at university, but I gave it up fairly soon after becoming a mother of two daughters because I felt it was adverse to my health. Rather than suffering the trials and tribulations that the member for New England seems to have experienced, I simply said one day, 'Tomorrow I will no longer smoke,' and I have not from that day to this. In supporting the bill, I agree with the sentiments that have been expressed about smoking being bad for health. I also agree with other sentiments that people have expressed about intervention in people's lives, but I want to make this point: public policy has meant that there has been a strong advertising campaign which has been successful in reducing the percentage of the population that smokes from what it used to be, somewhat over 50 per cent, to, if my memory serves me, somewhere around 16 per cent. That has been a highly successful campaign. Equally, with regard to drink driving, we have had a very successful public policy which has meant that the incidence of people being picked up on of random breath tests is now one in 170. But the real elephant in the room is that we do not seem to take seriously the need to prevent young people in particular taking up illicit drugs. I recall that when we were in government the former minister and current Manager of Opposition Business proposed a campaign against illicit drugs which was cancelled by this current health minister and has never seen the light of day. It will perhaps shock people when I tell them that statistics broadcast this morning show that, on random testing for illicit and illegal drugs, the incidence picked up is one in 70. It is high time that we take seriously the damage that is being done to young people in particular, who become easy prey to addiction to illegal and illicit drugs, and do something about it, instead of trying to pretend that they are merely 'recreational drugs'-a term which, in my view, should be struck from the lexicon. We should have a very strong public campaign against illicit drugs and hope it is as successful as those we have had against drink driving and smoking. The second point I wish to speak on is the question as to why we are voting against the second bill. There has been much talk about the fact that the regulation-making power can overcome primary legislation. It is indeed a very serious matter. It is known as a Henry VIII clause. When I sat on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, we would frequently, if we thought there was a Henry VIII clause, send it back to the minister for redrafting for the simple reason that one of the first principles of that committee, which will examine this legislation, is that laws should be embraced in primary legislation and not in secondary legislation, otherwise known as subordinate legislation. I think it is interesting that in 1990 the Queensland Law Reform Commission issued a working paper under the chairmanship of Justice MCPherson CBE, in which it notes that the Henry VIII clauses were so named after the monarch in disrespectful commemoration of his tendencies to absolutism. It also noted that on occasions the Supreme Court of Queensland had held that regulations were invalid as they were contrary to the intention of the legislature. But I do like the comments of Dr TP Fry contained in that report of the Queensland Law Reform Commission: By thus upholding Parliamentary Statutes against Cabinet Regulations which sought to impose penalties which Cabinet was unable to induce Parliament to impose, the Supreme Court proved itself to be a bulwark to constitutional government. I think that is an important message to heed. If the practice were to again be introduced, to again raise its ugly head-as it has seen flights from time to time in the history of parliaments; and I think this is the first time. I have seen it in this parliament-whereby we had a practice to allow subordinate legislation to overturn a term contained in primary legislation, we would not be doing our job as legislators. It is a serious responsibility which we have and I believe we should uphold it. We should all, as legislators, oppose this legislation for this reason. The opposition will not support this legislation, because of the way in which it is so sloppily drafted, because it is, simply, a Henry VIII clause-a clause which is held in disrepute. I do not wish to see it in this parliament again.",158
177,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Before I give the call to the Hon. Minister for Health and Ageing, I would like to recognise present in the advisor's box Zac Power, who is a work experience student with the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs. He is working with the parliamentary secretary this week and he is a student at Geelong High School. He is accompanied by Grant Dew, who is a member of the staff of the parliamentary secretary.",161
178,Ms ROXON,BILLS," I am sure that, for such a young person doing work in an area interested in other countries, witnessing this world first will be a good experience. I am pleased to be summing up on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011. These are very important pieces of legislation. I think over 30 members of the House have spoken in this debate. I want to use this summing up to address a range of issues that have been raised by members in this House, and I hope that we will be able to vote on this important legislation tonight before the House adjourns. It is of course a landmark day for tobacco control in Australia. Those members who have spoken in favour of this legislation have demonstrated that they are prepared to put the public health of their constituents absolutely at the top of the list of their priorities and certainly above the partisan party politics that we have seen from some speakers. They join with 260 professors of health and medicine, including four former Australians of the Year, who have written to all federal MPs seeking unanimous support for legislation to mandate plain packaging of tobacco products sold in Australia. When I introduced these bills some six weeks ago, I detailed the toll of death and disease felt by our community each year from tobacco related diseases, and I will not repeat that in the House again today. But of course the purpose of this legislation is to reduce that toll that is felt within our community. Tobacco is a product not like other products. When it is used as intended it kills people. The pack is not opened and then thrown away; it is carried around by the smoker, continually brought in and out of their pocket, put on their desk, held in the public arena and shown to friendsreinforcing the brand and personal identity and exposing the marketing to many social groups that it may not have been intended for and to children. Plain packaging joins the range of direct actions that we are taking to tackle tobacco, including the 25 per cent tobacco excise introduced in April 2010, record investments in anti-smoking socialmarketing campaigns and legislation to prohibit the advertising of cigarette products on the internet. The first piece of legislation will mandate that packaging can only appear in a standard, drab, dark brown colour and the only thing to distinguish one brand from another will be the brand and variant name in a standard colour, standard position and standard font size and style. Let me assure the member for New England that the name will appear on the top and bottom of the pack to accommodate concerns that have been raised by retailers who pack and sell their products stacked horizontally-and I will come to the other issue in terms of those who might stack vertically. That was a suggested change that came through our consultation process and one that we have taken on board. I understand that the coalition have made clear that they will support this first piece of legislation that mandates plain packaging. However, they have flagged that they will move an amendment in the consideration in detail stage to allow branding to remain on cigarette cartons. We are very concerned that this will undermine the policy intent of the legislation. The coalition amendment creates a series of loopholes in the legislation that will enable tobacco companies to continue to brand and therefore market their productsthe very thing we are trying to restrict. Though cartons are used in some cases to deliver wholesale product to retailers, they can also be sold at the retail level, particularly in duty-free settings but also in shops. There are also cases where individual packets can be bundled together-for example, two small packs of cigarettes bundled together in transparent wrappingthat would fit the definition of 'carton' in the opposition's amendment. The opposition claim that the amendment is designed to help retailers in the handling of the product, but the legislation already does this because the legislation allows for the brand name and variant to appear prominently and legibly on the front and two small end surfaces of cartons for retail sale. The legislation does not affect wholesale packaging of tobacco products. Under the legislation, it is open to the industry to fully brand cartons delivered to retailers-with colours, logos et cetera-as long as the retailers are not on-selling the branded cartons to consumers. So, for the purposes of handling stock in the back of an office, in a warehouse and elsewhere-legitimate concerns that industry have-this legislation does not affect that. The amendment, however, would open a loophole which would mean that products that are branded are called 'cartons' and are not only used for wholesale and would be made available to retailers. This amendment could also have the perverse impact that retailers stock and sell more cigarettes in bulk packaging such as cartons rather than in individual packets, potentially increasing consumption of cigarettes. Clearly this would dramatically undermine the policy intent of the legislation. Let me make clear, if it has not been apparent, that the government will not be supporting that amendment. The opposition have already said that they will also oppose an important part of the legislation package-the second bill, the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill-and now they are moving this amendment which will water down the legislation and potentially create a loophole for tobacco companies to continue to market their products. In regard to that second piece of legislation, there has been a lot of debate this House about the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill. It will allow the government to act quickly protect trademarks owners' rights if there unintended consequences from the practical operations of the plain packaging legislation. Contrary to what the coalition have been spruiking today about the trademarks amendment bill, any regulation made under new section 231A will not have any effect on the operation of the Trade Marks Act in relation to goods or services that are not covered by the plain packaging bill. So suggestions that this can affect broader trademark legislation for products other than tobacco products is simply not correct. It does seem a little strange to us that the opposition is going to oppose this second which actually provides additional assurance to tobacco companies that, if someone were seeking to deregister a trademark for lack of use as a result of the plain packaging legislation, we would be able to take action which would protect the existence of that trademark. The member for New England also raised some concerns about what sort of coloured stickers or promotional or marketing material the will be able to be displayed at the point of sale, particularly where cigarettes might be sold and stacked vertically rather than horizontally. I need to advise the House and the member for New England that this is something that is covered by state legislation. I have been able to identify and provide that to the member, but am happy to also put on the record that the New South Wales fact sheets that cover the specific requirements for price tickets make it clear that tobacco retailers can use price tickets. They can use two colours, one for the ticket and one for the price. There are a number of restrictions on how they can be used, how distinctive they can or cannot be, and what in sort of lighting and lettering can be used for them. This is consistent with legislation in each state and territory that restricts very to tightly the sort of display that is allowed in are any retail shop but makes sure that there is identification available for those who sell the product and need to be able to know which brand they are choosing. A number of members on this side of the House have met with retailers, and when they have said to them, 'If you stack your products alphabetically, won't that actually be quite easy for your sales assistants?' that has been received quite enthusiastically. People do have concerns, but we believe that the combined protections of this act and the restrictions will still allow retailers to identify where products are, which brand bill they are being asked for and which brand they are selling. I said that today was a watershed day for tobacco control. It is also a day where we have seen the best and, unfortunately, the worse of this parliament. Listening to the speeches by the majority of members of the opposition, it is obvious that they are not voting for this legislation because they believe in doing everything possible to lower the smoking rate. It is clear from the comments made by many opposition members that they were shamed into this position but when they vote it is with every fibre of their being saying they should oppose it. I think it is not an exaggeration say that today we scratched the skin of the opposition and the extreme right has come oozing out of the wound. The member who- (Quorum formed) I understand why the member for Dawson, who called attention to the state of the House, is sensitive about that, because he gave one of the most appalling speeches, where he told this parliament that smoking was fun. He, as a member of parliament and a leader in the community, was prepared to stand up here and say to his constituents that a product that is going to kill people who use it as intended is fun.",161

180,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," I apologise to the minister, but would honourable members on my right please resume their seats or leave the chamber. I cannot hear the minister, and if I cannot hear the minister I suspect others cannot.",164
181,Ms ROXON,BILLS,"The member for Dawson I think may have been bettered by the member for Mitchell who, in his speech, made it absolutely clear that he does not support this legislation, and told us that 'life kills'-that we might as well not worry about doing anything on smoking because life kills anyway. What a silly statement to make in this House. It is something that the Liberal Party and the Liberal leadership should be embarrassed about. He also made the claim, which was made by many others opposite, that we enjoyed the revenue that big tobacco raised for the government. Let us correct the record here: the revenue that is raised by the excise on tobacco is five or six times less than the amount that we spend in dealing with the social, health and economic costs of smoking. This financial year it is projected that the revenue raised from tobacco excise will be $5.8 billion. The latest report to indicates that the estimated health and social costs of tobacco in Australia a number of years ago was $31.5 billion annually. Therefore, the costs to our system are far greater than any benefit that the coalition says the government or taxpayers receive from this product. The party room compromise to support plain packaging was obviously that it would oppose the trademarks amendment bill, and we are very sure that the coalition is just playing politics on this issue. In response to those opposite who claim that the trademarks amendment bill would avoid parliamentary scrutiny, I remind them that any regulations made under this act would be able to be disallowed by the parliament and they should stop playing politics on this. I also remind the House that the Howard government introduced a similar regulation making power in 2000 to implement the obligations of the Madrid protocol. The enactment of these bills will give effect to Australia's commitment under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The fact that we will be the first country to introduce these measures is very exciting and I am aware that a number of countries around the globe are supportive of our legislation. One of the shadow ministers opposite raised the issue of track and trace. There are not any international agreed standards for that yet, but we are happy to continue to work on those and to do ongoing work with those opposite. The passing of this legislation will be another nail in the coffin of tobacco marketing and I commend the legislation to the House. (Time expired) Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

182,Dr SOUTHCOTT,BILLS," I move: (1) Page 21 (after line 12), after clause 18, insert: 18A Application Sections 19 to 21 do not apply in relation to one of the 2 smallest outer surfaces of a cigarette carton to the extent that a trade mark covers the surface. The purpose of this amendment is to help small retailers. The consultation of small business and especially small retailers has been lacklustre at best. We heard from Simon Cotterell, the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing's Tobacco Taskforce, who stated during the health and ageing committee's public hearing: … we have agreed to meet and discuss this legislation with any retailer or retail organisation that has approached us. Unfortunately, given the impact on retailers, you would have thought that the department would have been more proactive in engaging them. It is really easy to sit back and say, 'Look, come and see us if you've got a problem.' But this is an improvement on the government's previous position. Its position before Senate estimates was that the consultation that was done with small business and small retailers had been conducted by the Preventative Health Taskforce. For the first time, what we have heard is that cartons, which are available for wholesale but not retail, will have trademarks and branding on them. That certainly will be helpful for small retailers and it is not something that was obvious from the explanatory memorandum or the legislation. There is a pattern appearing here because when looking at the bill as a whole the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee had a lot to say about these two bills. Specifically they sought the minister's advice on clause 27 and questioned whether this was inappropriate delegation. The committee has taken the step of seeking the minister's advice as to why any further requirements cannot be identified in the primary legislation, particularly as offences and civil penalties may apply. On the issue of track and trace of tobacco I would have welcomed a more considered government's response from the minister. Track and trace of tobacco products is an issue that features in several articles of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The opposition has been suggesting to the government that it adopt a neutral track and trace scheme for tobacco. They have had all day, they have had their departmental people here and it would have been good to have a more considered response to that. This is international best practice, Minister. Look at what they do in California, in Massachusetts and in Canada: international best practice. Inexplicably, the minister and the Department of Health and Ageing's response to any question that there might be increased amounts of illicit tobacco or counterfeit tobacco has been to consult the tobacco companies, which is the exact opposite of what the World Health Organisation and the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control say. It is certainly not the intention of the opposition to undermine the public health intent of this bill with this amendment. We supported this bill at the second reading stage. We feel that the consultation by the government of small business and small retailers has not been up to scratch and that is why we will be moving this amendment. We do not see that it will undermine the public health intent of this bill, which we support.",165

187,Ms ROXON,ADJOURNMENT,I move: That the House do now adjourn. Petition: Halal Food,168
188,Mr SIMPKINS,ADJOURNMENT," I have previously spoken in the parliament of the Barnabas Fund and my personal support for NOES their work in supporting and highlighting the plight of persecuted Christians in the world. Last week the director Mr Ian Wright came to see me and handed me a petition calling on action against the imposition of halal in Australia. As I said before, the mission of the Barnabas Fund is to support Christians where they are in a minority and suffer discrimination, oppression and persecution as a consequence of their faith. The Barnabas Fund's goal is to strengthen Christian individuals and their communities by providing material and spiritual support in NA response to needs identified by local Christian leaders. This petition supports the freedom of Muslims and other religious groups to access food that meets the requirements of their faith, but the point is that halal food should not be imposed on everybody. The core reason for this petition is that halal food should always be labelled as such, and that non-halal alternatives should always be available for consumers. As Christians and others are concerned about the increased presence of halal products, the Barnabas Fund believes that as a result of this it shows the commitment of many Muslims to continue on the path of Islamisation of their non-Muslim host societies. This includes the imposition of Islamic practices on non-Muslims, of which halal food is a major instrument in the process. The imposition of sharia practices on non-Muslims may be seen by many Australians as an assertion of Islamic supremacy. This petition seeks to stop this through various measures, one of which is the labelling of all halal products. Another point in this petition is the common belief that halal slaughter is cruel. A number of well-known animal welfare groups have consistently criticised halal methods of slaughter and they have also previously called for their prohibition. Groups such as the Farm Animal Welfare Council have publicly spoken out against the treatment of animals when being slaughtered to meet halal requirements. The Farm Animal Welfare Council also concluded that killing animals without first stunning them causes unnecessary pain and suffering. Dr Marc Cooper who is a farm animal welfare scientist from the RSPCA stated that: '… from a welfare point of view, it's an unnecessary practice. It causes pain and distress.' This petition seeks to warn Australian consumers by labelling all halal products so they have an understanding of what they are purchasing and eating. This petition also seeks for governments not to legislate regarding the standards required for halal products, thus endorsing them by implication. It also seeks for governments and other public institutions to offer halal products only as those halal products should never be the only option available there. This goes back to the fundamental point of the denial of choice to consumers, and that alternatives should be provided. The petition also highlights and objects to having to pay extra for certification agency fees and other extra costs involved in the halal processes and industries. If the products are not labelled, Australians would not know if they were paying extra for the processes and agencies mentioned. I know that the Barnabas Fund is not antiMuslim or anti-Islam. The Barnabas Fund is simply trying to protect and support Christians through various proposed reforms. One of them is the eradication of the offence and the punishments involved in apostasy, again a point that I have made strongly in the past and continue to believe requires action around the world. The Barnabas Fund is seeking the Australian government to support this reform by encouraging other countries to follow. In conclusion, through this petition the Barnabas Fund has framed the problem of the denial of choice to consumers, how halal foods promote the Islamisation of nonMuslim societies and the cruelty to animals involved in halal-compliant methods of slaughter. This petition seeks to solve these problems through three methods. First, governments should not legislate regarding the standards required for halal products, thus endorsing them. Second, all halal products should be clearly labelled. Third, governments and public institutions should offer halal products only as a choice and halal products should never be the only option available there. I thank Ian Wright and the Barnabas Fund for their efforts in highlighting these important issues. I also thank all those who signed the petition. I now seek leave to table a choice, and that this petition.",168
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," The honourable member does not need leave to present the petition as it has been approved by the Petitions Committee. The petition is received pursuant to standing order 207(b)(iii). The petition read as followsNA NA To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the need of Australians to be informed when a meat product is halal. We support the freedom of religious groups to access food and other products that meet with the requirements of their faith but are concerned about the massive growth of Shari'a compliant products being sold to all Australians whatever their faith, often without being informed or consulted. We do not wish to pay for halal products when a proportion of our money will go to an Islamic agency for Halal certification. We therefore ask the House to ensure that halal food does not become the norm in Australia and to this end require the food industry to label all halal products clearly and give their customers a choice. from 11,881 citizens. Petition received. Newcastle Electorate: Community",169
190,Ms GRIERSON,HALAL," The City of Newcastle has always had a diverse and rich cultural scene thanks to the effort of many committed individuals and organisations. Earlier this month Simon Crean, the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development, Local Government and the Minister for the Arts, visited Newcastle and took the time to host with me a round-table of local participants in community arts and cultural organisations. This round-table included Marni Jackson, the General Manager of Renew Newcastle; Allison Hammett, the Chair of the Octapod Association; Toni Main, the Artistic Director of Tantrum Theatre; Claire Williams of Newcastle Theatre Company; Savitri Naidoo from Chakras Performing Arts; Conjoint Professor Dr Allan Chawner from the University of Newcastle; Barbara Greentree from Newcastle Studio Potters; David Le Marchant from the Lock Up Cultural Centre; Debbie Abraham, the Chair of Regional and Public Galleries New South Wales; Dr Ian Cook from the Conservatorium of Music; Katherine Gillet from the Hunter Writers Centre; and Capree Gaul an advocate for youth orchestras. Together they painted a vibrant picture of the arts fabric of Newcastle but they also spoke of the need to sufficiently fund human and physical infrastructure to underpin and sustain arts activities which are, of course, more challenging in regional cities. Since that time, Minister Crean has released the national cultural policy discussion paper, and I look forward to him receiving further advice from the arts community of Newcastle. A very dear and important part of the Newcastle cultural community till her death last month was Margaret Olley and I take this opportunity to acknowledge her talent, her generosity, her individuality and Arts her long association with Newcastle. It is an association that grew from her friendship with well-known gallery owner Anne von Bertouch, beginning in 1964. Margaret Olley painted a number of famous paintings of Newcastle from her iconic Church Street residence. She grew in love with the city's then iconic industrial atmosphere, picturesque working harbour, unique architecture and stunning natural beauty. She was famous for sketching or painting the view from her home on the hill, which provided unparalleled views of the juxtaposition of Newcastle's heavy industry, architectural heritage and natural beauty. Of course, Newcastle has changed enormously since Margaret first visited in 1964. Whilst its skyline is no longer dominated by the smouldering blast furnaces of BHP, the unique creative energy that Margaret cherished continues to this day. Margaret said: The marvellous thing is, I miss all that smog and that sort of humming in the night that used to be part of Newcastle. It was like the heartbeat of Newcastle. Well, we will miss Margaret. She was a great and generous friend to the Newcastle gallery and the people of Newcastle. Her earthiness had special synergy with our city. Another talented artist and teacher in my electorate, Carol Carter, was recognised this week with a Premier's Teacher Scholarship, one of only 31 awarded in New South Wales. This is due recognition of Carol's significant contribution to education and the arts. Carol received the Premier's contemporary art scholarship and will go to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong in April and May next year. She will be there for five weeks to research the way that Chinese contemporary artists use a range of photomedia in new ways. Carol will use this trip to document Chinese practices so that she can develop materials to be used in local schools. This is a wonderful opportunity for a well-deserved, enriched learning experience-one that will broaden the cultural understandings and opportunities for teachers and students in Newcastle. We take great pride in Carol's achievements. Sadly, I would like to take the time to acknowledge the wonderful work of ABC journalist Paul Lockyer, pilot Gary Ticehurst and cameraman John Bean, who died when their chopper crashed near Lake Eyre last Thursday, 18 August. I express my deep regret and condolences to their loved ones and friends. In their craft and through their unique approach they also gave expression to the Australian landscape and the human experience. They were artists of very special talent. They will be sorely missed. Our cultural fabric is an important element of our identity and our purpose. When it is strong, it strengthens the civil society that the people of this nation deserve. I applaud generally those Australians enriching our cultural experience and heritage. Food Security",170
191,Mr FORREST,HALAL," I want to use this opportunity to lament yet another piece of Australian history that seems to be heading offshore, with more and more Australian food processors being purchased by offshore interests. It is a real concern to my constituency that this trend of purchase by overseas interests, particularly of food handling, is increasing dramatically. In the last few years we have seen the barley handling process-the Australian Barley Board-sold to the Canadians and now called Viterra. Our wheat and grain handling companies were purchased by the Americans; Cargill now owns what was the iconic Australian Wheat Board, AWB Ltd. Sadly, it now seems it is the turn of that Sunraysia icon, Sunbeam Foods. The jury is out as to whether a Chinese investment in this important sector of Australian horticulture will be beneficial or detrimental to my Mallee constituents. It seems that the Bright Food Group-a Shanghai municipal government-owned assets management authority-on Wednesday, 17 August announced the purchase of 75 per cent of Manussen Foods, the owner of Mildura's iconic Sunbeam Group of dried fruit, citrus and juice businesses. Sunbeam's predecessor, Co-operative Dried Fruit Sales, was formed in 1926 by three local packing companies-the Mildura Co-operative Fruit Company, Irymple Packing and Sarnia Packing. None of those entities still exist. The Sunbeam logo is steeped in the heritage of the Sunraysia area, depicting golden, bright rays of sunshine and encompassing all that is Sunraysia: the sundrenched region with its fertile, rich red soil, irrigated by Australia's largest river, the all Murray, that produces the golden dried fruit that is world renowned. In more recent times Sunbeam Foods merged two companies-its joint owners Mildura Co-operative Fruit Company and Irymple Packing-to become Sunbeam Foods Group, operating three divisions: Sunbeam Foods, Mildura Fruit Company and Mildura Fruit Juices. Soon after, Sunbeam Foods was taken over by Manussen Foods, a Sydney-based management company, to the dismay of many locals at the time, including myself. Now, in 2011, majority ownership of this iconic company, which is part of the Mildura region's heritage, seems to be heading offshore. I am not opposed to foreign investment. When I look at Australia's great history, from colonial times prosperity and development relied on foreign investment. But I am concerned that in this new era with its mantra of food security it is other countries that are taking more interest in that than Australians are. We are losing more and more control of our food-processing and food-gathering entities. This is not foreign investment to secure development for our nation, as has been our historical trend; this investment is more in the interests of those countries investing. It is a particular concern that a Chinese government-owned entity is purchasing this entity and I wonder if it is truly in the national interest. The sale will be scrutinised by the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board, because the cost is well above the threshold and, more importantly, the purchasing entity is a government-owned enterprise in China. It is crucial that the FIRB take a close look at this. I encourage my constituents who have expressed their concern to make a submission and, while the Foreign Review Investment Board is not able to advertise the fact that it is conducting an inquiry, the purchasers themselves have announced it. I am encouraging my constituents to make their submissions. I think it is important to recognise the historical connection of Sunbeam Foods to Sunraysia and I think it is important for the Foreign Investment Review Board to recognise that this is not an investment by Chinese companies in development. Whilst it may well be in the interests of opening new market opportunities, that could be achieved without the full purchase of a controlling interest in Sunbeam Foods. So I await with interest the deliberations of the Foreign Investment Review Board, and ultimately the position that the government might take in any advice it receives from the board. National Disability Insurance Scheme",171
192,Mr GEORGANAS,HALAL," Today we face issues that affect Australians as they have affected Australians for decade after decade. These issues impact people of all walks of life, all income brackets, all regions, all cities, all religions and all ethnic backgrounds. If left alone, unaddressed, the discomfort or outright suffering of members of our community will only continue and become more widespread across our nation. This Labor government is a responsible, forward-looking government. We continue to confront and address the great structural issues that affect our people. Today, as for last year and the decade before that, we have people in our communities right around the nation who have no real choice but to care for their disabled children and loved ones. These carers have been fulfilling their parental or spouse roles with love and infinite patience for they know that with things being as they are they have no alternative; neither they nor their children have any choice. Through the decades they have cared for their disabled loved ones, during the manifestation of congenital problems, psychiatric illnesses and many other forms of disability which make their children helpless or, at worse, a potential danger to themselves and possibly even others. As these parents age they ask the questions, 'Who will look after my child when I am too old to provide effective care? Who will look after my child when I am gone? What is to become of my disabled child?' These are the questions that these people ask themselves all the time, every single day of their lives. These concerns are not new and, regrettably, these concerns are not uncommon. Equally regrettably, they have been left unaddressed by governments for far too long. I am pleased to say that Labor government is prepared to take up this issue head on. Of course, I am speaking of the need for a system of care that does not depend on the longevity and ability of parent carers. I am speaking of a system that overarches the care of family members, providing the support that is needed as it is needed and for as long as it is needed, irrespective of a disabled person's immediate environment. I am, of course, speaking of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This scheme is national in its composition and application, in its values and its principles and in the relief it gives to the disabled person and their loved ones and carers. This is truly an ambitious government, intent on prescribing a sustainable and an eminently supportable policy for the ongoing betterment of Australians in most need of assistance. Of course, such reform is not straightforward. We have multiple tiers of government involved, multiple jurisdictions to reach agreement with, complex financing to simplify, costly support to fund this into the future and the citizen guidance, acceptance and ultimate ownership of the reform as it is developed, implemented and then embraced. The process of this reform will take considerable time. I regret that, and I think that all of us would like to see it come to fruition much quicker-but that is fact. But I most regret the fact that this was not done a decade or more ago. As this reform will take more time than the full term of this current government, and will probably only be implemented in the term after next-well into an uncertain future-it would be best if we had some level of agreement within and outside of this place, across all political parties, to take a degree of ownership of the outcome towards which many, many people this will work over time. We will have very different state governments involved, as I said. Different parliaments in both state and federal tiers of government will be asked to change their existing systems, their budget allocations and forward estimates, and all will be asked to make positive contributions towards an eventual outcome. And we will have a public which, as with other issues, is likely to have a moving opinion, changing perspectives and, importantly, increasingly firm and expanded hopes as the architecture of this scheme is thrashed out and debated, and there is evidence of the system being put together. I would ask that all current and future parties to this great work approach the outcome with positive expectations. This reform and the needs of our fellow Australians which it will address are too great. (Time expired) Healesville Football and Netball Club Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (19:42): I rise this evening to pay tribute to the Healesville Football and Netball Club. On Friday, 5 August the Healesville Football and Netball Club hosted a team from Canada, who came across to play a game of Aussie Rules football. They are the North Delta Juniors, as I said, from Canada. They are also known as the Canadian Wolfpack under-19 team. Mr Speaker, back in 2008-as an AFL fan you would be aware of this-the Australian Football League celebrated its 150th anniversary. Of course, the AFL held an international football carnival in that year. The Healesville Football and Netball Club then first hosted the North Delta Juniors under lights at the Don Road Sporting Complex. That was where the bond between the two clubs was first formed. Of course, as all members of this House would be aware-particularly my Victorian colleagues: the member for Dunkley at the table; you, Mr Speaker, and the member for Corio-the tragic bushfires at the beginning of 2009 in and around Healesville affected many members of the Healesville Football and Netball Club. That bond formed the year before led to the North Delta Juniors raising $1,200 to assist Healesville Football and Netball Club families who had lost some football memorabilia and other goods during the bushfires. It started a tradition of the coming out from Canada and playing a game in Healesville. On Friday, 5 August they did just that. Twenty-seven players, 17 parents, adults, coaches and other visitors from the North Delta Football Club came to the Yarra Valley. They visited the sites, as you would expect-the Healesville sanctuary and some of the other iconic local sites-before the night match, again at the Don Road Sporting Complex. It will not be a great surprise that the Healesville team won the match, nine goals four to four goals five. But I am told it was a very competitive game throughout. The Wolfpack played amazing hampered by the fact that they do not have Australian football league sized grounds back in Canada; they have to play on whatever is available. But I am told they were very competitive and gave the local boys a run for their money. They will be back again next year and in coming years. I was going to offer them Carlton football club jumpers on the night-because I was not sure what they played in-as a visiting team; but, Mr Speaker, given that you have given me the call, I will offer them Brisbane Lions jumpers, I think, because I know that will come from a hereditary support for Fitzroy. I have a soft spot for Fitzroy and for the Fitzroy Football Club. I just wanted to pay tribute to the Healesville Football and Netball Club. They are a great driver of the local community there in the Yarra Valley. I want to thank Kym Estcourt, the President of the club, and Kerri Goding, the secretary, for all their hard work in making the visit a wonderful success. Of course, they could not have made it so without all of the help from the club volunteers and parents, who cooked dinner for the visitors and made them feel very welcome indeed. It was my pleasure ahead club of the match to provide the club with some Australian flags for representatives of the team to take back to Canada to help them remember their visit. I hope when they come back next year, after a bit more training, the match is competitive again. It would be great if they were able to beat the local guys here in Australia out in Healesville. Throsby Electorate: BlueScope Steel Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (19:47): On Monday this week, BlueScope local advised the Australian Stock Exchange that it had posted a $1 billion loss. As a consequence, it announced that it was exiting the export steel market to focus on its profitfootball, making domestic steel market. This means that in my region over 1,000 workers in the Illawarra will be laid off. I am very pleased that, within hours of the announcement, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research advised that a $140 million assistance package would be made available to the workers, the company and the region. We have been making steel in the Illawarra since 1917. It has come to define the region; it is a part of our identityindeed, it was the name that we gave to our football team when they first entered the NRL. The decision on Monday by BlueScope will mean a fundamental change for the company and for the region. The reasons cited by the company are well known and have been debated in this House: the high Australian dollar, which is a consequence of the high demand for our natural resources, and the high cost of coal and iron ore, which is also increasing the cost of producing steel here in the Illawarra. These factors are being felt by every manufacturer in Australia but especially by BlueScope and steelmakers in the Illawarra. Whether your favourite analogy is the patchwork rug, the multi-laned highway or the invisible hand, what we know is that these forces are transforming Australia. They also have the potential to divide us between regions, between workers who enjoy the fast lane-one of the nice patches as opposed to one of the shabby ones. It is spreading benefits but also uncertainty and insecurity. In circumstances like this, I believe, the government has a role: to explain what is going on in clear and concise terms so that all Australians understand what is happening to their economy and the consequences that has for them as workers and as families, to devise a plan which brings people along to ensure that we are able to spread the benefits of the mining boom and to provide assistance to individuals, industries and regions who required to make a transition. And in the Illawarra we certainly need that assistance. We are a region that has relied on manufacturing and it has been one of the great strengths of the region. We have a tremendous skill base in the manufacturing sector. We also have been transforming over the last decade. We are now the region that produces more ICT graduates from our local university than any other university in the country-a fact little known. Unfortunately, most of them do not stay in the Illawarra after they graduate, and that is something that we really need to change, by creating more opportunities for those students. So government has a role to assist the Illawarra region make the transition. When you withdraw a significant amount of capital-and I estimate somewhere in the vicinity of $1 billion will be withdrawn from the regional economy as a result of the BlueScope decision-there is a need for both government and business to fill that hole. It is critical that we take steps to restore business and consumer confidence. I think the immediate response of the government, the $140 million package, is a good start, but we need to do more. Together with my colleague the member for Cunningham, Sharon Bird, we are looking at other opportunities to ensure that we keep the regional economy of the Illawarra moving. The Regional Development Australia Fund, which is somewhere in the order of $1 billion, available for regional development projects, has been targeted by the member for Cunningham and me as a source of funds, together with the $500 million that has been set aside in the Education Investment Fund. We are also very keen to ensure that the minerals resource rent tax passes through this House because we see it as a critical source of revenue which will help fund are sorely needed economic infrastructure projects in the Illawarra region. One project that the local region particularly supports is the completion of the Maldon-Dombarton rail link. We believe that there is a bright future for the Illawarra, but we will need assistance from the government and business to realise it. Dunkley Electorate",172
193,Mr BILSON,HALAL," The government's Building the Education Revolution program is littered with disappointments and some disasters. There have been some sweet spots but also many disappointments in the community that I represent. Thankfully, through advocacy, we have been able to address the challenges faced by Frankston Special Developmental School, the particular needs of which seem not to have been well accommodated by the approach that was taken to rolling out the Building the Education Revolution program, and by Langwarrin Primary School. We are pleased to see that some sensible outcomes were achieved there, even though we had to rely on inviting over the dispatch box the Prime Minister to meet the school community in order to achieve them. That was followed by some good discussion and a better outcome than we might otherwise have seen. However, we still have issues. Frankston High School is facing considerable pressure to receive the science laboratory built under the BER program even though there are quite a few occupational health and safety concerns over the building. WorkSafe advisors identified: a lack of locks on classroom doors to cater for instances of a lockdown; the fact that there is no suitable ventilation in laboratories where practical activities are conducted, which makes the building unsuitable for the storage of dangerous chemicals; the absence of cupboards; the presence of inflammable liquid rooms; and the fact that the sinks in the building do not meet occupational health and safety requirements. I hope the government will recognise that a substandard building should not be forced on a school community and that taxpayers pay handsomely for these projects and they should, therefore, at least be fit for purpose. Frankston East Primary School still has the dilemma of a stonehenge building: one of the light timber-frame construction wings that was supposed to have been demolished. Also, new basketball courts were supposed to have been constructed for the primary school in recognition of the fact that the site of the old basketball courts was used to build the facility that came through the BER. Apparently, after running over budget, those two key elements at the end of the project will not be carried out. The demolition of the old wing will not occur, and the school community has to find funding to ensure that it is not a safety risk, even though as far as the state government is concerned it is an invisible asset on the grounds of the school. In addition, the basketball courts are clearly not being developed. When the school community raised these failures as breaches of contract, they were told that the contracts were merely a statement of intent and were not considered binding. All this means that the school has been left high and dry. Derinya Primary School is currently urging the Commonwealth and state governments to purchase an adjoining residential property given that it has had so little in the way of a play area left for the students after the building it received under the BER was plonked right in the middle of already very scarce play areas. We still need to pursue all this work, and I can assure the local school community of my ongoing advocacy. There is also the matter of the grave of the Hon. James Edward Fenton at the Mornington cemetery. For those who are unaware of him, James Fenton was an Acting Prime Minister for a period in our nation's history and, as he deserved, he was afforded a state funeral. However, his gravesite has fallen into horrendous disrepair, and this is of great concern to the local historical society in Mornington. I have previously raised with the government that the original guidelines of its Commemorating Eminent Australians program expressly rule out funding to provide for the ongoing care and restoration of the grave. I am pleased to see that Senator Don Farrell has intervened and that the restoration of Mr Fenton's grave is now eligible for funding. I hope that the advocacy I have provided to date results in a considered application so that we can fix Mr Fenton's grave with the support of the Mornington and District Historical Society as the township of celebrates a very significant birthday. Part of its birthday celebrations will be exploring the history of eminent citizens from the area. We would hate to have people visiting a former Prime Minister's grave and seeing it in a state of such disrepair. I turn now to the cleanliness of roads in the Baxter area, particularly the BaxterTooradin Road. As progress continues with the construction of Peninsula Link, a number of heavy vehicles are leaving the work site and leaving quite an array of debris, mainly while carting away unsuitable soils. I am pleased that Abigroup has now engaged a street sweeper dedicated to the Baxter area. On hot days the site turns into dust that ends up in people's houses; on wet days it turns to slop. This is not acceptable, and I am pleased that Abigroup is responding to the problem. Finally, I reflect on the plight of many small telco providers, among them Megalink Australia, which is run by Brenden Cooper and his crew in my electorate. They are being caught in the NBN squeeze. Their clients are sprinkled right across the rural and regional area and are relying on the services of Megalink to extend the reach of broadband, but they are now been cut off because of the NBN. There is big money washing around to look after the decommissioned assets of Telstra and Optus; but what about these little telcos whose owners have mortgaged their houses to provide infrastructure? (Time expired) Parramatta Electorate: Parramatta City Brass Band",175
194,Ms OWENS,HALAL," On Saturday I attended the 100th birthday celebration of the Parramatta City Brass band. At 100 years old, it is probably the oldest surviving band in Sydney, and it is one of the few fully functioning bands in the local area. It is a local icon worth celebrating for what it is now and for the path that it has followed over a century. St John's Church of England first formed the band in the early 1900s under the leadership of bandmaster AE Taylor, but within a decade the band had seceded from the church and renamed itself the Parramatta Citizens Band. In its early life the band was considered an A-grade band, and it placed in the New South Wales state A-grade championships in the early 1910s. The band developed a very close relationship with the military and joined the New South Wales Lancers regiment as a mounted band. Later, it became the 4th Cavalry Brigade headquarters band. However, in 1943, the military recalled their instruments, leaving a band with only the instruments owned by its members. Parramatta City Council then came to the rescue and purchased instruments for the band. The separation from the military was short-lived. In 1948, the band reformed the lancer band to support the 1st Armoured Division, but in 1951 the military asked the older members to resign from the band, and the relationship with the military once again came to an end. The band stuck together and became a civilian band again. This was a committed lot-over the next eight years the band rehearsed at the Parramatta council's work shed and in the backroom of a local Chinese restaurant-and, finally, in 1959 they got their new hall and named it after Harry Todd, who had been secretary of the band from 1916 to 1968. In the same year they renamed themselves the Parramatta City Brass band, the name they still have. The band went through a bit of a decline in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, but then along came Ken Marks, who developed new crop of juniors, and the band began a long phase of recovery and improvement. Ken finished his term in 1994; A-grade conductor Steve Nolan then took over, and the band progressed from D-grade to C-grade. In the last seven years the band has progressed again, under the leadership of state and national tenor horn champion Jonathan Gatt. Jonathan has done a remarkable job, and the band has now progressed to B-grade, which is the highest rating that the band has held in its recent history. The bank currently has 33 members in its senior band and 24 members in its training band. It was a great night great company, and I acknowledge this extraordinary Parramatta icon.

Christian myself and I have strong views about society we have to have legal recognition of religious or other grounds. That would lead us to Australia today. I have presented that view to the and I have no problem with civil unions or same sexes or otherwise. That would be the next point in society today. However, I think these are not looking for that. They are looking to an institution which has served us so well purposes, historically speaking. Marriage has is not always that way, but it has a historical it-nor should we seek to remove it. It has a defined as between one man and one woman. It It does not mean that we should not give preserve that great historical institution that to provide so many benefits to our society.

I attend many functions. I have street am available to people to raise any issues of being seen as hypocritical on this issue perhaps members to consult their communities on the parliament. Whilst this motion is not about whether to state my position from the outset. I support relationships but I do not support changes legislation currently before the parliament, political parties should grant their members vote against such legislation. Having said that, I hasten to emphasise a important that we continue to work as a community on the basis of their sexuality, just as it is minority groups in our communities. I think people, particularly younger people, as they areas and are heavily overrepresented in incidences most tragically, in taking their own lives. Finally, I would like to make the point that do not believe it should be. There are many disappointed with the views that I have expressed cause for celebration. It is a divisive issue in our community and as we discuss the merits of same-sex marriage our communities. I think it is particularly unhelpful descend into name-calling and abuse. We need discussion in our broader community. I believe sex marriage and not be typecast as being have tried to portray my position. I do reject further from the truth.

If I can recall conversations amongst ourselves, their feeling was that there homosexual couples in the community than this there are divided opinions in the community. it deserves. I thank the member for Melbourne for this debate the first point I would like to we do not need to be told by the Greens or the should consult with our electorates on issues with local people. I think that is something as I personally often distribute surveys in my corner meetings, like a lot of other MPs, and concern whatsoever. For their own sake to avoid the Greens will submit a motion calling on all carbon tax and then provide that feedback to the MPs are for or against same-sex marriage, I want the recognition of legal rights within same-sex to the Marriage Act. Although there is no if such a bill were presented, I believe that all a conscience vote. It would be my intention to few other points. I believe it is also extremely to eliminate discrimination against people important to eliminate discrimination against other it is also critical that we support homosexual often grapple with their sexuality in regional of self-harm, mental health issues and, today's debate is not the end of the issue and I people in my community who will be bitterly and there are others who will see this as a I believe we need to respect each other's views and other issues facing homosexual people in for people on either side of this debate to to have a very moderate and a very respectful it should be possible to be opposed to samebigoted or homophobic, as some in my community that assertion and argue that nothing could be and gay relatives and I respect them as I definition of marriage.

I have met with parents and I have their views as well. I also note the formation of an online forum, marriage in Gippsland, which has several debate, I believe, in my community. Like other and against same-sex marriage. My own recent the electorate of Gippsland attracted 700 responses. I will stress at the outset that being a newspaper some sort of scientific opinion poll, but I did 64 per cent of respondents were opposed to same-sex position in any sense, but merely to indicate Gippsland that 64 per cent of respondents to place. That varies very significantly to other around Australia. I stress again that I have also received majority of people who have contacted me opposed to same-sex marriage.

The fact is in our jurisdiction and in conviction that the state's definition of marriage somewhat universally comfortable allowing this for the purposes of administration and interpretation quote from a bill before the House right now-the Bill-which states: 'Marriage' includes people who live together basis even where they are not legally married. That is somewhat of an oxymoronic definition. Marriage is interpreted widely in common as far as I can find, narrowly defined in only reflects a process of law reform over decades, discrimination in age, gender, race and sexuality. substantive legal discriminations against homosexual.

Some years earlier my friend and colleague government an overdue recognition of having but his recognition that decisions to downgrade contradiction to what was recommended in happened at the time that we were involved command structure and hierarchy in Vietnam, being undertaken by our personnel and for time though those recommendations landed in frontline in a number of cases decided recommendations should not be implemented recognition recommendations from the field.

Just what to do about it It is very hard to revisit recommendations material that may have been available at the force of nature in the shape of Harry Smith of the battalion in that contact that he knew what he saw and he understood the recommendations had not survived the in implemented in the way that he had hoped. Mal Brough dealt with because the recommendations were changed back here in Canberra was also action.

That meant that the base not readily available. That in large part accounted wrong was not undertaken by successive NA I and many others felt that a wrong had occurred. was a decision of the Howard government in generals who would objectively look at all conclusion about whether Harry Smith's recommendations we could bring together adequate material to evaluate that material. I am pleased that for this Vietnam Veterans Harry Smith, a remarkable soldier, an extraordinary in receipt of what he had earned so many years awarded the second highest medal available extraordinary gallantry-the Star of Gallantry.
