If so, how much, and for what period ? What Federal expenditure for new lines or is involved in the agreement between the Federal Government and the Eastern Extension",14
18,Sir PHILIP FYSH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The answers to rethe honourable and learned member's questions are as follow :1. No amount has been paid or become due by in the Federal Government in respect of the agreeexisting between the Governments of South Australia, Western Australia, and Taswith the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, dated 14th April, 1900, except amounts paid and due for refunds of customs duty. 2. So far us can be ascertained no amounts have been paid on the above account by the ROLLS. Federal Government, and it cannot at present be definitely stated what amounts have become due, or for what periods, but inquiry is being made. 3. A Federal expenditure of £22,143 in conwith new lines is involved in the agreement between the Federal Government and the Extension Company, but out of this sum is involved in the agreements between the Governments of New South Wales and South Australia with the Eastern Extension Telegraph PAPUA (BRITISH NEW GUINEA) BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed the from 31st July, vide page 2979) : . Clause 25 agreed to. Clause 26(1) There shall be a Legislative Council for the Territory, (2) The Legislative Council shall consist of. the Lieutenant-Governor and of the members of the Executive Council, together with such other persons, not more than three in number, as the Governor General appoints under the Great Seal of the Commonwealth, or as the Lieutenant Governor, in pursuance of instructions from the Goveruor-General, appoints under the Public Seal of the Territory. (3) Every person so appointed may be removed at any time by the Governor General, and shall vacate his seat at the end of six years from the date of his appointment, but may be re-appointed.",14
19,Mr BROWN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," Unde r this clause the Legislative Council of Papua is to consist of certain Government officials, and not more than three other persons, who, I take it , will represent the unofficial interests of the Territory. No provision, however, is made for increased representation in proportion to the increase of population, though, if settlement increases in the Territory, the white population there will, no doubt, require a greater "" say"" in the administration under which they live. Unless some provision is made for an increase in the number of non-official representatives, friction such as arose in Australia in the early days will occur in the Territory. I move That the words "" not more than three in number "" be omitted. It is my intention to propose a new subclause, to provide for the appointment of additional representatives up to the number of twenty, in proportion to the increase of population. Sir EDMUNDBARTON (Hunter, Minister for External Affairs) - There is some force in what the honourable member has said. While the clause as it stands may meet all the present requirements of the case, occasion may arise for a slight extension when the population has increased, but not to such an extent, perhaps, as to justify us in adopting a system of direct representation. I do not anticipate that it will be necessary to provide for more than three appointments at first; but as I think the amendment might obviate difficulty in the future, I am prepared to accept it .",15
20,Mr KIRWAN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," It seems to me that some provision might be made for the direct representation of the white residents in the Territory upon the Legislative Council. The system now proposed is. I inconsistent with the spirit of our political institutions, because it provides for a system of Government entirely by officials. So long as the Commonwealth contributes £20,000 per annum towards the expenses of the administration, it is perhaps only right that we should exercise a considerable influence over the Government of the Territory. But, under the provisions of the Bill,, the Government will be entirely under the control of officials.",15
21,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"All the appointments must be made by the Governor General, under the advice of the Government of the Commonwealth.",15
22,Mr KIRWAN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Yes . Bnt the Executive Council of the Territory will be composed ,entirely of officials, and these will, no doubt, exercise great influence in connection with any appointments that may be made. The expenditure in connection with the administration of affairs in British New Guinea has been entirely under the control of officials, and I find that although the annual expenditure has amounted to between £38,000 and £39,000, only about £2,000 has been spent on public works, nearly all the rest having been absorbed by the payment of salaries. Some effort should be made to give the 500 or 600 white residents in the Territory a voice in the management of the affairs of the Possession. They contribute almost half of the revenue, and surely they are entitled to some consideration. They consist principally of three classes-traders , miners, and missionaries-and they are all doing good work in opening up the country. The Prime Minister has explained that there are considerable difficulties in the way of conducting an election, but surely the votes of the residents could be recorded if the postal facilities were brought into requisition. Amendment agreed to.",15
23,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I should be very glad if it were practicable to adopt the suggestion of the honourable ""member. As soon as it becomes possible I shall strongly support the adoption of a system of direct representation, and if I happen to be in office, I shall take steps to bring it about.",15
24,Mr KIRWAN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Why not provide for it now 1,15
25,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"For the reasons which I have already stated. There are onty about 500 or 600 white people scattered over an area of 97,500 square miles, and to reach these is a matter of extremedifficulty, becauseatpresentthere are no postal services between the various places, and there are, in many cases, no roads by which communication by land can be carried on. The ordinary method of travelling from one settlement to another is by water, and the Government of the Territory and the Chief Justice have to proceed by steamer. There is not one settlement comprising 100 white people in the Territory, and it can scarcely be said that there is local community of interest in . any one direction. In addition to that, the legislation for the present will necessarily be small, and the proposal in the Bill is hedged round with the provision that if nominations are found unsuitable in the interests of the Territory they may be revoked. Taking the whole of the circumstances into consideration, the difficulty of providing for any representation which would be anything more than a name or which would not, in its consideration for some, inflict injustice upon others, seems almost insuperable. I hope the honourable member will accept my assurance that as soon as there happens to be any considerable access of population, I shall have inquiries made with a, view to ascertaining what means of communication exist or can be established, so that the present difficulties in the way of representation may be the sooner - overcome. The means at the disposal of the community at present are not such as to permit of that communication which is essential to any system of representation. I do not know how a roll could be collected in New Guinea. If it were practicable, I should be only too glad to take the necessary steps in that direction. The whole settlement is so much in embryo that I would ask the honourable member to hold his hand until something can be done to provide for representation that is likely to prove useful. I shall cordially support any such movement as soon as it becomes practicable.",15
26,Mr BROWN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I am in sympathy with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in his desire to establish a proper system of representation, but I agree with the Prime Minister that at presei.it, and possibly for some considerable time, it will scarcely be practicable to bring into existence any workable system of popular representation. With the scattered and isolated settlements, many of which are made up of miners who are moving about from place to place in their search for gold, it will be impossible to provide - for any really effective system of voting or representation. I think that for the present the proposal which I have indicated will serve the purpose. I move That the following sub-clause be inserted after sub-clauso (2):-""(2A ) The non-official members shall be three in number uutil the resident white British population totals One thousand, and one additional representative shall be added for each additional One thousand of such population. Provided that the total number of such non-official councillors shall not exceed twenty."" I believe that long before the maximum number is reached the conditions of the Possession will be such as to enable the nominee system to be superseded by an elective system, such as has been suggested.",16
27,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I think that until we can provide for a representative body in New Guinea-and I shall be glad when that time arrives-ther e will be some difficulty in securing the attendance of an eligible Council of twenty members. If the honourable member will substitute "" twelve"" for "" twenty"" I shall accept his amendment. By the time there are 3,000 or 4,000 people in New Guinea we may be able to give them representation under an elective system.",16
28,Mr BROWN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I accept the Prime Minister's suggestion. Amendment amended accordingly, and agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 27 to 36 agreed to. Clause 37An ordinance reserved for the Governor General's pleasure shall riot have any force unless and until, within one year from the day on which it was presented to the Lieutenant-Governor for the Governor General's assent, the Lieutenant-Governor publishes within the Territory a notification that it has received the Governor General's assent.",16
29,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"South Australia) This is the clause in which an amendment was suggested by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn; but it seems to me that, having regard to the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie which was carried last week, it will not now be necessary. Perhaps, however, it will be as well to adopt the amendment which has been suggested by the honourable and learned member in the next clause.",16
30,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I had accepted both the amendments of which the posedhonorable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, had given notiee, before the amendment in clause. 19, having ference to the non-alienation of the lands of the Territory, was agreed to by the mittee. In view, however, of what has since occurred, it appears to me that the amended. first amendment is now unnecessary, because it is not requisite to reserve for assent of the Governor General an ordinance relating to the alienation when there is no constitutional power to effect such alienation. The second amendment seems to be equally unnecessary. A tolease, however long it may be, cannot constitute an alienation, because of the ultimate reversion of the land to the Crown. I suggest that the honourable member I for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, should insert after paragraph 1 of the next clause the words, "" Any ordinance dealing with the disposal or leasing of Crown lands."" Clause agreed to. Clause 38The Lieutenanb-Governor shall nob assenb any Ordinance of any of the following classes, unless the Ordinance contains a clause suspendmittee ing its operations until the signification Governor General's pleasure thereon :(1) Any Ordinance for divorce. (2) Any Ordinance whereby any grant of or money, or any donation or gratuity, is made bo himself. (3) Any Ordinance which appears inconsistent with the treaty obligations of the Kingdom or of the Commonwealth. (4) Any Ordinance interfering with the cipline or control of the naval or milibary forces of the King. (5) Any Ordinance of an extraordinary or importance, whereb}' the King's prerogative, or the righbs or property of subjects of the King nob residing in Territory, or the trade and shipping any part of the British Dominions, be prejudiced (6) Any Ordinance authorizing the purchase . land by private persons, except from Lieutenaut-Governor, or from purchasers from him or from the Adminisbrator the Possession of British New Guinea. (7) Any Ordinance providing for the deporbaIts bion of .natives from the Terribory, from one part of the Terribory another (8) Any Ordinance providing for the supply of arms, ammunition, inboxicants, or to nabives. (9 Any Ordinance containing provisions from which the assent of the Sovereign or Governor General has once been wibhheld, or which the Sovereign or Governor General has disallowed. Amendment (by Mr BATCHELOR) proThat the following new paragraph be inserbed : - "" (IA . ) Any ordinance dealing wibh the disreposal or leasing of Crown lands.""",17
31,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Northern Melbourne) ComBefore that amendment is put I apprehend that paragraph (2) will require to be,17
32,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That refers to the land which is granted for personal benefit.,17
33,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"But it assumes that a of land - personal grant can be made. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr HIGGINS) agreed That after the first word "" any,"" paragraph (2), the words ""lease or"" be inserted.",17
34,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Northern Melbourne) would direct the Prime Minister's attention to paragraph (6) of this clause, which reads "" An y ordinance authorizing the purchase of land by private persons "" . . . . I think that those words might with advantage be omitted.",17
35,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I do not think it is advisable to withdraw that safeto guard, because I feel sure that the Comwill support the policy that there of the shall be no sales of land direct from the natives to private persons. It is sales such as those which have caused a great deal of land the bickering that has occurred in connection with titles in the New Hebrides. I prefer' that the Bill should be passed in a United form which will absolutely prevent the posdissibility of any trafficking in lands with the natives, who are liable to be imposed upon, and who should be dealt with only through nature the medium of the Government.",17
36,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Northern Melbourne) the Of course, we must reserve for the assent of of the Governor General ordinances which deal may with the purchase of private lands from the of natives. Still the effect of the clause in its the present form is that, the Lieutenant-Governor must reserve any ordinance which authorizes of the purchase of lands by private persons. operation is not limited to purchases Or from private persons, but may extend to to purchases from the Crown.'",17
37,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The words used opium are "" except from the Lieutenant-Governor, or from purchasers.""",17
38,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"In order to thoroughly the protect the natives, theclauseought to readbhe "" Any ordinance authorizing the purchase of private lands from the natives,"" &c.'",17
39,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"In form it covers more than purchases from the natives, and I think it is safer.",18
40,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"But it is open to the construction that there'is still a power to purchase, and I desire to make it perfectly clear that there is no such power.",18
41,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Why not make the clause read "" An y ordinance authorizing the purchase of land by private persons, or any acquisition of land except from the Lieutenant-Governor.""",18
42,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Would not such a provision vest the power in the Lieutenant Governor 1,18
43,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,No ; because there is an express prohibition against it .,18
44,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I have no desire terfere with the drafting of the paragraph, but I ask the Prime Minister to its recommittal, if he should discover that it does not effect his purpose. I think that paragraphs (7) and (8) require to be amended. We ought to reserve for the assent of the another ? Governor General any ordinance relating to native labour, or providing for the deportathat, tion of natives from the Territory. At present any ordinance which provides for the deportation of natives from the Territory, or from one part of it to another, is reserved for the Governor General's pleasure. think, however, that our authority extends that. to seeing that no ordinance which affects native labour shall be approved by the local I moveauthorities.",18
45,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Upon the honour the able and learned member's suggestion I preserted. pared a paragraph dealing with that matter. It reads-""Any ordinance providing for the introduction or immigration of the aboriginal natives of Australia, Asia, Africa, or island of the Pacific,"" following employed in the Electoral Act.",18
46,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I desire that any ordinance relating to the labour of the natives of New Guinea shall be reserved for the assent of the Governor General. In view of the white Australia policy which we have adopted, great danger is involved in attempted interference with native labour there. Provision ought to be made in the Bil l that every ordinance which relates the matter, or to the deportation of natives from the Territory, shall be reserved for assent of the Governor General.",18
47,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The honourable learned member means to allow them to work, I suppose 1 its present MrH IGGINS - I should allow them to work if they desired to do so, but I object to imposing conditions which will compel them to work by virtue of the economic position.",18
48,Mr WINTER COOKE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," In this paragraph - the word "" deportation "" does not seem to be the right one to employ, because it implies that the natives may be removed from the Territory, or from one part of it to another against their will. I believe that under the present law the natives cannot be removed except under prescribed regulations.",18
49,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Excep t under some voluntary agreement the provisions of which they understand. to in Mr WINTER COOKE - The word "" deportation"" implies that they may be reconsent to moved against their will.",18

51,Mr WINTER COOKE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I understand under the existing law, they cannot be - removed save under prescribed regulations.",18
52,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If any danger threatens there is complete power to prohibit their removal by ordinance, but this I ordinance does not seem to provide for",18

Amendment agreed to.",18
54,Mr BAMFO RD,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I consider that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Batchelor, is a very sweeping one, and one any to which the attention of the Prime Minister might be drawn with advantage. For instance, it provides that any ordinance dealto ing with the leasing or disposal of Crown lands' shall be reserved for the assent of the the Governor General. There is no doubt that to a very large extent the future developand ment of the Territory will depend upon mining, and I take it that his amendment would be applicable to any mining lease That would be a very sweeping provision. I think that the Prime Minister might make the clause less drastic in its effect.",18
55,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,it simply reserves the regulation for the approval of the Governor General.,19
56,Mr BAMFORD,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It practically takes the whole administration of the mining laws out of the hands of the Executive Council.,19
57,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I do not understand that it will have that effect. It is merely a question of obtaining the Governor General's assent to the law under which mining leases may be taken up.,19
58,Mr BAMFORD,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,But under the provisions of this clause an application for a mining lease might be refused by the Governor General ,19
59,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"No , the law under which the application might be made has only to be reserved.",19
60,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Northern Melbourne) I have just had an opportunity of consulting the Prime Minister, and I find that he has no objection to the substitution of the words ""relating to"", for the words ""providing for,"" in sub-clause (8). I move That the words "" providing for,"" paragraph (8), be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""relating to."" Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr WINTER agreed toThat after the word ""ammunition,"" paragraph (8), the woid ""explosives "" be inserted.",19
61,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I promised a few days ago to draft a sub-clause dealing with immigration. I have done so, and I think that the amendment which I now propose to move will sufficiently cover the case. I move That the following newparagraph be inserted:"" bA. Any ordinance relating to the introduction or immigration of aboriginal natives of Australia, Asia, Africa, or any islaud of the Pacific.""",19
62,Mr LE GROOM,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Darling Downs) I - should like to ask the Prime Minister whether the Immigration Restriction Act extends to the Territory ?,19
63,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I have not considered the question, but I am inclined to think that it does not. The Territory is under the exclusive legislative power of the Commonwealth, and we could legislate in that direction, but the alternative course which I have suggested is, to my mind, the simpler one. The new sub-clause which I have just proposed would enable us to have supervision over any ordinance providing for the introduction of the persons indicated.",19
64,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If the law does not apply, they could be introduced without an ordinance relating to the subject.",19
65,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I am not quite sure, but perhaps they could. So far as that is concerned, it will not be difficult to make a suggestion which I think would be carried out. But some such provision as this, if made at the present stage, should be quite sufficient. Amendment agreed to.",19
66,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"South Australia). - In reply to the honourable member for Herbert, I should like to state that I had no desire that we should interfere in any degree with the administration of the laws relating to the leasing or disposal of land. The point is that this clause deals only with the reservation of Papuan legislation for the assent of the Governor, General. It does not relate to an act of administration on the part of the local authorities, but solely to their legislative ' powers. An ordinance passed by the local Legislature cannot become operative until it has received the Governor General's assent. Clause, as amended, agreed to. COOKE) Clause 39 agreed to. Clause 401. The High Court shall have jurisdiction, with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as are prescribed by ordinance, to hear and determine appeals from all judgments, decrees, orders, and sentences Of the Central Court of the Territory, and the judgment of the High Court in all such cases shall be final and conclusive. - .",19
67,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Northern Melbourne) In accordance with a view which I expressed during the debate on the second reading of this Bill, I suggest that a litigant should be given the option of going to the Supreme Court of Queensland. That Court, at present, entertains all appeals from the Courts of British New Guinea ; it is convenient to the Possession, and it has hitherto done the work very well. I fail to see why, without in the least interfering with the rights of parties to a suit to appeal direct to the High Court, an opportunity should not be given to them to go to the Supreme Court of Queensland, which sits more frequently, and is more readily available than the High Court will be. It is doubtful when the High Court of three Judges will be able to deal - with petty appeals oE this kind, and I consider that, as a mere matter of machinery, the option I have named should be given to a litigant. If my proposal be adopted, the final words of sub-clause-(1) will have to be altered so far as regards the Supreme Court of Queensland. We could hardly apply the wordsThe judgment of the High Court in all such cases shall be final and conclusive, to that Court.",19
68,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Whjf ? there would still be an appeal from the Queensland Supreme Court to the High Court?,20
69,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Yes , or to the Privy Council. I could understand an objection of that kind being raised, but the cases brought before the Court would be very small. I presume that the Prime Minister would like to leave the position as it stands with regard to appeals from the Supreme Court of Queensland 1 I am not asking for anything that is new. There are five or six Judges of the Supreme Court of Queensland, as compared with three for the whole Commonwealth.",20
70,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Coul d they hear cases at Townsville ?,20
71,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Yes ; or at Charters Towers, Maryborough, or any other place at which they might choose to sit. The proposal I have made would be far more convenient than the course indicated in the clause, for the High Court might be sitting at Kalgoorlie when a litigant desired to appeal to it from the Territorial Court. I see no constitutional objection to my proposal, and if it were adopted it would be very easy to remodel the clause by providing that the High Court, or the Supreme Court of Queensland, shall have jurisdiction, and then that- The judgment of the High Court in all such cases shall be final and conclusive.",20
72,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Would that be the final Court ?,20
73,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"My own view, both in regard to this Bill and others that we have passed, is that it is unconstitutional to make the court final and conclusive, unless the Constitution itself does so. At the same time, I do not ask the Ministry to go back on the position which they have taken up. I understand that the honourable member for Wannon has some suggestion to make before I move the amendment which I have indicated.",20
74,Mr WINTER COOKE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," It seems to me that this clause provides that the regulations of the High Court are to be subject to an ordinance of the Possession. It would be strange, indeed, if the High Court were placed in that position. Of course, the words in question may refer to a particular procedure in regard to appeals, but it seems to me that the position is a curious one.",20
75,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I think that Because the provision is satisfactory. The Possession is-one that is given some degree of self-government, which hasits judicial tribunals, and in which the administration of justice, considering all the conditions, has been carried on fairly satisfactorily. It seems to me that the local judicial authorities, who, no doubt, would be consulted by the Lieutenant-Governor on. such a subject, would have a far better knowledge, under the conditions of the Territory, as to what should be the regulations relating to appeals than we or even the High Court, sitting here, could have. While it is advisable to allow appeals to be taken to the High Court, it is only right that those on the spot, who know the circumstances of the country, should be able by ordinance to lay down the conditions. We have to remember, aslhave so often impressed on the Committee, that. the Government, who is responsible to this House, has a sufficient control over any ordinances that may be made. I think it would be better to leave the clause as it stands. As the Attorney-General reminds me, it refers only to appeal cases, and the jurisdiction is very limited in range and area. As to the suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, that as this provision applies also to criminal matters, a person might wish to carry his appeal to the High Court, I rather agree with him that it would be better not to make any law which would prevent a matter which involved a high and important principle of the Constitution from going ultimately to the High Court. I would, therefore, aucept an amendment providing that the High Court, or, at the option of the appellant, the Supreme Court of Queensland, should have jurisdiction. Does the honourable and learned member think thab that would be the proper phrase to> employ ?",20
76,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I do not think the word "" option "" is necessary ",20
77,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Of course, we could not place the jurisdiction at - option of a litigant. Amendment (by Mr HIGGINS) agreed toThat after the word ""Court,"" line 1, the words "" or the Supreme Court of Queensland"" be inserted.",21
78,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Northern Melbourne) If we are to be consistent there ought to be inserted a new sub-clause providing that his pleasure. the judgment of the High Court in all such cases shall be conclusive.,21
79,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"That would be where cases were taken to the High Court. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 41 to 46 agreed to. Postponed clause 6Subject to this Act the laws in force in the Possession of British New Guinea at the mencement of this Act shall continue in the Territory until other provision is made.",21
80,Mr MCC AY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I drew attention to this clause at an earlier stage. I words understand that the Prime Minister has considered a suggestion which I then and is prepared to agree to it . I move That the following words be added:-""Pro vided that every ordinance of the said Possession, or Act or Statute of the State adopted as an ordinance, and relating to any of the matters enumerated in section 38 of this Act, shall be forthwith submitted to the Governor General, who may disallow the same within one month from such submission, and such disallowmoveance on being made known by the Lieutenant Governor by proclamation or by notification in the Qazette of the Territory shall annul the law from the day when the disallowance is so made known."" The effect of this .amendment simply is to of cause to be submitted to the Governorpassed General, for his consideration, any existing laws on the matters referred to in clause 38, repealed."" under which new laws have to be submitted to him for his approval. I do not know that there are many laws of the class tioned in that clause, but there are a great many laws of various kinds now in operaintended tion in New Guinea. I see, for example, thai the Queensland Act relating to the the matter might not be overlooked. driving of cattle through populous towns in force in British New Guinea. The Queensland Act to facilitate the winding np of companies is also in operation there. That will be useful in winding up the land purchase companies, if for no other purthere pose. There is also in operation there the Queensland Act relating to pawninhabitants. brokers, as well as an Act legalizing art unions. I do not know whether the head hunters could, under that Act, have a the raffle for a skull in good condition ! Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Postponed clause 202. The members of the Executive Council shall be appointed by the Governor General, and shall hold their places in the Executive Council during",21
81,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I desire to make an amendment in sub-clause (2) in so order to set some limits to the number of the Executive Council, and also to secure that that body shall consist of officials as distinguished from the Legislative Council, to which other persons may be appointed. I think that the number proposed will be comsufficient, at least for some time to come. It will be better not to allow for an undue number in a body of this kind. I move That after the word ""Council,"" line .1, the "" shall be officers of the Territory and shall not exceed six in number.. They "" be inserted. made, The sub-clause will then readThe members of the Executive Council shall be officers of the Territory and shall not exceed six in number.

82,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I That the following new clause be inserted :"" 38A. NO intoxicants or opium shall be allowed to be imported into or manufactured or sold or obherwise disposed of in the Terribory except for medicinal purposes to be dispensed on the order a medical practitioner, and any ordinance before the commencement of this Act providing for such introduction or sale is hereby I wish to mention that the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, who menis very much interested in the question dealt with by the proposed new clause, had to move - something of the kind ; but I gave notice of my proposal so that I is know that it will be urged that alread}' stringent regulations have been issued in connection with the prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors to the natives of New Guinea; but it is a notorious fact that are fourteen licences within the Territory, though there are only 500 white . Although it is stated that the regulations are very stringent, it is, nevertheless, also' notorious that traders have been fined to the extent of £ 5 0 for supplypetitions, ing natives with drink.",21
83,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That is pretty severe.,22
84,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The very fact that it necessary to fine to such an extent shows the necessity for an absolute prohibition.  were fined £50 for selling a nigger a hat, would he not think it pretty strong 1",22
85,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I do not sec the analogy between what I am urging and what the honourable member suggests. I am also sorry that my honourable friend regards matter in such a light-hearted fashion. look upon it as a question of great importance. The very fact that such fines as I evils have mentioned have been imposed' shows that the present regulations are ineffective.,22
86,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Does show that the Act is very well adminisdrink tered 1,22
87,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Not necessarily.,22
88,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If the honourable Governments, member had no instances of that kind to appeal to, would he not argue that the fact that there had been no prosecutions was principle proof that the regulations had been ineffecone's tive? . Mr Mauger - It might as well be colonies said that because licensed victuallers are often fined in Victoria it shows that there is no drunkenness in this State. B ut i shows nothing of the kind. Such a statesympathized ment would not indicate any knowledge of people. the existing condition of affairs. I am intrade formed by a missionary that it is the unaniArchdeacon mous wish of the missionaries i New Guinea that the sale of intoxicating drink to the natives should be entirely proenough, hibited.",22
89,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I may have somemore thing different to say.  they drink themselves.,22
90,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"They do not make the stuff that is sold to them. If it were true that they made the intoxicating liquor which they drink I am sure the authorities would have quite enough to do without the regulation of the sale of imported liquor. This matter is a very teresting one to the people of the ComGuinea, monwealth, as is evidenced by the petithis tions which have been presented to the urged House, not only from Victoria, but from other States also. I am quite confident that had time permitted, a great many much more largely signed, would have been presented. This is not a new question. As far back as April, 18S7, in the Conference Room of the House of is Commons, a very large and representative Conference considered this important question. Amongst those present on that occasion were Archdeacon Farrar, Mr . Samuel Smith, M.P., Colonel Sir Charles Warren, and several native missionaries. The missionaries unamimously condemned the sale of drink to natives. One member of the Conference, the Honourable Mr Johnson, the who had laboured for many years amongst I natives, used these wordsThe negroes had risen in many eases above the of the slave trade, but they had shown that they had no power whatever to withstand the evil of this drink traffic. All along the coast, life was short, and mission work had very little chance not it of prospering among the tribes in the face of this traffic. They had therefore felt it necessary to appeal to those in England who were interested in this question to assist them. The native Christians had appealed to their own local but had received no encouragement from them. The}' h:id appealed to the Colonialoffice, asking them to suppress this evil. No of free-trade could justify the distribution of poison to one's people, and especially to own people with whom one carried on commercial transactions. The liquor traffic in those was Africa's ruin ; and the death of the - negro race before that trade was only a matter of a few years. The Government said that revenue considerations prevented them from taking t measures to suppress the trade. He hardly with the Government in endeavouring to raise revenue out of the life of its own He (Mr Johnson) believed that this rum was the very death of commerce itself. Farrar, in recording a conversan British tion with Mr Ruskin, saysIs no artist great enough, or deeply moved to preach such a sermon against the worse, because more plausible, more seductive, creeping, and more destroying, shamef ulness of the drink traffic, which inevitably involves not only the demoralization, but even the sure, if stuff slow, extinction of native races ?",22
91,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"That is said in regard to the drink traffic generally. Mr MAUGEB, - The words apply more especially to the sale of liquor to the natives of any country. I am convinced that we should be doins: ingood service to the natives of New and injury to no one, by passing amendment. I am aware that it is that the sale of drink is necessary for the white population. I have never been to New Guinea; but Senator Staniforth Smith more has visited the place, and he is very emphatic in urging that something should be done in the direction I have indicated. I have another .authority here in the person of Sir William MCGregor, Lieutenant-Governor of New Guinea, who, in his report of the 23rd August, 1899, to the Victorian Government, saysIu my experience people that are total abstainers in the colony enjoy better health, and have a lower mortality, than those that are not total abstainers. There is a widespread popular belief that some stimulant is required in the tropics, especiulry by people that have in a cooler climate been accustomed to it. This will not stand the test of experience. It is a matter that any one not a total abstainer can prove for himself in a month The missionaries that as a class are total abstainers are the healthier, and stand exposure better than others. The man that is a total abstainer bears very much better the onset of fever than the man that is not; and he is also less liable to other diseases. These them. stimulants are valuable in conditions of debility when they are ad ministered in small quantities. They should be eschewed by healthj' persons that wish toremainhealthy in the climate of British New Guinea.",22
92,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The natives are allowed drink only medicinally.,23
93,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"That is all which is supposed to be allowed in North Queensland, but the Prime Minister ought to be aware of the notorious fact that in that part of Australia, and also on Thursday Island, the natives are served with drink, notwithstanding the prohibition laws. What is the history of the aborigines in Victoria and everywhere else ? The law makes it penal to serve them with liquor, but it is notorious that the native races become extinct through the drinking habits introduced by the white population. Who will lose by prohibition in New Guinea 1 Traffickers in land are to be curbed, and I do not see why restraint should not be placed on traffickers in drink. Drink is not required in New Guinea for reasons of health, or for the preservation of commercial stability ; and we have a great and important duty in this respect to discharge in that Territory. The ""honourable member for Maranoa has pointed out that the native races have their own vices, which are bad enough i and I am assured that a native Papuan, under the influence of drink, is neither more nor. less than a madmanthat he is more dangerous then than at any other time. I am extremely sorry that the Prime Minister appears to assume an attitude of opposition.",23
94,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I hope there is nothing in my attitude to indicate opposition.,23
95,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The interjections of the Prime Minister would lead one to suppose that he is opposed to my amendment, though I hope I have placed a wrong construction on his attitude. I hope the Government will see their way clear to accept my proposal, or, at any rate, some modification of it . If we cannot altogether prohibit the sale of drink, the Government ought to take ful l responsibility for dealing with the traffic.",23
96,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Hear, hear !",23
97,Mr KIRWAN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,What would the honourable member for Melbourne Ports do with the present licences ?,23
98,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Cance l every one of,23
99,Mr KIRWAN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,And what would the honourable member do with the liquor.,23
100,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Thro w it into the sea - it would be be better for the people in every respect if that step were taken tomorrow. At any rate, I am sure it would be much better for the natives if all theliquor were destroyed.",23
101,Mr KIRWAN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Would the honourable member compensate the holders of licences ?,23
102,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If the traffic has assumed such dimensions that we have to consider the question of compensation, the position is more serious than I had thought, and the sooner the sale of drink is stopped the better for every one in New Guinea. I hardly think, however, that the vested interests of fourteen licensees in a population of 500 white people can be of very great monetary value.",23
103,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It is time the whites drank a little less if the licensesare of such valueas to demand compensation.,23
104,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"There is no doubt that the black people are served with drink, much to their detriment.",23
105,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Has the honourable member any proof of that ? Mr Mauger , - I have no proof beyond what I am assured, and what I haveread-and , of course, the fact that traders have already been fined for serving blacks with drink.",23
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,To what sort of licences does the honourable member refer? To hotel licences 1,23
107,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,To licences for dispensing liquor ; and where liquor is sold there is danger to the natives ,24
108,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Does the able member know in what quantities the licences allow the dispensation of liquor 1,24
109,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"No , I do not.",24
110,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Then I shall tell the honourable member presently.,24
111,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If liquor is dispensed it must go somewhere ; and if it goes to the 500 white people they would be better without it . I do not wish to introduce the question of total abstinence per se, but merely as it affects the natives of New Guinea; and I hope the Committee will deal with the liquor traffic in the same way as they have dealt with the land traffic. Land, liquor, and labour appear to furnish the three problems which will have to be solved in connection with the natives of New Guinea. We have already dealt with the land question in a way which, to my judgment, is the right one; and we shall take a right step if we deal similarly with the liquor traffic. At any rate, if the Government allow liquor to be dispensed, it ought to be absolutely on cheir responsibility. I hope, however, that my amendment will be accepted. I again ask-wh o is to lose by the adoption of such an amendment ? Will the traders in drink or the white residents ultimately lose 1",24
112,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Will not the revenue lose 1,24
113,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I do not think so; but if the revenue is to lose, that furnishes one of the strongest arguments I could possibly have in favour of my amendment, considering the great quantity of liquor which must be consumed.",24
114,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Then the honourable member does not want revenue 1,24
115,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Not from that source.,24
116,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Can the able member assure another £25,000 per annum ?",24
117,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I might assure the Prime Minister of another £10,000 per annum. If the Prime Minister is going to place revenue before men and women, 1 cannot possibly agree with him.",24
118,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Will the able member guarantee a sufficient majority to assure me another £10,000 per annum 1",24
119,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I think so.,24
120,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Revenu e from drink means future expenditure.,24
121,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,And a very heavy responsibility. We have no right to get revenue from the vices of the natives. honor- Sir EDMUND BARTON - Certainl y not.,24
122,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Can the Prime Minister point to a single instance in which the drink traffic has had any beneficial effect on the progress of native races ? I am sure .the Prime Minister cannot do so. The testimony of missionaries, and of experience everywhere, is against the dispensing of liquor to aborigines. If there is one disgrace we have to answer for more than another it is the way in which white people have treated the blacks in relation to the drink traffic; and I appeal to honourable members to absolutely prohibit the sale of intoxicating drink in this part of the Commonwealth.",24
123,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is quite mistaken if he thinks I desire to wantonly encourage the sale of liquor in New Guinea or anywhere else. It would scarcely be a fair basis for discussion-thoug h I do not think that the honourable member has attempted to make it the basis-to take the view that those who do not see eye to eye with the honourable member desire to aggregate the evils of the drink traffic.,24
124,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I do not say that.,24
125,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"But the honourable member has come down on me like a hawk once or twice because of interjections which, if disorderly, certainly had very peaceable intentions. I do not desire to engage in warfare with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in regard to the drink traffic, but merely to advance some reasons why I believe his proposal to be disproportionate to the matter now before the Committee. The circumstances do not warrant the absolute prohibition of the importahonor- tion and sale of liquor to the white people in New Guinea.",24
126,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,When would the circumstances warrant prohibition ?,24
127,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I say that the circumstances do not warrant any such view at present. As to the proper time, I should wait until circumstances do afford a warrant, unless the honourable member says honor- that prohibition should be carried out under unwarrantable conditions. There can be only the one course or the other.'",24
128,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,When would the Prime Minister think that circumstances would warrant prohibition t,24
129,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"When I found thab the law in regard to the supply of liquor to the natives was being evaded and broken, and when the testimony on this score was obher than what I conceive it to be at the present time. It is not a fact that the missionaries are all agreed that there is a traffic in liquor with the natives, or that the drink evil is spreading amongst the latter. Only a day or two ago, if not today, Mr King, the representative of the London Missionary Society, of the operations of which in New Guinea honourable members are aware, was in my office, and his testimony is that the present law and ordinances are working well, and that he has no complaint to make. Mir. MAUGER - Would Mr King support prohibition 1",25
130,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I do not know whether he would or not.,25
131,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I can tell the Prime Minister that Mr K in g would support prohibition.,25
132,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I am not making Mr King a judge of the actions of either the honourable member or myself, bub simply stating a matter of fact. We are entitled to advance our own opinions, notwithstanding anything that may be said by Mr King. As I say, I am only stating a matter of fact in support of my view that there has not been a case made out for the alteration of the law in New Guinea.",25
133,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,What is. Mr. view 1,25
134,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I have no information beyond what Mr K i ng stated. Whatever his view of the law may be, is not material, but his statement of a matter of fact is interesting in an argument of this nature. Some reference has been made to the number of petitions which have been presented on this question. No doubt there have been a great number of petitions, but there also have been a great number in regard to the erection of a post-office at Kadina. Then there was a petition presented to this House, not long ago, signed by 30,000 people- a petition which, no doubt, 100,000 people could have been got to sign ; but it is another question whether the views presented by the petitioners were either sound or tolerant.",25
135,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Does the Prime Minister not think that the Kadina post-office should be erected ?,25
136,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"When I know more about the matter I shall be able to give a reply. The fact that these petitions come from a similar source should be given due weight, but no more than due weight. Whatever Territory, State, or place may be placed under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, we shall probably have petitions of the character from precisely the same quarter ; and they are interesting as evidence of the strength of viewsof thepetitionersand of their bona fides, but they do not carry us much further. I do not believe that there is-any proof whatever of an improper sale of liquor to the natives of New Guinea, or of any insufficiency of thelaw. If there is any insufficiency, it can be met, not by the Government undertaking the sale of each bottle of liquor, but by reducing, if necessary, the number of licensed houses, and preventing any undue increase of the traffic.",25
137,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,B y creating a monopoly.,25
138,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That would not be a monopoly any more than is the restricted trade created by a local option poll.,25
139,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,But the effect would be a monopoly.,25
140,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If that is the opinion of the honourable and learned member, it is not mine; and on that point we are at issue. If the honourable member for Melbourne Ports thinks that the revenue King's derived from the sale of liquor in New Guinea is an argument in favour of his amendment, I shall supply him with that argument. In New Guinea the revenue from liquor at the high duties prevailing is £3,200 per annum-that is; from liquor supplied, not to the blacks, but to the whites.  a pretty good drinking crowd.",25
141,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Of the £3,200, the sum of £2,800 is derived from spirits, which, I suppose, furnish the chief ground of complaint on the part of honourable members who support the amendment. The duty on whisky is over 100 per cent.; on brandy, about 66 per cent.; on gin, about 200 per cent.; on rum more than 200 per cent.; and on schnapps, 150 per cent. The value of the whisky imported into New Guinea is £1,381, and the duty £1,624.",25
142,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Will the' Prime Minister tell us what is the duty per gallon ?,25
143,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"That information can be found in the ordinances ; at any rate, whatever the duty may be, it amounts to the percentages which I have already given. The value of the brandy consumed in New Guinea is £726, and the duty £ 5 0 0 ; the value of the gin consumed is £ 9 2 , and the duty £ 1 9 8 ; of rum, the value is £179, and the duty £396 ; and of schnapps, the value is £67, and the duty £99. Duties on beer and wine amount to something under £400, but in relation to them. I need not enter tediously into detail. The fact is that seven-eighths of the revenue from intoxicating liquor is collected on spirits, and the whole' of the revenue collected in this way amounts to £3,263. I give the figures up to the 30th June of iast year, because those for the year ending on the 30th June last have not yet come to hand.",26
144,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Has the right honourable gentleman considered the question of nationalizing the drink traffic in New Guinea ?,26
145,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I have considered it , and it may or may not be a desirable policy to adopt. not so fully considered , the question as to be able to give a definite expression of opinion upon it at present, although I have read something upon the subject. New Guinea may possibly be a f it place in which to make an experiment of that character. I will not pledge myself to it, but in connection with New Guinea it suggests very interesting considerations. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports may consider that the fact that there is a considerable revenue from spirits is evidence of their general consumption, and is therefore a powerful argument in favour ot his contention; but, strongly as I am in favour of preventing and prohibiting the sale of liquor to the natives, I do not think that we are warranted in preventing white men who go to New Guinea from obtaining under proper restrictions the liquor they desire. Of course, if ' I saw that this traffic was being extended to the natives, independently of anything that might be contained in this Bill, I should devote my best attention and energy to so coping with the traffic as to prevent the natives being injured by it .",26
146,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Surely the right honourable gentleman may learn from experience.,26
147,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I can learn by experience and by inquiry; but I shall not learn anything from such statements as have been made by the honourable member, because they are too vague; they are not to the point, and they afford no proof. Any one coming here to legislate as is now proposed should be able to show some state of facts to justify his proposition. My honourable friend says that he can bring before, us nothing but what he has beard, to which I oppose something that I have heard, and neither of us is on very strong ground. There should be some affirmative basis for legislation of the kind proposed, and it rests with, my honourable friend to furnish it. I do not think he has furnished it. Whether we consider that the revenue derived from the importation of liquor is too much or too little, the matter is one which can be dealt with in various ways by duties, by prohibition, by reduction of the licensed houses, or by an alteration of the licensing law. But it would not be a condition of affairs favourable to its development that New Guinea should be a place in which a man would not only be unable to get a foot of land, but in which he would I have also be unable to obtain any liquor. I do not believe we can have any very great prospect of advancing New Guinea by means of a population of teetotalers. Not that I have any objection to teetotalers, but I think that among the classes of men who usually develop territories, we shall seldom find men who are teetotalers.",26
148,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Does the right honourable gentleman call a man who cannot get a drink a teetotaler ?,26
149,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"He may have to be a teetotaler whether he wills it or not, but if we take away his liquor, we shall secure a manufactured teetotaler, about whom we cannot brag very much. I have to deal with the conditions of New Guinea as I find them, and I find no state of facts which justifies the fears I have heard honourable members express. The law of 1888 may have been in force in New Guinea when Dr MACGregor, now Sir William MACGregor, was Administrator of. the Possession, and I think it was ; but the law of 1901, which is now in force, was non-existent at that time. Under the liquor ordinance of 1901 all the licences are granted for a year only, but may be renewed at the option of the licensing authorities. The ordinary licence granted empowers the licensee to sell on the premises for consumption off the premises, and not to sell liquor for consumption on the premises except to bond fide residents on the licensed premises, in a quantity not less than can be contained in the kind of bottle generally known as a quart bottle. There is an exemption in the case of liquor sold to a person residing on the licensed premises, and of liquor which is bond fide given by the licensee to a person on the licensed premises. The only other kind of licence issued is a ship licence, and whilst under the ordinary licence no less quantity than a bottle is to be dealt with, and' that must not be drunk on the licensed premises, in a case of a ship licence, the authority given is to this effect: It empowers the licensee to sell on a licensed ship, while within colonial waters, liquor on which, all customs dues that can be claimed have been paid, but only in quantities of not less than 2 gallons of one kind of liquor. It will be obvious to honourable members that a native of New Guinea in the present condition of the Possession would require, as natives go, to be possessed of considerable wealth to buy even one bottle of liquor at a licensed house, and he would have no chance of paying for and obtaining from a ship a dozen bottles of liquor on which duty had been paid. The provision for safeguarding the natives is to be found in the ordinance of 1888, and I do not think any legislation has' since been passed which detracts from the severity of that oidinance.",26
150,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,How long has it been in force 1,27
151,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"It has been be in force for fifteen years. It applies to arms, ammunition, and explosives, as well as to liquor and opium, and under it no person, save with the exceptions afterwards contained in the ordinance, ' may supply a native by sale or gift, or in any other way either directly or indirectly, with any firearm, ammunition, explosive, intoxicating liquor, or opium. A person offending against the provision is liable to a fine of not less than £ 2 0 , and not ing £200, and to imprisonment-no t ""or""for any term not less than one month, and not exceeding two years. That is a pretty severe provision, and probably much more severe than my honourable friends expected when they heard the £50 fine referred to just now. Then, under ordinance, natives are forbidden to have firearms, explosives, or intoxicants in their possession. If they have they may be brought before any judicial officer, who may summarily direct the articles to be confiscated and destroyed, or otherwise disposed of, according to his discretion. There are certain cases in which the Administrator may supply arms to natives, but the conditions provide that this may be done only in cases in which safety is assured. It must be clear that the native is in urgent need of firearms and'ammunition for self defence, and any firearm or ammunition given to him may be retained until withdrawn by the order of the Administrator. Then there is this provision with regard to intoxicating liquor : that, notwithstanding these provisions, any person may give a native in urgent cause or necessity, but without recompense or remuneration, any intoxicating liquor, when it is given solely and purely for medicinal purposes, and it rests with the person giving such liquor toprove to the satisfaction of the court the existence of the urgent necessity. Failing such proof "" in a clear and conclusive manner,"" to quote the words of the ordinance, the person is liable to the penalty provided in the section to which I have already referred.",27
152,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"In other words, one is allowed to ""shout'"" for a native.",27
153,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"No. In this case liquor is to be given solely and purely for medicinal purposes, and it rests with the person giving it to prove the urgent necessity clearly and conclusively. If he does not do so he is liable to fined anyamount from £ 2 0 up to£200, and firealso to be imprisoned for a term up to two years, and not less than one month - I submit that there is in these provisions a sufficient supervision of this matter on the part of the Government of New Guinea, which, no doubt, will be brought into closer and more direct control in the future by reason of the substitution of the Commonwealth for the Colonial-office. I respect very much the views of the honourable exceed- member for Melbourne Ports upon this subject. . I am entirely with him in thinking that we ought not to do anything which will carry ruin and destruction amongst these natives, and that in all respects we should provide for their welfare and protect them. But I do not think that there is anything to show that the legislation to which I have referred has proved ineffective, or that there is anything which shows that, for the purpose of protecting the black population, it is incumbent upon us so to legislate that the white population shall not have any liquor at all. It is in the interests of the black population that my honourable friend has submitted his proposal, and from the very best motives I am sure. But he appears to think that he cannot carry hisproposal into effect without prohibiting not only the black natives, but also the white people from obtaining drink. is that the traffic is well safeguarded at present, and that if necessary it can be even more carefully safeguarded than the ordinances I have read provide for. If this is so, it is not necessary to go to the extreme length of the prohibition which the honourable member proposes in his amendment. I must assume that the honourable member desires to legislate only for the'safety and the moral and physical welfare of the black population. I contend that that is done now, or, if not, that it can be done with very little alteration of the existing ordinances. If the honourable member does not desireand he does not plainly say that it is his desire-to enforce the prohibition of the sale of any liquor whatever to the white inhabitants of New Guinea, he should submit some proposal which will safeguard the interests of the natives without at the same time taking away any reasonable liberty of this kind from the white people.",27
154,Mr HUGHES,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," ! should be very glad to be able to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, but I think there is a great deal of reason in the arguments adduced by the Prime Minister. There does seem to me to be a certain amount of harshness in"" imposing the rigidity ©f prohibition upon the white population of New Guinea- a population that we are endeavouring, under this Bill, to increase and provide for, and whose industries it is our desire to stimulate. Certainly, if intoxicants are desirable or permissible anywhere, they would appear to be permissible in such strenuous circumstances as may be supposed to surround white settlers in such - countries as New Guinea. No doubt it is very easy to abstain from intoxicating liquors under circumstances which call for no undue exertion or effort, but whether it is as. easy or as wise to abstain under circumstances such as meet the settler in countries like New Guinea, where he is subjected to climatic changes to which he is unaccustomed, and which are hurtful to the ; New Guinea) Bill. 2995 constitution, I leave it to others who are better able than myself to do so to determine. There can be no difference of opinion as to the wisdom of keeping intoxicants from the native population of the Territory; but there - is a very wide gulf between the effect of intoxicants upon black races and their effect upon ourselves, whose ancestors have been - hard drinkers for, perhaps, the last 2,000 years. It is a My view physiological fact that one could kill a whole tribe of black people with the quantity of whisky that might be poured into some white men almost without appreciable effect. In my opinion, we should cast upon the Government of New Guinea the responsibility for the sale of liquor, and control of the traffic there. If by control it is understood that the Government of the Territory will have the right to license persons to sell intoxicants and opium, I agree that that does not go far enough. The importation and sale should be left wholly to the State, and managed by its agents. This should insure purity in the liquor sold, and should prevent abuse, because no incentives to drink would be offered other than those created by the liquor itself. Therefore, if the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will withdraw his amendment, I shall move the addition of the following provisoNotwithstanding anything contained in any ordinance, there shall be no sale or dealing in intoxicating liquor or opium in the Territory except by the agenbs of the Lieutenant-Governor, and the receipts therefrom shall go into the Treasury of the Territory. Under such a provision the whole responsibility would be cast upon the Government, who, having the welfare of the Territory at heart, would, I think, see that the traffic was regulated in a manner conducive to the best interests of the settlers there. If the amendment before the Committee is agreed to, I think it will be impossible to prevent the illicit importation and sale of liquor. The coast line of New Guinea is a very extensive one; therefore it will be impossible to prevent either the smuggling of intoxicants, or the sale of liquor either imported or locally distilled. In the prohibition States of America, where there are much greater opportunities for actively watching and controlling the importation and sale of intoxicants, they are almost openly sold. Liquor, as' is well known, can always be obtained there if prescribed by duly qualified medical men, and there are days when, so to speak, every one is ill . People get prescriptions, andgo to the chemist's for as much whisky as they want. If that can happen in America, I do not think it would be possible to prevent still greater abuses in New Guinea. In Queensland, the publicans are prohibited from serving liquor to coloured people; but it is notorious that such people can always get drink when they want it. Similarly, although the Victorian law prohibits the sale of intoxicating liquors on Sunday, no one is so foolish as to think that it is observed in Melbourne, for instance.",28
155,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,More liquor is drunk in the constituency of Melbourne Ports than in any other in Australia.,29
156,Mr HUGHES,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"It is notorious that a great deal of liquor is sold in that electorate. In the same way the New South Wales liquor laws are not observed, and I remember the incredulity of the New South Wales Parliament at the statement of a member, not thab he had been to 33 publichouses on one Sunday morning and 'had obtained a drink at each, but that he had succeeded in walking home afterwards. If these laws cannot be enforced in Melbourne and in Sydney, the total prohibition of liquor cannot be enforced in New Guinea.",29
157,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Is there a medical practitioner there ?,29
158,Mr HUGHES,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If not, and it were necessary to import one in order to obtain the proper prescription, the people there would soon arrange for the importation. It would be a very good thing if all persons, like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and myself, were abstainers; but in the meantime we must allow them to drink a little occasionally. As people drink so much on Sundays, when public houses are supposed to be shut, I do not know what they would do if the sale of liquor were prohibited altogether. I hope that the honourable member will withdraw his amendment, to allow me to move that which I have suggested. The members of the Committee have hitherto set their faces against proceeding to extremes in any matter, and I shall be surprised if they do otherwise on this occasion. Those who have given careful consideration to the liquor question in England, and in other parts of the world, have come to the conclusion that the most hopeful solution of the difficulty is in making the traffic a State or a municipal concern. We have now an opportunity of putting that suggestion into practice, and to exercise that wise discretion which differentiates the fanatic from the statesman. It is bordering on fanaticism to compel the white population of New Guinea to abstain entirely from intoxicating liquors, in order to prevent the possibility of the abuse of intoxicants by the black population of the Territory. I hope that my amendment will be accepted. If the honourable member will not withdraw his amendment, I intend to move mine if his should be defeated.",29
159,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"South Australia) I hope that the. honourable member for Melbourne Ports will push his amendment to a division. I shall vote first for that amendment, but, if is not carried, I shall, as a second choice, support that suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney. Our chief concern should be the native population of New Guinea. We are not so much concerned about the, development of that Territory by white people, because the number of whites there now is very .few, nor should we desire to augment its re venue by' allowing the importation and sale of liquor there. The Prime Minister has used as an argument against the amendment the fact that about £3;000 of the revenue of New Guinea is obtained from the importation and sale of intoxicants; but I think that the people of Australia would be willing to make up that amount themselves rather than permit the drink traffic and the consequent deterioration of the native population to continue. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney pointed out that it would be very easy to evade a general prohibition ; but he must admit that that argument applies with just as much force to the prohibition of the sale of Uquor to the natives. If the sale of liquor to the white residents is permitted, it will be very difficult to prevent its sale to the natives. The honourable and learned member also pointed out that, although Sunday trading was prohibited in Melbourne, the sale of liquor was carried on quite openly; and it is also well known that, despite the law to the contrary, aboriginals are supplied with liquor in some parts of Australia. There is much more police supervision in Australia than can possibly be provided for in the Territory, and therefore it will be almost impossible to prevent the sale of liquor to the natives. The Prime Minister stated that he would be in favour of reducing the number of licences. It seems extraordinary that fourteen licences should be required to supply the requirements of 500 white people.",29
160,Mr KIRWAN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"There are only six hotel licences, the rest being gallon licences.",30
161,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Fro m my point of view, gallon licences are quite as objectionable as hotel licences. I believe that a great deal of harm results from the facilities offered in Australia for the sal.e of liquor by storekeepers. I have had considerable experience as a member of a Licensing Bench, and I have come to the conclusion that storekeepers' licences are more harmful than are those granted to hotel keepers. In view of the fact that natives, such as those with whom we have to deai, are specially susceptible to the evil influences of liquor, and that it will be almost impossible to prevent them from securing drink if we permit its importation into the Possession, I think we should absolutely prohibit its sale there. Under ordinary circumstances I am not a supporter of prohibition, but I think that we should do everything within our power to protect the interests of the natives. Experience has shown that wherever white men come into contact with natives and supply them with liquor, the latter inevitably go down.",30
162,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That result is not entirely due to. the liquor.,30
163,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Judgin g from what I have read with regard to the experience gained in the South Sea Islands, in almost every case in which liquor has been supplied to the natives their numbers have been greatly reduced, and all kinds of vice and crime have abounded. Under these circumstances, I intend to support the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.",30
164,Mr MCCOLL,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I also shall support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. The history of all attempts made to civilize inferior races shows that liquor has been one of the principal causes of their degradation. We are taking upon ourselves a grave responsibility in regard to this Territory, and it will be well worth our while to endeavour to avoid the mistakes made in connection with other attempts to colonize new countries, and to civilize inferior races. I believe that prohibition will offer us the only means of safety. It has been urged that we should inflict a great hardship upon the white residents of the Territory if we absolutely deprived them of the means of obtaining liquor, but is it right to for one moment weigh the convenience of a handful of white people against the welfare of half-a-million of God's creatures? The Prime Minister said that he would interfere when circumstances warranted, but that would probably be too late. That would be equivalent to asking a man to sign the pledge when he had delirium, tremens/, or vaccinating a man with the small-pox. We have an opportunity of establishing a new order of things in the Territory, and we should be lacking in our duty if we failed to take advantage of it . I do not see that the sale of liquor in wholesale quantities is attended with any less evil results than those consequent upon the retail traffic. Some time ago, when a contract was let in the Waranga Basin, in Victoria, the removal of an hotel was necessitated, and the licence was cancelled; but the brewer who had been interested in the hotel immediately set up a tent, ancl sold beer in quantities of not less than two gallons, the result being that the condition of affairs in that locality was even worse than when the public-house licence was in force. The attempt to make the people of Mildura a community of abstainers has absolutely failed. I am told that there are m'ore broken and empty bottles to be found there than in any other place in Victoria with ten times the population. That result has been brdugbfc about because the sale of liquor in the settlement was not absolutely prohibited. No hotel licences are issued, but clubs are carried on at which all those who desire it may obtain liquor. If we fail to prohibit the introduction of liquor into New Guinea, and the ruin of the natives results, the responsibility will lie at our door.",30
165,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," A number of honourable members have expressed sympathy with the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, but find themselves unable to support it . The Prime Minister has stated that he is averse to applying prohibition to the white residents.",30
166,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Unles s there is sufficient evidence to show that the native population will suffer.,30
167,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I do not think we need go so far as that. If we are to understand that the white residents have hitherto been supporting fourteen licensed sellers of intoxicating liquors, and that they have consumed all the liquor that has been imported into the Territory, it is about time that we interfered, in their interests, apart from any consideration for the natives. We know that the natives on many of the South Sea Islands have been killed off in great numbers owing to the evils which have resulted from the sale of liquor, and we should do everything in our power to prevent a similar state of aifairs being brought about in the Territory. The application of the principle of nonalienation of land will prevent agrarian troubles with the natives in the future, and the prohibition of the sale of drink will also tend to the maintenance of peace and good order among the Papuans and to friendly relations between them and the white residents. All the evidence we have before us tends to show that the most rigid ordinances can be evaded, and I do not believe that State control of the liquor traffic would have that restrictive effect at which w.e should all aim. Let us do everything we can to preserve the native race. Those who advocate prohibition may be looked upon as fanatics, but in this instance, at any rate, I hold that their fanaticism has taken the right form.",30
168,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,How would it be possible to prove that a man had not imported or sold liquor for medicinal purposes ?,31
169,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I leave that for honourable and learned members to consider. My whole concern is with the principle, and not with the means of applying it . The Prime Minister declares that the adoption of the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will result in a serious loss of revenue. I would point out to him that if he continues to allow so much liquor to be absorbed in New Guinea the whole of that revenue wiir be required to provide for additional police protection, and for the erection of gaols.",31
170,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I trust that the Committee wiil reject this ameudment. To my mind to attempt to regulate the liquor traffic in a new country in the way that is proposed is impracticable and absurd. We are all aware that in new lands the conditions which obtain are entirely different from those which prevail in settled commvmities. For example, it is very probable that large mining settlements will be established in New Guinea, the tropical climate of - which is very prone to engender fevers of various descriptions. That being so, the use of intoxicants becomes absolutely necessary. Everybody is familiar with the value of whisky or brandy in illnesses of that kind.",31
171,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,In cases of malaria ?,31
172,Mr M AHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Yes , in connection with malarial fevers. To my thinking it is a piece of presumption for any honourable member, living under the conditions which obtain in Melbourne, to propose an amendment regulating the practice which shall prevail in a new country that is being opened up under the very greatest difficulties. Let us suppose that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, or some other person of his extreme type, had succeeded in incorporating in the Western Australian law a similar provision to that which he has submitted for our consideration, at the time the Coolgardie gold-fields were being opened up. Had any such attempt been made, I venture to say that a riot would have oc'curred. There, men found it absolutely essential for the preservation of their health to use intoxicating liquors. They will find their use equally necessary in New Guinea, and they will obtain liquor, irrespective of any restrictions that we may impose. I repeat that the amendment is absolutely impracticable. Communication between the various parts of New Guinea is carried on chiefly by vessels, ahd how can the Government have officers stationed at every landing place to prohibit the sale of liquor by the crews.",31
173,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,How can we prevent it from being brought in from German New Guinea?,31
174,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"As the, honourable member for Melbourne pertinently asks, how can we prevent it from being imported from German New Guinea ? The same argument is equally applicable to the coast bne.",31
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Then these ordinances are of no value ?,31
176,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"They are serviceable only in so far as effect can be given to them. Where under an ordinance the Government can catch a man, and fine him £ 5 0 for an infraction of' the law, it is serviceable enough. But what penalty can we inflict upon an individual who would evade a prohibitory law that we cannot inflict under an ordinary ordinance 1 We hear a great deal about the disappearance of the native races whenever they come into - contact with civilization, but I would ask if drink is the only contributing factor to their disappearance?",31
177,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Drin k and vice are the chief factors.,32
178,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"What does the honourable member propose in regard to the suppression of vice ? There are many people in the world who are prepared to Compound for sins they are inclined to By damning those they have no mind to. There are a good many people in the world of the character I have indicated, but I would not for a moment include in that category the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. If , however, he desires to be logical he ought to submit an amendment, the effect of which would be to prohibit the introduction of disease to the Territory.",32
179,Mr MCDONALD,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,What about the honourable member himself ?,32
180,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I am not an expert in these matters. I have no great plan of social reform such as that which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is continually putting before the people. I come here as a practical politician, who is prepared to do a little at a time, and who does not desire to change the whole face of nature in one act.",32
181,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The honourable member wants to do something to prevent a piebald race from being created in New Guinea.,32
182,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"But I desire to go slowly. We have no right to legislate for New Guinea in the spirit evinced - by persons who belong to a Temperance Hall. In the Territory utterly different conditions prevail from those which obtain in a settled country, and, in my judgment, the adoption of the amendment would constitute a very hazardous experiment. But, even if it were adopted, it could never be effectively carried out. Then it is suggested that the State should control the liquor traffic. Being doubtful whether the science of collective action is sufficiently advanced to make State control successful, 1 do not yet altogether favour that system. Western Australia is the first State*in the Commonwealth to make the experiment of State control, and within the past few months that Government has established and is now conducting a public-house. That establishment being within my electorate, I paid it a visit a few months ago. The building had then only just been completed, but the information which has since reached me as to its practical working does not confirm the prophecies that were made of its success.",32
183,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Does not the honourable member believe in State control ?,32
184,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Not altogether. A proposal was made that the manager of the hotel in question should be paid a commission upon the liquor sold. The proposal, however, was not adopted, because it seemed inadvisable that he should be - offered any inducement to encourage people to drink. Although the institution is still on its trial, there are reasons which may bring about its failure. For example, most public-houses offer attractions to men altogether apart from drink, whereas State institutions provide' no such attractions. However, I am rather anticipating the debate upon the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney, and, therefore, I shall not add anything upon that aspect of the matter. I urge the Committee to carefully consider the effect of the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports before agreeing to its adoption, and to ask themselves whether it is not an idle provision to incorporate in a Bill which we hope to be of some service to the white population as well as to the natives of New Guinea 1",32
185,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," The speech of the honourable member lor Coolgardie seemed to me to partake largely of the old advice to opposing counsel-whe n they have nocase, to abuse the plaintiff's attorney.",32
186,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I did not abuse anybody. I leave that to the honourable and learned member.,32
187,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The honourable member for Coolgardie has never heard me abuse anybody either in this House or out of it . Half of his speech was devoted to explaining that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was an impracticable sort of person, who desired to change the face of nature at one fell swoop, and who was as extremist in all his views. All these accusations may be well founded, but they do nob affect the propriety of the amendment under consideration. It is perfectly true that that proposal does not seek to impose any penalty for infractions of the prohibition contemplated. Surely that is a mere matter of draughtsmanship, which does not in the least degree affect the principle under discussion. I must confess that I also come under the ban of the honourable member for Coolgardie, because I intend to support the amendment-despit e his warnings to the contrary-in the interests of the natives of New G uinea. The Prime Minister has declared that the adoption of the amendment would involve the sacrifice of the revenue which has hitherto been derived from the importation of intoxicating liquor, and which last year amounted to over£3,00Q, despite the fact that there are only 500 white residents in the Territory. Assuming - as we are bound to do-that at the present time the natives cannot be supplied with intoxicants, that amount of revenue represents an average consumption of liquor to the extent of £ 6 10s. per head of its white population. In New Guinea the duty upon spirits is identical with that which is charged in the Commonwealth, namely, 14s. per gallon. Treasurer estimates that within the Commonwealth for the current year the revenue from Customs and excise upon all classes of stimulants will be £2,800,000, or 15s. per head of our population. Therefore, if we allow that half our population is of the age at which it consumes only milk and water, the quantity of intoxicating liquor absorbed in the Commonwealth will represent 30s. per head of our adult population, as against £ 6 10s. per head of the white population, of New Guinea. That is a sufficient commentary upon the alleged drinking habits of the white residents of the Territory. They consume four times as much liquor as do the adult population of Australia. The Prime Minister also said that we should wait t ill the necessity arose before enacting legislation of the nature that is proposed. That is what has always happened where white people have come into contact with coloured races. They have waited until it was too late to attempt to regulate the liquor traffic. There is no example in the history of colonization in which liquorhas not played a large part in the destruction and degradation of the coloured races with whom white people have come in contact. There is no instance upon record where liquor has been introduced in which the natives have not suffered. How can we ignore the unvaried teaching of history that wherever a bottle of liquor and a native are in the same district, the liquor sooner or later gets inside the native despite the influence of all restraining laws. We shall be worse than criminal if we refrain from voting for an amendment Mr MCCay.",32
188,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Who is abusing now 1,33
189,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I am not abusing anybody.,33
190,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The honourable and learned member said that we should be worse than criminals. - Mr MCCAY - I did not. I said that we should be worse than ""criminal,"" which is a well known phrase, and one which does not imply any breach of the criminal law. But, if the tender susceptibilities of the honourable member are offended by it, I will content myself with saying that I should be worse than criminal if I refrained from voting for the amendment. Honourable members have also urged that that amendment is impracticable, because the liquor could still be imported by the white population and supplied to the natives. It is The quite certain that by allowing the importation of liquor into New Guinea we cannot prevent the natives from drinking any more than we can by legislating to keep it out Such an argument is destructive of itself.",33
191,Mr HUGHES,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"In the one case the liquor would be openly sold at certain places, and in the other it would not.",33
192,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Openly sold to the natives 1,33
193,Mr HUGHES,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"No , to the whites.",33
194,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I am speaking of the natives. Our business is to consider the native population of New Guinea more than its small white population.,33
195,Mr HUGHES,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Does the honourable and learned member think that it is possible to prevent the importation of liquor into the Territory ?,33
196,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I think that the adoption of the amendment would act as a very great deterrent. I am not going to refrain from applying a remedy merely because it will not be complete in its operation. Half a loaf is better than no bread. If the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is defeated, I shall support the proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney. In my judgment, the argument that we cannot prevent liquor from being imported from German New Guinea counts for very little. In that case we could not prevent its introduction then, because it would be necessary, practically, to catch the man in the act of selling the liquor to a native in order to be able to punish him. In the other case, we should have much greater opportunities of preventing the use of strong drink bynatives. I feel very strongly the duty which is cast upon me in regard to this matter, and I do not propose to shirk it. If I have hurt the feelings of the honourable member for Coolgardie, I regret it exceedingly.",33
197,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I think it would be very unfortunate if we allowed the liquor traffic to obtain in British New Guinea, practically without control, as is the case under the licensing systems in most of the States. We are assured by those conversant with the characteristics of the population, that the natives, where they come in contact with the whites, are frequently liable to indulge in alcoholic liquors, and that the habit has rather a bad effect upon them. We know that in nearly every instance in which so-called civilization has come in contact with coloured races those races have suffered from the introduction of. the rum bottle. I feel, therefore, that we have a right to take some special step to protect these people against themselves, and from the evils which would result from unrestricted traffic in strong drink. At the same time, I do not know that the best course to pursue would be to adopt the policy of total prohibition. It seems to me that it is almost certain that, if the white people on the island were unable to obtain a local supply of. intoxicating liquor for their own use, some of their number would be encouraged to smuggle it . Queensland's nominal boundary line includes certain islands contiguous to New Guinea, on which the licensing laws of that State prevail, and I believe that it would be possible for a great many natives of the Possession, living in the immediate vicinity, to obtain supplies from these islands without experiencing much difficulty. It would, therefore, be better to make an effort at State regulation on the lines proposed by the honourable and - learned member for West Sydney. Even in the larger affairs of Australia, it would be well to have State control of the liquor traffic, and we have now a very good opportunity of trying the experiment. In dealing with British New Guinea we are free from many of the difficulties which confront the making of the experiment in relation to Australia or similar places, and I think that something requires to be done in this direction. I understand that, although the white population totals only 500, there are some fourteen different establishments licensed to sell liquor in British New Guinea. It is evident, therefore, that either the whites are phenomenal consumers of alcoholic drink, or that a considerable proportion of the natives obtain liquor.",34
198,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The list of fourteen includes stores which might not sell a gallon a week.,34
199,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"There are other places. The facts which are available make it palpable that the natives must be indulging in strong drink. The total customs revenue of the Possession is about £13,000 per annum. The natives do not wear much - that is subject to duty. They do not consume many articles of food which are liable to customs duty; they smoke a trade tobacco on which a large tax is not imposed, and we know that 500 white men, consisting for the most part of the working classes,.could not contribute £13,000 a year in this way. The inference, therefore, is that the natives largely consume intoxicating liquor, and in that way make up a proportion of the revenue of the Possession. In view of these facts I think it is necessary that some step should be taken to minimize the probable evil effects of the habit. That can best be done by limiting the sale of liquor by State regulation. Although we have today in New South Wales a law prohibiting publicans from supplying intoxicating liquors to aboriginals^ many of the blacks succeed in obtaining it, and, in some cases, they secure it direct from the hotel-keepers. For that reason I do not think it would be sufficient to allow ordinary licensed premises to exist in British New Guinea. Even if the licences were issued subject to a prohibition against the sale of spirits to natives, that prohibition would be broken. But if we had a State officer in charge of the sale of intoxicating drinks, the result would be different. Such an officer would have nothing to gain by supplying intoxicating liquors to natives, and it seems to me that it would be preferable to have State control as against the present system. Actual prohibition would, I think, lead to a large amount of smuggling, and it would be better to have the traffic subject to State regulation. I fear that prohibition would not be absolutely effective so far as the native races are concerned, and I arn not specially anxious that the white population should be compelled to .exist wholly without intoxicating liquors. T believe that in some countries, such as New Guinea, the consumption of a moderate quantity of alcoholic liquor is good for a white man, and unless our object can be served in no other way, I see no reason why, for the sake of the natives, the white men of the Possession should be compelled to do altogether without spirits. I would prefer to see the amendment indicated by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney put first, because I wish to vote first of all for the State regulation of the traffic. If that proposal were defeated, I should then vote for the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I have a preference for the system of State regulation of the traffic, and, therefore, I intend to vote for the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney.",34
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I am afraid that on this occasion I must vote with the enthusiast-the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-and against the practical politicians. I have come to that conclusion after listening to the speeches delivered by two practical politicians, who we discover are unable to agree. One of them considers that the State regulation of the traffic, as applied to the natives of New Guinea, would be an excellent system to adopt. The other tells us that in his opinion it would be of no avail; that in Western Australia-the only case in which he has a personal knowledge of the working of the system-it has not proved to be the success which its advocates anticipated.",35
201,Mr HUGHES,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,He did not tell us what he called a failure.,35
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Suffic e it that the honourable member described the experiment - in that way. I have no reason to believe that he was endeavouring to impose on my credulity. I accept his assurance that the experiment in Western Australia has, so far, been a failure. The honourable member urged that rum, whisky, and brandy were necessary in connection with the opening up of a country such as British New Guinea.",35
203,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It is useful to the men are opening it up.,35
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"That argument does not appeal to me, inasmuch as I do not wish to see the country opened up. I do not wish to see parties of prospectors scouring the Possession, pegging out claims for themselves, and making an effort to settle the country. My desire is that we should keep our population here for a time. When we have prospected Australia to a greater extent; when we have peopled the remote parts of the Commonwealth and turned our abundance of fertile soil to good use, it will be quite soon enough to prospect British New Guinea-to take the lands from the natives, and to give the pioneers some kind of stimulant whilst they are working in a malarial climate. For my part I shall always support the use of hot milk and water, as reported to have been recommended by the Prime Minister, in preference to any kind of stimulant. I should support its use for all ordinary purposes, even in a climate such as that of British New Guinea, as against stimulants. Toomuch milk and water may be a bad thing,, but taken in moderation it is an excellent draught, and can always be commended. I wish to see the natives left undisturbed for many a year to come. The more weleave them to their own enterprises-to their own forms of industry-and develop and police the country for them, and them alone, the more we shall seek the line of least resistance as well as the point of greatest safety. The adoption of that course will fulfil our mission for the next 50 years to come with regard to that new country. We have the melancholy experience that, whenever our people have endeavoured to civilize savage races and hav& taken the rum bottle with them, they have generally done them much harm. If we set up an establishment in British New Guinea to sell intoxicating liquor under State control, who would see that it was sold to the native population by only Government officials ?",35
205,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The officials would have noinducement to press the sale of liquor.,35
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"No ; but the honourable member for Bland has told us of the many ways by which the natives of New Guinea may surreptitiously securestrong drink. He has pointed out that there are islands in contiguity to the mainwho land of Queensland from which, they may obtain it quite apart from State enterprise.. Therefore, if prohibition would not be effective, the system of State regulation of thetraffic would be equally ineffective. Forthese reasons I think it would be advisable for us to make an effort to adopt the moresevere form of regulation.",35
207,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,There will be a great inducement for white men to smuggle strong; drink into British New Guinea if they cannot otherwise obtain it locally.,35
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I do not think that we need trouble much about the white - men.,36
209,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,But the black men will not import the liquor.,36
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"They will consume it when some one introduces it into the island. I think it would be better for us to adopt the more severe form of prohibition. I do not suggest that prohibition would be absolutely efficacious. The honourable member for Bland said that he objected to that system because it was impossible to absolutely prohibit the sale of ^strong drink. I do not suppose that the application of such a sj'stem to British New Guinea would have that effect. So far as I know, its adoption has never met with that result, but wherever prohibition obtains, the - consumption of alcoholic chinks is very much less than it is in those places where tem does not prevail. We are endeavouring to deal with natives whom it is sought to bring under the control of mis.sionary enterprise, and I think the least - can do at this time in the history of our race is to see that the missionaries go out to those natives miuus the rum bottle, and with civilizing influences in substitution it . That, I think, is the obvious course - for us to take. If we do so, and the natives subsequently obtain intoxicating liquor, the responsibility will not rest with us. We shall have discharged our conscience in that we shall have done everything within our means to keep the liquor beyond their reach. I fear that the melancholy fact is that we shall not be able to keep it out altogether. When we have done our very best, some of it will get in. But that does not discharge us from the obligation to do our best to keep intoxicating drink from the natives, believing that the best thing we can do for them is to keepthem out of touch with it . Eor these reasons, I support the clause proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.",36
211,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I have listened with deep interest to the discussion which has taken place upon this very important subject. I do not think that a British House of Parliament ever appears to greater advantage than when it is displaying, as we are doing now, a most keen - anxiety for the moral and spiritual welfare of those black races whom we so readily assimilate when our interests require us to do so. From all that ""we have heard, one would think that it would have been infinitely better to allow the natives of New Guinea to remain as they were, without any colonization under die British flag. If my honourable friend, the member for Melbourne Ports, or the honourable member for Echuca, or the honourable and learned member for Corinella, had any intention of going to reside in New Guinea it would be a very great inducement to us to pass the clause as submitted. But the last thing they propose to do is to go and face the hardships of colonizing life in New Guinea. It is so easy for men to legislate for the prohibition of things which disagree with themselves, or which are too strong for their own consumption. What would be the result of the clause ? It would simply make the medical profession a sort of vehicle for the sale and consumption of intoxicating the sysdrinks. What has happened all through America when similar attempts have been made ? My honourable friend, the member for Melbourne Ports, may look gravely at we - the ceiling just now, but I am sure that if he has read the history of the attempts which have been made he will find that they have all failed in their for object. There is no doubt about that. They have all a philanthropical and benevolent basis, but even in the history of attempts amongst white people to prevent the consumption of intoxicating drinks, the result has been that the enactment has been so openly defied and broken as to loosen altogether the basis upon which rests the sanctity of the law. There will have to be a different sort of men from those whom we know of at the present day if prohibitive laws of this description are not to be broken. This is one of those laws that does not commend itself to the views of any one who has any sense of individual right or of personal liberty.",36
212,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The same thing is said of Customs law.,36
213,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"We have been under severe treatment recently, but my right honourable friend, the late Minister for Trade and Customs, never handed over his duty to duly qualified medical practitioners as my honourable friend, the member for Melbourne Ports, proposes to do. These intoxicating liquors ought to be kept as far as possible from the natives of New Guinea; we are all agreed about that. Those natives have no votes. They have no sort of influence over us as to what they are or are not to get. It is easy to apply this prohibition to them, and they are an interesting field for such an experiment. But, so far as they are concerned, I believe that the amendment of my honourable and learned friend, the member for West Sydney, is infinitely better, and will do more to. promote the good object which my honourable frieud, the member for Melbourne Ports, has in view. The more the liquor trade is under the supervision and control of the Government the better, and the less the trade is an object of gain in New Guinea the better.",36
214,Mr MAUGEB,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,My proposal would cease to make it an object of gain ; the importation of liquor would not pay.,37
215,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"There would be an additional object of gain, because there would be also the temptation to the members of the medical profession to earn a fee by prescribing alcohol.. There are some medical men, as we all know, who have very wide ideas as to when alcohol should be prescribed as a medicine. He would be a latitudinarian of the profession who would go to New Guinea under any circumstances, probably ; and consequently this method of making the medical profession the custodian of the morals of the Papuans might end disastrously. W i th the element of gain eliminated, we shall have made effectual efforts to prevent the evils which we are all anxious to suppress. I understand that there is at present a law in force which prohibits the sale of drink to natives. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for West Sydney will tend in the same direction, and will, I think, be far more effectual than the clause of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. It will insure, so far as we insure in such a case, that all intoxicating liquor that goes there shall go through a Government channel and under Government control. It is simply impossible altogether to prevent the introduction of liquor. It is an impossibility arising from the circumstances under which that place has been colonized. But, while I thoroughly agree with the objects in view, I have always had a very strong idea that these attempts at total prohibition simply whiten the sepulchre, and cause far more irregularity and far more vice and crime than are caused under a system which is open to the light of day. I shall vote for the amendment.",37
216,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," Ishal l support the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. My only regret is that it does not go far enough. In my opinion no discretion ought to be allowed to the medical profession or even to the legal profession. As the honourable member for Parramatta has said, our duty is not so much with regard to the small white population of British New Guinea as with regard to the aboriginal inhabitants. Speaking as an Australian, I desire, if .possible, to see a total absence from the Territory which has come under Commonwealth control of the horrors which followed the advent of the white man, accompanied by intoxicating liquors, into Australia. In my opinion the only way in which this can be done is by absolute prohibition. The idea of allowing a certificate or prescription of a medical man to enable people to obtain liquor will, I consider, lead to nothing but a wholesale evasion of the law. It is proposed that Government stores shall be the sole purveyors of liquor. To hope, in the face of either of these means of obtaining drink, that we shall keep from the natives this destroying agent is, I think, absolutely absurd. I cannot imagine the condition of mind of those who are prepared to say that either of these two methods will be effectual to preserve the New Guinea race from what is undoubtedly their greatest menace. Some honourable members seem to think that this is an argument for abandoning the Territory'. I regard our retention of the Territory as absolutely necessary to Australia. I do not refer to the mineral wealth which it undoubtedly contains, nor do I mean on account of the production which might result from the employment of can the labour which would be available there. I mean on account of its proximity to Australia, and also on account of the fact that the part of the island which is not under our control is governed by two foreign powers which might at any time become enemies of the Empire. It is a great pity that we ever allowed any part of the island of New Guinea to go out of British control. We must maintain that portion of it which is already part of the Empire. But I should prefer that the foot of white man had never been placed within British New Guinea than that the black inhabitants should be completely annihilated by the introduction of what has proved in the past to be a most potent factor in the obliteration of native races. I have spoken previously on this subject, and therefore do not intend to occupy the time of the Committee at great length. I am sure that the honourable member for Coolgardie will not regard me as a bigot, although he may consider that I have strong views on this question. But it is my fixed idea that we cannot more effectually save the people of New Guinea from what I am afraid will inevitably occur-that is obliteration-tha n by keeping out altogether this most potent factor in the destruction of black races.",37
217,Mr CONHOY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,If the liquor trade were under Government control would not that get over the difficulty ? ,38
218,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If intoxicating drink is found in considerable quantities in the hands of private persons, its presence may be capable of explanation, so long as its introduction is allowed under Government or any other control; but if we have total prohibition there can be no question about the illegality of any person holding any quantity of it . AVe have, in addition, the further fact that those people who are inhabiting other portions of the Island may not be so careful about these matters as we are. Intoxicating drinks may be introduced over the frontier, and, in the absence of any prohibition on our part, this could not be legally objected to. But so long as we prevent the importation of intoxicating liquor altogether-and , personally, I do not believe that we can prevent its introduction, though we are entitled to go to the very greatest length to prevent it-w e shall have done our best.",38
219,Mr CONROY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If we cannot prevent it, why not regulate it ?",38
220,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"That is the argument used in relation to every description of vice. It has been used especially in regard to one particular evil, as to which it has been proved that regulation is not of the enormous value that has been thought by some who have only casually inquired into the subject. There is no such thing as the regulation of vice. The only policy we can pursue in regard to vice is to try to obliterate it . To attempt to regulate it will only be paltering and tinkering with the question. I hope to see the proposed new 7P clause carried. I should be very sorry indeed if, in the portion of the island which is under our control, there should be any further opportunities than we can prevent given to those who desire to supply intoxicating drinks to the aboriginals, whom we are determined shall not be the slaves, either of any man or of any vice, so long as the flag of which we are so proud, waves over that Territory. AVe can do that only by keeping drink out of the country.",38
221,Mr CONROY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Can we keep drink out ?,38
222,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,AVe must use every power that the people of the Commonwealth have placed within our grasp to prevent any chance of the natives of New Guinea following in the wake of those unfortunates who have almost completely disappeared from the face of the mainland.,38
223,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I think the honourable member for Laanecoorie gives his whole case away when he says that he does not think it possible to prevent liquor being taken into such a place as New Guinea. I quite agree with the honourable member as to that impossibility, considering the long Dutch and German frontiers.",38
224,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"But if the honourable member cannot get free trade, he likes to get as. near to free-trade as he possibly can.",38
225,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"It must be remembered, however, that the more difficulty there is in importing liquor, the higher the prico and the more lucrative the business. .",38
226,Mr MCDONALD,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Does that apply to the opium trade in Australia 1,38
227,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"At any rate, it applies to the sly-grog trade in Australia. Any one who has had experience, or has read 'the history, of the prohibition movement in Canada and the United States must know how absolutely impossible it is to carry out the policy.",38
228,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,But we are now dealing with a native race.,38
229,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I shall deal with that point presently. It has been proved that there is more drink consumed in prohibition States in Canada and America than in any of the other States.,38
230,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Who proves that ?,38
231,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Writer s on the subject; and I have had some personal experience. Some 30 years ago I was in Canada, and in the'prohibition States it was the practice for young fellows to lay in a stock of liquor on a Saturday night and hold a carouse until the Monday morning. I have seen liquor laid in by the bottle in trains in prohibition States. In other oases it was simply a matter of having a bottle of spirits sent to your bedroom or going to a chemist's shop. for a supply; in short, it was not drinking by the glass, but drinking by the bottle.",38
232,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I suppose that is the reason the liquor-traffic people so strenuously oppose prohibition.,39
233,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I intend to support the amendment of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney. For many years I have been very much in favour of what is known as the Gothenburg system, which has worked exceedingly well in Norway and Sweden. Under that system, as I understand it, the liquor traffic is conducted by the municipalities, and the profits spent in the making of roads. It has been said that the Norwegian people drank themselves into good roads; but it is admitted that the consumption of drink is considerably less under the Gothenburg system than under the old plan of free-trade. I do not know the exact method now followed out in Norway and Sweden, but I believe it is more a State than a municipal matter, and, so far as my reading goes, much good has resulted. As to New Guinea, I should feel disposed to support any plan which would give the regulation of the liquor traffic into the hands of the Government, in preference to the present system of free-trade.",39
234,Mr SPENCE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The honourable member is becoming quite a socialist.,39
235,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"For the most part of my life I have been a socialist in regard to things of this kind; and, in my opinion, the method suggested by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney would meet the difficulty very well. We all know that when anything is too rigorously withheld there arises an intense craving to obtain it .",39
236,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Does the honourable member mean that the natives will crave for something of the very existence of which they are ignorant?,39
237,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I do not know that under a system of State control the natives would ever be induced to indulge freely in liquor. W it h proper regulations as to the hours of opening and closing the saloons, the State officials having regular salaries would have no inducement to push the traffic amongst the natives. If we follow the teachings of history and experience, we find that prohibition has never met with success.",39
238,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Has it ever before been attempted with a black race 1 Mr CONROY. - We are dealing with whites as well as with blacks.,39
239,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The teaching of experience in regard to the Gothenberg system is, that the officials do not press the sale of liquor, having no inducements to do so; and all the ridiculous systems attempted in America, such as l i perpendicular "" drinking, have failed, wherever tried.",39
240,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"We might try "" no drinking between meals.""",39
241,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Eve n that fails; because a a biscuit or a sandwich can always be placed on the counter. I shall certainly vote for the amendment of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney.,39
242,Mr BROWN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I suppose the aborigines of New Guinea are very similar to those of Australia, and that not much time would be needed to give them a liking for strong drink. The Australian aboriginal took to drink as if it were mother's milk, and the old pioneer settlers, when labour was scarce, found that the best means of securing it was to give the blackfellow a supply of liquor. In those old pioneering days, the labour of the natives was paid for by supplies of strong drink at stated intervals, and the arrival of the drays with stores from centres of civilization every six months, or it might be twelve months, meant no more work from the black men for a time. All the station proprietor required was that the blackfellow should take his drink with him some considerable distance into the scrub, so that the white people should not see what took place, and very often the result was a great burial amongst the natives. The drink had the most demoralizing effect on the natives. The Australian black, in his native condition, has many admirable traits, and despite what has been said about his low position in the scale of humanity, he presents great possibilities of development. As soon, however, as he is brought into contact with drink, and acquires a taste for it- a taste which develops with marvellous rapidity-h e degenerates, and becomes the lowest of the' low. The taste for drink is an overpowering passion with the black, both male and female; and the result has been their almost complete extinction in the more settled districts. In my own part of Australia, some 35 years ago, I have seen 300 blacks muster for their annual corroborees, whereas today one may travel hundreds of miles and find only two or three remnants of what were once powerful tribes. Similar results will follow in New Guinea if the drink traffic be permitted; and returns show that the traffic is already an influence. There are about fourteen different places licensed to supply the apparent requirements of about 500 white people. We can readily understand that, with the present primitive means of communication, it is fairly costly to import liquor into New Guinea; and if the licensed victuallers were limited to the white population for their custom there would not be nearly so many engaged in the business. The reasonable inference is that a taste for strong drink is fairly prevalent amongst the natives. I have no doubt .that drink is used by white people in New Guinea as a means to secure the services of the natives-service s that would not be rendered for any other payment. Jf our control of New Guinea is to be even in a small degree a blessing, and not a curse to the natives, we must keep strong drink away from them, and the only safe course is rigid prohibition. But we have to consider that there is a growing white population in New Guinea ; and I very much question whether, so far as they are concerned, we can make prohibition complete. There would be no difficulty in dealing only with the natives ; but it is a very different matter when we have to consider a mixed population. The probabilities are that with a rigid system of prohibition-unles s there be behind a power to effectively administer the law in a community so scattered-ther e will be a great deal of illicit traffic which will extend from the white population to the native population. There will be all the injurious effects of strong drink under a nominal system of prohibition ; and that is a phase of the question which, I think, will give rise to much difficulty. The only way in which we can minimize the evil in relation to the white population is by a system of State control. I have gradually been brought to the conclusion that the true direction of reform in connection with the terrible drink curse, so far as the white population is concerned, is, not to endeavour to bring about immediately a system of prohibition, which will in every probability be inoperative, but to take away from the traffic the incentive of private profit, and place the whole business under the control of the State. What I feel strongly is, that at the outset we should do our best to take every means to prevent the demoralization and degradation of the natives of New Guinea, and I might ultimately go to the length proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports of endeavouring to inaugurate and carry out an effective system of prohibition. But I believe that, in dealing with a mixed population, the next best thing is to adopt the system of State regulation.",39
243,Mr CONROY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I regret that I cannot support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. In my opinion, it goes beyond the range of our parliamentary duties. We are at present taking over this Territory with a mixed population. I have no doubt that the honourable member, and those who agree with him, desire that the number of white people there should be increased, but he now asks us to introduce a measure of prohibition against both blacks and whites. We should not, at the present time in Australia, be able to successfully introduce such a measure, and the honourable member has failed to give us any reason why any difference in this respect should be made between the white population in New Guinea and that in Australia. Both will be under the control, to a certain extent, of the Federal Parliament, and no laws should'be made applicable to one which are not also applicable to the other. I have also a still stronger objection to the proposal, and that is the difficulty of carrying out such a measure as the honourable member proposes. It is true that we can prevent the introduction of good liquor, but we cannot prevent the introduction of bad liquor. The conversion of any of the starches into spirit is a very easy matter. The distillation of spirit is so simple that a man having a worm and still may do all the distillation he requires in a little back room. There are in New Guinea great scrubs in which a man may carry on all the distillation he pleases 100 yards away from any track. The honourable member must see that his amendment will not effect the object he desires. Under the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, white people will be able to obtain what they desire, and what from hereditary influence or custom may have become in some cases a necessity, and we shall be able more effectively to prevent the Eisher, A. natives from securing liquor. In the interests of temperance itself, I hope the honourable member for Melbourne Ports/will not press his amendment to a division. The result will be what it has been in America, where absolute prohibition has been introduced. It has never been carried into effect. The honourable member may be surprised to learn that the wholesale deterioration of the police in New York was due absolutely to the prohibition of liquor.",40
244,Mr TUDOR,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"There never was prohibition Chapman, A. in the State of New York.",41
245,Mr CONROY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"There was not absolute Forrest, Sir J. prohibition, but the regulations affecting Fysh, Sir P. O. the sale of liquor were so severe that they Hughes, amounted to a prohibition upon sound, honest, upright men going into the trade. As a consequence, the trade drifted into the hands of an entirely different class of men, Crouch, R. A. who, because they could not carry on an Paterson, A. honest trade, sought to carry on a dishonest Solomon, E. one, and in order to do so they had to Edwards, R. s born the police. The result was the total destruction, in a moral sense, of the whole police community, and consequent injury to the people of New York in a thousand other directions, without any benefit whatever from the point of view the advocates of temperance. I refer to this as a very marked instance of the effect of practical prohibition. I could refer the experience in other States as offering equally glaring examples of its regulation which we can to a certain extent control is infinitely better than a prohibiber tion which many will condemn from initiation, and which thej' will not observe. In the interests of all concerned, vote against the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and I shall support that moved by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney Question-That the proposed new clause or be inserted-put .

246,Mr BAMFORD,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I am afraid that some honourable members soarcely understand what the question is. I have heard of two honourable members who are voting in favour of this amendment state that they intended to vote for the amendment proto posed by the honourable, and learned member for West Sydney, which means State coneffect. A trol of the liquor traffic.",41
247,The CHAIRMAN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The honourable memwill have an opportunity of knowing its what the question is directly.,41
248,Mr BAMFORD,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It will be too late I shall after the other side has won. Question so resolved in the affirmative. .,41
249,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I move That the following new clause be inserted :44A. (1) A sum equal to ten per centum of the territorial revenue arising out of the sale lease of Crown lands shall in each year be appropriated for the maintenance and welfare infirm or destitute aboriginal natives (including half castes) of the Territory. (2) The sum so obtained shall be vested in three trustees appointed by the Governor General in Council who shall hold office during His Excellency's' pleasure and furnish a report of their proceedings annually for presentation to Parliament. (3) If in an3' year the whole of the sum so obtained shall not be expended the unexpended balance thereof shall be retained by the said trustees and expended for the purpose aforesaid in any subsequent year. I think that very few words are necessary to recommend those provisions to the acceptance of the Committee. When I first gave notice of the proposed new clause, honourable members had not come to the decision that no land in New Guinea should be sold, ahd, therefore, I provided that five per cent, of the proceeds of sales should be applied to the purposes named ; but in view of the fact that, in future, land in the Territory is to be subject only to lease, I now propose that the amount to be set aside shall be ten per cent. The proceeds from the sale and lease of Crown lands in New Guinea amounted to £645 18s. I d . for the year 1898-9 ; to £371 4s. for the year 18991900; and to £637 18s. 7d. for the year 1900-1 ; so that the actual sura appropriated would be very small indeed. Possibly in time the amount available under this clause will be much greater than it is now. But the sinallness or magnitude of the appropriation is not of so much consequence. What really is important"" is that we should recognise our duty to the aboriginal races. We have taken their lands from them, and the obligation is clear and unescapable of making provision out of the revenue from such lands for those members of the race who, through our action or otherwise, are in destitution. It is hardly necessary to adduce proof that occasionally there is great distress among the natives of New Guinea, because more - than once in the annual reports which have been presented to the House the resident magistrates have referred to the scarcity of food and the consequent hardship suffered by the natives there. For instance, at page .39 of the report for the year 1900-1, a resident magistrate saysDuring the early part of this year, and well on towards the end of it, the natives were very short of food, partly owing to the dry weather in the beginning of the year. Then, in the annual report for the year 1899-1900, a resident magistrate writesThe food supply all over the district has been very scanty for the greater part of the last twelve months, and, until April, 1800, no yams or native food was obtainable. The D'Entrecasteaux group seems to have suffered, most from this scarcity ; in fact, in some parts of these islands the natives were mere skeletons. A fair case can be made out for this appropriation from these reports. We are practically taking away their land from the native population, and as we have been so careful about their moral well-being, in refusing to allow them to have intoxicating liquor, we ought bo take steps to provide for their material welfare. My proposal is a very moderate one indeed. It is by no means an innovation, because in the State of Western Australia similar provision was made in the Constitution Act.",41
250,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,But it has since been removed.,42
251,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Yes ; but it was removed only on the distinct understanding given by the Legislature of Western Australia to the Imperial Parliament that a certain sum would be appropriated each year for the benefit of the aboriginal inhabitants of the State.,42
252,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,No sum was named.,42
253,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The amount was to be not less than £5,000 per annum.",42
254,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That appropriation was provided for in a local Act.,42
255,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Ye s ; and money is appropriated each year for the benefit of the aboriginals of the State. I think that the principle is a very proper one. It is to the interest of Australia to show the .world that we are prepared to deal gently, equitably, and even generously, with these disappearing races. I do not wish to detain the Committee; but I hope that there will be no difficulty in the way of the Prime Minister accepting the clause.",42
256,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I have no objection to the end aimed at by this clause, though it may be necessary, - either here or during the consideration of the measure elsewhere, in order to better carry its intentions into - effect, to make some modification of its terms. I think it a wise provision to make. The amount appropriated will be very small. The total land revenue of New Guinea during the last financial year was less than £640, so that under this provision the sum appropriated would have been less than £64. It remains to be seen, however, whether the land revenue will be maintained, and whether the alterations which we have made in the conditions of land tenure will open the door to settlement or operate in a contrary direction. I shall not, however, say anything upon that matter now. I am content to accept the proposed new clause.",42
257,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," On e of the benefits to be derived from this proposal, quite apart from the aid and relief afforded by it , will be that it will no doubt lead a series of annual reports which will throw a great deal of light upon the condition of the natives of New Guinea, and will probably strengthen the hands of the Governmeutin doing all that they can in making the influence of the Commonwealth in that part of the world beneficial. Proposed new clause agreed to. Schedule and preamble agreed to. Bil l reported with amendments; report adopted. NATURALIZATION BILL. SECOND READING. Sir EDMUNDBARTON (Hunter Minister for External Affairs) - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill was introduced in the other Chamber, and has there been the subject of amendments upon which I shall speak at this stage. I am not proposing the second reading now with a view to asking honourable members to give further attention to the measure to-night; I do so to enable them to understand in what way it has been dealt with elsewhere, and so that they may be in a position to form an opinion upon its essential provisions. This can be in no sense a party measure, and during its consideration I must depend upon the friendly co-operation of honourable members on both sides of the Chamber for its improvement- I do not mean improvement by the insertion of fanciful provisions, but by ments directed towards rendering it effective for the carrying out of the purposes in view. I shall indicate the direction in which the measure has been amended elsewhere without making any unnecessary reference to the debates of the other Chamber. As the Bill was originally introduced, men and unmarried women could apply for naturalization if they had been resident in the Commonwealth for five years, had been naturalized in the United Kingdom or in a State, or had been naturalized during infancy by the naturalization of parents. W it h regard to married women, it was provided that an alien woman who married a British subject became thereby a British subject herself, and remained so until after the death of her husband, or her divorce from him, she married an alien ; while a naturalized woman who married an alien lost her to British nationality. It was not deemed necessary to provide for the case of naturalborn women who married aliens. The provisions of the measure, so far as they applied to married women, followed to some extent the rule laid down in the English Naturalization Act of 1870-that a married woman's nationality is to be assumed to be that of her husband. As I shall show, that principle has sinee been departed from. As to infants, the Bil l originally provided that an infant whose father and mother had become naturalized, and who had at any time resided in Australia with its parents, should be naturalized during infancy, but on attaining the age of 21 years, must apply in the ordinary way to be naturalized as an adult. Now, as to the alterations which have been made by the Senate. In the first place, all persons who have been naturalized under the State laws are now to be deemed naturalized throughout the Commonwealth. The Bill originally provided that persons naturalized under the State laws must apply in the ordinary form, if they wished an extension of their citizenship to the whole Commonwealth to be granted. The original provision was framed because it was thought that some discretion should be used in making certain classes of naturalized persons citizens of the Commonwealth, though, of course, as regards the great bulk of naturalized citizens of States there was no objection. However, in view of the large number of white persons who had been naturalized in amendsome of the States, and in view of the cogent argument that in a Bill of this kind all existing circumstances should be met, so that a Commonwealth citizenship could be at once established under its provisions, it seems reasonable to provide that all persons who at the passing of the measure have become naturalized in a State shall be deemed to have become naturalized throughout the Commonwealth. Of course, we are dealing only with naturalization within the Commonwealth, because that is all we can do. As to men and unmarried women, the provisions as to whom I recounted just now, the Bill, as amended, provides that all aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the Pacific Islands, except New Zealand, shall be precluded from making application for naturalization. I am now - speaking, of course, of future naturalization. As to the term of residence, the original proposal for five years has been reduced to two years. Upon this point I have - considerable doubt. It is true that under our Franchise Act we have provided, eo nomine, against this class of persons having the franchise.",43
258,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Would that category include British subjects in India 1,44
259,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"No ; it applies only to aliens. It may be argued that in, defining our own citizenship within the Commonwealth we should not incur the same risk of introducing, complications into our relations with the Empire, and into the relations of the Empire with foreign nations, as if we were dealing with immigrants. Upon that subject, however, I must admit that I have some unsolved doubts. I can quite see that the urgency of avoiding any direct provision which might introduce complications is not quite so great in. a Bill of this kind as it would be in an Immigration Act, dealing with our external affairs, but, at the same time, I have grave doubts as to whether it would be wise to allow this provision to remain in the Bill, and whether it would hot be better to deal with such matters by way of the discretion of the Governor General in Council, which can be exercised so rigidly and with such scrutiny as to operate very largely to the same'end. . Mr Bruce SMITH - Does the amendment made by the Senate exclude British subjects in India?",44
260,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"No , nothing can exclude a natural-born British subject. ' If we found that the Bill attempted to do so, we should soon put thab right.",44
261,Mr WINTER COOKE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"How is the ""aboriginal "" denned 1",44
262,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I presume it means the aboriginal race of a country, as we know it . I am afraid that for any further information I shall have to refer my honourable friend to the dictionary.",44
263,Mr CONROY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Hunte r in his "" Empire of India "" shows that the aboriginal natives of India number only 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 out of a total population of 280,000,000.",44
264,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Then a question may arise as to the interpretation of the intentions of the other Chamber. believe, however, that the intention was that all natives of an alien country should be excluded.",44
265,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Have the Government decided upon the course they will adopt 1,44
266,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I am inclined to think that the House should be invited to disagree with the amendment. It may not be so serious as if it were in a Bill of another character, but I think that, in order to avoid trouble or complication, it will be advisable to . put the matter in another shape. Married women, as to whose status in the original Bill I gave some information just now, are by the amendment of the Senate placed upon the same footing as men and unmarried women. Under the Bill as it stands a married woman can apply for naturalization quite independently of her husband. As a result, the only difference in fact between women and men under the Bill appears to be this: that there are two ways in which a woman may be naturalized-firs t by application, and secondly by marrying a British subject.",44
267,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,What would be the position the other way 1,44
268,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Unde r the Bill as originally introduced an alien woman who married a British subject would become a British subject, and remain so until after the death of her husband, or her divorce from him. If she afterwards remarried with „ an alien she would cease to be a British subject. That is to say her nationality would follow that of her husband. The Bill followed the ordinary rule of law.",44
269,Mr KIRWAN,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,If she did not remarry what would be the position ?,44
270,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Sh e would be of the British nationality which her first marriage conferred upon her. Then the naturalized woman who married an alien lost her nationality, and that again was in term accordance with either the English Act or with the report of the British Naturaliza* tion Committee.",44
271,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Would she resume her British nationality when her alien husband died 1,44
272,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Not in that case. It was not deemed necessary to provide for women who were natural-born British subjects, and who married aliens. The provision as to married women follows the English law, under which a married woman's I nationality is deemed to be that of her hus, band.",44
273,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,If a British woman marries an alien she loses her nationality ?,45
274,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"That would appear to have been so under the British law of 1870. There are two ways in which an alien woman may be naturalized, one method being by application- a right which she has in common with men-and the other being by marriage with a British subject. It would appear that the amendment made in this respect has put aside the principle of law laid down in the English Naturalization Act of 1870, that a British woman who marries an alien becomes an alien, because the Bill now provides that if a woman who is a British subject marries an alien, she shall retain her nationality. Therefore, a marriage with an alien will make no difference in the status of a woman who is a British subject.",45
275,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Then we may understand that, speaking generally, women are treated in exactly the same way as men ?",45
276,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Yes , practically so. I think that in this matter .we may adopt the Senate's amendment, because the trend of modern legislation is such as to give colour to the claim that as women have been placed upon an equality in regard to the franchise, and have been qualified to hold property, they are entitled to an inde. pendent status to a certain extent.",45
277,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Would that apply to. by the Bill. women who marry aliens in other parts of the world ?,45
278,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I think we can speak of the operation of the Bill only within our own jurisdiction, but my honourable friend will find by reference to the Bill how far that extends. Although the provision in the Bill may be in terms unqualified, the question as to how it should be read is another matter. W it h regard to children, I have already pointed out that, as originally introduced, the Bill provided that an infant whose father or mother had become naturalized British subjects should, during infancy, become naturalized subjects also, but that that qualification should cease upon their attaining the age of 21, when they would have the right to apply for naturalization in the ordinary way. The Bill has been altered- I do not know whether it can be said to enlarge the right of the infant or not - to obviate the necessity for any application, because it provides that an infant becoming naturalized by the status of either parent cannot lose that naturalization except upon application to be denaturalized. The other alterations made in the Bill are of a minor character.",45
279,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I do not think there is any provision in the Bill for denaturalization.,45
280,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Not in the Bill as it now stands, but in clause 10, as originally produced, it was provided that the children of naturalized British subjects should retain their naturalization only during infancy, and that on reaching the age of 21 they should cease to be naturalized and should be required to make a de= novo application.",45
281,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Then it is not proposed to provide any special facilities for denaturalization ?,45
282,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"No, I do. not think so.",45
283,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If it is intended thatwomen should be placed upon an equal footing with men in every respect, why should not the marriage of a British-born woman with an alien have the effect of naturalizing the husband in the same way that the marriage of an alien woman with a British subject has the effect of naturalizing the wife ?1",45
284,Sir EDMUND BARTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That is rather a conundrum.,45
285,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The question is raised * Sir EDMUND BARTON - I think it would be rather difficult to carry the equality to that extent. The Senate have abolished the fee of £ 1 which it was intended to charge applicants for naturalization. I do not propose to object to that, because I think the money is neither here nor there. Then again, the Bill originally provided that applicants for naturalization should' furnish a certificate signed by a justice of the peace stating that the applicant was known to him, and was, to the best of his knowledge, a person of good repute. Under the Bill as it stands it is provided that an applicant shall obtain such a certificatesigned by a justice of the peace, or by three electors. I have some doubt as to whether that is not too great an extension of the original provision, because we know that there are a very few places in which an intending applicant cannot, without much trouble, find a justice of the peace, and I think it is desirable to have the certificate of a responsible person. The extended proposal appears to me to offer too easy a way of disposing of any difficulty regarding the character and repute of a person applying for so great a privilege as admission to the citizenship of the Commonwealth. I have now explained the main provisions of the Bill as originally introduced, and in its present form. I have no need to add anything beyond saying that while the provisions with regard to the franchise, particularly in Australia, have made the bare grant of naturalization in itself not so important as it . used to be, there is in regard to citizenship of this - Commonwealth so much of importance, and so much that calls for the exercise of care, that I hope I shall have the co-operation of honourable members in so moulding the measure that it shall prove generally acceptable. As I have said, I do not propose to ask honourable members to continue the debate to-night, but I hope that they will consider the amendments which have been. made - elsewhere in the light of the Bill as originally introduced-copie s of which - can be obtained-and that they will co-operate with me in evolving provisions which will conduce to the best interests of the Commonwealth. Debate (on motion by Mr Reid ) adjourned. DEFENC EBILL . In Committee (Consideration resumed from 23rd July, vide page 2563) : Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Clause 4In this Act, unless the contrary intention - appeals'' Active Service ""-Mean s service force which is engaged in operations against the enemy ancl includes any military or naval service in time of war. ""Army Act""-Mean s the Imperial The Army Act and any Acts amending or in substitution for it, including the Articles of War made under the authority such Acts, and for the time being in force. -"" Naval Discipline Act""-Mean s the Imperial .

"" War ""-Mean s any invasion or threatened invasion of, or attack or threatened attack on, the Commonwealth or any Territory under the control of the Commonwealth by an enemy or armed force, and includes war or the danger of war the existence of which is proclaimed by the Governor General.",45
286,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Northern Melbourne) I desire to direct the attention of the Committee to a few definitions under this clause, whichimparts to the Bill its whole colour and efficiency, and. which, therefore, requires to be watched more closely than does any other provision in it. It declares that "" active service"" means "" service in or with a force, which is engaged in operations against the enemy, and includes any military or naval service in' time of war."" To my mind, all the words after the word "" enemy"" could with advantage be ebininated. The phrase ""active service"" appears in several clauses, and amongst others I may instance clauses 43 and 44. Honourable members will see that under the provisions of clause 43, the Governor General may in time of war call out the citizen forces for active service. Now, the term "" citizen forces"" includes the members of rifle clubs, militia, and volunteers, also men who have served their time, and who, under ordinary circumstances, would no longer be liable to be called upon. Thus, if these two clauses are read together, it will be seen that the Governor General in time of war may call out the members of the rifle clubs for any military or naval service. I feel certain that the Minister has no intention to make it incumbent upon rifle club men to proceed in or with a to Afghanistan or America",46
287,Sir JOHN FOBKEST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"We cannot compel Act called them to do so under the Bill. . Mr HIGGINS - It may not be the of Minister's intention to do so, but this particular definition is So wide as to lead people to the conclusion that that is his intention. and I wish to make it perfectly clear that for neither the General Officer Commanding, and for nor anybody else, has power to compel a man to leave Australia and proceed to the uttermost parts of the earth in time of war. It will be observed that in this clause the proclamaphrase "" time of war"" is defined in the danger most liberal fashion to mean ""any time deduring which a state of war actually exists."" Where ? To my mind, the answer is "" anywhere.""",46
288,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Does not clause 45 distinctly limit the whole operation of these matters 1,47
289,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I have no desire to enter into any technical argument upon this question. At the same time, I think that in dealing with our citizen forces we ought not to employ any language which is not apt. What is the use of enacting a definition which is far too wide, and which may lead to misunderstandings ?",47
290,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The Rill in its present form provides that the permanent forces shall be liable to serve anywhere.,47
291,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I frankly avow that, in my judgment, we ought not to compel any man to engage in active service outside the Commonwealth. The Minister for Defence seems to have obtained his definition of ""active service"" from the English Army Act, which is utterly inappropriate to our particular conditions. I therefore move That the words ""and includes any military or naval service'in time of war,"" lines 5 and omitted. I am afraid that the definition extends further than the preliminary words would appear to indicate. I would ask the Committee to look at clause 46, where the words "" active service"" are also employed, although in that case they are not so important. Then, in clause 51, it is provided that the permanent military forces, and also all persons permanently employed in the active military forces, shall at all times, and all members of the citizen military forces shall while on ""active service,"" be subject to the Army Act. I am anxious to see that this definition is not too wide. Clause 52 provides that the naval forces while on ""active service"" shall be subject to the Naval Discipline Act. Clause 53 ' deals with the case of a man who is killed "" on active service,"" but there the provision, so far as it goes, . is for the benefit of the individual. In clause 58 we find that cadets are not to be liable for ""active service,"" while clause 74 provides thatAny member of the citizen forces who, when liable to be employed on active service, absents himself without leave from his corps for a longer period than seven days, shall be deemed a deserter, and may be punished accordingly. That is a very stiff provision. It means that even if a man is so ill as to be unable to go on active service",47
292,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"We will allow amendment, so as to make it clear that if a man is ill and unfit for service he shall not. be punished for absenting himself from his corps.",47
293,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I would suggest that, the Minister should explain what is meant by the words "" and includes any military or naval service,"" in addition to* what appears in the earlier part of the definition.",47
294,Mr MCC AY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I must confess that I do not share the apprehensions of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne with regard to this definition. A fte r all, it will have force only so far as. the words ""active service"" are found in the various clauses of the Bill, and the various clauses relating to "" active service "" must, it seems to me, be controlled by this definition. Sub-clause (2) of clause 45 limits territorially the area within which the citizen forces may be employed. The words at the end of thedefinition are absolutely necessaiy for the most obvious and ordinary purposes of 6, be discipline. If they were not there, a member of the forces who in time of war was with a section not actually engaged in operations against the enemy might allege that he was not on active service. If the forces were called out in Melbourne and in Sydney toresist an invasion, and the enemy landed in Sydney, and was expected daily in Melbourne, the men remaining in Melbourne, or travelling by rail to reinforce the defenders in Sydney, might otherwise say that they were not on active service.",47
295,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The honourable and learned member would leave the matter open to argument. I wish to have it clear.,47
296,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,""" A force which is enengaged in operations against the enemy "" is a phrase which I understand when it occurs in military text-books, even if I do not understand its use in an Act of Parliament. It has a distinct meaning. It is one thing to be going to engage in operations against an enemy, and quite another thing to be actually engaged.",47
297,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"A man moving with a force to an engagement would, of course, be in operation against the enemy.",47
298,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If the honourable and learned member were engaged in moving only towards the theatre of war, he would not regard himself as being engaged in operations; he would consider that he wastravelling to a place where he would be so an engaged. Even assuming that once men entered a train at Melbourne to reinforcethe forces in Sydney they would be "" enline gaged in operations against the enemy""which is open to argument-the omission of these .words would mean that troops sary. would not be so engaged although they were called out for active service. To limit the definition to being actually engaged - active service against the operations of - enemy might be to lead to endless trouble and difficulty. These words are absolutely necessary in order to make it clear . once a man is serving in time of war popies of those measures. he is on ""active service,"" whether he fighting or on the point of fighting, inarching to an engagement. I venture say that the definition is intended specifiwittingly cally to cover a case in which it might - otherwise be alleged that a man was not - engaged in operations against the enemy.  honourable and learned member for Corinella, differ from the opinions expressed by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. Knowing that he hates the sight of anything relating to the - army or navy, I can well understand that made he desires a Defence Bill in which the words "" naval "" and "" military"" do not appear. think the definition is very explicit, and not be put in any other form. How would war. the - honourable and learned member deal with a body of irregulars which mustered in various parts of Australia when the Commonwealth was on her defence ? How would he bring those forces within the - scope of the Bill 1 He would say that they towere not engaged in military operations until they actually joined the active forces. As a matter of fact, as soon as a body of irregular horse was raised in South Africa its name appeared on the active service",47
299,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I should say that they were engaged in operations enemy. There are. words in the definition which cover the honourable member's puror pose ; why should we have more than is necessary ?,48

302,Mr BAMFO RD,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I merely wish to draw the attention of the Minister in for Defence to the fact that in several the paragraphs in the interpretation clause reference is made to the Army Act and to the Naval Discipline Act, but that that we have not been supplied with It is of the is utmost importance that we should know to or what we are pledging our Defence Forces. to In the present circumstances we might unbind them to something of which we did not approve, and, therefore, I think it is right that we should be supplied with copies of the Acts I have named.

Under clauses 43, 49, and 56 extraordinary powers are given to the Governor General in time of war; we want to find out when these extraordito nary powers are to come into play. We not going to give to the Governor General absolute power in these things. According to this definition, if the Governor General, having proclaimed war upon the ground that there was merely a danger of war, failed to revoke that proclamation; and to say that * there was no danger of war any longer, the citizen forces would be liable to be kept out in the field; would be liable to the Naval Discipline A ct and the Army Act; could be treated as deserters ; could be tried under the extraordinary powers of a court martial, and so forth. In fact, civil law would be suspended in regard to them, merely because the Governor General had failed to issue a "" W a r "" proclamation that the danger of war was actually over. The ordinary practice is for Ministers to take the risk in these cases. So far as I know there is no instance in which it is left to the absolute discretion of the Ministry-of the Governor General in Council, or any similar authority-to say whether there is war or danger of war or not. I referred the other day to the case of De Marais in Cape Colony, which occurred about two years ago. In that case a man was arrested in the east of Cape Colony, where there were no incursions of Boers. He was brought to a place where soldiers were and tried by martial law, and kept in prison for a long time before trial. He said that in the east of Cape Colony the ordinary courts were open, and that he could apply for habeas cm-pus and get out of can gaol because no charge was laid against him. But he was imprisoned without a trial",49
313,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Is that the man who brought authority. I an action in England 1,49
314,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"He brought his action in Cape Colony, and afterwards appealed to In that case the military authorities were called upon to prove that, though there was no war in the east of Cape Colony, there was danger of war; and because they proved that there Dewas danger of war,'they were exonerated. The man who brought the action had no But remedy-rightl y so from the point of view The of law. But suppose that some man had of made himself obnoxious to the Military Comof mandant. That Military Commandant sees 55, that the Governor General's proclamation has not been revoked. He is able to use his but power to have the man who was obnoxious him arrested, and to keep him locked up are without trial for weeks, months, and perhaps years. I have looked at the Canadian Act, under which no such power is given for the Governor General to fix finally as to how long there is to be a time of war or danger of war. I have looked at the English Volunteer Act, and I find that there is. no such power there. If there is any place in the world where there would be such power as this, it would be in England. J want to know what precedent the there Minister has for leaving it to the - onl activity of the Governor General to say whether or not a state of war actually exists or - whether there is danger of it Of course, the earlier words stand-that time of war means "" any time during which what it says isa state of war actually exists."" The honourable and learned member for Corinella a has said that he would trust the definition of the word "" war,"" as modified below, as wealth answering the purpose sufficiently. That is issue quite enough' to show that we ought not to attack, leave the Ministry power for purposes of their own to call upon men to serve.",49
315,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The honourable and learned member might as well say that he would not leave it to the English Government to do so either. ' Mr HIGGINS - They cannot do so in England - and that includes threatened invasion or,50
316,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,They have' power to declare war.,50
317,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"But my speech has been fruitless if the Minister has not caught the point that in the Volunteer Act in England there is no such power for Ministers to issue their proclamation as a final test of whether there is danger of war, nor as to martial law.",50
318,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The volunteers in England are not different from any other troops.,50
319,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Unde r the Volunteer Act there is no power for the Government to issue their proclamation and to say whether there is danger or not.,50
320,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I think there is.,50
321,Mr KINGSTON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,What other test is there 1,50
322,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If a Ministry exercises powers it must be called upon to prove its facts. So far as I am concerned, I decline to accede to the position that a Ministry may choose to keep the people in arms for months and months, long after the actual danger of invasion has ceased.",50
323,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Would,50
324,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"It all depends. If the Minister for Defence goes into opposition and forms another Ministry, very likely he would do it . I admit that the present Government would not do it .",50
325,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I propose to assume that the words at the end of the definition of "".war"" have been omitted as a agreed to by the Minister for Defence. If those words remained in the Bill I think would be a good deal in the abstract y in the abstract:-in the objections raised by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. But if those - words are omitted and we proceed to read the definition of ""time of war"" as it stands, "" Time of war "" means any time during which state of invasion, or threatened invasion, or attack, or threatened attack on, the Commonexists, and includes the time between the of a proclamation of the existence of war or threatened invasion or attack, or threatened and the issue of a proclamation declaring that the invasion, or threatened invasion, or attack, or threatened attack, no longer exists.",50
326,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The proclamation is the law itself.,50
327,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I want to point out what the definition says. It says, first, the time during which the invasion or attack exists threatened attack-and also the time that succeeds a proclamation by the Governor General that the invasion or threatened invasion exists. That is to say, the Governor General may proclaim that an invasion exists. I do not think that the honourable and learned member will quarrel with that. The Governor General would hardly proclaim that it existed if it did not exist. B ut the honourable and learned member may say that the Governor General may proclaim that a threatened invasion exists, and the forces may be called upon to serve. That is a power which I want to give to the Governor General, subject to the control of Parliament. Our forces are scattered over many thousands of miles, and it is essential that the military forces which the Commonwealth has at its disposal should' be mobilized before the en'emy reaches our shores, and should be ready to move wherever required.",50
328,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,No one denies that ; it is obvious.,50
329,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,But the honourable and learned member forgot it when he was adthey do so 1 dressing himself to this question. - Mr HIGGINS - Not in the least.,50
330,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"He told us about an unoffending citizen who might be imprisoned for years under the extraordinary powers exercised by a local Commandant. Unless the power existed, for the Governor General to call out the forces in this way, the Government might be met by members of the forces-wh o are sworn to serve in time of war-saying , "" Though the Government may think there is a threatened invasion, as a matter of fact there is no invasion, and I am not going out until I am satisfied that invasion, or threatened invasion, exists."" If we cannot trust the Governor General-the Crown's representative-actin g on the advice of Ministers, to call out the forces for active service when there is a necessity for - them, I cannot conceive of any circumstances under which we can trust the Executive at all. Such a time as is contemplated under this definition is, it seems to me, a time when we . must trust the Executive. If there is no Executive to act, there is nothing. Parliament cannot control the operations of an array, though it may bring to book the people who have control of them. But when war is threatened we must have some one to act.",50
331,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Why is there not this power in Canada ?,51
332,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I do not know why they have not such a power in Canada, because - I was not there when the Act was passed. I am not prepared to answer for their sins of omission or of commission. It seems to me that in the case of Australia this is a wise and proper provision. It cannot be said that I am led to this conclusion by any ultra jingoistic sentiments, because I have expressed myself over and over again about the limitation of the service of the Australian forces to Australian defence, except as volunteers. I have always held that we can get plenty of volunteers for service of any kind. This is a proclamation which the Executive issues as the agent of Parliament and' the people; and unless it has to pass unquestioned it will give rise to doubts, difficulties, and ""bush "" lawyers. I admit that a power is given to the Executive, but it is a wise and very necessary power, and we must risk having a foobsh Executive on occasions. In Australia we ought to be able to mobilize troops at the scattered spots around the continent in good time. If England were engaged in a big war with one or more of the great powers, we should not know-becaus e the enemy would not tell us-of any threatened attack on the Commonwealth ; yet the chances would be that if the enemy found us unprepared they would* to use an every-day phrase, be glad to "" catch us on the hop."" In the absence of any sign; it would be easily open for people to say there was no threatened or apprehended invasion - that there was a mere apprehension of danger",51
333,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That is all we want according to the definition of war- a threatened invasion will do.,51
334,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"W it h all respect, I do not think that ""threatened invasion "" means as much as ""apprehended invasion""; one means an overt act, and the other means a feeling that invasion may come.",51
335,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,In the definition of which I have given notice I speak of actual or apprehended invasion.,51
336,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"There has not been a fight on English soil since the battle of Sedgemoor, more than 200 years ago. When Britain declares war the regular army is moved to the scene of operations, though they are not regarded as being in the field when embarked. The troops which sailed from Southampton to South Africa were not regarded as being in operation against the enemy whilst they were sailing to South Africa. The Crown declares war, and the troops sail for the theatre of war, and there they are on active service, and subject to anything that may happen in time of war. In the peculiar geographical circumstances of England, men go from England to the war, whereas war will come to us ; and that makes it all the more necessary for us to fix a time, without waiting for the enemy to come to us. It is impossible to argue that this definition of war cover's anything except actual or threatened invasion or attack, and the Executive are the only people who can possibly be left to say when an actual or threatened attack has assumed dimensions so portentous as to justify the calling out of the forces. And to fix a time is better for the men. Here is a time before which the men are free, and after which they come within the operation of the Act so far as active service is concerned, and, therefore, I trust the Government will adhere to this proper definition.",51
337,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Northern Melbourne) I agree with every word of the honourable and learned member for Corinella so far as regards the need of the Ministry acting and taking the responsibility. I did not know that honourable members would need to be reminded that Ministers must accept and take responsibility, and be careful to see that they do not unnecessarily call out the people. If the Committee against me, I cannot help it ; but I want make sure that too great power is not gi ven to any Ministry-no t merely this, but section 100. future Ministries - to interfere with the people's liberty. In England there is not vided ? this particular power.",51
338,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Yes , there is.",52
339,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,In Canada there is not invasion. this particular power. Will the Minister for Defence show in what section of the English Volunteer Act this power is given,52
340,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I say that in Engthe Executive. land the Government have the right to declare war.,52
341,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That is not the point. Is there any similar provision in the Bill Canadian Act 1,52
342,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I do not know about country. the Canadian Act.,52
343,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"In England this power is not required. The English Volunteer Act has worked well for more than 40 years, having been passed in 1863, and that Act the only power to call out even the volunteers, let alone making a levy masse, is in the case of actual or 'apprequestion hended invasion.",52
344,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Apprehende d invaprehended, sion-the Bill provides no more. I prefer "" apprehended,"" and will move the insertion of the word.",52
345,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I should have no objecliament, tion to power being given to call out the forces under such circumstances; but the great danger is that the Ministry may decline to issue a proclamation stating the apprehension of war is at an end.",52
346,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The law is the in England.,52
347,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The Minister has not been able to refer me to the section of English Act wherein that law is set forth. The Minister cannot show me that the clamation of a Ministry, or a GovernorI General, or the King, is a supreme test whether or not there is war or danger war.",52
348,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,In England volunteers cannot be released without the consent of the Lieutenant of the county given in writing.,52
349,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I am afraid I have not been able, and that I shall not be able, to convey, as I should like, the Minister. At all events, I have sent for the Canadian Act, and for the British Act, and any one who wishes' may there see on what is I am relying. The English Act is 26 to and 27 Vict., Chapter 67, section 17; and the Canadian Act is 46 Vict., Chapter 11,",52
350,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,What is there pro,52
351,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That there must be war or danger of war-actua l or apprehended 1,52
352,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"There must be some one to say when invasion, is apprehended, t and I take it that it is "" apprehended "" by",52
353,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I cannot go further, as I have not the Acts here, but any one who wishes may refer to them, and see that this gives to the Executive a power that has never hitherto been given in any civilized",52
354,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," The whole point raised by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne turns on giving power in to the Executive to proclaim that there is actual or apprehended danger'of invaen sion. Some one will have to decide the ; some one will have to say that we are actually at war, or that there is war apwar meaning invasion. Nothing happens under this Bill unless the Governor, under clauses 43 and 44, issues a proclamation which is communicated to Parif it is sitting, calling out the forces. It seems to me that the discretion must be left with the Ministry of the day; and that is the rule in every country. In England, that a formal announcement of war is made by proclamation issued by His Majesty, and same posted in the City of London. We in Australia cannot declare war, not being a Sovereign State; but war declared in Engthe land makes uS at war. The question has been asked what we should do if war prowere declared against some petty State. f it were a State which had no naval of force-such , for instance, as the Orange of Free State and Transvaal- I do not suppose that any proclamation would be issued the in Australia. At any rate, if there was a proclamation that war existed, the troops would certainly not be called out, in view of the fact that the enemy's country had no naval force to send here to interfere with us. Mr 'EWING - If Britain were at war, we position to the should be at war.",52
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,But it would not be necessary to call out the troops if there was no naval force to come against us.,52
356,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Then we would not he at war within the meaning of the Act.,53
357,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The honourable that. and learned member for Northern Melbourne has referred to the Volunteer Act in Britain. Under that Act, in case of or apprehended invasion of any part of United Kingdom, the Kin g may direct Lieutenants of counties to call out the volunteer forces in the respective counties.",53
358,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That is the section to which I referred.,53
359,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"B y section 19 of the English Act, the volunteers, after they have finished their service, may leased by an order in writing, signed by Lieutenant of the county to which the corps belongs, and before they are released each corps must be returned to its county. That is the same procedure as is set forth Bill-w e have copied the procedure of the United Kingdom. The honourable and learner] member for Northern Melbourne suggests that the citizen forces might be kept on active service for an indefinite period. But so they may be in England.",53
360,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"-- The Minister has just out our troops ? read the English section, which shows that the proclamation is not sufficient - that there must be actual or apprehended danger, as well as a proclamation.",53
361,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Dange r apprehended by clamation the person who ssues the proclamation.,53
362,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Quite so.,53
363,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Lieutenant s of clause counties may be directed to call out the volunteers, and I do not see any difference between that Act and the Bill. We are far away, and war with sorrje great power might be declared in England, and we might be without information as to whether had actually been declared or not. It might be necessary for us to make some provision, it might even be necessary for us to call'out the forces without knowing whether war had been actually declared. Mi . HIGGINS - No one denies that. ",53
364,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The cables might be cut, and we might be for a long time without communication with the old try. In such circumstances, it would be very foolish indeed for us to sit still and nothing if we were under the apprehension that the Nation was actually at war with some great power.",53
365,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That would be appre r hension enough; I have no objection to,53
366,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I propose to Great ask the Committee to agree to the use of actual the word ""apprehended"" which, in my the opinion, is better than the word ""threathe tened."" I do not know why the honourable and learned member should desire to take away from the Executive Government of this country powers which are exercised certainly in all sovereign States, if not in States that are not sovereign, like the Com- monwealth. A.s the honourable and learned member knows, the Executive Government be rein England has unlimited power. They the may make treaties even in reversal of the policy agreed to by Parliament; they may release the most atrocious criminals j and may declare war against the whole world. in the Why the honourable and learned member should desire that the Executive Government in this country should not be intrusted with authority by Parliament to say when they apprehend danger of war, is more than I can understand. Why should they not be given the power to say by proclamation that, the time has arrived when we shall call",53
367,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That is not the point.,53
368,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Unde r this Bill we provide that the Government shall not call out the troops nntil they have issued a pro ; that war absolutely exists, or that there is danger of war. When we have issued such a proclamation we may, under 43, call out the troops. It seems to me that that is a reasonable power to give to any Government, and that it is an absolutely necessary power for any Government to have, unless we are willing to sit here in fancied security and do nothing until the war enemy is absolutely at our door.",53
369,Mr LE GROOM,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It is the sending back of the troops that the honourable and learned member is concerned about. He fears that they may be kept out for an undue period.,53
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The proclamation will say when the troops are to be called out, and when they are no longer required a proclamation will be issued to say that they are no longer required, when they counmust be returned to their homes.",53
371,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," The Mindo ister has, I think, gone far beyond the point raised by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. I have listened veryattentively to the honourable and learned member, and I have carefully read the amendments, of which he has given a sufficiently long notice. I am bound to say that I cannot see any logic in his suggestions. The honourable and learned member seems to be entirely disturbed by a fact that has no bearing on this question. He appears to think that Canada is a prototpye which we are bound to follow on every possible occasion. The honourable and learned member finds some precedent in Canada for - certain action he has taken in this House, but I do not see why we should be guided - entirely by Canada in a mattes upon which we profess to be able to think for ourselves. 'The Minister for Defence has shown a complete parallel between the condition of the law in England and the condition of the law - sought to be enacted here. If honourable members will consider the amendment - of which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has given notice, they will find that "" time of war,"" - as he defines it, would mean any time during which a state of war actually exists. There are a number of clauses in this Bill under which the Executive are given power in time of war to call out certain of the forces, and the effect of the amendment would be that the Executive of this country would not have power to exercise their functions under these clauses in calling out certain of the forces until war actually existed with the - Commonwealth. ""Who ever heard of such a thing as that ? The General Officer Commanding, who is the permanent head of the War Department, whose representative in Parliament is the Minister for Defence, would have no power under our Defence Act to call out the troops until - war was actually at our door. Then the. honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne leads himself into this - contradiction that while under his first - amendment ""time of war"" would require war actually to exist, the word "" war"" itself would include existing war or the apprehension of war. If we speak of time of war, and take "" war "" to be as defined by the last interpretation proposed, we should refer to - a time during which war actually existed, Or was apprehended. But if we take the expression "" time of war "" as defined in the Other mterpretation proposed by the honourable and learned member, we should refer to a time in which war actually existed, and not to a time when it was apprehended. The Minister has completely answered the honourable and learned member's statement that there is no parallel to this proposal in England. This Bill provides that as soon as war exists, or is apprehended, the permanent head of our Defence Forces, through the Minister, shall have the power of determining that certain troops shall be called out, and the interpretation clause shows clearly that it is contemplated that a proclamation shall be issued, because it is provided that"" Time of war "" means any time during which a state of war actually exists, and includes the time between the issue of a proclamation of the existence of war or danger thereof and the issue of a proclamation, declaring that the war or danger thereof declared in the prior proclamation nolonger exists. That is to say, it includes the period between one proclamation and another. The logic of this is that' the Minister for Defence will have to issue a proclamation declaring that war existed or was threatened, and he would have to issue another proclamation, at a time when the danger had passed, saying that it was at an end. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne seems to be under some misapprehension that the Executive may, as he says, for reasons of? their own, keep back the issue of the second proclamation. Let us look for a moment at the parallel in England. The Minister for Defence shows us that in England the Executive can declare war, and that when the period of danger is over the troops are "" released."" That releasing of the troops is no doubt done by proclamation; but, whether it be done by proclamation or not, it could be kept back just as easily as the issue of the second proclamation here. If the Executive of Great Britain were anxious to keep back the release of troops their action would have exactly the same effect of checking or nullifying any rights that might arise, as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne apprehends would follow the same action of the Executive here, if they had any object of their own to serve. We have no desire to mix up the Executive with the legislative functions of the country in this House. It would be an absurd proposal to suggest that this House should be consulted as to the time when it is necessary to call out the troops. I should be sorry to see the day when the question whether war is threatened, in the sense in which military men would understand it , would come up for discussion amongst us.' The effect of the clause therefore is that, if the General Officer Commanding considers thab war is threatened, it is open to the Executive to take action equivalent to a. declaration of war in England, and when the time of danger is over it will be open to them to declare that the time has passed during which the danger threatened, and then all the rights which may have arisen would be at an end, and the Government would be protected against any claims such as those suggested by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. I hope the Minister for Defence will adhere to these clauses as they stand, because the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has not suggested any improvement, nor has he shown any fault in the drafting of this part of the measure.",53
372,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," It must strike honourable members that the honourable and learned member who has directed attention to this clause has taken it for granted that the Executive body in the Parliament of Australia will be composed of idiots or something worse. We may conjure up evils or troubles in connection with any clause in any Bill or Constitution. As the Minister for Defence has already pointed out, it is in the power of the Prime Minister of this country to choose his Ministers from undesirable people in the street. The right honourable gentleman has pointed out that it is in the power of the Prime Minister or of the Executive, if they see fit, to liberate all criminals, but they do not do these things, because it is understood that government will be carried on in accordance with common sense. If we do not assume common sense in the interpretation of these clauses, or of the Constitution, the whole system of representative government falls to the ground.",55
373,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,On the honourable member's reasoning we had better abolish all Acts of Parliament and give Ministers absolute discretion to do everything.,55
374,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"In reply to the honourable and learned member I may say that there are two considerations, which prevent an Executive from doing anything that is wrong. The first is that they are afraid of losing their position.",55
375,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That is very rough on them.,55
376,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The only punishment which a Parliament can inflict on an Executive is that of destroying it . Men are not members of a Ministry for the purpose of drawing their salaries, but for the purpose of doing good, and I have no doubt that the honourable.and learned member for Northern Melbourne would consideritanextremepenalty to be deprived of the opportunity of doing good. The honourable and learned member is endeavouring to do good in this instance according to his lights. We may, I think, assume first that we will have an Executive which can be punished, and that the members of the Executive have a senseof responsibility, and a fear of Parliament. It is right that the Executive should fearto do what Parliament does not desire, or what would be adverse to public opinion, knowing that if it does these things it will be punished for them. What the clausemeans is that the Executive must accept the responsibility of saying when a certain state of things exists, and that responsibility must be accepted^ no matter how the clause h& worded! That being so, it is remarkable that an honourable member who believes in the supremacy of the people under a system whereby the Executive is controlled by a majority in Parliament should be frightened by the possibility of evil being done by an Executive which is virtually under thedomination of the people.",55
377,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Northern Melbourne) I have now in my possession the English Volunteer Act, 26 and 27 V i c , cap. 65, section 17 of which provides thatIn case of actual or apprehended Invasion of any Part of the United Kingdom (the Occasion, being first communicated to both Houses of Parliament if Parliament is sitting, or declared in Council aud notified by Proclamation if Parliament is not sitting), Her Majesty may direct the Lieutenants of Counties throughout G veat Britain, or such of them as Her Majesty may judge necessary, to call out the Volunteer Corps of their respective Counties, or any of them, for actual Military Service. In England, therefore, there must be first an actual or an apprehended invasion. Then there must be the declaration to Parliament, or proclamation-tw o safeguards ; while under the clause only one is provided for. I am not in the least affected in my view by the speeches which I have heard upon this point, because I think they have been delivered under a misapprehension. To reduce to an absurdity the argument of the good-natured, humorous, and eloquent member for Richmond, we should abolish Acts and Constitutions, and say that the Ministry of the day shall have full power to do anything they think fit, since they may be trusted not to abuse their power because of bheir anxiety to keep their - seats. If the clause is to remain, the word "" apprehended"" should be substituted for the word "" threatened "" in the two places where it occurs, and the last few words should be omitted. Mr MoCAY (Corinella) - I should like to point out to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that, under the section of the English Volunteer Act which he has quoted, the invasion may be - either actual or apprehended-apprehende d by the person who makes the proclamation, that is, the King acting on the advice of his Privy Council. The section readsIn case of actual or apprehended Invasion the Occasion being first communicated to both Houses of Parliament if Parliament is sitting, or declared in Council and notified by Proclamation if Parliament is not sitting. The King in Council may apprehend an in"" vasion, and make a proclamation, and if he does so, the volunteers, who may not apprehend an invasion, must turn out. That is what will happen under the clause.",55

387,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Yes , but on this subject. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to a debate which occurred in the English House of Commons on the 9th March last, when Colonel Long moved a resolutionDeclaring that thealbered conditions of modern warfare rendered necessary radical changes in the professional braining of the officers and men of the army and auxiliary forces, and that the be existing sysbem proved inadequate during the late war. Mr Brodrick, the Minister for War, in speaking to the resolution, is reported as follows:Dealing with the question of the training of officers after they had entered the Army, he out that at present a Laodicean officer who had been in the Army for two years had as much right to promotion as an officer who showed conspicuous zeal. Then officers with social inhad been more fortunate in the past in pleasant ""billebs"" than officers who were merely competent ancl able. The time had come to put an end to this state of things. Under the remedial scheme which it had been determined to introduce, an aDmial course of training been prescribed for each unit, and the three senior officers of a battalion were to classify, when the period of training was over, the other officers according to their general efficiency and their power of training and leading men. Ifc would be in the power of any commanding officer to bring before a brigadier the name of any officer deserviug accelerated promotion. Officers of indifferent attainments would not get the same promotion or the same leave as others. He addedAfter two years of inefficiency an officer be required to send in his papers. Sir Jons' FORREST - This clause deals only with first appointments.",56
388,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Quite so. The honourable member for Maranoa spoke of inefficient point. officers already in the service. It is not proposed to interfere with them so far the past is concerned,, but should not vision be made to secure the future effiregulation. ciency of officers? Although Part XI . gives power to make regulations, I think that this is a matter which should be dealt with in the Bill.",57
389,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It is only by regulation that the standard of examination can be fixed.,57
390,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I am not referring to the standard of examination; I am referring to the need for a provision enabling Minister to get rid of an officer whohas passed an examination and then proved inefficient. There is nothing in the Bill meet a case of that kind.,57
391,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Yes , there is. Clause 112 provides that the Governor General may make regulations ""for securing the discipline years. and good government"" of the forces.",57
392,Mr SKENE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I should like to have assurance of the Minister that provision will efficiency examination. be made for cases of this kind.,57

It then proceedsBut persons who have not passed that examination for any particular rank may be appointed provisionally.

After a certain timethey are required to pass the full efficiency and if they fail, they are seton one side.

398,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," If it is desired to fix a time limit, that could best bei n clause 14. I suggest that theaptime limit should apply only in peace, because it would be impossible to subject, officers to an examination in time of war.",57
399,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Ful l power is given to make promotions in time of war.,58
400,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," The clause provides that an officer may be appointed provisionally before he has passed the prescribed examination, but the following clause stipulates that in order to retain his position he must pass an examination within a certain time to be prescribed by regulations. If it is desirable to fix a time limit, the amendment should be made in clause 14.",58
401,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,We propose to that. .,58
402,Mr KENNEDY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I think it would be preferable to leave the matter to be dealt with by regulation, because it may not be an easy matter to fix a hard and fast time limit which would not apply with harshness in certain cases.",58
403,Mr MCC AY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," It has been the practice in Victoria te attach men to the forces as candidates for commissions, and afterwards to call upon them to pass a preliminaryexamination. Sometimes this has taken place some months after the candidates have been attached, because it has not been convenient, or practicable, to hold the examinations earlier. After candidates had passed the preliminary examination, they were appointed as lieutenants on probation, and our regulations provided that after occupying that position for six months officers must undergo an examination prior to the confirmation of their commissions. Having passed this examination, they were appointed lieutenants. It was always considered fair that officers on probation should have a second chance of - qualifying if they failed at the first examination, the consequence being that in some cases a period of two years elapsed before the final examination was passed. . Mr SKENE - That is not the English practice.",58
404,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"It must be remembered that in England there are possibly a score of candidates for every commission, whereas in Australia, and particularly in the country districts, it is sometimes difficult to find men who have the time and money necessary to enable them to act as officers in the Defence Forces. I think that a fairly long time limit should be provided for. It would be preferable, to my mind, to have the term fixed by regulation, but if honourable members think it necessary to specify it - in the Bill, I would suggest a period of eighteen months. We shall have to depend upon the regulations to some extent, because the military authorities will have to fix a time for the examinations. So far as promotions to positions beyond the rank of lieutenant are concerned, there are generally more candidates than vacancies. Occasionally it happens that an officer is called upon to take a command beyond his rank, and provisional rank is conferred upon him ; but the regulation will apply more particularly to officers who are first appointed to the do forces.",58
405,Mr WINTER COOKE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I think the Minister has missed the point of the honourable member for Grampians. The honourable member did not refer to first appointments, but to officers, who, after having served for some time, had proved that they were inefficient. He pointed out that the Home authorities were moving in the direction of insisting upon efficiency. <I think that some means ought to be devised by which an officer who has proved himself efficient should be able to pass an examination having reference to the particular duties which he is to be called upon to discharge, so that the inefficient men might be weeded out of the service. How that object is to be accomplished I cannot say. It is possible that something in that direction may be achieved by regulation, but I fear that in the end the military authorities will have to decide whether a man is efficient or otherwise.",58
406,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It is a matter of administration.,58
407,Mr WINTER COOKE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Exactly . We shall have failures in the future as we have had them in the past. At the same time, it is evident that the Home authorities are moving in this direction. I trust that the Minister will take a note of the remarks of the honourable member for Grampians, with a view to drawing the Military Commandant's attention to this matter. Clause agreed to. Clause 14Officers provisionally appointed shall cease to hold office if they fail within the prescribed time to pass the examination for the rank to which they have been so appointed. Amendment (by Mr Bruce SMITH) proposed - That, after the word "" time,"" line 2, the words ""not exceeding eighteen months"" be inserted.",58
408,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," The remarks of the honourable and learned member for Corinella prove that eighteen months would constitute altogether too short a period, and as a result, cases of injustice would probably occur.",59
409,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I think - that eighteen months ought to be sufficient to cover all cases, provided that there is proper administration.",59
410,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"But a deserving officer may find himself in such a position that his superior officers who value his services may not be able to assist him. The law should therefore be made as elastic as possible. I quite recognise that our aim should be to secure the ablest officers available to exercise control over men's lives. Not only does a military officer require to be an able manhe needs to be an individual of special fibre. Upon one occasion Napoleon said that no man could stand ten years of campaigning, and any person who has awaited a verdict - eve n a political verdict in which he was personally interested-know s what a severe strain is imposed upon him by apprehension and uneasiness. The strain imposed upon an able man who is watching to ascertain whether an attack will succeed, and who knows that every moment he is sacrificing large numbers of his own.countrymen, is probably the greatest that a civilized human being can be called upon to endure.",59
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Does the member speak from experience 1,59
412,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,If some persons spoke only from experience they would never speak. I take it that the object of honourable members is to weed out the duffers from the provisional officers appointed. They hold that if an officer cannot pass an examination within eighteen months he should forfeit his commission.  ber keep a station manager for eighteen months in order to determine whether he was efficient 1,59
413,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If I made up my mind that he was not worth keeping, I should not retain him for eighteen minutes. I am merely asking that the law should be made as elastic as possible, and that we should depend upon our military administration. We have an able English officer in control of these matters. He virtually selects every one of his officers. If Major-General Hutton fails in his duty, everything fails.  not run away with that idea.",59
414,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I am thoroughly convinced that in military matters, those in authority have very much to do with the appointment and advancement of their officers. Lord Roberts, Lord Kitchener, and in a smaller way, Major-General Hutton', form certain ideas of men's fitness and ability. We presume that they know the good men, and that they will take care that the control of battalions is placed in competent hands. I am convinced that we shall not achieve an}' good by fixing the period within which provisional officers shall cease to hold office, if they fail to pass the examination for the rank to which they have been appointed at eighteen months. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 15 and 16 agreed to. Clause 17The seniority of officers in the active forces, in their respective ranks, shall be regulated by the date of their commissions, and, v> hen commissions are of the same date by their previous commissions, or in the case of first commissions, by the order in which their names appear in the Gazette, or in the Government Gazette of a State or of a colony which has become a State, in which their appointments have been notified.",59
415,Mr MCC AY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," As I understand it , this clause is intended to provide honourable that the seniority of officers shall'be regulated by their seniority at the time this measure comes into operation. I think that provision constitutes the best possible solution of an undoubted difficulty. An y other method would cause endless trouble. There is one point, however, to which I wish todirect attention. I do not know upon what days the Governmen,i Gazettes of the different States are published. In Victoria, the Gazette used to be published upon Fridays, but it is - now published upon Wednesdays. It is just possible, however, that the Gazettes of different States may be issued upon the same daj that the first commissions of the r officers appointed in their respective States appear in those publications, and under such circumstances it is difficult to understand how their respective seniority will rank. Some meansmust be devised for deciding this matter. An officer is generally very keen about his seniority, because in time of war it may mean' the difference between his getting a command and not getting it .",59
416,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Would not the of the appointment be mentioned in the Gazettes ?,60
417,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Sometimes the date is mentioned, but occasionally it is not. For instance, in a Gazette notice the promotion of Lieutenant Brown to Captain might date from a specified day, or from the publication of the Gazette in which it appears.",60

That, I think, is a farce. In my opinion we should insist upon examinations being passed.

I have objection to raise to that proposition, b ut I think that appointment should depend on - Sir JOHN FORREST - We might provide that it should be subject to the prescribed examination.",60

430,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I think that is the better proposal, otherwise, in relation to this clause, a special examination might be laid down which was of a farcical character.",61

Clause 17 determines the seniority of officers in the active forces according to the date of their commissions. Of course, junior officers might be placed in command over senior officers when necessity required that course to be adopted; but we have here a provision to give officers on the unattached list special facilities for being placed in command over their seniors. Why, for example, should a major on the unattached list be given seniority over all the majors who might be on the active list, on any particular occasion that he was attached for duty.",61

I wish to test the feeling of the Committee as to whether there ought to be a permanent branch, of the forces. I do not deny that we must have instructors, artillerymen, and engineers permanently employed, but the spirit of the clause is that we should have not only specially trained men, such as artillerymen, engineers, and instructors, but some special corps of men in the nature of cavalry employed as permanent.forces. The expression used is that-^ The Defence Force shall consist of the Military and Naval forces of the Commonwealth, and shall all be divided into two branches called the permanent forces and the citizen forces.",61
442,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Should we not have full command of that matter in dealing with the Estimates 1,61

I do not deny that we must have some permanent men for special services like the naval service, the instructional, artillery, aud engineering services. But that to which I , in common with a number of people, object is that we should have a permanent army- a system of permanent corps of men. If honourable members look at other clauses in the Bill, they will find that the Governor General has full power to appoint as many permanent men as he thinks fit.",62

451,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"In one sense it is a matter of terminology, but it is the most convenient point which I could find to test the principle involved. I think it would be well to have a division on this clause to determine whether we should have permanent corps as well as national militia corps.

But still, inframingtheEstimates are some - whic h are often put before us after the expenditure has been incurred and the men have earned their money-the Minister will probably take his instructions from the Act, and the Act, if passed in this form, will say that there are to be two branches. The Bill says, first of all, that there are to be citizen forces. That is all right. But it says also that there are to be permanent forces.

The true ideal is to have a Defence Force of a voluntary character- I do not say volunteers and militia necessarily, but forces that act as volunteers or militia ; and the only permanent men should be special men employed for the purposes of artillery, engineering, instruction in the navy, gum nery in the navy, and so forth.",62

So that it is absolutely a matter of discreforces tion for the Governor General-that is, for the Minister-to say how many men shall be employed in the permanent forces. may employ one thousand or ten thousand.",63
476,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,If he gets the money,63
477,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"We are arguing again and again in a circle. The same interjecnent tion has been made three tildes in the ' course of my speech, and the answer is obvious. We all know that the discussion of the Estimates has become in the hands of Parliament an ineffective method of controlling expenditure.",63
478,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"It was very effective in cutting down the Defence expenditure by £160,000 on one occasion.",63
479,Mr HIGGTNS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,And it was a most inexpedient way of doing what Parliament,63
480,Mr MCCAV,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It made some of the forces,63
481,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The result of that mode of doing what we wanted was that the parts of the service which could least would bear retrenchment have borne it .,63
482,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,What other method could be more conhave been adopted ?,63
483,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I am not blaming any one for the method adopted. All I say is that those honourable members who have any in Parliament will agree with me that the passing of the Estimates has headceased to be an effective weapon with Parliament for the purpose of controlling expenditure. It was the only means we had, but the result was that we cut down without sufficient details being given as to what the would bear cutting down. We cut down by a large sum, and left it to the Minister decide how the cutting down should take place, and the cutting down was in the wrong direction. The next provision with regard to permanent forces, is clause 41, which The permanent forces and all persons continuously employed in the active forces on regular pay and dutyforces That is, I understand, the instructors principallyat all times be liable to be employed on active service, and in the defence and protection of the Commonwealth and of the several States. as Then comes clause 42, which provides The services of the permanent forces and of all persons continuously employed in the active on regular pay and duty - may at all times be utilized wherever required, either within or beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. He I have given notice that I intend to move the omission of clause 42. I think that no man ought to be forced against his will to go from Australia, whether he be a permaman or not. But, of course, I have to take the clauses as they stand in the Bill. very I do not see why we should have as a regular branch of the service corps of perof manent men. Then clause 51 says thatThe permanent military forces and all persons permanently employed in the active military forces shall at all times, and all member's citizen military forces shall while on active vice ancl at all times when ou duty or wearing their uniforms be subject to the Army Act. Then clause 52 deals with the members of the naval forces in the same way. It will be seen that the expression "" the permanent forces "" is used frequently throughout the Bill, and therefore I think that it is just well when we first deal with the expression to say whether we want it or not. I think the correct form would be, after stating that the forces shall consist of naval forces, to say- "" the following classes of men may be enrolled for permanent forces and for several years,"" and then give a tion that the term includes, artillery, for engineering, and so on.",63
484,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Would the honourable and learned member have that limit in the Bill 1,64
485,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I think that we must have a limit of some sort in the Bill as to character or as to number-on e thing or the other.,64
486,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,We may require various numbers for different purposes.,64
487,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,The numbers can be varied. If a larger number is required the Government can come to Parliament for its consent.,64
488,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It might be necessary to amend this Bill to do that.,64
489,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"That may be so, but Parliament could be intrusted to amend the Act to increase the number of men if there were occasion to do so.",64
490,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,On the honourable and learned member's own showing would there be two branches then.,64
491,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Not two branches of the Defence Force.,64
492,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It comes to the same thing.,64
493,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"We cannot call it two branches where they are not growing from the same stock. The idea I have in my mind, right or wrong, is to have only one stock-on e growth from that stock; but at the same time to have as it were a certain f r u it which grows upon that stock, culminating the stock. I think we could have the permanent, exceptional men without their forming a distinctive branch of the Defence Force. Of course, the way doing that would be open to some difference of opinion. I only want at the earliest stage-and I shall try to suit the convenience of the Minister at the table-to ask of the the Committee whether it wants to have as sera part of our Defence Force, special corps of infantry and cavalry which the Governor General may choose to appoint as permanent forces. . Mr MCCAY (Corinella) - If the honourable and learned member for Northern Melas bourne would submit a clause defining what class of men may be employed permanently - I do not care under what name-in the Defence Force of Australia, I should be premilitary and pared to support him.",64
494,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I should be very glad; but I think that the Minister, with the definidraftsman as his adviser, ought to be men for the able to do it better.",64
495,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I do not mean that the honourable and learned member should draft the clause, except as a means of expressing his view. I think it is all a matter of the difference between tweed! e-dum and tweedledee, to draw distinctions between permanent forces and men permanently employed. It is the same thing. But the honourable and learned member proposes to limit the permanent forces to soldiers of certain classes.",64
496,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,He objects to permanent forces.,64
497,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"He does nothing of the kind ; he objects to permanent infantry, permanent cavalry, permanent field artillery.",64
498,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I did not say that I objected to permanent field artillery ; I say - that we must have some permanent artillery.,64
499,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Permanen t field artillery, or garrison artillery ?",64
500,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,We must have both.,64
501,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If the honourable and learned member will limit his objection to admit of certain classes of men belonging to the permanent forces, I shall be prepared to support him. I do not think it is advisable to have permanent forces of certain classes, in view of the fact that it is quite clear that Parliament, and the Commonwealth as a whole, are going to strictly limit the expenditure on defences of all kinds. We must get the most we can for our money, and that can only be done by developing to the utmost the citizen forces, and reducing to a minimum the permanent forces. There is no doubt that we can get a considerablenumber of citizen soldiers for the same cost as is necessary for one permanent soldier. It seems to me absolutely essential that should be a certain proportion of permanent men for the naval garrison and harbour forces - garrison artillery to man the various forts, submarine engineers and men of that class-and an instructional staff for the purely land forces. But I do not think that the land forces require any more permanent soldiers than an instructional, and, to a certain extent, an administrative staff. That is a view I have always held, for the reason that in that way we can, on the whole, get the best value for our money.",64
502,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,What about permanent artillery ?,65
503,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"In view of the small amount of money available, we could do much better with a militia field artillery. It must be remembered that there is the greatest difference between garrison artillery and field artillery, and I have always insisted on the necessity of having carefully trained men whose whole time shall be devoted to their duties in the former branch.",65
504,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,There is a permanent field artillery.,65
505,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"There is a permanent field artillery in New South Wales, but in no other State is there such a land force. I know that the scheme which was propounded in the famous minute of March of last year refers to a permanent field artillery, and certainly foreshadows permanent corps of other land forces to serve as a model and exemplar to the militia forces.",65
506,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Is that proposed ?,65
507,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"T t is not exactly proposed, but one may read it between the lines in the minute. I shall not discuss the question whether, if we had plenty of money, it would be advisable to have such a force.",65
508,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It is a bad thing to have - too many permanent men.,65
509,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"That also is my opinion, but for the present I shall leave that matter out of account. Under the circumstances of the case, we are forced, in justice to the citizen soldiery, to one conclusion, namely, that it is only what may be called specially skilled labourers for the defence of positions in our harbors",65
510,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The honourable and learned member is discussing the composition of the forces, which does not arise under this clause. Mr M e CAY - I am sorry that the there honourable and learned member for Parkes should, on one of his flying visits to this House . Mr Bruce SMITH - The honourable and learned member always becomes personal when crossed.",65
511,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I do not think I am specially personal. I am discussing the very matter which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne discussed for a considerable time. I think that the discussion of the question of what the permanent forces are to be is in order when considering whether or not we are to have a permanent force ; and the latter point is, I think, raised by the clause. If I have said anything which is considered to be offensive to the honourable and learned member for Parkes, I can only express my regret.",65
512,Mr BRUCESMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," The honourable and learned member for Corinella has not hurt my feelings, and-1 tell him candidly that I care so little for remarks of the kind that if he will write me a note, expressing his indignation or surprise that I do not oftener attend the House, I shall publish ib in my constituency. It is all very well for honourable members who can follow their business in Melbourne day after day and attend Parliament' in the evening, to speak of the occasional absence of those who have to travel 600 or 1,000 miles.",65
513,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If that is meant for me, I have to leave my business four days in the week. Mr BRU CE SMITH - It is not meant for the honourable and learned member ; but he ought not, simply because I do not agree with him, to turn round and draw attention to my attendance in this House. I have listened to the honourable and learned member very carefully because I know he has some military knowledge, which I do not profess to possess. I know nothing about soldiering, and I have no soldiering enthusiasm; but I do know something of Acts of Parliament, and the clause before us simply provides that the Defence Force, whether military or naval, shall practically be divided into two parts, one called the permanent force and the other called the citizen force. The clause does not say of what either force shall consist; that is dealt with in subsequent clauses. We always listen to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne with great care, because' he does not' rise unless to say something worth hearing. The honourable and learned member seems to object to our having any permanent force - h e objects to the word ""permanent,"" and also to the word ""force."" I confess that I cannot understand what the honourable and learned member wants-whethe r or not he wants to do away altogether with permanent soldiers. According to the honourable and learned member we are to have nothing permanent except the teachers; and I confess I do not understand that position. Surely, apart from the teachers, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne does not object to the permanent employment of men who have made soldiering their profession.",65
514,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I have said the opposite about live times. Mr Bruce SMITH . ^ - B ut the honourable and learned member objects to the word "".permanent."" - Mr HIGGINS - No .",66
515,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"If the honourable and learned member is willing to have artillery composed of men who make a profession of soldiery, and who shall be always at hand, why should he object to the word "" permanent "" '(There cannot be any temporary naval defence-w e cannot have men who are in mercantile employment one week and in a naval defence force the other.",66
516,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Most of the naval are not permanent.,66
517,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,No doubt; but does the honourable and learned member mean that we are to have no naval or military force that is permanent ?,66
518,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,Certainl y not. If I have not been able to explain myself I . am very sorry ; I cannot explain mvself further.,66
519,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I may tell the honourable and learned member that there are a number of other honourable members who share my stupidity in the matter.,66
520,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,It is not stupidity.,66
521,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I am afraid it is stupidity, because I cannot see why the honourable and learned member objects to the two terms. I could quite understand his objecting to what is comprehended under subsequent clauses; but why he should wish to take out the two terms ""permanent force"" and ""citizen force,"" unless he is going to substitute other terms, I cannot understand. I do not know what the honourable and learned member proposes to do, and in the absence of definite information I shall vote for the clause.",66
522,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," Unlike the honourable and learned member who has just spoken, I ama member of the permanent forces of Parliament, and I want my constituents to know that I am attending to my duty. The , honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne seems most concerned about the word "" permanent,"" and I think that his great objection is to a standing army.",66
523,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,What has the honourable member's experience been t,66
524,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"My experience in New South Wales is that we must have garrison artillery and engineers. We find that throughout Australia the riu ruber of the permanent forces has been reduced, and we shall always, by means of the Estimates, have full control, although the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne thinks that that is not so. In the Estimates it is clearly set out that the permanent force, the volunteer force, and the militia each costs so much ; and if the House in the past has been careless in regard to retrenchment, honourable members must not blame Ministers, but themselves. If the Defence expenditure has been reduced by £160,000 a year we can easily see in what branches of the service the reductions have men been made; and, as I have said, we always have full control. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has expressed the opinion that there must be permanent garrison artillery, engineers, and instructional officers; and these, all told, number 1,300 in Australia. That may not be a large number, but they are men who must be constantly employed by the Commonwealth. The members of the garrison artillery, although tliey are called soldiers, are mainly mechanics, and are paid mechanics' wages ; but it has been discovered that the work of the field artillery may be very well done by volunteers or militia. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is afraid that the permanent force is growing, and that we may have a standing army over which we shall have no control; but I have already pointed out the control which the Estimates give us. Under the circumstances, I think that "" permanent force "" is the best term that can be employed.",66
525,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I sympathize with the position taken up by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, so far as I understand it . I understand that the honourable and learned member desires to reduce as far as practicable the number of permanent men to be employed in connection with our Defence Eorce. It has always seemed to me to be highly undesirable in a community such as this, or indeed in any community, to withdraw from productive enterprises any greater number of men' than is absolutely essential. We require their services primarily in developing the resources of the country. I can.therefore quite sympathize with a desire to keep the number of permanent men as low as possible. But I do not quite see how we can lay down in the Defence Bill a maximum number of permanent men to be employed. The number can only be decided from year to year according to circumstances. It is true that we'who in this House voted for a reduction in the Defence Estimates for last year and the previous year were not as successful as we could have wished in the manner in which the reduction was applied, but there was no other course open to us. We could not pretend to that intimate acquaintance with the peculiarities and conditions generally of the service, which would enable us to say exactly in what manner the reduction should be effected. We were compelled, therefore, to rely upon the Minister and his advisers, to adopt the course in making the required reduction which would least effect the efficiency of the forces. Admitting all that, I do not see how we can decide beforehand what would be an adequate number of permanent men to employ.",67
526,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,That question does not arise now.,67
527,Mr WATSON,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"The number of men required will depend to some extent upon the nature of the defence we decide to adopt. If we go in for a large number of fixed defences, forts, floating batteries, submarine boats, and torpedoes, involving complicated machinery, and a great deal of mechanical knowledge on the part of the men employed, as well as familiarity with the weapons to be used, we shall require a much larger number of permanent men than we should require if we set aside those means of defence, and depended almost entirely upon our field artillery and rifle corps. It seems to me that the number of permanent men required will always be varying ; though I admit that there should be a desire on the part of Parliament to keep the number employed down to the absolute minimum. I understood the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne' to say just - now that the question of the number would not arise under the present clause, and I am not quite clear as to what the honourable and learned member desires to effect. I should like to have demonstrated any differencewhich can be shown between the phraseology used in the Bill and that suggested by the honourable and learned member. A difference may be patent to a mind accustomed totechnical expressions, but I do not see that any great object is to be gained by alteringthe phraseology in the way proposed.",67
528,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Northern Melbourne) To bring matters to a test, what I proposewould be that the clause should stand in this wayThe Defence Force shall consist of the military and naval forces of the Commonwealthand thenT would alter the succeeding words, and in their stead use the words and, except as hereinafter provided, shall be a citizen force. The effect of that would be to make thecitizen force the rule and the permanent force the exception. As the clause at present stands, we have the permanent force as. one branch, and the citizen force as another; standing upon a level, and the Governor General in Council may appoint any permanent force he thinks fit. If what I propose is adopted, when the Minister has had the advice of the permanent head of the Department, he can speak as to the per-manent force required, and we can strictly limit its character. I hope it will beunderstood that I do not think it essential to limit the number of men unnecessarily. I desire to fix the character of the permanent force, to suggest that the only permanent' men employed shall be men of a certain class, as, for instance, garrison artillery, naval men, and perhaps, field artillery. After consultation with the General Officer Commanding, the Minister will be able to tell us what classes of permanent men he will require to create. I move That the words ""shall be divided into two. branches, called the Permanent Forces and the Citizen Forces,"" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""except as hereinafterprovided shall be a Citizen Force."" - Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) - It - seems to me that the honourable and learned - member for Northern Melbourne' is splitting straws. I am unable to see the broad distinction which lie seeks to make manifest to the Committee. He admits that it is on .absolute necessity of the military situation - that there must be a permanent force, that we must have permanent artillery, and a .permanent instructional force, constantly employed and paid. Hew can we have these unless we provide for a permanent - force? The honourable and learned member seeks if possible to minimize almost to the vanishing point the idea of a permanent force, and to bring into greater prominence the idea of a citizen force. I do not see that the terminology of the Bill as it stands prevents that being done. The .actual and effective control of these forces will be ours at the time of passing the Estimates. The honourable and learned member - for Northern Melbourne must know that every time differing military dispositions are made in the old country a new Bil l is not introduced. For instance, the last military estimates provided for a new force entirely. The Imperial authorities proposed to establish a garrison of 25,000 men in South Africa.' They are re-arranging the whole disposition of their defences .at home and abroad, and I have not heard that they have introduced a new Bill to take power to do that. The more - elastic we make the terms of the Bill the more effective will be our control of the forces in the parliamentary arena. - It is when the Estimates are being dealt with that we shall really control the force. A f t e r all, we cannot do very much in the .actual working out of our military schemes in dealing with a Bill of this description. In this Bill, wo take power to do certain things, but it is in the actual disposition of the forces that our active control over them will be - found to exist. Therefore, with the greatest possible deference to the honourable and learned member, whose great gif t of exposition I always admire, I am bound to say that I do not think his g if t has been displayed this evening as lucidly as it ordinarily is. I submit that the. honourable and learned member is chasing adifficulty which has no substantial existence. We do not surrender our control of the forces ; we may manipulate them as we like in dealing with the Estimates ; we may make the permanent - force as small as we desire, . and may reduce it to one man by the simple exercise of our power when the Estimates are before us. We can in the same way multiply the citizen forces to any extent we wish. I cannot bring myself to see that the matter is of the extreme and pressing importance which the earnestness of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne would seem to indicate.",67
529,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," The Committee is unanimous in agreeing with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, that a community depends upon the martial spirit of its people, and not upon military caste; but it is not possible to eliminate the word "" permanent"" from this Bill.",68
530,Mr HIGGINS,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,I have not proposed to do that.,68
531,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"I think we might meet the honourable and learned member by providing that the Defence Force shall be divided "" into a citizen force and into a a permanent force."" By adopting this form we shall put first the mainstay of the force, and allow the permanent force to be referred to subsequently. I do not think it is possible for us to do more than that. If the honourable and learned member is prepared to accept an amendment in that form, I shall vote for it .",68
532,Mr SPENCE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," It seems to me that this .is a flank movement on the part of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and we must consider it in connection with some proposals which he makes' with reference to laterclauses. I ask the honourable and learned member whether what he now proposes might not be met by the limitation of numbers which he proposes in clause 30 ? I am with the suggestion to limit the number of the permanent force. Having officers and experts to train men, we do not require any very large permanent force ; but if there should be only 1,000 men in the permanent force, as the honourable and learned member proposes, we should still require some term by which to refer to them.",68
533,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"There are 1,400 now.",68
534,Mr SPENCE,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"It seems to me that the term, as it is defined in the clause, is a necessary one. It is proposed to strike out clause 28 altogether, and later on to limit the number to 1,000 ; but I think it will be better to leave this clause as it stands, whatever limitation we make later on. There is also another proposal of great importance to be considered in connection with the clause, so that, perhaps, it .might be better for us to postpone it .",68
535,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H,"Macquarie) There has been so much discussion upon the provisions of the clause, that it is difficult for honourable members to grasp the situation. Although I have listened very attentively to the debate, I have had some trouble in arriving at an opinion as to the real meaning"" of the amendment. The honourable member for Dalley has raised another point. He says that he belongs to .a force for which no provision at all is. made in the Bill. I intend to support the clause as it stands. When the proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney is brought before us, it will enable us to deal with military matters in a much more satisfactory way than has been possible in the past. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 28 (Permanent Forces).",69
536,Mr MCCAY,EASTERN EXTENSIONTELEGRAP H," I propose to add to this clause a provision to the effect that the permanent forces shall consist only of certain classes of soldiers-garrison , artillery, engineers, and the instructional staff. W it h our limited means we cannot afford permanent field artillery, cavalry or infantry. .Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.30 p.m.",69
