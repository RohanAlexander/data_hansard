2,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address a question to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. I remind the Minister that the Prime Minister claimed at the National Press Club last week that there would be very few people on award wages earning below $20,000. I ask: is it a fact that there are as many as one million working women who earn less than $20,700 a year? Are those one million working women, like the million unemployed, Labor's forgotten people?",10
3,Ms FATIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know how the Deputy Leader of the Opposition could even ask this question, because when one looks at the Fightback package one sees how the Opposition's proposals will affect women in this country. It is absolutely a disgrace. The working women of this country know that there is one party and one party only that is concerned about their welfare, their pay, their opportunities for study, their opportunities to work in the work force and their opportunities to have child-care to assist them so that they can be in the work force. This Labor Party is that party. This Government has done more for women in Australia than any previous government. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 145 an answer shall be relevant to the question.",10

13,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Will he inform the House of the medium term implications for the economy of the One Nation plan he announced to the Parliament last Wednesday? Does the Government intend to provide extensive analysis so that the public can judge the consequences of its major statements?,10
14,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Government has always provided most forthright documentation in its Budget statements. In fact, I have often remarked that the quality of the Australian budgetary documentation is without peer around the world for the information which it contains. This is also true in this statement, wherein the medium tenn consequences of the package are set out with detailed projections to 1995-96, showing GDP growth averaging 4 1/4 per cent over the four years-solid growth numbers but not excessive numbers, and numbers which have been cavilled at by the Opposition in tenns of being an inordinately high rate of growth, which, of course, it is not. In that particular presentation we have 800,000 jobs being created over the period, inflation staying at around 3 11z per cent, debt to GDP stabilising and possibly slowly declining. What does the Opposition provide to support the credibility of its package? series of scenarios, a bold claim that it will create two million jobs. What are these scenarios? The Opposition cannot make up its mind. Page 30 of the Executive Summary of the Fightback! document-these are very important words-says: The third scenario (High Road) shows the effects of a program of reform such as that outlined document. That is, the GST and all the other bits and pieces that come with it. Page 333 says: (While a number of elements of the policy change underlying the ""High Road"" Scenario are similar those embodied in the Coalition's the analysis does not purport to portray the outcomes which would be achieved by implementation of that package. . On page 30, scenario C shows the the reform as outlined in the document; on page 333, the analysis does not purport portray the elements of the outcome to be achieved. Worse is to come. After a little probing in the Parliament, the honourable member for Wentworth put out an amazing press release last Thursday. He said: Fightback was not modelled. In other words, it was right. This great document, which is supposed to be the way Nation package. forward, is so great a document he would not even model it. He claims two million jobs then says: Fightback was not modelled. He brings down a document of four-odd pages which he says will transform but the Australian people are supposed to take it on as a matter of faith. to model the changes of Fightback into the scenarios; we simply take it on as a matter of faith. So the two million jobs are simply an of the 1990's. act of faith. What is scenario C which the honourable member for Wentworth now disowns? It was meant to illustrate the brave new world. not include the GST-just the good things: the big productivity boost to reforms outlined in the document. It did not include the and He was not game to model it with the GST in it. What did it show? Unfortunately, the wheels fell off. To get his two million jobs, A the Murphy model, which underlines scenario C, shows that inflation rises to 4.2 per cent in 1992-93, to 6.5 per cent, to 7.7 per cent and then it goes to 5.9 per cent in 1995-96. Debt rises to $246 billion in 1995-96-even higher than the wild figure of $225 billion which he attributed to our policies last week. I have the pages from the Fightback modelling. It shows inflation at 4.2 per cent, 6.5 per in this cent, 7.7 per cent and 5.9 per cent; an unemployment rate of 8 1/4 per cent in 199596; and debt at $245.9 billion. In other words, he is up there with his Thursday night replyMr Conno]]y- Mr Speaker, I raise a point to of order. I draw your attention to standing policy package, order 145, which states: An answer shall be relevant to the question.

26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The honourable member for Mitchell will resume his seat.,12
27,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I suppose now everyone in the Parliament can see the sensitivity of the Liberal Party in this piece of duplicity where you write a letter to the Australian people saying that the reforms set out in the document were designed to provide two million jobs and that the scenario which provides the two million jobs has not been modelled in Fightback. You then say two weeks later that Fightback was not, repeat not, modelled! No wonder you thought you had an easy go of all this. No wonder you thought you had an easy go from the presentation of the Fightback/ document, that you could pluck $2m out of the air without any reference to it being part of the GST or the changes, that you could duplicitously go to the Australian people with a letter signed by you and say that this package provides two million jobs, and that you could then deny it and say that Fightback was not, repeat not, modelled. In other words, you have put your name to a letter, urging people to believe that you could create two million jobs from a set of economic policy changes which you 'say have no reference to the policy changes because they were not modelled. Then we find that Dr Murphy concluded-there is no denying this,",12
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that of itself a switch between a goods and services tax and income tax lowers GDP from what it otherwise would have been, and unemployment is still higher after five years. If the GST gets into wages and there is a decline in GDP, the lift in unemployment is substantial. In other words, the person who modelled scenario C, and the person whom the Leader of the Opposition relied upon last Thursday night, has said that, if you actually switched income tax to goods and services taxation, GDP would be lower than it otherwise would be and unemployment would be still higher. What is the point of a consumption tax if we are going to have lower GDP and higher unemployment and inflation? If the consumption tax is so bad that you could not model it, but you were still duplicitous enough to claim that it will give us two million jobs and then sneak in here on a Thursday night-not even in here, but in the press box-and say it is not modelled, no wonder you thought you were going to get away easily with the Fightback package. Mr Connolly- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister has now spoken for 10 minutes. He has not once addressed the question.",12
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! What is the honourable member's point of order? Mr Connolly-I seriously ask you, Mr Speaker: how are you going to protect the interests of this Parliament in terms of the",12
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,13
31,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will be continuing on these points: the Government has produced a document which models 800,000 jobs based on the changes which it has made, as it always has, with all the measures explained and all the reconciliation tables there. What we have in this duplicitous shambles is a duplicitous claim of two million jobs which bears no relationship whatsoever to the GST or Fightback, which the Opposition says was not modelled. So at the back of the Fightback! document scenario C, which has higher inflation and employment going up to 1995-96 and which has a debt of $245 billion, is simply there for window dressing, to make the duplicitous claim that you can create two million jobs when you would not even model your Fightback package. It is no wonder the Leader of the Opposition thought he would get away with the Fightback presentation with some of the soft analysis that there was, but he let the cat out of the bag by making it clear, almost like a badge of honour, that the great package was so great that he was afraid to model it-and, in fact, did not model it-and that the whole claim of two million jobs is totally fraudulent.

33,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I remind the Treasurer of the Prime Minister's statement that there are very few Australians earning less than $20,000 a year. Is the Treasurer aware that there are just over one million Australians under the age of 25 who earn less than $20,000? Will you confirm that these young Australians will not get any tax cut whatsoever under the Keating package? Why have you abandoned Australia's youth?",13

35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,13
36,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have heard for almost a week now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition trying to portray himself as the person who has some great concern for low income earners in this country, particularly unemployed Australians. We have now seen this extended to a new concern for young people. Of course, none of us on this side believes that at all. None of us on this side believes that members of the Liberal Party or the Liberal-National coalition have the slightest regard for the people who are worse off in this community, particularly those who are unemployed. I do not think that anyone else in Australia believes that those opposite have a concern for these people either. The point is that what this Government is doing now-and has done in the past-for low income members of the Australian community has to be seen not just in the context of what the Prime Minister announced last week but in the context of what we have been doing consistently over the years and most recently in the Budget of last year. From April of this year, 86,000 families who are currently receiving part rate FAS, that is, the family assistance supplement, will gain an average of $16 a week in additional assistance. That is $16 additional assistance from April as a result of decisions taken in the last Budget. An additional 47,000 families will become eligible for FAS, receiving on average $30 a week. Only last week the Prime Minister announced that all FAS recipients would have the amount of their FAS increased by $3 a child per week. As well as that, the Government has been responsible for increasing the basic pension rate-an increase in real terms of 12 per cent-and rent assistance has been increased by between 78 and 137 per cent. Mr Reith-What about the millions who get nothing?",13
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order I The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,14
38,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These measures that we have taken have been carefully targeted on the outlays side of the Budget to ensure that the assistance goes to those people who are most in need-low income earners and particularly those low income earners who have families. On the other hand, what does the Opposition want to do for these same families? In the first instance, it would increase the waiting time for those people who are going onto Job Search allowance. It is a particular joke for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to get up here and talk about young people, because he is saying that as young people become eligible for the Job Search allowance, he would make them wait longer. They would be denied income for longer before they received any benefit from his government whilst they continued to be unemployed and continued to look for a job. As well as that, he then says that if they happened to commit the heinous crime of remaining unemployed for nine months or longer, those opposite would attempt to take them off benefits altogether-deny them the Job Search allowance altogether if they remained unemployed for nine months or longer. Of course, this isMr Filing interject!ng",14
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Moore!,14
40,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the context in which this man should be judged, because he says that in his own package the Opposition, through the tax system, is going to help all taxpayers and, of course, particularly people at the bottom. Let us examine that claim on its own. The Opposition intends to force everyone in Australia-every household, every family, every individual-to contribute to $20 billion in the form of a new tax. That is an average of $23 per week for every man, woman and child in Australia. The sum of $23 per week will have to be paid by them by way of this new tax. What is he offering to the lowest income taxpayer who gets a tax break from him? Six dollars a weekI That is the tax cut that he offers to the lowest income taxpayer in Australia-$6 a week when taxpayers, on average, will have to pay something like $23 per week in order to pay for this new unfair tax on their food and clothing. As the Deputy Leader will discover tomorrow when we will take great pleasure in presenting to him and to the Australian people a distributional analysis of the real effects of his package on households in Australia, four out of five taxpayers in Australia will be worse off. In other words, four out of five taxpayers will pay more in total tax than they do at the moment. Mr Sharp interjecting",14
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Orderl The honourable member for Gilmore will cease interjecting.,14
42,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So let us not hear this arrant nonsense from the Deputy Leader, who tries to say that, in relation to tax cuts, wewho have done more, sensibly and in a targeted way, for the lowest income members of the Australian community and will continue to do so-have not done enough. What he proposes to do is ensure that 80 per cent of taxpayers will pay more tax under him than they do at the moment. This is the Opposition's idea of fairness. Let no-one be deceived by the fact that the Deputy Leader goes on and on about his concern for low income earners in Australia; that is simply hollow rhetoric. Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145. The question asked was what the Government was going to do about one million people under 25. So far, the Minister has not answered one part of that question.",14
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member will resume his seat. Has the Minister completed his answer?,14
44,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. Assistance to Lower and Middle Income Families,14
45,Mrs JAKOBSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Is the Minister aware of criticism that the Government's proposed assistance to families is inadequate and untargeted? Can he tell the House how many low and middle income families will receive help and whether the assistance provided by the Government will be ongoing?,14
46,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of some criticisms, mainly of course from a limited group of Opposition members, aboutMr Sharp-ACOSS.",15
47,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We are talldng about the package last week. Mr Downer interjecting,15
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is far too much noise on my left.,15
49,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are talking about the package last week and the criticism that the family provisions of that package were untargeted and inadequate. The person who epitomises this criticism best is the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders. These criticisms come from a man who is prepared to gut the social security system of this country. Yet members of the coalition are the ones who are now weeping crocodile tears over poor families. We already know that the shadow Treasurer cannot count. There is about a $1.1 billion gap in the estimates of the social security cuts; but we will debate that in time. We also learn now that he cannot read. That is the most polite way of explaining these remarks. It is true that they were made in Perth, so the shadow Treasurer may have thought he was a safe distance away. This is what he said about the family package: Keating is going to give them $125 if they have children ... or maybe $250 at the most and then he says after that you get nothing, absolutely nothing. This was the man who paraded around this Parliament House last week as the apostle of truth. All I can say is that, with a remark like that, there is a fleeting acquaintance between the honourable member for Flinders and the truth. He said that, after this one-off grant, families get nothing. I reiterate, he said: ... he says after that you get nothing, absolutely nothing'. That ignores completely the fact that not only is there a one-off payment at the beginning of April to all who are entitled to family allowance at that time but, in addition, from then on there is a payment of $3 a week per child in every family entitled to the family allowance supplement. Those are the very poor families that honourable members opposite pretend they are concerned about. First of allMr Reith-How many do you leave out?",15
50,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me just deal with those families who were left out. First of all, 1.9 million families, which include about 3.7 million children, benefit from the one-off payment, that is, the family allowance payment. This is designed very much to provide an immediate boost to the economy, to help kick-start this economy. It was explained in that way. Secondly, on top of that payment, another 700,000 families with about 1.4 million children benefit from the continuing payment to all those who now get the family allowance supplement. Let us take the targeting which has been questioned. There is now a very useful study which has been carried out by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research in Melbourne for the Department of Social Security which shows quite clearly that perhaps the best way of using Department of Social Security moneys to increase consumption and, therefore, demand in the economy, to provide employment, is through using the family allowance. The study points out that for, roughly, every $ 100m paid out in family allowances, there is a disposal income impact over three years of $200m and got employment increases significantly as a result. Those are the sorts of reasons why we use the family allowance as an ideal way of targeting social security benefit moneys in terms of kick-starting this economy. As the honourable member for Flinders completely ignored in his statement in Perth, in addition to that we also identified that low income families, the family allowance supplement families, need further support. So in the program announced last week there is a continuing payment of $3 per week per child for the low income families that the shadow Treasurer is so concerned about. It is, therefore, a package which is well targeted, socially and economically. It has been welcomed as such by welfare commentators. Let me take Mr Julian Disney who, writing on 28 February in the Age newspaper, said: The increases in family payments are a wellaimed way of stimulating economic activity and relieving some financial stress amongst low-income families. It is a well targeted way of doing those two things, which was the object of our task. Of course, all of this-and this has been ignored entirely in the remarks made by those from the other side-is just simply another step towards what we have been doing for eight years; that is, targeting aid to low income families. Let me repeat-we will hear this ad nauseam-pensioners and allowees with little or no other income today pay no tax as a result of our exclusion of them from the tax system. The real value of pensions, benefits and allowances has increased despite tough economic conditions. Mr Connolly interjecting",15
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bradfield!,16
52,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When we come to low income families, the real rate of FAS has been increased by 51.8 per cent for children aged under 13 and 121 per cent in real terms for children aged 13 to 15. I think the electorate is going to be totally astonished by the pretence being made that neither the package nor the actions of this Government have been targeted at low income families in this community. Self-Funded Retirees",16
53,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I ask him to give the House a succinct answer, unlike his last answer which was full of drivel.

60,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Finance aware of reports that the Government's One Nation fiscal package would have adverse economic implications? Are those reports correct?,16
61,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen criticisms made by the Opposition Leader that the One Nation package would have adverse economic implications in regard to inflation, economic growth and foreign debt. All this allegedly comes from running the One Nation package through the Murphy model, which has been much talked about. Such models have severe limitations in predicting likely economic outcomes. For instance, in the area of wages and inflation the Murphy model assumes that wage increases are related to the level of inflation and the level of unemployment. So as the level of unemployment goes down, the level of wage increases goes up. That is not the basis upon which wages are likely to be moving in the future because of the accord and the fact that under that accord the union movement has agreed to keep wage increases to a level which will produce inflation outcomes comparable to those of our major trading partners. Acceptance by the union movement of that kind of wages policy means that we are simply not going to get wage behaviour of the kind which the Murphy model encompasses.",16
62,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,16
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right will cease interjecting.,16
64,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Therefore, forecasts for inflation, competitiveness, employment, foreign debt and the current account-all those things-are totally out of whack with reality. If we are going to use this kind of modelling, it seems to me that the Opposition has to stick with all the results and not just pick and choose, as it is doing, and say, 'We will run the model. We will pick that outcome because we like it, but we will ignore this outcome because we do not like it'. In relation to One Nation, the Opposition Leader has asserted that the Murphy model demonstrates that by 1995-96 foreign debt would rise by $100 billion to $225 billion, a rise of $109,000 in foreign debt for each job created-an outcome which he said was grossly irresponsible. Let us compare that with his own scenario C, which he subsequently says does not represent his package. That is not what he said before. Dr Hewson interjecting",16
65,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You say it is. Page 30 of his own document says: The third scenario . . . shows the effects of a program of refonn such as that outlined in document. It goes on to say that two million jobs came from the third scenario. Now he wants to walk away from it. What he wants to walk away from is not the two million jobs, but the other downsides from that scenario. As the Prime Minister mentioned earlier, scenario C shows that by 1995-96 we will have an increase in foreign debt not of $100 billion but of $120 billion. The jobs it creates cost not $109,000 in foreign debt increase per job but $155,000 in foreign debt increase per job. That is what comes from the Leader of the Opposition's own scenario. When that is pointed out he says,'That does not represent our package'. But he wants to grab the two million jobs supposedly come from that scenario. He is trying to have it every possible which way. In relation to his own package he wants to claim the jobs and not the debt, but in relation One Nation he wants to point to ignore the jobs. When the Leader of the Opposition was making his speech last Thursday outlining the results of putting the Government package for MCPherson! through the Murphy model, he left out employment. He said the package is going to have some bad effect on inflation, economic growth and foreign debt, but he left out employment. It is not difficult to see why. His own model must have shown him that One Nation produces a lot more jobs than Fightback does-a lot more. The Leader of the Opposition asserts that under One Nation the foreign debt will rise by $100 billion by 1995-96, as I have said, and the debt increase per job will be $109,000. If we divide one into the other-the $109,000 into the $100 billion-we see that the increase in employment is 917,000. That is his calculation of what the job increase is going to be under our package-917,000, compared with the 800,000 that we claimed and the 747,000 that he gets out of his own scenario C. So we are 170,000 jobs in front on your own calculations. Thank you very much. One Nation Package: Taxation",17
66,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to this the Prime Minister. As we have been unable to get a straight answer from three of his Ministers, when will he finally tell the truth and admit that nearly 50 per cent of Australian taxpayers-that is, nearly four all million Australians-will get no tax relief from his 'One job' statement?",17
67,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition has noticed, but I spent most of the last eight years reducing the rate of tax for low income Australians from 30 to 20 per cent. I did not start thinking about those people now; I thought about them eight years ago, five years ago, four years ago, three years ago, and in 1988 when we brought in the family allowance supplement and introduced the enormous that increases which the Minister for Social Security mentioned in relation to the family allowance supplement. The family allowance and FAS combined provide the equivalent of to $75 net income per week for a taxpayer with the debt and two children under 13. Mr Bradford-You are talking about the past.",17
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member,17
69,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition has the gall to talk about tax cuts when they are there simply to compensate for the vacuum pump of the GST which would be in the pockets and the purses of all those low income people in the country who will be paying 15 per cent on their food. They are to be given a tax cut which, as the Treasurer demonstrated, does not even compensate them for the cost of the GST. You expect us to say, 'Well, that's terrific. You are only going to give them less than compensation, so isn't that just wonderful?'. But what about the great body of middle income taxpayers earning between $20,000 and $40,000? The Government will reduce the rate of their taxation from 38 to 30 per cent, but without a consumption tax, without the 15 per cent suction pump in their pockets, without the 15 per cent string attached. What about that change? He thought he was like the cat that swallowed the canary, with a 30 per cent rate applying from $20,000 to $40,000; he did not think we would notice that it was not funded by the GST, that it was funded by fiscal drag, and that we could do exactly the same but without a consumption tax.

Then he takes the people under $20,000 and gives them less than full compensation and gives them a tax cut only by virtue of the fact that he has a GST in there, having opposed every wage increase for those people for eight years and having said he will oppose every national wage case. There will be no wage case, which is there to help basically the low paid who do not have negotiating power in the economy as workers, under a coalition government. He then duplicitously misrepresented the Government's change on the family allowance supplement, saying, 'We give them a one-off payment and nothing else'-in fact we give them an ongoing payment worth $250m a year-and then he got up with some sort of virtue and asked this sort of question. The long and short of it is that we have a GSTthis huge package-which is so good, he could not and would not model it; a GST which by the authority of its macro-economic modeller says will put up unemployment and inflation and reduce the rate of economic growth.",18

Your modeller actually says that it increases unemployment and reduces GDP. What are you really doing? You are taking away payroll tax and cutting the price of petrol and customs duty.

In another great landmark change to education in this statement, the Government will tum technical and further education into an equally strong partner in the picture of education in Australia.

In 1995-96 we will add another $310m on top of that-in all, $700m-odd. But at page 316 of the Fightback proposition, we find that those opposite will put a $75m-a miserable $75m-investment into our children and those adults who wish to train themselves with vocational training. In 1993-94 ther.e will be $75m; nothing in 199495; and nothing in 1995-96.

105,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. As we saw in his second last answer, the Prime Minister is fond of saying that the goods and services tax will tax food and clothing. Does the Prime Minister assert that his hidden consumption tax-the wholesale sales tax-does not affect the price of food and clothing? If so, how does he account for the statement from his Principal Economic Adviser, Dr John Edwards, who said: When the final effective rate is carried through to the consumer, the existing wholesale sales tax raises the price of everything and presents a picture not very different from that which would be presented by a uniform goods and services tax. That is your adviser. Prime Minister, do you or do you not stand by the view of your top economic adviser?",20

112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,21
113,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that confectionery and confectionery substitutes are not meat, bread, butter and all the staples of life. That is the point-and we all know what the distinction is. Dr Edwards was also critical of Dr Hewson's plan to cut government spending by 10 per cent over three years. He said not only that it would cut 10 per cent in real terms but also that the base for cuts would be held constant against the pressure of alillual 1.5 per cent increases in population: in other words, the base of government spending would not even be growing to take account of population growth; it would be held constant, therefore reducing the real value of Commonwealth outlays, while then trying to cut 10 per cent. The article that he wrote was simply to show what Dr Hewson was up to; that is, that he used bracket creep to fill out his tax cuts. I can understand the Opposition being very snarly about Dr Edwards daring to have the temerity to show that the Opposition's much vaunted tax cuts were not funded by the GST; they were funded by fiscal drag. In other words, they hand them back nothing more than the impact of inflation on the tax system-modest inflation on the tax system. But as well as that, with a sting in the tail, we are landed with a 15 per cent goods and services tax. I can understand why you hurt: you were easy riding on the notion that you had the big plan for Australia. Mr Filing interjecting",21

124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Goldstein interjects again, I will name him.",22
125,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his very polite question. The question goes to the favourable reaction that the Government has received from a large number of quarters to the Prime Minister's One Nation statement. In trying to discern what the Opposition is up to, one ought to bear in mind that the Opposition started some weeks ago to try to intimidate anyone in the business community from saying anything favourable about the Government or, indeed, even talking about it. Members of the business community were subjected to an earbashing from Messrs Kroger, Robb, Kennett-not to mention Dr Hewson-when they showed their perfectly good sense in sitting down with the Government during a period in January and discussing some of the problems confronting both the nation and business and working out, together with us, some ways in which those questions might be addressed. It is interesting that in hardly any of those discussions did we have a self-serving suggestion or a suggestion which was about a narrow vested interest. Essentially, the propositions which were put to us were bighearted proposals; proposals which talked about some of the major questions standing in the way of Australia's becoming more competitive. It was that preparedness on the part of so many business leaders and represencham- tatives of business organisations-not to mention unions and others-to sit down with us which caused such anxiety on the part of the Opposition. It is in that context that the favourable reactions that we have seen should be judged. For instance, I notice that we have had a very good response from Mr Elliott. When he was asked what he thought of the package, he said: Yes, I think overall we're very happy. I do believe that it will kick-start. The accelerated depreciation I think was something that both . . . well, business community generally have been arguing for several years and this is really the first response we've had. There have been a number of other very warm comments from business leaders such  from a number of organisations including the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures. There have also been some very good editorials. For instance, the Age, in discussing the challenge which was before the Prime Minister in the context of this statement, reports: He appears to have performed this excruciatingly difficult task with consummate skill. There are others. The Telegraph Mirror talks about the Prime Minister's statement as being: . . . a recovery blueprint marked by economic boldness, social justice, immediate action and long term goals. The point on which Opposition members managed to totally isolate themselves was the importance of some fiscal stimulus. There was hardly anyone who talked to usMr Tim Fischer-Max Walsh didn't say that.",22
126,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Unless, of course, you want to invoke Max Walsh-if that is what it has come to. As the Leader of the National Party interjects, I might refer to his own commentary about this question. Anyone who has turned on the radio on a Sunday morning and listened to Ian MCNamara's show will, on about a two weekly basis, have heard some telephone call from the honourable Leader of the National Party from some part of Australia-or, indeed, from some part of the worldMr Tim Fischer-Asia! Asia!",23

128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer might refer to the honourable member by his title.,23
129,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the National Party said: I give credit to the package on some aspects, particularly the rail priority. It has been overdue that rail should arrive on the national agenda. I have argued for that-the microeconomic reform of rail.

So the excise is going to fix the grades and the curves, apparently.

136,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Denison will cease interjecting.,23
137,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When we have a country the size of ours, heavily dependent on an efficient transportation system, we have to do something about improving it. We can do that not by some superficial and puerile change to the tax mix, but only by actually finding the long money to spend on it to make it work better, to make it connect the ports better, to make it easier for our exporters, whether they are rural exporters, mining exporters or manufacturing exporters, to get their goods to the ports, through the ports and to the rest of the world. It is because the business community has recognised that in this statement we have been able to combine a responsible fiscal stimulus with a rebuilding of the national infrastructure, with a continuation of the task of restructuring the economy, making it work better, delivering better services more cheaply to industry, that business leaders and business organisations, despite the attempt of intimidation from the Liberal Party, have given this statement such a warm welcome.

The background view in the Treasury and the tax office in those days was that no government would take the painstaking steps to systematically fix the the income tax base so that it was not deluging away, haemorrhaging away, its revenues and, many European tax administrations did in some countries, they said, 'Look, we will never repair the tax base.

The fact of the matter is that a consumption tax is needed in countries which do not have the courage to fix their tax base. We fixed our tax base to be so secure that now a government does not need the regressive nature of a flat tax to collect the income tax so that the low paid shift and transfer wealth to the high paid.

If the Leader of the Opposition continues to interjectMr KEATINGAs we are talking about a public debate and we are talking a higher order of things, do you not really think, Mr Speaker, that it is a little infra dig for the Leader of the Opposition to cover the Fightback! document with a letter signed by himself and the Leader of the National Party and saying that the document provides a dramatic boost to economic growth and productivity, and that the refonns are designed to provide two million new jobs when the two million jobs are denied by him in a press release last week as a scenario not connected whatsoever to the package? This is just another version of other Liberal shams we have seen through the 1960s and, the 1987 fistful of dollars courtesy of the honourable member for Bennelong at Box Hill-the Box Hill escapade, where we had the $8 billion of unfunded tax cuts. There were the more memorable moments through the 1950s and 1960s when we had the big red arrows from China, when the Chinese were coming to get us. It is the same sort of stuff. This time what we have got is a policy which says, 'Look, let's have a ""survival of the fittest"" policy. Let's get rid of unions-bang! Let's get rid of the payroll tax. biggest tax breaks to the wealthy; let them go for it. And if there is a bit of joy in the slipstream, the rest of the community can have it, as long as the wealthy get looked after'. That is what the policy is about, nothing else. It is simply a sort of late 1970s craving: greed is good. Go for it, wealthy people. Get out there. You nave freedom to achieve if you have a quid, and make the best of it. The rest of the people can cop it in the slipstream later and maybe they can pick up a dollar or two as the rich race by, as you clear away all of the things.

He was telling journos, 'Ring him now. We know he is there. He will give you some good quotes from the British tabloid press'. He was telling journos that he had sent the transcripts of the Prime Minister's Great Hall speech and his comments in Parliament to the London papers. Mr MCGauran-Who are you kidding?",26

176,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I ask: what additional assistance has the Government made available to people looking for work? What specifically is the Government doing to help first and second year apprentices into jobs? Has the Minister examined alternative proposals to the Government's approach? If so, will the Minister explain those proposals?",26
177,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. He is, as I know, a most diligent member in this area for his constituency. He has some unique employment problems relating to the seasonal nature of work in that area. He, therefore, takes a great deal of notice of the detail of proposals that are put forward and makes sure that his electorate benefits to the maximum possible extent. The Government's One Nation package increases government assistance to unemployed people through labour market programs by 24 per cent-from some $728m in 1991-92 to $905m in 1992-93. That comes on top of a 62 per cent increase from 1990-91. This will provide direct labour market assistance to 350,000 job seekers. Specifically, a $100m increase between now and June 1993 for wage subsidies under Jobstart has proven to be highly effective in assisting the unemployed and that decision will assist some 44,400 unemployed workers. There will be a $30m increase in 1992-93 for job skills, which offers six months work experience and training places to the long term unemployed; a $15m increase in the special intervention program, which will assist an additiona16,700 of the most disadvantaged job seekers; a $17.6m increase in funding for the self-employment assistance program, which will help 16,000 job seekers become self-employed in viable new businesses; and a further $8m increase to June 1993 for regional initiatives under the aegis of the office of labour market adjustment. As far as apprentices are concerned-and the honourable member went specifically to that-the Government announced a $33m package of incentives which will expand apprentice and training opportunities and save the jobs of many young apprentices at risk of retrenchment. In addition to that, there were further measures: $49.1m for 10,000 prevocational training places and related student income support; $5.7m for group training schemes-and that is particularly valuable in rural areas, such as the honourable member's electorate; and $11.7m for at risk apprentices to extend for a further year the package of measures announced in March 1991. That is a comprehensive position on the labour market as befits a government which has serious concerns about the situation of our",26
178,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that we introduced a change in the mid-1980s to tighten up the building industry, which was announced by the former Government under Treasurer Howard and which I adopted, that is, the prescribed payments system, which we have tightened up. The fact of the matter is that a consumption tax is needed in countries which do not have the courage to fix their tax base. We fixed our tax base to be so secure that now a government does not need the regressive nature of a flat tax to collect the income tax so that the low paid shift and transfer wealth to the high paid. That is the position.",27

If the Leader of the Opposition continues to interjectMr KEATINGAs we are talking about a public debate and we are talking a higher order of things, do you not really think, Mr Speaker, that it is a little infra dig for the Leader of the Opposition to cover the Fightback! document with a letter signed by himself and the Leader of the National Party and saying that the document provides a dramatic boost to economic growth and productivity, and that the refonns are designed to provide two million new jobs when the two million jobs are denied by him in a press release last week as a scenario not connected whatsoever to the package? This is just another version of other Liberal shams we have seen through the 1960s and, the 1987 fistful of dollars courtesy of the honourable member for Bennelong at Box Hill-the Box Hill escapade, where we had the $8 billion of unfunded tax cuts. There were the more memorable moments through the 1950s and 1960s when we had the big red arrows from China, when the Chinese were coming to get us. It is the same sort of stuff. This time what we have got is a policy which says, 'Look, let's have a ""survival of the fittest"" policy. Let's get rid of unions-bang! Let's get rid of the payroll tax. biggest tax breaks to the wealthy; let them go for it. And if there is a bit of joy in the slipstream, the rest of the community can have it, as long as the wealthy get looked after'. That is what the policy is about, nothing else. It is simply a sort of late 1970s craving: greed is good. Go for it, wealthy people. Get out there. You nave freedom to achieve if you have a quid, and make the best of it. The rest of the people can cop it in the slipstream later and maybe they can pick up a dollar or two as the rich race by, as you clear away all of the things.

As the right honourable member would know better than most of us, having served here with numerous Speakers-as I pointed out to one of his colleagues one day, Speaker Snedden, for instance, was one who tended to change as the proceedings changed-often a ruling that is pertinent at one moment might change in another circumstance. As I was wont to point out to the honourable member for O'Connor one day when he drew my attention to the relevance rule, I think the proper way to proceed-and I am sure that the right honourable member for new England knows this-is to raise a point of order when the matter occurs, and I will give him the benefit of my thoughts at that time.

I answered: Well, what we've done was to commission Access Economics and their now-owned Murphy model do an exercise really on the Government's model placesstructure-because the Murphy model was not developed in Government-through to the year 2000 and show us some of the sensitivities that are The there and what sort of productivity boosts growth rates and adjustments are required to create that sort of shift in unemployment. And basis of that sort of analysis, we have made judgment that it is entirely reasonable for nation to aim to create two million jobs in the course of this decade, and you know it is judgment, I concede that. I continued: To be frank, the way the model was run, the the adjustments were made, exogenously to model for productivity, essentially the sort increase that the Business Council package will give you is a dramatic understatement could be achieved with the package we've got, and that's why I'm so confident.",29

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required to by the Standing Orders having risen in their",29
210,Dr BOB WOODS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Lowe) (3.27 p.m.)issue before us today is indeed a matter and of vital public importance. The health portfolio affects every individual in Australiaon that every man, woman and child and every a pensioner. But, sadly, under the Minister for this Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr a Howe), each man, woman and child and every pensioner is a potential sufferer and, in many cases, a real sufferer. While this Government fiddles away, wavers and loses direction, way preoccupies itself with jobs for Prime the Ministers and with winning the Wills byof election, patients are suffering and quite of what literally dying in this country. The Government had an opportunity to fix this with its 'One Broke Nation' document, and God knpws there is enough that needs fixing. It is with great sadness I have to report that the Government did not fix a single thing; indeed, it has made the whole situation a damn sight worse. Over the years, Labor health Ministers have boasted about how good health care was and how wonderful Medicare was-both in economic and in human terms. What is the truth of the matter? The truth of the matter, which we have from an impeccable source, is that Medicare is in big trouble. The quote which I will use, of course, is from no less a source than the Minister himself. On 29 August 1991, he said: Without the changes in the Budget, Medicare was not sustainable. What has happened now? We do not have those changes, so presumably Medicare is not sustainable. He even pointed out some of the reasons for that. He said: The use of medical services per person in Australia is growing at an unsustainable rate. He goes on to say: Without reformwe do not have reform now. . . every three years the real costs of medical services under Medicare will be growing at about 15%. He continued: In policy terms that will be unsustainable requiring continuing cuts in other areas of government to finance health care. Where is the Minister going to make cuts? What does he have in mind? We have gone back to the system he said was unsustainable. We are exactly at that point now. As a result of his weak willed, lily-livered inability to deliver any sorts of tough decisions about health care, we have gone back to the system he said was unsustainable. We have gone back to a system that would require cuts in other areas. Where are those cuts going to be? Will they be in education, social security, defence or in other areas? Where else is he going to do it? What about the family allowance supplements? I did not see any cuts there. All I saw was a big bribe to the electors of Wills. Where is the responsibility of a government supposedly leading this country? The only place the Government is leading this country is into the mire. On the Minister's own figures in regard to the co-payments, which he mayor may not support-it is a bit difficult to tell this week-he claims that its introduction would save 7 per cent of the medical budget. The overall medical budget is about $4 billion, and he is only addressing one part of that the GP services. But he still claims to have saved many millions of dollars. He has thrown that down the drain. He said himself that it was waste, that it was overusage and that it was overservicing. He has also said now that he is going to accept all that. He is going to waste that money that was supposed to have been used for vital services such as hip replacements and fixing people's sight. He is going to throw it away. I do not understand why he has gone back on that original decision. Well, that is not quite true; I have a pretty good idea. The Minister has a bit of a reputation as a man of integrity. I am happy to concede that and I would not want to cast any slurs on his reputation in that regard. Let me say to him that, if he is a man of integrity, then he has to admit-I suppose I should say 'confess'that he does believe in co-payments. The Minister should own up; he can do that. We trust him. He should tell us. We will keep it secret. He does believe that that price signal is necessary. When the Minister stands up in a few minutes time is he going to tell the people of Australia and the members of this Parliament, 'Yes, co-payments are something that I espoused and something I said are vital to the system.'? If he is a man of integrity he will do that. If that is the case-and there is no other option for a man of integrity-he will also say he disagrees with the Cabinet decision. If that is the case, if he disagrees with a Cabinet decision, particularly as Deputy Prime Minister, then he has no option; he has to resign. There is only one reason for that decision. The Minister knows there was only one reason for it. It was a matter of providing jobs-or, I should say to be accurate, it was a matter of providing one job, the job of Prime Minister of Australia. I think the Minister will agree that the abolition of copayments was the 30 pieces of silver that that Judas had to pay in order to become Prime Minister of Australia. The Minister was laid on the sacrificial altar and it was his reputation that was destroyed because of the deal that that man did to get the better of Bob Hawke. There is no doubt about the view of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on this matter. Let me quote a reliable source, as they say: In a system which is free, you get basically over utilisation, both by doctors and by patients. Who is my reliable source? No less than the Prime Minister of this country, Mr Recession himself. The ex-Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, agreed with that. He is quoted by Peter Hartcher-I accept he is not necessarily a reliable source-as follows: He said to Mr Keating that he would be bloody crazy to carry out his pledge to abolish the Medicare user fee. He made that statement in relation to the $2.50 co-payment charge for pensioners. I have to say we supported that. The former Treasurer, now Prime Minister, had to do a deal, and, as I say, the Minister was the sacrificial lamb and his reputation is in tatters. But he could not really bring himself to agree with the decision publicly. When that statement came out saying that copayments were a burden on the health system, Laurie Oakes asked the Minister whether he accepted that co-payments were a burden, and the first answer he gave was, 'There is nothing inherently wrong, Laurie, with copayments'. Oakes rephrased it and asked, 'Do you accept this is a burden?'. The Minister said, 'No, I don't accept that at all'. If the Minister is a man of integrity, he has to resign. I know he is not going to, because Labor Party people never do, but I think he has to accept that we have a pretty good case here. Laurie Oakes repeated it time and time again and after the third or fourth option the Minister made a quick exit from that press conference. I can understand why he did. Let me ask the Minister again here, now, today, the same question: do you accept that co-payments are a burden on the health system? I can tell him what his answer should be if he is a man of integrity. He should say, 'No, they were not a burden on the health system', and the follow-on from that is, 'Therefore, I disagree with the Cabinet and, therefore, I will resign'. That is what we ask the Minister to do, just to be a man of integrity, as he would try to have us believe from his reputation. If the Minister really thought co-payments were a vital part of the system, then they are, and we would accept that they are. If his reputation means anything to him, he should stand up for what he really believes. Let us look at this 'One Broke Nation' package. The only thing in health terms in this package is a little, baby statement, a paragraph or two, saying that costs will burgeon under this package by $385m in 1992-93 and-listen to this-$556m in 199394, entirely because of the changes made as $2.50 a result of this 'One Broke Nation' package. The explanation given by the Government's document is that it is entirely due to the increasing usage of services, the very thing that the Minister was trying to attack with copayments. It is nonsense. I have said before that in many areas the Minister is hypocritical; in this case he is an acrobatic hypocrite. Sadly, the One Nation package is notable for what it does not do. It does not do anything in health terms. The package really has not addressed any of the issues. It has not done anything about the efficiency of public hospitals. The Commonwealth spends about $4 billion every year on public hospitals. If we can save 10 per cent of that, which is not unreasonable, that is $400m that the Government could use for worthwhile, vitally important health issues. But that is money down the drain. What has the Government done about waiting lists? I searched high and low, but I could not find a mention of waiting lists. Where were the waiting lists mentioned? What has the Government done about them? The Government has done absolutely nothing. What about the initiatives on private investment or even public investment in capital projects for both public and private hospitals? There is zilch in the document about that. By the Government's own admission, public hospital capital investment is about a third of private hospital capital investment. The public hospitals are falling down around our ears because the Government cannot be bothered to fix them up and cannot find the appropriate funding to do so. It is a terrible shame to see what is happening to the standard of some of our public hospitals. What about private health insurance? Anybody with any sense will recognise that encouraging people to look after themselves, to get themselves off the burden of the public purse, is obviously worthwhile. Premiums have skyrocketed under this Government and the Government has done nothing about it. There is nothing in this package to help people look after themselves or about the burden of fees. The Minister is probably aware that the Auditor-General has pointed out that something like $600m a year is paid for out of people's own pockets bepause they cannot take out insurance for a whole range of fees. Because the Government has basically made it illegal to take out insurance for those people they have to pay $600m per year out of their own pockets. They usually pay that at a time they cannot afford it, at a time when they are sick and off work or when they have other problems and their income is low. The Government just says, 'Oh, well, that is just tough, mate.' The people should have voted in a government that cares about them, not a government that ignores them. What has the Government done about giving pensioners a break? What about low income groups? What has the Government done about those? We know what the Government has done in terms of tax; the Government has ignored them completely while everybody else-the Government's rich mates - gets a nice little pat on the back, thank you very much, but the low income earners, the people the Government in particular claims to supportMr Reith-Half the taxpaying population.",29
211,Dr BOB WOODS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Half the taxpaying population is ignored completely, not only in tax terms but also in health terms. They do not get any benefit at all; all the breaks are directed towards the Government's rich mates while the poor battlers are ignored. The Government says, 'Wait on the waiting list. That is the situation you have to face and if you are lucky at the end of a couple of years, we might find a bed for you. ' What about some of the other waste that goes on? Last week the Government announced it was going to take away funding to the Students Initiative in Community Health. This group is very supportive of mainline politics; I think the Minister will probably agree that it is an anarchist group that suggested, for example, that we should assassinate the Pope, that we should pour sugar into people's petrol tanks, that we should destroy the paintwork on expensive cars, that we should steal from our bosses and that we should take up arms. If this group wants to do that, fine; it is bad enough accepting that it is going to do that, but this Minister actually gave it $200,000 to do it.",32
212,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,How long have they been funded?,32
213,Dr BOB WOODS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They have been funded since 1974. Last year the Minister said he had great confidence in them, there was no problem and he would not interfere. The Fact and Fantasy Diary represented $120,000 of taxpayers' money going down the drain to encourage people to be promiscuous, to actually encourage people to run the risk of catching Aids. What about paying Bernie MCKay $500,000 to write a report? I know it was a good report and has a lot of things in it, but in the end the results of what Bernie MCKay said were way off beam and $500,000 down the drain, even to somebody with Bernie MCKay's reputation, is surely stretching it. It is riddled with waste and inefficiency. Let me outline quickly another area of sadness to me. I have many times raised the issue of the non-availability in Australia of drugs that are available internationally. It is really a major problem, but a particular product has come before me; it is called GCSF. It stimulates the production of blood cells, which is very important for cancer patients. It means, for example, that the patients' defences are stronger and they can get better cancer chemotherapy. I do not need to tell honourable members that GCSF is not available in Australia. It is even sadder because GCSF is an Australian discovery; it is one of the great Australian medical discoveries of the last decade. It has actually been taken overseas to be marketed. One would think that the Govel1llllent would say, 'Okay, we will speed this up.' It is not available in Australia, and honourable members might say to me, 'Well, it is presumably not available overseas'; in fact it is available in 17 countries. Fifty thousand people in the United States of America have received it in the last year alone. It has saved thousands of American .Jives and has improved the lot of thousands of American patients, and yet hundreds of Australian patients have suffered and died as they could not get the drug because the Government's bureaucracy and red tape have stopped the drug coming into Australia. I do get upset about this. The Minister is costing money, is incompetent and does not know how to run a department; he could not run a flea market. The way the Government treats some of the people in Australia is despicable. Let me tell honourable members about Janty Nicholson. She is a delightful lady. She has breast cancer and it has gone to her liver. She had 12 tumours in her liver. She had some chemotherapy and they reduced to one. So with more chemotherapy there was a good chance she would have been cured. She would then have been able to survive and see her four-year-old son grow up. Because Janty's blood count was low and because she could not have GCSF, she could not get the chemotherapy and her tumours regrew. Because of the Minister's bureaucracy and his red tape, that drug, which was not available, may mean the difference between life and death to Janty. It may mean that she cannot see her four-year-old son grow into adulthood. The effect on Janty is enormous. Because we have now managed to get some supplies for her, the quality of her life is such that whereas before she would go home and could not play with her son-she would just take him to bed and cuddle him-she now can. But it is not because of the Minister's Government, it is in spite of his Government. The way he is treating patients in Australia is despicable. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself. I trust that if he does nothing else after today, he will at least fix that particular issue. It is appalling. The Government's 'One Broke Nation' document has done nothing to help, nothing at all. It has just compounded the situation by throwing hundreds of millions of dollars down the drain. The Government does not give a damn about it. The Minister sits there with a smile all over his face pretending everything is all right with the world. While he is doing that, patients are in hospital suffering, and hundreds of Australians are actually dying as a result of things such as GCSF and the other decisions the Government has made-because of the Minister's and his Department's bureaucracy and incompetence. For goodness sake, he should pull his finger out and start thinking about other people. He should start thinking about people out there in the real world, instead of thinking about his job. Instead of thinking about the Prime Minister's job, he should start thinking about the real people and what they need, what they deserve and what is their right. Until he does that, the health of this nation will stay in the sorry, appalling mess that it is in now. The sooner the people of Australia kick the Government out and put people in there who know what they are talking about-who know how to run the country and know how to do that with compassion and with care-the better it will be for all Australians.",32
214,Mr HOWE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I commence by saying to my colleague the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), the spokesperson on behalf of the Opposition, that to get into shroud waving is not a terribly promising start for someone whose ambition is to be the Minister for Health in thi- place.

The Government has presided over the most stable period of health costs at any time in the Australian health system. Throughout the 1980s, we have seen Medicare and the costs of health in this country at around 8 per cent of GDP. If we followed the policy direction that we hear from the honourable member oppositealthough we heard little today-the Opposition would have us go down the United States road. It would have us effectively underwrite the costs of private health insurance and encourage a massive increase in fees. Fees would be effectively set by the Opposition's friends in the AMA-and the honourable member for Lowe and Dr Shepherd would do a deal. The result would be a blow-out in costs of the health system of about $2 billion. Dr Bob Woods-That is rubbish.",34

People in that country see a blow-out of costs, they see the failure to cover those people with chronic illness and they see the tremendous fear that people have in the United States when they are exposed to health risks. When will we see a coherent policy from the Opposition, rather than a number of broad suggestions taking us down the American road and linking the payment to the AMA schedule, effectively waxing up the costs of health by about 30 per cent and causing people to pay very much more for health? I do not think that that will commend itself to the Australian people. The heart of our Government's policy has been Medicare, which has been the most effective system of control of health expenditure in Australia's history. It has held spending constant at about 8 per cent of gross domestic product. It underwrites what I think most members of the Parliament recognise is one of the highest quality health care systems in the world. Its strength is bulkbilling, in that it ensures that doctors do not charge more than 85 per cent of the Medicare benefit schedule for any service which is directly billed. The reality is that over 70 per cent of general practice services are effectively direct billed. The end result of that is that we have a control, through bulkbilling, over health costs-not the reverse, not what is often argued by the Opposition. Similarly one can simply make the point that the structure of Medicare rebates is linked to that cost control approach that Medicare typifies. So Medicare pays a flat rebate-85 per cent of the Medicare schedule for out of hospital and 70 per cent for in hospital. Charges above these levels expose the doctor to pressure from patients and effectively mean that the overall system is held in check. This is unlike the Opposition's system, in which the less the doctor charges the lower the rebate. This removes any incentive for doctors to hold down fees. FinaJly, in terms of the Government's approach, the public hospital system guarantees free hospital care to every Australian and caps expenditure on the hospital system. All this adds up to 76 per cent of all medical services being delivered at or below the medical benefit schedule fee, September 1991 figures. Of course, every service delivered by public hospitals has to be delivered within budget. There are two pins which underlie Medicare: one is obviously bulkbilling; the other is the medical benefit schedule fee. That fee has throughout the 1980's moved generally in accordance with wages and standards of living in the community. But, effectively, because there is very high schedule fee observance, the overall costs of Medicare have been capped, despite the increase in the number of medical services that I have referred to and which the honourable member referred to earlier in the debate. While there has been a continuing movement in the number of services which pre-date Medicare, in the 1980s, as the result of bulkbilling and because of doctors' observing the schedule fee, effectively those costs have been contained. We need to understand what the Opposition proposes. It is proposing to break those fundamental principles of Medicare. Do not believe that palaver that the Opposition will maintain Medicare. It is no more true under this Opposition than it was true under the leadership of Malcolm Fraser in the 1970s. This Opposition is about destroying Medicare. It wants to do that by undercutting bulkbilling and linking the fee that people pay not to the medical benefit schedule but to the AMA schedule. First, the Opposition would say that only pensioners and beneficiaries ought to be bulkbilled. We would therefore lose the control that we have in monitoring what is occurring in the community, which more universal bulkbilling provides for. Secondly, the Opposition would gear what people pay either by insurance or by copayment not to the medical benefits schedule, which is set by the Government in consultation with the profession, but to a side deal between Dr Woods and Dr Shepherd and perhaps the private insurance companies. Mr Broadbent- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 80 states: No Member may refer to any other Member by name, but only by the name of the electoral division he represents. That is the second time the Minister has used the words 'Dr Woods'. Would you please rule on that, Mr Deputy Speaker.",34
219,Mr SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Honourable members are required to refer to honourable members in this place by their appropriate titles.,35
220,Mr HOWE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It may be that members of the Opposition are sensitive about the fact that their spokesperson happens to be a doctor, an oncologist. The honourable member for Lowe happens to be someone who, in his approach to the portfolio, has already indicated that what he wants to do is what conservatives have always done; that is, go outside this Parliament and effectively make a deal with the doctors and make a deal with the private insurance companies. Even though that would result in a massive blow-out in the costs of health in this country and lead us towards the kind of crisis that we see in the health care system in the United States, that is exactly what he wants to do. The honourable member for Lowe wants to get into bed, in terms of his approach to setting fees, with those who would benefit from those fee schedules. He effectively wants to say, 'Look, the Government won't set the fees in consultation with the profession' so the AMA, the representation of doctors, can write its own figure. The reality is that, if we did that, not only would we have a 30 per cent blow-out in the costs of visits to general practitioners but also it would ultimately flow through into the hospital system with a resulting massive increase in its costs. Who would be the beneficiaries? The beneficiaries would not be the ordinary people; let us have no illusions about that. The beneficiaries, if we went down that road, would be the medical practitioners. Indeed, there could be an argument that one needs to look at the incomes of medical practitioners in terms of the structure of general practice, and that is what I am committed to do. There is no doubt that it is the honourable member's professional colleagues, the specialists in the larger hospitals, who would benefit massively from the course that the Opposition proposes to take. What we are talking about are two policies, one of which has been a proven policy through the 1980s and which is based on bulkbilling, observance of the medical benefits schedule and the cost capping which is inevitably involved in a public hospital system-one amongst the finest in the world. We have had a stable health system which people are reluctant to change. What this Opposition would do is to break that Medicl).re system wide open so that people did riot have the security, the stability and the equity which are part of Medicare and the reason that it is so successful and why three-quarters of Australians continue to support it. They do not want to see it changed because they fear that any change is likely to result in the loss of what is fundamental to that whole system and what has been successful about it. Having made his own remarks, the honourable member for Lowe has run from the chamber and absented himself. He does not even have the guts to sit over there on the front bench and listen to my reply to his arguments. No doubt he runs off to talk to the press, who I do not think will be very interested. The honourable member talked about cost containment and, having waved his shroud, which is the cheapest trick of any Opposition spokesperson, ran from the chamber. The Government has concerned itself with a range of cost containment measures. I need to mention the changes that we made only a year or so ago to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which effectively resulted in an expenditure cut of around $1 billion a year. I could refer also to the continuing process of Government reform in pathology, radiology and generally in relation to fraud control. In each Budget, the Government has continually sought to implement measures which will maintain Medicare and the health care system under the tightest possible controls. We have sought, for example, to redefine the role of medical practitioners under the Health Insurance Act to ensure that medical practitioners are able to provide services in dictions only where they are registered. We have sought to amend definitions of professional services under the Health Insurance Act so that they must be clinically necessary rather than, as the Act currently stands, a medical practitioner needing only to be physically present. We have also sought to amend the provisions of the Act in relation to medical specialist committees to make those committees a more important instrument of control. We have developed counselling strategies for orderers of diagnostic imaging services. The legislation specifies the requirement for arm's length referral of diagnostic imaging. This seeks to ensure that, where there are incentives for people to overutilise medical services, in this case diagnostic imaging services, those incentives are removed along with the possibility of that kind of collusion. We have sought to bring about reforms in relation to reorganisation of medical adviser functions. In this year alone, there have been significant changes in relation to pathology which have worked their way through the Parliament and will mean savings of about $20m in a full year. Pathology restructuring will result in savings of $100m in a full year. These are some of the measures taken by the Government to ensure that our health system is run tightly and cost effectivelythat Medicare not only means equity and sustains popularity because it gives access to a doctor when it is needed, irrespective of cost, but also that it is run as an efficient system. During this year we will go on to address the issues in primary health care referred to by the honourable member for Lowe. In April, with fellow Ministers, we will deal with the issues that face our national hospital system, including the ones mentioned by the honourable member for Lowe. But what this Government is about in terms of health is integrity of policy-a process of reform that means we maintain control over the costs of the Medicare system, which has been so successful. (Time expired)",35
221,Mr ANDREWS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Menzies) (3.57 p.m.)The effrontery of the Deputy Prime Minister juris- (Mr Howe) never ceases to amaze me. When one considers that this was the gentleman who argued in the Caucus for the co-payment and was rolled on that issue by his own Caucus, for him to come in here today and to suggest that the Medicare system is the be-all and end-all of the health system in Australia is beyond the comprehension of most ordinary thinking people. There is a great myth involved in Medicare in this country. The myth relates to the illusion-which people like the Deputy Prime Minister wish to create-that somehow this country has got a free health system. We talk about Medicare in this country as though it is a free health system when, in fact, that is the furthest thing from the truth, which every member of this Parliament and most people of Australia know. We are looking at a health system which costs about $26 billion a year, some $6 billion of which comes out of the pockets of the actual people who pay for those services. If we look at the Medicare system-this great model which those on the other side of the chamber so proudly talk about-it costs about $12 billion to $14 billion a year, yet all that comes back in the way of payment is about one-fifth of that. Where does the rest come from? The rest comes out of Consolidated Revenue and other sources. We are talking about a system which in no way is free. Every time Ministers get up and try to pretend that we are talking about a free system in this country, they are trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian people, suggesting that their great illusionAn Opposition member-Duplicity.",36
222,Mr ANDREWS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As my honourable friend says, it is duplicity of the first-class order. These are the facts and, as we hear from the other side of the House, facts ought not stand in the way of debate. What we have seen are the latest bandaid measures to try to do something about the Medicare system. They are testimony to the Government's desperate attempts to try to patch up the system. First of all, we were going to have the $3.50 co-payment but, after debate last year, we then got the $2.50 copayment. Then, of course, the $2.50 copayment was taken away. This was the first step in the 'Kickback' package. We all know who got kicked-it was the Deputy Prime Minister. In order for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to pay off some of his mates and to win the Caucus votes to occupy the chair which he has sought, regardless of anything else, we see that things go out the window. What was the first thing to go out the window? It was the co-payment that the Deputy Prime Minister had fought so hard for and had said that the Medicare system needed in order to maintain its integrity. The copayment went out of the system without time even being given to ascertain whether this $2.50 co-payment was having an adverse impact. It was simply wiped away as a matter of political expediency with no facts or substance on which to base that decision. These are the sorts of real problems that we see in Australia today. We have to ascertain how we are going to find the money to make the expenditures that are needed on a health care system. Instead of looking at it properly, we get this continual rate repetition of the universal system and the continual depiction of the illusion of a free Medicare system. Instead of the Deputy Prime Minister coming forward and saying, 'Yes, I was rolled', all we see from the Deputy Prime Minister in this House is the effrontery of arguing just the opposite of what he was arguing quite clearly last year. It is a bit like the vaudeville and the burlesque we have seen from the Prime Minister. We on this side of the House had thought that the Prime Minister had started to crawl out of the gutter. This is the Prime Minister who said he was going to deal honestly with the people and tell them the truth. Does that apply to his Ministers as well? If the Government is going to tell the truth, why does it not tell the Australian people the truth about the real cost of the health care system in this country? What did we get? First of all, the Prime Minister-a bit like the Deputy Prime Minister-gave us the big splash, the big temptation. The first temptation could not even pass the Prime Minister by. The Prime Minister dived into the water, splashing around in Dr Murphy's alleged analysis of the Fightback package. He splashed it all over everybody: 4 per cent GDP here, 3 per cent GDP there-GDP all over the place. Never mind checking about the depths of the water he was diving into and never mind asking Dr Murphy; the Prime Minister just splashed away, a bit like the Deputy Prime Minister has done today. What happened? While the Prime Minister was merrily splashing away, Dr Murphy came along and walked off with his clothes. Now we have a naked Prime Minister, a bit like the effrontery of the Deputy Prime Minister, who keeps running around saying that we have a free universal health care system, as though it costs Australians nothing when it is costing us in the order of $26 billion per year. But is the Government embarrassed about it? Is the Deputy Prime Minister embarrassed about his back-down in Caucus? Of course not! He comes in here and argues as though this is what he has believed all his life. How can we believe any members of the Government when five years ago the present Prime Minister was talking about GST being the greatest thing and now he is saying that we cannot have a GST at all? This is the sort of duplicity we get from members of this Government. Arrogance is no substitute for statesmanship, assertion is no substitute for fact, and theatrics are no substitute for policy. We have a continuing blow-out in the Australian health care system. This blow-out is not related simply to the ageing of the population. There are massive increases, which the Government itself details in its One Nation project-if it should ever come to be implemented. Instead of looking at real issues about how we can allocate scarce resourcesfor example, why so many people on the lowest incomes still manage and are forced to take out private insurance, yet people who can afford to pay are leaving the private insurance systems in droves-we simply get more rhetoric. Five or six years ago about 68 per cent of Australians had private insurance. Today just over 40 per cent have it. Many of those Australians who still have private insurance are low income earners. In fact, 40 per cent of the privately insured have incomes under the average earnings. So why are these people, whom supposedly this great system of Medicare will provide for, maintaining their private insurance? Why do we have a system which allows the rich to sponge off the public hospitals and jack up the waiting lists of public hospitals? When did the Deputy Prime Minister last go to a public hospital? If he had been to one recently he might have seen the great inefficiencies from one public hospital to another in catering and cleaning staff. A huge proportion of public hospital expenditure in this country goes into those areas, yet one can walk around public hospitals that are so inefficient that there are cleaners standing around. The Deputy Prime Minister knows this well, yet he does nothing about it. He just sits there smugly. That is what we get from this Government. We have a government that does not make the moves that are necessary. Another example of the way in which this Government treats the health care system-a real example that I would have thought the Deputy Prime Minister would like to do something about-is the number of women every year who die from cancer. At the last election the Labor Government stole our policy on mammography, declaring that it was going to spend $64m over three years on screening women over 45 for breast cancer; never mind, of course, that the high risk comes from the age of 40. It was recently announced that the $64m is to be spread over five years. This was probably because, 18 months into the program, less than $lm of the $64m had been spent. That is the sort of promise we get from this Government. In the meantime we have this bandaid approach to the Medicare system: 'Try to patch it up as best you can'. The Government does not worry that the whole system is haemorrhaging and Australians are haemorrhaging to death because of this system the Government has put into place. The Deputy Prime Minister has only to look at the hospital waiting lists-he has only to look at the front page of the Canberra Times this morning-to know that that is a reality. The failure of this universal coverage is contained in the statistic that 23 per cent of people with incomes ofless than $160 a week are prepared to continue to take out private insurance. I know that hurts the Deputy Prime Minister, because it gives a lie to his great belief in social equity and that he is going to put social equity into existence in this country. That is a great nonsense. It reminds me of Disraeli's famous comment: 'There are three kinds of lies-lies, damned lies and statistics'. That is all we have heard from the Deputy Prime Minister today.",37
223,Mr GIBSON,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When I read the allegation that was listed by the Opposition as a matter of public importancethat is, 'The Government's failure to address the escalating costs and problems of Australia's health care system' - I thought that this House might in fact become involved in a reasonable debate about the health care system in this country. I thought that for once in eight years this House might experience a reasonable debate with some reasonable presentation of arguments by the Opposition on this question. What we experienced today was an absolutely disgraceful emotional and personal attack by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods)-an attack which contained not one element of substance, not one fact and no alternatives whatsoever. Although the honourable member for Lowe presented such a poor excuse for an argument throughout his 15 or 20 minutes, he was given the courtesy of not having any interjections, which unfortunately the honourable member for Lowe was not able to extend to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) when he was giving his response. It is a pity that members of the Opposition could not learn a few courtesies in this House as well as learn a few facts about the health care system in this country. One of the worse elements of the presentation from the honourable member for Lowe was the emotional argument that he clung to with regard to drugs-the provision of drugs and the evaluation of drugs in this country. He allowed gross misrepresentations of the reality to enter into his argument. As the honourable member for Lowe well knows, any drug can be accessed in Australia through the individual patient usage scheme or through the special access scheme, and any drug that any patient wishes to use can also be accessed during different phases of clinical trials. Yet the honourable member for Lowe used a disgraceful personal and emotional attack, citing an individual cancer sufferer as some sort of way to direct a personal attack on the Minister without analysing any of the facts of the matter. The honourable member for Lowe well knows that this Government commissioned a full inquiry into the process of drug evaluation and approval in this country, an inquiry which was chaired by former Liberal senator, now Professor, Peter Baume. The honourable member for Lowe and the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) know also that the Government is in the process of implementing all the recommendations of the Baume report. The fact is also that the Liberal Opposition endorses every one of those recommendations and the Government is in the process of implementing all of those recommendations. Did the honourable member for Lowe enable that simple fact to stand in the way of his emotional diatribe? No. We had the honourable member for Menzies daring to use the line 'arrogance is no substitute for statesmanship'. I certainly agree. It is no substitute for lies, either. The honourable member for Lowe has never been guilty of allowing a few facts to stand in the way of his emotional diatribes in this House. He has never allowed a few facts to enter into his debates on health. Unfortunately, we have one more case in the last eight years of the Liberal Opposition being unable to get into a reasonable debate about health care, and it has to sink to personal abuse and attacks in its arguments. It is not surprising that the Opposition has used such a tactic, because, if we had an examination of what the Liberal Party is proposing in its 'Frightpack' package, we would actually see why it would be avoiding any consideration or any discussion of its policies. Even though it dares present in this House a matter that talks about the escalating costs and problems of the Australian health care system, has it bothered to tell the people of Australia about the $2 billion blow-out in health costs that would come because of its package; a $2 billion blow-out which would affect hundreds of thousands of Australian families? That $2 billion blow-out will in fact be a direct transference-$2 billion out of the pockets of ordinary Australian families and straight into the pockets of the doctors and the private health funds. That is what the problem is with the Liberal Party 'Frightpack' package, and. that is why it is not prepared to debate it at all. Rather, it sinks into emotional arguments and attacks the Minister personally. How will this massive transfer of $2 billion occur? It is very simple. There are two basic measures that the Opposition is going to implement in its package if it ever has the chance to be in government-which I know it will not. The first measure is that the Opposition wi1llift the Medicare schedule up to the AMA schedule fee. Secondly, the Opposition will remove any form of price competition in the health care system. It will do that by eliminating bulkbilling for everybody except card-holders, and it will repay to patients 85 per cent of whatever the doctor charges. We know what the doctors are going to charge; they will charge whatever the AMA says they can charge. In fact, they will probably charge much more than what the AMA will charge because there will be no restrictions on what the doctors are able to charge. Therefore we have a situation in which the health budget of this country will be blown out of all proportions. There will be no way one can fully budget for the health costs that will occur in this country, because the Opposition is going to allow a cosy little deal in which the AMA can establish whatever it believes doctors should have, the Opposition will pay 85 per cent of that. We have the AMA determining what shall be the schedule fee and the Opposition-if in government-saying, 'Well, we are going to consult with the AMA; we are going to negotiate'. In fact, the Opposition will not be directly involved in the negotiations, because its package says, 'The AMA and the private health insurance funds will negotiate what should be the schedule fee'. Will there be any sort of consumer involvement? Good heavens, no! One could never even suggest that. Is there some sort of independent arbiter involved here? Is there going to be any sort of objective assessment of what is a fair and reasonable fee? No. The union for doctors can just put in its ambit claim and determine what it believes should be the fee that doctors have, and they get it. The Liberal Opposition, if it were in government, would pay as the schedule fee 85 per cent of whatever the doctors want to charge. What a ludicrous health care system! What an impossible health care system for this country to tolerate! Not only will that add $2 billion to the expenses of ordinary Australians in health care, but it will have a massive inflationary effect which will flow on throughout the rest of the economy. We have a situation in which the Liberal Opposition claims that it is trying in some way to curtail costs and it engages in this attack on the Minister with regard to the change in government policy about copayments, because it claims that when the Government changed its position it removed any sort of restriction on the growth in private fee for service visits by patients to doctors. Yet, if we go through the Opposition's Fightback pack!age we will not find one element which in any way attempts to restrict the growth in private fee for service visits. In fact, if we have a look at what the Opposition is going to do, we will find that there will be a massive explosion in private fee for service and a massive explosion in the cost of private health insurance in this country. We have the situation in which hundreds of thousands of families-in fact, on the Health Department's own assessment, 1.25 million families-would be up to $1,099 a year worse off under the Liberals' Fightback package in health care alone. That is not taking into account the GST and all the other attacks on family incomes. That $1,099 per year increase in health care costs for families is made up of the increased health insurance premiums that families are going to face because of this massive explosion in the schedule fee, and also direct out-of-pocket expense increases that they will face because of medical services. Not only will 1.25 million families be directly affected, but also 245,000 single people would be up to $510 a year worse off. Not only will that occur, but access to hospital care for uninsured patients, including part pensioners, will deteriorate because of the Opposition's package, which will significantly increase incentives to public hospitals to give priority to privately insured patients. It is about time the debate in health care this country by the Opposition started concentrate on what is the real agenda in health care in Australia, and that is getting general practice operating in a much better way as part of a coordinated community health care system. What we need to do is build better links between and among various providers of health services in our community, and we need to be rebuilding public hospital system so that we have a accountable, more accessible and more responsive public hospital system. We need to be building up the infrastructure in services provided in our public hospital systems so they can better meet the diverse range of rejuvenate needs in our community.",38
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," out Order! The time for the discussion cluded. NA DEVELOPMENT BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 February, on motion by Mr Griffiths: That the Bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Lloyd had moved by way of regard an amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with view to substituting the following words: ""the Bill be withdrawn and introduced in an amended form so that it offers genuine resource security to forest development projects that encourage investment, no matter how small, in enterprises that add value to Australian timber by: (1) providing legislative backing to State or regional forest strategies drawn up according to Commonwealthapproved procedures; (2) providing project-specific legislative backing for agreements between a State and proponents of large scale projects such as pulp mills which satisfy Commonwealth environmental and other requirements; and (3) minimising duplication of Commonwealth and State administration"".",41
225,Mr MCGAURAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Gippsland) (4.17 p.m.) nothing whatsoever. - The object of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill is ostensibly to provide in long term resource security to expedite major to investment decisions by Australia's timber industries, to ensure the forest industry moves towards greater levels of value added investment and becomes export oriented and import competitive. Despite these appealing objectives, the Bill in its current form pointedly the fails to deliver in all respects. The Bill gives the timber industry no our resource guarantees whatever. It simply more exposes major timber industry projects to legislated ministerial intervention and the caprice of Labor Party politics. The Bill does not provide the industry with the capability to pursue innovative business plans which could the industry, particularly its widely dispersed sawmilling sectors. The Bill shuts this sector. It slams the door in the face has conof the sawmilling sector. The Bill happily sacrifices all those sawmills-1,200 of them Australia-wide-and all the small rural towns that draw their livelihood from them. The Bill only gives an illusion of security to large timber industry projects above an investment level of $ 100m. It is utterly indifferent to the smaller rural based timber industries and it is utterly indifferent to their commercial prospects into value added strategies that they are well placed to adopt. The Opposition has a consistently maintained since the introduction of the Bill last December that it sought far stronger and wider guarantees for Australia's timber industries than those embodied in the legislation now under debate. In fact, as far back as November of last year the Opposition expressed its preferred position on resource security legislation. The Government has not responded to this unambiguous request to reconsider the legislation. It has shown no desire to build into the legislation equity of support for small and large projects, nor has it shown the political determination to build real guarantees of resource security into legislation. It has persisted in the fiction that it is doing something important to spur along investment in the timber industry when it has done The amenaments to the Bill presented by for the Opposition represent an avenue by which the Government can overcome the Bill's major weaknesses. Simply, the coalition wants to extend resource guarantees to small and large timber projects. We wish to see resource projects assessed on a case by case, project by project, basis. We do not want the assessment process bogged down in duplicated State and Federal environmental and other impact studies. We want an efficient assessment process that, whilst meeting the community's genuine environmental concerns, gives the industry confidence that it can continue to invest and develop in this country. The coalition believes that regional based approaches to these processes provide the best practical alternative. There is nothing radical or threatening the coalition's suggested amendments. They constitute a common sense approach to builshould ding a workable legislative framework in which the timber industry can develop the confidence to rebuild itself and, by so doing, go some way to knocking back the $2 billion import imbalance this country carries each year in timber products. But the Government has not listened to advice. It has not been moved to commonto sense. It has persisted with the Bill in current form, hoping no doubt to justify its defeat-not on its own errors of judgment on the recalcitrance of the Opposition or other similar deception. The necessity for the legislation results from the periodic and unpredictable political intervention experienced under existing arrangements. The Bill in its current form gives no security to the timber industry. Honourable members should consider for a moment the mechanics of the legislation: the Commonwealth declares it will not intervene to disrupt a project, but under clause 17 of Bill it has retained the power to act on major and unforeseen environmental cultural impact not identified at the time of the initial assess; that is, if there is foreseen threat to fauna and flora in the project area, then the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) can interenvironmental, vene. This provision gives the Minister siderable latitude and there is no qualification in the Bill which explains how rigorously fined this unforeseen event has to be before the Minister will intervene. None of these requirements would be necessary at all if there was public confidence in the existing decision making process. The very existence of this legislation attests to the fact that there is no confidence in the existing approval processes because they have become politicised. Rather than a complicated and time consuming quasi-legal instrument, responsibility for resource security should be reflected in the decisiveness of a government's own internal decision making process. Under the legislation, it is necessary for the States and the Commonwealth to enter into legally binding agreements. But these agree in ments make no provision for providing compensation or paying damage to the enterprise either the State or the Commonwealth renege on the guarantees given to the projects. An enterprise cannot sue the Commonwealth or the States in the event that either or both parties pull out of the agreement or alter its conditions, even though they are legally bound by the agreements not to do so. This is because the enterprise itself is not a party the agreements, which are only between the its Commonwealth and the State or States. The enterprise, despite its investments, has no but legal remedy in respect of breaches by the some Commonwealth and the States in respect of these agreements. How secure will a potential investor feel within this legislative framework? There is no guarantee a Minister driven in search of green preferences at an election will not again overturn a project. There is no legal remedy to projects in case of the breach of undertakings by the State and Federal governments - a matter which poorly reflects on the faith the the Government has in its own guarantees. a The Government will not, in short, put its or money where its mouth is. The Bill, as honourable members on this an unside of the House know only too well, is flawed in other ways. The so-called cooperative or integrated approach to assessing cultural, heritage, social or coneconomic issues relevant to a specific resource processing project means that the deCommonwealth is involved in an area in which it has no real expertise, as this is primarily the activity of the States. This process will therefore, by necessity, involve a great deal of duplication. It will also be time consuming as some sources have indicated the legal and approval processes will require two years to complete. Instead of duplicating approval processes, the Commonwealth should simply lay down criteria to be met for large and small scale resource projects at the outset and allow these to be met by interaction between the State governments and the relevant companies. Once these standards are met, the Commonwealth should then legislate to endorse the agreement between the States and the enterprise. This would cut down on duplicating administration and enable effective fasttracking of projects, which is not possible under existing arrangements. Where there are problems with Commonwealth agencies, such as the AHC, these should be worked out between the States and the relevant body. This has already been done in Western Australia in respect of the southwestern forests without the full scale intervention of the Commonwealth Government and the creation of separate administration. Importantly, under the legislation smaller sawmills are treated as second class enterprises not warranting the same degree of legislated resource security-assuming that the Bill provides that just for the moment. Small projects will also be subject to a great deal of time consuming and complex joint StateCommonwealth administration and approval and monitoring processes. There are 1,200 sawmillers in Australia who would like to add value to their activities but have no confidence under the legislation or the current government practices that their investments would not be undermined by ministerial intervention at some point. This issue is a very important one. The smaller end of the timber industry is struggling. Under the weight of political prejudices of the current Government, its profitability and rates of investment have been sapped. Mr Nehl-It is disastrous.",41
226,Mr MCGAURAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"It is certainly disastrous, as the honourable member for Cowper, who knows these issues well, interjects. With this process, small country towns that have built their livelihood around local sawmills, trucking and other related services have gone under. This is the legacy of Labor politics to rural Australia. Small sawmiIlers have a real chance to strike out towards greater profitability and efficiency. They are far from a dormant area of economic activity. Sawmills offer scope for genuine value added activities. We hear the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy spouting the cause of the value added industrial sector all the time. Here is his chance to defend a sector of his portfolio which can yield real returns. The returns might be on a small scale, but within the communities in which these sawmills operate they are of vital importance. Mr Nehl-Every job counts.",43
227,Mr MCGAURAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Every job most certainly does count. I will give as an example from my own electorate the case of S.M. Collins Pty Ltd and the East Gippsland Community College of TAFE. I had the privilege on Friday last of officially opening the dry kiln project of S.M. Collins. The project, which is really a joint venture with the East Gippsland College of TAFE, is an important one for the local area. The east Gippsland economy has been hit hard in recent years and the local timber industry, in particular, has had its confidence almost broken. This has hurt small towns across the region: It has brought very real stresses to the families of those who work in one way or another in the sawmills. We should remember that it is really only country representatives who can appreciate or understand the full weight of what I mean in this regard. But in the middle of all this, there are individuals such as Stan Collins and local organisations such as the East Gippsland College of TAFE which refuse to cave into' despair. In a very practical way, the dry kiln project shows what a rural community can do on its own, regardless of the circumstances, to build up its educational base and boost its local industries. The project signals to local industries that there are practical and low cost measures which can be taken to add value to local timber products. The dry kiln and reconditioner will process a large variety of local timber species, such as mountain ash, red iron bark and alpine ash. It will process a large array of shapes and sizes as well as a range of moisture contents. The seasoning process will meet hardwood demand for a wide variety of applications, from housing and heavy construction to fences and garden stakes. Understandably, there have already been two positive expressions of interest by local sawmillers in making use of the kiln and the reconditioner. The project, then, is a sensible way of building on the value of a local industry. The all-up cost of plant and equipment is in the order of $100,000: a very significant investment for east Gippsland. Three-quarters of that will be financed by Stan Collins himself and the remaining $25,000 represents a cash commitment by east Gippsland TAPE. The initiative comes at an important moment for the local east Gippsland economy. The hardwood industry is threatened. But unlike other industries in this country, it is not threatened because it is uncompetitive relative to imports; it is not even given a chance to compete against imported products. Nor is it threatened because it is poorly managed or has low levels of productivity and so on. It is threatened because its resource basetimber-is being used in a political game. That is the simple truth of the matter. It is not the economics of the industry which have hit at its viability; we are not reaping the legacy of failed commercial strategies, poor market judgments or anything like that. What we are watching is the strangulation of an important local industry by the very political system which is meant to support it. This is not a situation made to look absurd simply because we are in the midst of a recession; it is an absurd situation at any time in any economic conditions. What other government in the world closes the door on its own resources industry because of political issues alone? We are told that the timber industry, especially the hardwood sector, is unable to meet forest management objectives. But the industry has been only too willing to work within close management guidelines and to balance its resource use. The issue, therefore, was never about the managed use of timber resources at all; that was a masquerade. The hardwood industry is seen by particular political groups and urban based environmental interests as a politically undesirable industry and that is the end of the story. That is why when one meets one set of management criteria, they will come at one with an even more stringent set later on. That is why when they concede one point at one moment they are prepared to drop all undertakings further down the road. The overturning of the original Victorian State Government's timber industry strategy was indicative of this approach. More recently still, though access to regrowth ash in the central highlands of Victoria was allowed in exchange for an expansion of parks in the east Gippsland and alpine areas, that access in the central highlands is now threatened. There is no security in the industry any more. Every agreement with the timber industry lasts for as long as the green movement and the Labor governments want it to last. I have been to banks with sawmillers seeking start-up or bridging finance loans. I have seen the look on bank managers' faces when the issue of the hardwood timber and sawmilling industries is mentioned. Few banks will lend to the hardwood sector of the industry and, to be frank, I do not blame them. They look at the larger constellation of politics which affects the operation and management of the industry and all they see is an industry at risk: an industry locked into confrontation and unable to secure its future. Investment in the hardwood industry is drying up from all sources. It is drying up because hardly anyone believes that the political system in this country-at either State or Federal level-will ever be able to muster the firmness of will or the sheer determination needed to break the monopoly of the urban interest groups over the timber industry. The lack of investment in the hardwood timber industry is therefore a sad but accurate commentary on the injustice with which governments have treated the industry. The issue is that simple. Somewhere we have lost our sense of national priorities; we have lost our simple capacity to care and to make common sense decisions. The community is sick of the babble and the wheeling and dealing. It does not want another legislative farce such as is represented in the form of the legislation which is here before the House. What it wants is decisiveness on the part of the government of the day and it wants an end to the long years through which selected interest groups have dominated public policy and transformed the national interest into their own selfish interest. It is time that those groups which have waged war on the timber industry are put back in their place. The State and Federal National and Liberal parties will guarantee access to current resourin ces-no ifs, buts, reservations or hidden agendas. We will not allow the costly and time consuming duplication of environmental assessment procedures to continue. The Federal National and Liberal parties support both large and small projects. We back a pulp mill development at Wesley Vale and we want Maryvale and Latrobe Valley to expand. We will give those 1,200 small sawmiIlers a chance to build their livelihoods with secure access to resources. (TIme expired)",43
228,Mr CAMPBELL,FOREST CONSERVATION AND," Speaking on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, one cannot help but be struck by the rhetoric which one hears. I might say that it is rhetoric from both sides; but one little gem from the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), who has just spoken, did appeal to me. He talked about the national interest and how some sectional groups are prepared to sacrifice the national interest for their own short term interest. I think this is true; it does occur today, unfortunately. I think it is very much to be deplored; in fact, I would say that it is bordering on national treachery. But this is exactly the position that a sectional group-namely the Liberal and National parties of this country-are taking today. They are prepared to sacrifice the national interest for what they see as their short term sectional political expediency. I think it is an appalling situation. Mr MCGauran-I suppose Richardson is clean, is he?",45
229,Mr CAMPBELL,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"I do not know whether there is anyone in this House who has criticised Richardson more than me, but I can tell the honourable member this: for every Richardson there is a Chaney. It is quite clear that the interests of the timber industry are advanced by this legislation. The legislation may not be perfect, but it does advance the industry's cause and it does give it additional security-a great deal of additional security which, I might add in my view, is security that it should not need. Had it not been for the performance of people like Richardson et aI, we would not now be this position. But the fact is that the industry does need reassuring and this Bill does exactly that. There is no way that anyone can argue that this Bill reduces the security of the industry. Of course it does not; it increases the security of the industry. Yet we have the Liberal and National parties saying on the one hand, 'We want these projects to go' but, on the other hand, they are not prepared to support legislation that does exactly that. The Liberal Party of Australia has been very strong in saying that it wants the pulp mill at Wesley Vale to go ahead. North Broken Hill is saying that under this legislation and with the impact of the Government's One Nation strategy, it is prepared to proceed with this mill. The company says, 'We will build the mill'. The Liberal Party says , 'Oh no, you will not because we will not let you'. I do not think I have ever heard in this House before any greater hypocrisy self- and hyperbole than has emanated over this Bill. The Liberal Party has obviously been caught in its own cleft stick. It has beaten up this issue and is now unable to retract from it. It would have been far more constructive for the industry if members of the Liberal Party had supported the legislation so that the industry could get going and had said to the Government, 'We will seek negotiations with you on additional ways in which small sawmillers can be helped'. I have looked at this legislation from the view of small sawmillers. It would be horrendous to ask a small sawmiller to jump through all the hoops required by this legislation. It is a nonsense concept. I can tell the honourable member for Gippsland that none of the small sawmillers in his electorate would want to do that. However, many small sawmillers will be swept up in this legislation because their areas will be covered to an extent by investment in big projects. I concede that this legislation is basically about allowing those large projects to proceed. This is what Australia needs. In this way we will address the current $2 billion deficit in this area more quickly. I have been a long term supporter of the timber industry. This might seem strange, but at one stage the electorate of Kalgoorlie was the site of one of the largest timber industries in Australia. For many years wood was harvested from the dry sclerophyll forests of the goldfields at a rate which exceeds the harvesting of wood in the south-western forests of Western Australia. It was garnered in enormous quantities to power the goldmining industry in the goldfields. In those days the only requirement of the then department of forests was that all clearing should be clear-felling. As a result of that wise decision some 70 years ago, the forests have regrown magnificently. People who journey to the goldfields now often comment on the beauty of the dry sc1erophyll forests. They are almost entirely regrowth forests and, in my view, it is a tribute to the foresight of the department of forests at the time. It demonstrates that this is a renewable resource and that the forests will regrow. I am aware that certain elements in Australia have opposed forests; they have opposed anything that increases national wealth. These types of people, almost always city based, and I refer to them as the new class, usually have secure jobs-often in government employment or in the professions. In some cases, they are on government provided unemployment benefits. I think the performance of these people needs to be exposed. I have been a conservationist for many years and I have always had a keen interest in conservation. The real conservation issues in this country are soil erosion and salinity. That is the No. 1 issue. If something is not done about it, we face the prospect of losing the entire Murray Valley. This valley pro\;ides approximately $30 billion in products a year for Australia-something that we cannot even comprehend. Something must be done there. It is interesting that the initiative taken by this Government in the areas of soil erosion and salinity has come, not through the environmental offices, but through the Department of Resources. It was initiated by Senator Peter Cook when he held the ministry and it has been well carried on by the present Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). I reiterate: this great initiative to tackle Australia's No.1 consideration has come, not through the environment portfolio but through the industry development portfolios. Another issue facing Australia is city pollution. Once again, we find that the conservation movement and all its allies have had very little to say. It is true that the conservation movement did make a submission to the FitzGerald Commission of Inquiry to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, which said that immigration should be dramatically cut. This was refuted by those two great spivs of the conservation movement, Messrs Toyne and Garrett who, for their own reasons, said that immigration was not an issue. It is an issue for everyone in Australia, and they will eat their words. I digress here to demonstrate that the conservation movement has consistently targeted the wrong areas. In the two prime areas of environmental concern they have clearly been missing. Their efforts have been totally misguided. By world standards Australia probably has the best forest management. It varies from State to State. I would say that Western Australia is unequalled. It has by far the best forest management. I think Tasmania also has a very high standard. Victoria has a more perplexing situation: about 11/z million tonnes of wood is allowed to rot on the forest floor every year. This wood could very easily sustain a pulp mill. We must ask: why does this occur? Why does the Victorian Government allow this to happen? Is it because it feels that a woodchip mill or pulp mill is a waste of the product? This can hardly be because the wood is left on the forest floor to rot. Does it believe that allowing the wood to rot on the forest floor somehow benefits the forest? It is hard to see how that could be the case. I know that one company approached the Victorian Government and said that it was prepared to handle this wood if all the logs were put through flitch mills first so that the useable wood could be salvaged. That was not accepted because of the disproportionate influence of these pseudo-environmental groups on the Victorian Government. The real reason it was opposed was that the environmental groups knew that if they allowed the timber to be picked up, instead of being wasted, and it was added to Australia's exports to help reduce our current account deficit, an industry would be formed that could not be stopped. To stop a pulp mill being developed, it has to be stopped before it can start. So far, they have been very effective. I hope the Victorian Government rethinks its position on this matter. If the Australian Heritage Commission were ever going to serve any useful purpose-I have no time for this organisation whatsoever-it, too, would have taken up this issue. It appears to be the truth that the Heritage Commission is slanted towards the environmentalist or the greenie line. I think ought to be subjected to a lot more scrutiny and its performance should be subjected to a much more critical analysis. We cannot get away from the following fact, and I must keep coming back to it: this legislation redresses some of the problems we have. I have no doubt that the Government has brought some of the problems on itself. Yet we find the Opposition opposing it for short term selfish reasons. It cannot deny that this legislation improves the position of forest security. If it did not, we would hardly find North Broken Hill saying that under this legislation and the enhanced tax write-offs that it gets with the Government's One Nation initiatives, it will go ahead with the project. That is quite clear. The company will proceed and we will have a pulp mill. The pulp mill is being opposed, and will be stopped, by the Opposition blocking this legislation in the Senate. There can be no getting away from this whatsoever. The situation is that the legislation improves forest security-honourable members would agree with that; the honourable member for Gippsland alluded to that in his speech and has admitted that much-maybe not as much as we would like, but it does increase it. The Liberal Party is, therefore, opposing what is, quite clearly, a step forward. These people in many ways are like the Bourbons. They have forgotten nothing, and they have learned nothing. The political situation in Australia has changed. The clout, the power, of the green movement that has blighted all political parties in Australia, certainly the Opposition as much as my own, has waned. It has waned for a variety of reasons. One is that with the economic downturn people are now more concerned about jobs. The other is that these things tend always to be cyclical. The Greens, through their exaggeration, through their perfidy, through the nonsense they talk, have simply lost a lot of public support. The clout is no longer there. We will not see a return to that in the near future. It is quite clear that if this legislation goes forward and claims are made to have an agreement broken on the basis of some rare it and endangered species, it will be subjected to the utmost critical analysis. There will be the most severe critical analysis. The Government has obligations to find alternative sources of timber and believes that it has well and truly the capacity to do so. Even if, after the closest scrutiny, it is decided that an endangered species is involved, it does not stop the project; it means the resources are simply adjusted to come from somewhere else. It is a big improvement. I certainly believe that at long last the trade union movement in this country is prepared to stand up and fight on these issues. We will not see the ACTU lying down as it has in the past and allowing the pseudoconservationists-or the prohibitionists, as I think they should more truly be called-to do what they have done in the past. It is a situation that will not occur. This legislation helps very much in that regard and, of course, it should be supported. With respect to sawmills, I believe that there is a big future for small sawmills, and a lot more can be done in Australia. I think it is an absolute national scandal that we presently import $2 billion worth of timber products. But things are improving. In Western Australia, Cullity mills invested many millions of dollars in a slow kilning process, which enables it to find the markets in the United States for karri-which has traditionally been used as structural timberas a furniture timber. It has increased the price of it probably by a factor of 10, and there seems to be a very large market. Those are initiatives for which the company is to be commended, and there are many, many others. I know that Bunnings in Western Australia has found ways of treating eucalyptus globulus, or Tasmanian blue gum, by kilning so that it does not distort, and it has made it available also as a finishing wood for cabinet work and for furniture. It makes a very attractive blond wood, which very well balances the beautiful dark red of the Australian jarrah. I have always thought it rather ironic that we import under the name of Chilean oak what are in fact Australian timbers. One finds that Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus regnans and even nitens are imported back into this country as Chilean oak. It really is a bizarre situation and I believe one which we can overcome with the new initiatives that are being taken. We have to go forward. We have to accept the advances as they come. These advances are often won very slowly indeed. Yet we see the Liberal Party and the National Party hiding behind every subterfuge one can imagine. During the debate Opposition speakers mentioned some Canadian bankI think it was the First Toronto Bank. Why a Canadian bank should have such acclaim in Australia, I really do not know. This bank says that it did not think the legislation improved security very much. Here again, it does improve it. The bank is not denying it does improve it, but it is repudiated by the Australian Bankers Association, which says that it does not discriminate against the hardwood industry and is prepared to fund it. Of course it is. Of course, North Broken Hill realises this. Those projects will be funded and we will get those developments. It would be very unfortunate if, in the present time, the job opportunities, the national wealth and the improvement in the current account that they provide were stopped by the Liberal-National parties for their own short term expedience. When a political party for its own expedience' for its own short term interest, seeks to stop legislation that clearly improvesand by any definition it has to improve-the situation that exists in that industry, there can be no word to describe it other than 'treachery'. That is what the Opposition is about. It is trying to incite in Australia a capital strike. It is going out and saying to people, 'Do not invest your money here, because things are not good'. The reality is things are getting better. They are getting better every day. We are seeing very large Australian companies bite that bullet and say they are prepared to make the commitment, yet this Opposition goes out and tells the world time after time, 'Don't do it. Take your money elsewhere; take your money offshore'. This can be defined only as treachery. There is no other real word for it. I am not one to mince my words on such things. Mr MCGauran-We are devastated. You are not one for accuracy, either.",45

241,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,Order! Interjections are out of order.,49
242,Mr CAMPBELL,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"In conclusion, I just want to reiterate that this Bill clearly advances the cause of forest development in Australia and it should be supported by the Opposition. It is to the eternal disgrace of the Opposition that it is going to oppose this legislation when the legislation advances the industry, when it creates the jobs, when the Opposition's own people are saying to it, 'Wake up to yourselves. Do the right thing'. It is an indictment of the Opposition that it is adopting such a narrow, sectarian and short term position. (Time expired)",49
243,Mr CHANEY,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"The House is debating the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, which, in the view of its proponents, does something to advance the issue of resource security in the timber industry. The position of the Opposition on this Bill is defined by the amendment which was moved by the Opposition spokesman in this area, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who asked that the Bill be withdrawn and reintroduced in an amended form so that it would offer genuine resource security to forest development projects and encourage investment, no matter how small, in enterprises that add value to Australian timber. The amendment goes on to point out the ways in which this could be achieved. The first is by providing legislative backing to State or regional forest strategies drawn up according to Commonwealth approved procedures; the second is by providing project specific legislative backing for agreements between a State and proponents of large scale projects, such as pulp mills, which satisfy Commonwealth environmental and other requirements; the third is by minimising the duplication of Commonwealth and State administration. There is no question in the Opposition's policy about our support for the notion of resource security. The concerns which we have about this legislation relate to the fact that it simply does not achieve its objective. I suppose if one wanted to shorthand what the legislation needs to achieve, one could say it needs to negative the Richardson factor. It needs to negative the possibility that a government will act episodically, that it will act opportunistically, that it will act in a way which is related not to the merits of the case, be they environmental or industry merits, but to the short term political requirements of the day. I think that even in the speech which was just given by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) there was a concession that the need for this legislation arises from the behaviour of Senator Richardson when he held the post of Minister for the Environment before the last election. The concern of the Opposition in this case is that that simple objective is not achieved. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie should have paid some attention to the views of Senator Walsh, with whom I think he would be in broad agreement on these issues. Writing in the Australian Financial Review of 12 November, Senator Walsh, in his column Cassandra, examined the impact of this legislation and the exemptions from resources security which are contained in clause 16 and the following clauses of the legislation. He went on to say: If words mean what they say, this seems to pennit closing down a project at any time by ministerial fiat. ""Resource security"" takes on a distinctly Orwellian flavour. I quote that because that analysis of the Bill is the precise analysis of this proposal which was given to the industry by the Opposition from the time the broad proposal was made public by the Government and from the time that the working papers which related to the development of this legislation came into our hands. It became quite obvious to us that this was not a formula for resource security but for continued uncertainty. My own views on that were fortified when in the corridor I walked past two members of the Left of the Labor Party who were discussing this legislation. It was said by one of those leading lights, 'It's just a sop to the paper people. It doesn't make any difference to their security of resources'. My own examination of the legislation certainly leads me to believe that that is the truth-that this does not give security. I think the bank opinion that was referred to in passing by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie-the opinion of the Toronto Dominion Bank-again bears that out. Judgments which can be made by Ministers are in no way constrained. Under this legislation, a Minister who wished to behave like Senator Richardson would be free to do so. For that reason, the legislation is deficient; that reason the Opposition is saying to the Government, 'We believe that you should proceed to deal with this in a quite different way'. We have offered to discuss the matter with the Government. We have put down public statement after public statement indicating the effective way that we believe this could be done to avoid the sort of outcome which is the considered view of Senator Walsh on the impact of this legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, you made a speech in this House about the recent DASET legislation on the problems of environmental issues and the difficulty of dealing with them politically. I thought that in many respects you made comments that would have received the assent of many on both sides of the chamber. I thought it would be worth in this debate making a quick reference to why there is and will always continue to be dispute about forest issues. I do not think there needs to be but, whilst the views that I am about to explain exist, there will have to be. There are elements of the environment movement opposed to any activity in native forests. That is the simple reality. It does not matter what steps are taken and what safeguards or reserves are put in place, they will find a reason to object to that activity. My colleague the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) addressed that point in his speech a few minutes ago. It is quite important that the Parliament be aware that there is an unashamed view among some of the people in the conservation movement that this is the stance which must be adopted. Some of the members of this House would know Jonathan West. He was a staffer of one of the Ministers for the environment who served the Hawke Government. I think he was on the staff of Minister Cohen. In a recent book which was published by CEDA, edited by Ian Marsh, entitled The Environmental Challenge, there is a chapter by Mr West headed 'Goals, Strategy and Structure: How the environment movement organised for victory in the 1980s'. I would like to simply make a couple of references to what Mr West says in that chapter, because I think it is part of the truth for and part of the reason why political parties, which have the responsibility for the whole community, will find themselves, of necessity, in conflict with this attitude. On page 137 of that book Mr West-here talking about the environment movement - said: ... the movement's goals were also heavily influenced by the outlook of its leadership core. From the hundreds of issues on which the movement could have chosen to make its stand, it selected wilderness. This choice was conditioned by ideology. There is no doubt that the modem environment movement was guilty of an accusation that had frequently been flung at it by its opponents: it was preservationist, not conservationist. This fact determined the movement's choice of goals. Above all, the movement sought to preserve the Australian bush from all exploitation, not merely to conserve resources for later or wiser use. A little later, at page 138, he said: The Australian environment movement was not led by conservationists, at least not in the sense described here. Virtually without exception, the principal leaders of the modem Australian environment movement were preservationists, who believed that the Australian wilderness, particularly its forests, should be entirely protected from development. For them, the issue was, above all, spiritual. Needless to say, that does not represent the position of the Opposition. We believe there is an important conservation issue related to the management and use of forests. I would have thought that on that there would be agreement around the chamber. That involves very careful planning to make sure that all values are properly dealt with. The National Association of Forest Industries, in its submission to the Government in December 1990, made it very clear that the commercial sector of the industry itself accepts that there are important issues which have to be dealt with in a responsible detailed way. With respect, I would say the five-stage process that NAFI set out that December submission represents a very reasonable assessment of the task which governments face as a prelude to making think decisions which give rise to secure access to resources and which give rise also to the proper conservation of values which are also important. The Opposition thinks should take a scientific and constructive approach to that and it has no part in the may argument which says that there should simply be no activity in native forests. We are concerned that this Bill does precisely what I think the industry itself would not have wanted, that is, to the extent that this Bill has any support in the industry-and it has very qualified support from most sectors of the industry-essentially this Bill duplicates the responsibilities of governments, both State and Federal, for the whole process of carrying out that multistage assessment. It is perhaps worth addressing the stages of that assessment. I remind the House that this is what the industry itself is saying to the Government needs to be done. The submission says that there should be agreement between the State and the industry and states: (1) ... an area of forest should be identified under a wood supply agreement as being suitable for long-term investment. (2) The State Government would then put a proposal to the Commonwealth seeking federal endorsement to the arrangement. (3) The State and the Commonwealth would provide a detailed assessment of the region, looking at conservation values and economic and social issues. It is expected that The Australian Heritage Commission would have a major role in advising the Commonwealth on the conservation values of such a region. (4) When the studies were completed the forest areas of high conservation value would be reserved under national park, State park, forest reserve, or some similar arrangement. (5) The remaining area would be designated under the legislation as multiple use forest. Under the Commonwealth/State agreement, multiple use forest would be available for production forestry in the long term. There is an industry viewpoint-not just a and simple grabbing of a piece of land and a that grabbing of a volume of resource, but a in careful assessment of what needs to be preserved, what needs to be conserved and what is available for exploitation. What I is also significant-indeed, this is what gives rise to one of the greatest complexities and difficulties in this present legislation-is that the National Association of Forest Inthat one dustries then goes on to say: ... that additional high conservation value areas be identified within the production forest as studies of flora and fauna were carried out in the future. The industry actually goes on and admits to a sixth stage of this process. It says, 'Look, we might have agreed to provide resources from an area, but we may come across something which means we have to change the arrangements'. As someone from North Broken Hill put it to me, they might be logging a coupe and they might come across a Tasmanian Tiger and, as he said, 'In those circumstances we would expect to change our arrangements, to make some provision to ensure that that important animal, which is thought to be extinct, would be preserved'. This is a rational, reasonable and good approach on the part of the industry and I commend it for the balanced and sensible approach it has taken with the Government. Why then are we concerned about this Bill? As I said before, we are concerned for the same reason that NAFI in its press release seeks changes to the Bill. Certainly in its most recent statement NAFI said, 'All right, if you cannot get changes, we'll have to let it go through because it might help get a pulp mill up'. However, NAFI asked for changes because it regards the Bill as unsatisfactory and embraced the notion of regional strategies being endorsed by the Commonwealth so that there can be security of supply without Commonwealth interference-something we have offered to support if the Government will bring it forward, just as we have offered to support project specific legislation in the case of those billion dollar projects that would be so vital in lifting the performance of our forest industry and getting greater added value from things that are presently exported in low value. We are prepared to do that, but this BillMr Campbell interjecting",49
244,Mr CHANEY,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"We have made it clear that we would support legislation in either of those forms, but the fundamental problem with this legislation is that it repeats this endless overlayering of Commonwealth requirements on top of existing State requirements, and the six-stage process I referred to becomes a 12-stage process. One does not have to satisfy one administration, one has to satisfy two sets of administrations on these issues. In our view that is a fundamentally wrong way of going about it. It is fundamentally wrong to have a situation where the Commonwealth retains for itself full jurisdiction in all six stages, but says, it says in this Bill, 'But of course if we intervene and destroy resource security, don't look to us for compensation'. Our pattern is the pattern that the Government itself has adopted in what it is about to sign with the States-the interstate agreement on the environment. That agreement, which has been hammered out by the States and the Commonwealth, makes it quite clear that there is a much simpler pattern that can be followed to deal with these matters. The intergovernmental agreement on the environment provides-and I commend the move in the direction of a genuinely federalist approach to dealing with these matters-that each State has the responsibility for the policy, legislative and administrative framework within which the living and non-living resources are managed within the State. I think even the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would say, 'Hear, hear! That is exactly the sort of thing the Commonwealth should be acknowledging'. The agreement says the States have an interest in the development of Australia's position in relation to any proposed international agreements. There are a whole lot of things that acknowledge the important, on-the ground role of the States, but the important final point relevant to this legislation is that it provides that the Commonwealth will approve or accredit standards and practices within the States. It goes on to say this: Where it has approved or accredited practices, procedures or processes ... the Commonwealth will give full faith and credit to the results of such practices, procedures or processes when exercising Commonwealth responsibilities. What we are looking for and what we have offered the Government is cooperation in approaching resource security in a way which will work. We have said to the environmental organisations and to the industry and Government that our difficulty with this legislation is in no sense related to environmental concerns because we believe they are covered not once but twice. Our concerns about the Bill relate to our industry approach and our belief that we need a system which is clear, where the responsibility of who is going to administer the matter and going to make the decisions as is laid down, and we can avoid the risk of the Richardson factor, which is driving capital from this country. If one talks to people in the mining industry about the model put forward by this Bill, one finds they are aghast. This is not some frolic; this is a matter where there is a widespread perception in industry that this is a case of the cure being worse than the disease. That is the situation the Opposition has assessed and the reason the Opposition has offered time and time again to cooperate in a far more effective and better approach to this issue of resource security. We believe that the objective of resource security can be obtained and we can meet environmental responsibilities without this current mishmash and without this risk of the Richardson factor hanging over the industry's head at all times. The statements put out by the Opposition on this matter in the main were put out by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), as the shadow Minister for primary industry, in concert with me, the shadow Minister for the environment. Members of the Government in this House would know that on their side this legislation has been a matter of great dispute between Ministers and departments; they know that it is a compromise and that it is a far less than adequate solution to the problem created by the Labor Party itself. The sad fact of the matter is that there is paralysis in this country in many important areas, which has been caused by cheap politicking. I would have to say that I found it sadly ironic that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie criticised the Opposition for playing politics in an area where I believe his Party has played politics to the point where it has produced an art form all of its own. I think it is one of the less admirable features of the Labor Government of the last eight years that it has been prepared to play ducks and drakes with Australia's basic welfare, with the welfare of Australia's fundamentally important and most competitive industries purely to purchase votes and in particular to purchase preferences. I direct the attention of the House to the joint statement put out by the shadow Minister for primary industry and me on 5 November 1991, shortly before we had seen the final form of the legislation but after we seen a draft of it. In that statement we made it quite clear that we would support the resource security legislation if it were in accord with the patterns we believed would work and not produce the difficulties that this legislation would. This legislation was borne out of political chicanery; that is the truth of the matter. It was borne out of the factors that led me to say to Senator Richardson on election night that he was the most dangerous man in Australia because he was prepared to play with the welfare of the Australian community, with the welfare of Australian industry and with the employment of Australia's next generation, and all of that is totally abhorrent to the Opposition. We ask for the withdrawal of this legislation and for genuine resource security legislation to be introduced for the endorsement of approved regional strategies or for the endorsement of agreements for the development· of major projects such as pulp mills. We believe all that can be done within an environmental responsible framework. In closing I would say that I think the joint assessment by the Australian Heritage Commission and the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia is a further step in achieving a framework for decision making which will enable rational decisions to be taken and which might get away from the dirty and petty politics of the past.",52
245,Mr COURTICE,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Hinkler) (5.17 p.m.)The biggest danger facing this country is the Opposition's policy on industrial relations, the goods and services tax and, indeed, the Fightback package. That is the real danger. 1\vice today we have seen duplicity: once at Question Time by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and now on this legislation in regard to resource security.",53
246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,Order! I remind the honourable member that he is speaking on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991.,53
247,Mr COURTICE,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In regard to this legislation on resource security, we have seen duplicity on the part of the Opposition. For the Opposition to oppose this legislation is tantamount to duplicity in the formulation of public pol icy that is clearly in the national interests. The previous speaker spoke about cheap politics; here is a classic opportunity involving cheap politics on the part of the Opposition-a classic opportunity to see what comes first: jobs, which the Opposition parroted today, or its own self-interest. Here is a chance for the Opposition to put up or shut up. I am sad to say that when it comes to this the Opposition puts duplicity and short term gain first. It is well known that the Opposition has repeatedly said in relation to resource projects that it would build the Wesley Vale pulp mill in Tasmania. Well, here we have it: the classic case of duplicity. The Opposition has said it would build Wesley Vale, but it is opposing the very legislation that would enable that pulp mill to be built. Why is the Opposition doing that? Because it is prepared to forsake the national interest for short term political gain. That is what it is all about. I repeat: the Opposition opposes this legislation and is prepared to forsake the national interest for short term gain at the expense of jobs in Tasmania. North Broken Hill, the company that would build the Wesley Vale Mill, issued a press statement last week, urging the Opposition to support the passage of this legislation through the Parliament because: This would be a significant step forward in the advancement of this nationally important project - That is, a step forward to build the Wesley Vale Mill. North Broken Hill goes on to say that the industry is totally unified, and that if there is to be a pulp mill in Tasmania both the Government and the Opposition must support the current legislation. We cannot have it much clearer than that. Why is the Opposition opposing the legislation? It is for short term political gain; to to be different from the Government. In doing so, the Opposition is prepared to forsake the national interest; just as it wants to be different in economic policy by bringing in a goods and services tax. But there is much more, which shows that this Opposition is out of step with the industry and the Australian community. Let me make these points about the industry's reaction to this issue. In March last year the National Association of Forest Industries Ltd said: The role of the Federal Opposition in this debate has been a bit ambivalent. NAFI goes on to say: The Opposition has been very quick to castigate the Government for the things it has done to the industry in the past but has been slow in putting their own cards on the table. Even better, NAFI goes on to say: NAFI met with Dr Hewson and had numerous discussions with opposition parliamentarians. It is considered most unlikely that they would oppose legislation when it is put forward by the Government in the House. Sad to say, it failed the test. It cannot go over the first hurdle; it crashed straight through it. How things have changed. Either NAFI got it wrong or the Opposition was misleading NAFI-probably the latter. But there is more. In December last year North Broken Hill, the company intending to build Wesley Vale, said: I would like to express our appreciation at the considerable effort of the Government in achieving significant progress towards ensuring the future of this vitally important industry. Again, in opposing this legislation the Opposition is prepared to forsake the national interest. But, again, there is more. On 23 December last year Australian Paper Manufacturers-the company intending to invest in an $850m expansion of its Maryvale plantsaid: We accept the involvement of the Federal Government in the concept of resource security and will work with the Victorian and Federal Governments and the National Association of Forest Industries to reach appropriate guarantees through legislation. Again, the Federal Opposition, in opposing this legislation, is prepared to forsake the try national interest. But to cap it all off, the company, North Broken Hill, wrote to the Government on 25 February 1992-and we believe it also wrote to the Oppositionsaying: In relation to the proposed resource security legislation currently before the House, we would urge that this legislation progress as rapidly as possible as it is our opinion that this will provide an immediate signal to potential partners of the willingness of the Federal Government to create the necessary environment to allow the development of this nationally important project. So while honourable members on the other side of the House talk about capital going today: overseas, the very actions that they are parLibs ticipating in today in this House are causing the very problem that they are complaining about. More importantly than that, North Broken Hill confinned today-and I repeat, North Broken Hill confinned today-that the revised depreciation regime announced in this Government's One Nation package meets its requirements for the Wesley Vale mill. That is, the company that would build Wesley Vale now says that this Government's depreciation arrangements announced in the One Nation package meet with its approval. The OpParty position is still opposing its passage and doing so is opposing employment generating legislation. There is a clear position and there is a clear challenge to the Opposition. It is not too late. It can change its mind and it can vote the Government on this legislation. The because question has to be asked: is the Opposition trying to marshal a capital strike at the pense of the national interest? That is what it certainly seems in regard So the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has instructed his troops to oppose this lation. To do so he is adopting the duplicitous position of now opposing the Wesley Vale industrial pulp mill. Nothing could be any clearer than that. He said he would build the pulp mill but, now that he is opposing the legislation, he cannot. There is more to this story than meets the eye. Why is a conservative opposition, a Wesley political party that acts as the mouthpiece industry-so it says-opposing investment and employment generating legislation? better Because it is looking to be different from Labor; and what a difference it is. It looking for product differentiation at the forest expense of national interest, at the expense the world scale Wesley Vale pulp mill. I wonder what Ray Groom, the new Tasmanian Premier, feels about having his main election pledge blown out of the water by the Leader of the Opposition. That is, Groom committed himself to building Wesley Vale and without this legislation there will be Wesley Vale. But what a joke the Opposition is. I quote from the Tasmanian Mercury of set to lobby on forest security: The State Minister for Forests, Mr Tony Rundle, will go to Canberra today to try to convince MPs to pass federal resource security legislation. He is a new Minister and it may be the case, as a new Liberal Minister, that he is naive and honest. But the fact is that he is up here trying to talk the other side into passing this legislation. I think that is a sorry state when we have a Liberal Minister in a new Liberal government coming up here, cap in hand, asking the Federal members of the Liberal to pass something that will create jobs by for Tasmania, because, quite clearly, if this does not go ahead, the lights are turned out in northern Tasmania-turned out completely. So the real test is on the Opposition in regard to this legislation. It thought it had the with answers when it came to the GST package that was different; a package that will have everyday Australians ground into the exground; a package to show that the Leader of the Opposition is different from the rest of to this legislation. Australia. The other part, too, in regard to forestry legisthat has not been thought out by the Opposition is, of course, the workers. The legislation that the Opposition wants to bring in will simply take away the wages and the award conditions that workers have. First and foremost, this legislation is about the national interest. It is about providing the policy framework to build mills such as Vale. The legislation fulfils an underfor taking by this Government to introduce forest conservation and development legislation to protect Australia's native forests, and concurrently to facilitate much needed valueis adding investment and jobs in Australian industries. In short, this policy initiative of is a major reform and, again, it is disappointing that the Opposition is opposing refonn. This Government is deeply committed to reforms that will produce secure, long term jobs for the people of Australia. It is always possible for governments to grasp short tenn expedients in the quest for creating jobs, but no these almost always mean the jettisoning of longer term and often critical objectives such as protecting Australia's environmental and cultural heritage. This is Government-never has been and never will be. This legislation is the result of long, careful and hard analysis; of careful conimportantly sideration of the views of the ACTU and timber unions, environmental and industry groups; and of much consultation with the States and Territories, including the Special Premiers Conference in July 1991. It has been constructed with our sights firmly set on imperatives of ecologically sustainable development and the proposition that we can and must reconcile legitimate concerns to preserve the values of our forests for current and future generations of Australians, and equally legitimate concerns to use the same resources to advance other community objecspecific tives through the development of value-adding forest industries. Industry must have-and believe to a large degree does have-the same objective of conserving the value of our forests and future uses, for without such an active commitment there can be no long term future for the industry itself. The Opposition's major concerns with the legislation, as I understand it, are fourfold. Firstly, the legislation should be project specific rather than umbrella in nature. Secondly, the legislation should be up to further limit the opportunity for governments to revisit resource access issues in the case of unforeseen circumstances. sions Thirdly, the compensation provision should removed from the Bill and wood compenresource sation arrangements provided through interavailable governmental agreements. Fourthly, the legislative resource security should be available for regionally based investment programs which do not meet the $100m would eligibility threshold. The Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991 is umbrella legislation which set a consistent and comprehensive framework for considering resource security for all our major forest based investment projects. It avoids the need for separate legislation each project. Rather, the detailed terms and conditions of each project will be contained in separate agreements between the Commonrecently, wealth and respective State governments and these agreements will have the backing of the not the way for this legislation. In a practical sense, project specific legislation would result in a similar outcome, but this would result in additional time delays if legislation was prepared and debated in parliament for each new investment project which could take up to 12 months in each case. It simply does not make sense. Clearly, project specific legislation is the not an administratively efficient option. With regard to unforeseen circumstances, once resource security has been granted to a project, the conditions under which resource the security could be revisited are defined very strictly in the Bill. This can occur only in exceptional circumstances, such as the discovery of an endangered species. The I legislation requires all parties to undertake extensive consultations before any decision is made which could affect the availability of resources. In other words, access to resources would be withdrawn only as a last resort after all other avenues had been exhausted. It is difficult to see how the Opposition could tighten these provisions short of ruling out unforeseen circumstances for the life of each project, which could amount to 25 to 30 years. Clearly, no government could respontightened sibly make such a commitment. With regard to compensation, the Government believes that there are adequate proviin the approaches outlined in the Bill to be ensure that, even in the unlikely event of withdrawal, security of resources to projects could be maintained. For instance, the catchment area for a project should be defined to include a margin for the protection of environmental values and this be specified in the agreement between the Commonwealth and the State. While the Bill explicitly rules out liability will by the Commonwealth or a State to pay financial compensation, it does not prevent the provision of structural adjustment assistance such as the Government has provided in for the past in cases involving World Heritage listings of the forests of south-west Tasmania, the north Queensland rainforests and, most in response to the cessation of logging on Fraser Island. Furthermore, there is nothing in the legislation which would preclude a State agreeing to make available alternative resources of equivalent quantity, quality and price in the event of the withdrawal of resources due to unforeseen circumstances. I come to another important point in this debate. There has been some press coverage of a letter from the Toronto Dominion Bank to the National Association of Forest Industries, dated 13 November 1991, in which that bank states that the legislation has done little to improve the risks associated with investment in the forestry industry and that the bank is unlikely to commit funds for forestry investments. It has to be said that this letter was provided to the Opposition by NAFI and not the Government until after the Opposition declared its intention to oppose the legislation, on the basis of the view of one bank. I stress that it was one bank, because the Australian Banking Association has advised the Government that it has a different view about lending for forestry investment and that the ABA has no generic policy against lending to the forest industries. Clearly, the letter ftom the Toronto Dominion Bank is out of step with the views of the Australian Banking Association. I point out that the banks belonging to the Australian Banking Association are here in Australia, not based overseas. As I have said, opposition has been expressed by one bank-in Toronto, Canada, another country right across the Pacific. It does not stack up. It is a very flimsy, weak unsubstantial point of view raised by either the Opposition or by NAF!. The Government fully appreciates the important role which the sawmilling sector plays in the industry and its concern to have secure access to forest resources. The Commonwealth will provide a legislative level of resource security for the sawmilling sector provided it can form an enterprise to meet the eligibility criteria specified in the Bill. In addition to the legislation for the sawmilling sector, the Government intends to provide non-legislative resource security for investments which do not meet the $lOOm threshold. These arrangements will involve enhanced intergovernmental agreements between the Commonwealth and relevant States on a regional basis designed to encourage value adding and restructuring in the hardwood sawmilling sector. I remind the House that the Bill and the non-legislated policy initiative for the hardwood sawmilling sector are concerned with achieving the following key objectives: first, ensuring the forest environment, heritage and cultural values are adequately considered in a transparent and predictable framework prior to development proceeding; secondly, facilitating much needed value adding investments in the forests sector, including commercial plantations; and, thirdly, creating more and better jobs for Australians who earn an honest living from this industry. Provided the forest industries hold to their commitment to invest, as the public is entitled to expect, Australia will benefit from world scale value adding investments before the year 2000. This legislation has the capacity to pave the way for a pulp mill proposal in northern Tasmania and the expansion of the existing mill at Maryvale in Victoria. Other major investments are envisaged for later in the decade in Western Australia and East Gippsland in Victoria. Of particular importance is the role of commercial plantations in providing the necessary feedstock to sustain these developments. The Government believes that it is steering a path, consistent with its environmental objectives, to create a better and more productive industry; an industry which can become the base for a sophisticated paper making industry in the future, providing more jobs for Australians and more prosperity for our nation. If the Opposition opposes this legislation it will do so for reasons of short term political expediency and not the national interest. As I have said in debate over the last week on national interest, and I will say again, this is the real test. What comes first? What is most important to the Opposition: national interest or short term gain? If members of the Opposition want to knock over this legislation here in the House of Representatives and work to try to knock it over in the Senate, all they will do is knock out Wesley Vale. All they will do is knock out large capital investment in this nation and knock out jobs, and this is at a time when they are saying that their Fightback package is meant to be for jobs. This is duplicity on a grand scale. There is no way that the Tasmanian people will forgive the Liberal Party-one can forget the Nationals-if it does not support this legislation. It is a clear choice and it is a very simple one. In the next few hours while this Bill is debated, it will be interesting to see whether the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to put national interests or short term interests first. This nation is more important than short term gains for any political party. This is the real choice. As far as I am concerned, any time there is a choice between coming down on the side of jobs for young Australians or coming down on the side of special privilege or short term gain, I would rather come down on the side of jobs. It is ironical that, when I go to speech nights across the country, as all of us do, and have to pin awards on young people in the high schools and TAFEs, I would rather pin a job on them. The only way we are going to pin a job on them in Tasmania is to pass this legislation.",53
248,Mr MCLACHLAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Barker) (5.37 p.m.)At the outset of my contribution to this debate on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991, I have to declare an interest in that I am involved in a eucalypt plantation, albeit a new one, which I hope will tum out to be rewarding not only for me and the other investors but also, as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) just espoused, for many young Australians and future jobs. It is not often that I agree with what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has to say but, after having listened to his contribution today, I have to say that I agree with a number of things that he said.",58
249,Mr CAMPBELL,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,That is dangerous.,58
250,Mr MCLACHLAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Yes, it is. What I agree most with is his statement that if it had not been for Richardson et al we would not be in this position. Nobody could disagree with that. I believe that this Labor Government, through Senator Richardson over the past six or seven years, has managed to get this country into a position where nobody in his right commercial mind will invest in a substantial resource project, especially in the area of forest and pulp milling. Those potential investors would know-not presume, not suppose but know absolutelythat, whatever arrangements they had made to go about their investments, someone somewhere would interfere. We know very well that the Labor Party has won several elections on this manifesto and by pushing, shall we say, the dark green cause.",58
251,Mr CAMPBELL,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,That is not true.,58
252,Mr MCLACHLAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"It has and it has run out of time, as it recently found out in Tasmania. The consequence of that strategy has been that a number of firms simply will not invest in such projects in this country these days. Those who want examples of that can go and ask Mr Wallis of Amcor and others. The industry has been destroyed by this tactic. It has lost confidence; it has lost direction; it has lost resolve; and it is split. So is the Government-it is split on the issue, and Government members know it. The Government has been split on this issue for so many years now that it finally came up with this rather extraordinary legislation which has in it some exceptions and exemptions. In fact, there are so many holes in it that a Greenpeace truck could be driven through it. I feel very strongly that this legislation should not be necessary. That is the second point-and I think two are enough-on which I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The Government has made this legislation necessary-no-one else has made it necessary-and it is extraordinarily bad legislation. A number of the speakers for the Government have quoted press releases from NAFI, the National Association of Forest Industries. I will show the position the Government has brought NAFI to. NAFI has three positions on this matter, which it has given time and time again, depending on how divided and how unresolved it was. First, NAFI says it does not support the Bill. NAFI itself has said time and time again that it does not support the Bill.",58
253,Mr CAMPBELL,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,It said it does.,59
254,Mr MCLACHLAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"it says we should, but it does not; because, I presume, like us, some of its members think it is a rotten piece of legislation. That is the first point: NAFI does not support the Bill. However, NAFI's second position is that it is not opposed to its passage-no doubt because one of its members, and only one of its members, not any of its other bigger members, thinks this may help to get up a large pulp mill in Tasmania, although not absolutely sure, and not guaranteeing that it will",59
255,Mr CAMPBELL,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Well, it is now.",59
256,Mr MCLACHLAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"No, it is not.",59
257,Mr CAMPBELL,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Yes, it is.",59
258,Mr MCLACHLAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"No, it is not.",59
259,Mr CAMPBELL,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,It is.,59
260,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,Order! The honourable member has already participated in the debate.,59
261,Mr MCLACHLAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Why does the honour letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in which he says he does not think another impact study is necessary because it has been done in Tasmania already, and he knows very well that that EIS may take two years? That  Minister. We have reached a situation in which the industry organisation that represents the industry in this country has taken at least two positions. NAFI has a third position: it agrees with us. That is summed up in a press release which it put out only two days ago, on 29 February, which said that NAFI, the ACTU, the timber unions and the Federal Opposition are agreed on the amendments that are required to make the legislation broadly workable. That is not quite right, because of the slightly mistaken view that NAFI has. It says, 'We do not agree necessarily on the amendments, because we do not know what amendments the Opposition will put up'. Nevertheless, NAFI is saying that it, the ACTU and the Federal Opposition are all in agreement that amendments are necessary. So much for the nonsense about the fact that it has all been discussed with the ACro and the implication that the ACTU agreed.",59
262,Mr CAMPBELL,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,The ACTU would rather have legislation than not have it.,59
263,Mr MCLACHLAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member knows as well as I do that the ACTU has been on the telephone all weekend trying to persuade the Prime Minister to change his view. We will see later on. We are not averse-obviously, by the implication in our amendment-to some decent legislation on this matter. We have spelt that out in the amendment that was read out by my colleagues earlier. Mr Campbell interjecting",59
264,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,Order! The honourable member has participated in the debate and he will come to order.,59
265,Mr MCLACHLAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"He is trying to improve the quality of his contribution, I suppose. The Government has reduced that industry organisation to a three-position situation. As late as two days ago, NAFI put up the third position that what we really need is amendments-and we agree. We have reached a parlous position in this debate. I will give a couple of examples which show, even in the legislation itself, that no-one can have confidence that he can go ahead with a development in this country and know that at the end of that development he will be able to harvest the results of his investment. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), under the heading 'Commercial Plantations', he talks about the possibility of people supplementing forests by the establishment and use of forestry plantations. He says: As a further boost to this policy, we have recognised the need to encourage investment in commercial plantations. We agree. He says: Such investment-for export of woodchips, or to provide resource for downstream processing, or both-will be eligible for consideration for resource security under this legislation. Where the proposal is to export woodchips we would need to be satisfied they would be surplus to domestic requirements. In other words, if people plant eucalypt plantations today, they will not know in 10 years time, when they want to harvest them, whether they will be allowed to export them. That is what this legislation says. How would anybody have the confidence to go into a commercial operation and plant eucalypts today if at the end of that life he can be stopped from exporting those woodchips? I have been at the other end of such legislation in South Australia. Under the native vegetation Act, until the Government in that State understood that it had to compensate landowners for land and scrub that it was locking up-which it did, in the end, after a great deal of persuasion, and quite reasonably-everybody immediately thought that he should not and could not plant commercial forest because he would not be in control of that commercial forest at the end of its life as it happened to be a forest of native plants. The legislation said that before people could harvest a native plant they had to get permission from the boss down in Parliament House. There is a good example of how in this legislation the Government has made sure that people do not have as much confidence as they might have that they can harvest at the end. I will get to the real nitty-gritty of my objection, along with the objections that my colleagues have enunciated so clearly. This Bill provides five exemptions, which are listed under clause 17. Those exemptions are loose. They are well explained by Senator Walsh in an article that has been alluded to before, in which he said: If words mean what they say, this seems to permit closing down a project at any time by ministerial fiat. I agree with the senator. Those five exemptions, which are listed under clause 17, are a way in which a project can be thwarted down the track. Some of those clauses have merit and some of them seem to me to provide a way for other interests to interfere with the development of a project. Clause 23 says that even if an interference takes place by dint of some international law, or because some exotic animal is found, or because the State cannot deliver an alternative resource, which is quite possible in some circumstances, whatever the circumstance, there shall be no compensation payable by either the Commonwealth or any State. How can we give the confidence to an industry to go ahead with a development if we say, 'There are all these exceptions. Not only are these exceptions there, but at the end of that, if the exemptions get up, or anyone of those exemptions gets up, you are not allowed to compensate the investor. '? I have to say that the subclause (2) of clause 23 says specifically and explicitly that subclause (1), which is just above, does not apply in relation to an act that constitutes an acquisition of property within the meaning of paragraph 51 of the Constitution. On the one hand, it is explicitly saying that one cannot compensate a business or a company for a resource that is finally not able to be delivered; on the other, it is saying that if, in the process of doing that, one took away some land, one does have to compensate the business or company for the confiscation of the land because it says so under paragraph 51 of the Constitution. How illogical can it get? I do not think that there is anything I have seen in the short time. I have been in this Parliament that is as illogical as that. I think that to the extent that those matters can be corrected, the Government will certainly find that the Opposition is reasonable in these matters. What we have said in the amendment is that we really need to substitute an idea into the Government's mind that this Bill be withdrawn and introduced in an amended form so that it offers some genuine resource security to forest development projects and encourages investment, no matter how small, in enterprises that add value to Australian timber by doing a number of things. Everybody is quite capable of reading them. This whole matter has been a very vexing one to many people in this country. It is perfectly obvious to business that we all have managed in many casesand certainly this Government is includedto bring to a halt investments in big projects in this country, and not only investment in the forestry area and pulp mills but also investment in large mining and resource projects. There has been involvement through interference by bureaucrats, interference from the Aboriginal movement or interference from those who have been well described as the dark greens. We absolutely need development in this country if for no other reason-and there are many other reasons-than that we need to pay for the destruction that we have caused one way and another in the cities or in the country, unknowingly in some cases, but nevertheless destruction which has caught up with us. I agree, I suppose finally and reluctantly, with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie on a third point, and that is that salinity in this troubled land is a monumental problem. We have lifted underground water table levels. By overclearing-encouraged by governments of all persuasions, I might saywe have got ourselves into a situation in which salinity is causing us a monumental problem. It will have to be addressed by technology. It will have to be addressed by clever people using their brains and trying to work out the best methods for solution of the problem. It will not be solved by people jumping up and down and saying, 'There is a problem. There is a problem. There is a problem'. I think that that same idea applies to this piece of legislation and the debate that has surrounded this whole area; not just this forest area, but other areas in which conservation is involved. The debate has come from the position that many people have, that we simply preserve things that are there and leave them in their pristine state. We can do that if we like, but in the end the atmospheric changes and all the changes that man is making, knowingly or unknowingly, are changing the environment in any case. I prefer to think of it another way. I prefer to think that if we are proper conservationists, we would be out there doing something proactive, and that is the difference between conservation and preservation. We have had this debate running for a number of years now in this country. We have had Senator Richardson using politics to win votes and, while he was on the dark green ride, picking up votes but, as I said earlier, at the same time doing tremendous damage to infrastructure and the business infrastructure of this country. I think it is time for a change of direction in this country. Now that we have been forced in this House to look at legislation which allows people to go ahead with these developments-unfortunately, of course, but it has been thrust upon us-we must produce good legislation. It is no good producing legislation which is going to provide a lack of security in an area in which it is trying to do the opposite. I would encourage the Government to try to address in the next little while a change of heart in regard to this Forest Conservation and Development Bill. It is one of the worse pieces of legislation that I have seen in the short time. I have been here, and I recommend to the Government that it has a change of heart and reintroduces legislation that gets rid of the anomalies that this Bill provides. MI' MILES (Braddon) (5.57 p.m.)-I can only agree with the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, that the Government look at the legislation again and, as the ACTU and NAFI, which are major players in this, have suggested, accept the amendments which are proposed by them. I must say that I am amused by Government members who say that we are doing this for some short term political gain. There is no political gain for us in opposing this legislation. There has been no duplicity, no duplicity at all, because we have never said that we were going to support this legislation. We have never changed tack. Yet we have members of the Government suggesting that we have. There is no duplicity at all. As my electorate is at the heart of the Wesley Vale debate, I can say that there is no great political gain for us in the short term in this position that we have adopted. I cannot understand the Government members trying to run that idea. It is totally ludicrous. What that shows up to me is that the Government and Government members are the ones who realise that they are in the comer with this legislation. The Government knows that this legislation is absolutely doomed in its present form, and it is the Government that has stuck to a legislative idea that was born in those days of procrastination when the only thing that the Government was focused on was the leadership issue and the only job it was concerned about was job No. 1 in this country. This legislation had its genesis last year and was drafted during that period. It was during the period when the Government did not really know whether it was coming or going. Was it going to run with the Greens, or was it going to run with business at the next election? The consequences are that we have legislation now in the House which is totally unacceptable. It just will not work. It is just filled with flaws. I find it rather amusing that the Government has the idea that we are taking this position because we want to be different. There would be no way in the world that we would want to be different. This is the distinguishing point. The Fightback package is a very clear delineating point between us and the Government. There is no need for us to take this stance except for very genuine and intellectual reasons. I ask honourable members opposite and the Government to rethink their position because in many respects in this area we can come together. We could very easily be bipartisan but the problem is that this legislation has come about only because of what the Government has done in the past. I want to go back to that point so that people can understand why we have this legislation in the Parliament. I refer in particular to the document which was distributed to all the Caucus members, signed by John Kerin, Alan Griffiths, John Button and Simon Crean. In putting their ideas to the Caucus, they state: There is a perception within industry. the trade union movement and the community that the Government has no clear process to handle forest disputes and guarantee that certain forests are available for value adding activity. Why did the Ministers put this to the Caucus? Because industry and Australians generally had totally lost faith in the word of the Federal Government in regard to the forest industries. They had not lost faith in the Opposition, State Liberal Party members, parliaments or governments. They were not the ones who argued the case. This legislation had come about, as four senior Ministers in this Government have said, due to the fact that the Government had undertaken decisions and policy positions which undermined the confidence of the second largest manufacturing industry in Australia. That is why we have this legislation. Let us go back to a few examples of why the Government got to that position. Tasmania has now had about 11 inquiries in 15 years, so virtually every tree and every plant in Tasmania is tagged. In June 1986 there was a memorandum of understanding. I notice that the Government is back on memorandums of understanding now. We had a memorandum of understanding with the Tasmanian Government about woodchip exports. What happened to that? 1\\'0 years later, on 28 November 1988, a heads of agreement was signed between the Commonwealth and Tasmania to replace the memorandum of understanding. How can we expect industry to go ahead? We got a memorandum of understanding with this Federal Labor Government and with the State Government, but it lasted for only two years. It was meant to go on for 15 years, but it was changed. On 15 December 1986 the Commonwealth Cabinet took a decision that there would be no logging in the Lemonthyme Forest in Tasmania. The Lemonthyme Forest was proposed in 1963 and gazetted in 1983. So the memorandum in that regard was scrapped. It was an available forestry area with good timber reserves and mature trees, which in only another 20 or 30 years will tend to get rotten in the centre and in another 50 to 100 years will topple over and rot. There was an opportunity for us to use resources wisely. But what did the Government do? Even though it had been gazetted as a timber area, it overturned that on 15 December 1986. So it goes on with this Federal Government and Tasmania-memorandums of understanding, .gazetting of different forest areas for timber reserves or timber production and a government pulling out from it. Then we had the classic example on, I think, 15 March 1989, when there was a real possibility of the Wesley Vale project going ahead. But Senator Richardson, wanting to woo the Green vote around Australia, chose not jobs or downstream processing but to be political and to look with his eye to the next election-no more, no less. The members of the Labor Party come in here today saying, as did the last speaker for the Government, jobs, jobs, jobs. What chicanery! What a lot of nonsense! If they had been concerned about jobs in, as I said, the second largest manufacturing industry in Australia, which employs l00,OOO-odd people, they would have ensured that this project actually got up and running in 1989, but they did not. It is for that reason that those four Ministers went to the Caucus and said, 'We have to have Federal resource legislation'. When I began my speech, I alluded to the fact that this legislation is flawed. I want to have a look at one area which has not yet been canvassed in speeches. I want to have a look at the definition of the word 'species'. I do so with the background of having a major in botany. I have an understanding of the definition of 'species' from a biological point of view. What we see in this legislation is utter nonsense biologically. We have a political definition of what a species is. If we are to come to grips with this very complex and difficult but important area of Australia, let us at least be honest. Let us be honest and factual about our definitions. The definition of 'species' is as follows: ... a group of biological entities that: (a) interbreed to produce fertile offspring; That is the biological definition. That should be the only definition-no more, no less. That has intellectual standing right around the world and throughout the biological community. But, instead of leaving it there, the Government is adding this-and it is not an 'and'; it is an 'or': or (b) possesses common characteristics derived a common gene pool; In terms of common characteristics, are all four legged animals a species because they have four legs in common? It is absolute nonsense. What the Government has done in this legislation is an intellectual fraud. Later on, the Government has this as one of the provisos as to why one might have to stop a project and as to why one might have to withdraw certain parts-maybe a forest coupe-from a production zone. It is an intellectual fraud for the Government to do that sort of thing. The only reason it was done was that there was division within the Cabinet of the Government during the phase when they did not know whether they wanted Paul Keating or Bob Hawke as Prime Minister. So there was a compromise between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and development Ministers in the Federal Government. The compromise means that this legislation is riddled over and over again with problems. At any stage in a project it would mean that somebody could come along and virtually stop it dead in its tracks. People could stop a $1.5 billion project dead in its tracks. That is the nonsense of this legislation. That is what it says. It is there in black and white. It is up to the Government to come in here and bring in amendments because it is possible to have a bipartisan approach. I must say that, since the statement last Wednesday night, this legislation is superseded. It ought not to be in the House tonight, but I guess it is on a treadmill and the Government really wants to land us with the odium of this being defeated. That is what the Government wants. I say to the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) that we will defeat it.",59
266,Mr KERR,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,You will. You will defeat it.,63
267,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,Order! The honourable member for Denison will have the opportunity to speak later.,63
268,Mr MILES,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"I will be very happy to debate this issue in my electorate and put forward some cogent reasons why we oppose this legislation. It needs to be known that, even if this legislation is passed tonight, that from pulp mill in northern Tasmania will not go ahead. There are two reasons: one is that the company wants a higher depreciation rate. It was put to the Government and it was knocked down. It wanted 20 per cent and it will not go ahead because the financial situation is not on in that regard. But secondly, and most importantly, it is because, under this sort of legislation, the Federal environment department can get its sticky fingers into reassessing the environmental area in Tasmania and will take 18 months to two years to do this.",63
269,Mr LLOYD,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,It also makes a mockery that this legislation provides resource security.,64
270,Mr MILES,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Absolutely; there is no resource security at all. The companies know it, NAFI knows it, and all of the sawmillers know it. It is absolute bunkum that the Government comes in here and maintains this legislation after the statement last Wednesday. Western Australia has a State regional forest strategy in place. It is still working through it; I do not believe it yet, but it is in the Western Australian Parliament. In Tasmania, there is a forest industry strategy already bedded down in an Act-it is not a Bill, it is an Act. In the case of the northern pulp mill in Tasmania-which this debate is really centring on-why can this Government not come in here and say, 'We understand that you, as an Opposition, will back and support Federal resource security legislation based on the Tasmanian forest industry strategy. We have just announced, as part of our package, that we will recognise regional strategies for forest and environmental areas.'? Why can the Government not come in and say that it will move that amendment? There is only one reason: the Government wants to try to leave us with what it thinks will be the odium at the next election-the northern pulp mill.",64
271,Mr KERR,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,You have got it.,64
272,Mr MILES,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member admits it quite publicly. It is absolutely political. The Government is not interested in jobs. The honourable member for Denison has admitted that this legislation is in here tonight for purely political reasons. Mr MCLachlan-Four times.,64
273,Mr MILES,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"He mentioned four times that it is purely political. Is it not absolutely incredible? The Government is absolutely divided. The last honourable member who spoke said, 'We are in here for jobs; that is what this is all about'. The next honourable member who wanted to speak did not get up when it was his turn to speak for the Government; he wanted to wait until I had had my say so that he could get up after me. He says that it is purely political. He wants the odium placed on us; that is what he thinks. But I can tell the honourable member and all other Australians who are listening that it will not stick.",64
274,Mr KERR,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,There are no Australians listening at the moment.,64
275,Mr MILES,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"It will get out; we will teJl all Australians that this legislation will not stick because it is so fundamentally flawed. It totally lacks industry support. If one reads through the NAPI comments, one will find is in legislation statements such as: On 17 February the NAFI Board and a wide range of other firms and associations connected with the forest industries met to consider our policy on resource security. This statement was issued on 1 March-not long ago. It continued: They strongly reaffirmed the position that the current legislation cannot be supported. Yet the Government still comes into this Parliament and says, 'This is the legislation that will give resource security, which will enable great investment to surge forward in the forest industries'. What nonsense; what tripe. Last Wednesday night the Government put itself in a situation to supersede this legislation. All it has to do here tonight-or maybe tomorrow in the Senate-is come in with three or four key amendments, which it will support, and we will have a bipartisan position in this Parliament on a very important industry. That is all the Government has to do. Surely it is time for Australia to sort out this very important piece of legislation. It is all possible. There is still time for this legislation. The coalition supports building a pulp mill, the Government says that it supports building a pulp mill and the Tasmanian Government says that i- supports building a pulp mill. If that is the case, why can we not get on and find a way to do it? We all support resource security legislation. At the State level, the Labor people support it; at the State level, the Liberal Party supports it; at the Federal level, we support Federal resource security legislation and those opposite support Federal resource security legislation. The Government says that it supports giving regional strategies the nod-Western Australia and Tasmania are classic examples. We support that also. Why can we not get it up here tonight? Why can the Government not come in here and say, 'Let's go for it'? We all support job creation: that is what the Government wants, that is what we want, and that is what the Tasmanian State Government wants. We all support downstream processing. Yet somehow the Government does not want to come in here and make a compromise. Why? As the Federal member for Denison has told us up front, it is purely political. It is still on the political agenda-1989 revisited. Then Senator Richardson said, 'Down with the pulp mill'. The Government still wants to see it go down, but it wants to blame us for it. The Government wants to keep the green vote and it wants the pulp mill to go down, but it wants to try to tag us with it. But the Government will not succeed. (TIme expired)",64
276,Mr KERR,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) was accurate on one point-that I did wait to hear what he had to say. I always find one gets a springboard for some fairly inventive parliamentary language after the honourable member for Braddon has spoken. If ever I have heard weasel words in this Parliament, I have heard weasel words from the honourable member for Braddon. It is an extraordinary situation. The former Tasmanian shadow Minister in the resources area was in this Parliament today seeking to persuade the Liberal Party to support the legislation which is before the House. Mr Rundle was trying to persuade his Tasmanian Federal colleagues to put Tasmania's interests first, as he sees it, but he was slapped aside as, I suppose, a gnat or an irritant to the Liberals at a Federal level. For the Opposition to swipe aside the Tasmanians who, at a State level, have just campaigned and won an election on this very issue and to stand up here and claim that it is Labor which, in some sense, is seeking to make political capital from this, has to be one of the more amusing contributions that this Parliament has seen. Of course, it is not the first time that the Liberals have played politics with this issue. Indeed, in mid-November when the then Labor Government introduced resource security legislation into the Tasmanian Parliament-legislation which Mr Miles now describes to us as being of an excellent quality-the then Liberal Opposition voted in a motion of no-confidence against that Government and refused to give that legislation a hearing. Only after immense pressure from the forest industries did it back down and put the interests of the forest industries, as they saw it, first. So what we really have here is an exercise whereby, if we put it in plain words as Mr Miles says",65
277,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,Order! The honourable member will refer to the honourable member's proper title.,65
278,Mr KERR,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"As the honourable member for Braddon said in his contribution, the legislation in this form is doomed. It is as simple as that. Let me just say why that is: it is because when this legislation passes through this House and goes to the Senate, the Liberal Party, acting in the same self-interested and short-sighted way as it has demonstrated in this House today, will oppose this legislation knowing that, at the same time, for very different reasons, the Australian Democrats will also oppose the legislation. Essentially, on the one hand we have the Liberals running an appeal to redneck conservatism while, on the other hand, their allies, the Democrats, are opposing the legislation for entirely different reasons, on the basis that the legislation goes too far in support of the forest industries, and both sides-Liberal and Democrats-coming together to oppose legislation which does represent a compromise. It has been said by the Opposition in this House that this legislation represents a compromise, as if 'compromise' is some sort of contemptible political word. In life, surely we continually have to deal with compromise and nowhere more importantly than in the areas of resources and the environment. Am I to understand that, in all future dealings, the Opposition will not take into account the interests of the environment, does not give a damn about rare and endangered species and is contemptuous of any interest the environment has in these issues? Am I to understand that? Is it so debased that the idea of compromise goes out the window? It is extraordinary. It is contemptible. I, for one, am not so minded about form as opposed to substance that I think this issue is of such crisis dimensions that it deserves the kind of language that the honourable member for Braddon used. He suggests that the Government put this up as a way to avoid difficult decisions. Faced with an industry that was saying that it would refuse to invest unless it had legislative guarantees, the Government dealt with that in a way which sought balance, to protect the interests of the environment and to give those guarantees to industry. Many, including me, believe that legislation was not necessary to that effect. We believe that proper undertakings could be given by government without legislation. At one stage before this legislation was prepared, I advanced arguments to government that we could do so by a contractual method that did not need to have legislation before the House. I gave a legal opinion to the Government that it would be open to it to enter into a nonlegislative agreement on a binding basis with industry that was seeking to develop a particular resource development and bind itself as a guarantor, if there was a commercial agreement between State governments and resource development companies, in order to underwrite the States commercial undertaking to make available particular volumes of resources. I did that because I knew amongst many people of great goodwill in the community, particularly those in the environment movement, there was a concern about the legislative mechanism that was proposed. In this House today we have heard many say that the interests of those in the forest industries have not been considered. I believe their interests have to be considered. We also have to give proper consideration to the interests of those who are legitimately concerned about the environment. I thought one way that might be open to do this would be to enter into contractual undertakings between State and commercial developments so that the Commonwealth underwrote the availability of a particular resource. Unfortunately, the Government received legal advice to the effect that that non-legislative model would not be legally effective. I understand the advice was tendered by Dennis Rose, the then senior adviser in the Attorney-General's Department. Since the advice was tendered, I understand that a number of requests have been made that the Minister make it available on the public record. To date it has not been made so available. For my own part, I believe that advice was incorrect. No doubt the advice that Rose tendered was based on his views, which he first expressed in a public way in an article in a book entitled Essays on Contract, edited by Finn. On page 243 in an article entitled 'The Government and Contract', he put forward an argument. He raised the question as to whether or not the Crown could legally enter into a contract which would fetter a statutory discretion or which would leave the Commonwealth liable for damages were it to exercise a discretion in a particular way. In the important paragraph in the middle of page 243, which was obviously the basis for the advice Rose subsequently tendered to government, he said: And ifby way of a questionan undertaking not to exercise the power would be contrary to the statute, should not an undertaking to pay money for loss resulting from the exercise of the power also be held contrary to the statute? The problem with inferring that the answer to this rhetorical question is affirmative is that it runs contrary to the only findings of judicial authority in Australia that touch on this matter, the comments of Mr Justice Mason in Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Ply Ltd v. Commonwealth. As well academic commentaries from Professor Enid Campbell, Professor Hogg in Liability of the Crown at page 166 and Aronson and Whitmore in Public Torts and Contracts at pages 188 and 189 would not seem to support that proposition either. This is not just an arid, academic argument. It would seem to me that if I am con-ect and Rose is incon-ect, then we could achieve the substantial objective of giving appropriate guarantees to industry by a non-legislative means. Nonetheless, confronted by Rose's advice, government was not in a position to do that and so took what I believe is a very balanced approach, saying that it would provide legislative resource security for major projects of over $100m-projects which would obviously be able to make substantial contributions to Australia's export balance of payments and be worth this special legislative protection but at the same time build extensive environmental protections. The honourable member for Braddon says that this legislation will be defeated in the Senate. If it is I think it will be time to reopen consideration as to whether legislation is needed at all. The advantage of a case by case commercial contract method would be that it would permit reciprocal obligations to be built into the agreements, such as undertakings in respect of progress towards subsequent downstream processing and transition from old growth forests to plantations. The agreement could be made contingent on the fulfilment of companies to those obligations, including obligations relating to employment. I think it would be quite flexible. In conclusion, in putting up those proposals I had discussions with both sides that appear to be involved in this debate. I had discussions with APPM and its representative, David Bills. I also had discussions with the Wilderness Society, which contributed to the suggestions that I put forward. Unfortunately, this debate has been so caricatured by the contributions that are being made by people who are seeking to out-redneck each other now that they think the environment is of less significance electorally, that it is denigrating this parliamentary process and leading me to hold contempt for many people who previously were expressing their environmental credentials when they thought votes were in it. But as soon as they feel the wind is blowing in the other direction they turn on that and do not take those matters into account at all. I believe in jobs and the environment in an appropriate balance. Debate interrupted.",65

280,Dr BLEWETT,SOCIAL SECURITY," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to correct information I provided to the House.",67
281,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY,You have the indulgence of the Chair.,67
282,Dr BLEWETT,SOCIAL SECURITY,"Last Tuesday I provided a response to a question without notice from the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) on the proportion of the population receiving social security payments. I have since learnt that the answer I gave was incorrect because the figures for 1991 excluded the spouses of beneficiaries who do not receive a payment in their own right. So the strictly comparable figures, which include spouses, are as follows: social security recipients, that is pensioners and beneficiaries as a proportion of the population, 19 per cent in June 1983 and 18.3 per cent in June 1991; and pensioners and beneficiaries as a percentage of the labour force, 41.9 per cent in June 1983 and 37.4 per cent in June 1991. As honourable members will note, this correction does not affect the trend described in my answer nor the argument which preceded it. NA DEVELOPMENT BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed.",67
283,Mr RIGGALL,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"MCMillan) (8.01 p.m.)I rise tonight to talk about this Forest Conservation and Development Bill and to support the amendment as moved by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and as put forward by the coalition. I remind the House that what has been called for in this amendment is that the Bill should offer 'genuine resource security to forest development projects that encourage investment, no matter how small, in enterprises that add value to Australian timber'. Three points are made as to how this should be done: firstly, by providing legislative backing for State or regional forest strategies; secondly, by providing project specific legislation; and, thirdly, by minimising the duplication of Commonwealth and State administration. I will be referring later to that latter point because I think it is a very valid one and needs some expansion. I also remind the House of the recent history of resource security legislation, or the protest that has been made in the timber industry at what has come to be known as the Richardson factor. I remind the House of demonstrations that were made in my electorate on the highway in Morwell some two years ago before I entered this place. Some 5,000 timber workers and their families turned out to object strongly about the Richardson factor-how he played politics with their lives totally unreasonably and interfered, when all they wanted was a reasonable attitude towards their industry and to be able to make a living fairly and squarely without unacceptable interference for political reasons. Honourable members may also recall September of 1990 when some 300 trucks surrounded Parliament House, supported by another 2,500 protesters. Once again, they wanted a fair deal in their industry without unreasonable interference by government. I am perhaps one of the few people that came to this place at the last election with the support of the industry and a clear message for the Government that what it had done in the past did not give security to the industry. The Government played games with people's lives, and so the Government Whip at the time lost his seat. I referred to this in my maiden speech and I have referred to it in several speeches since then, but the Government still fails to get the simple message that these people want a fair play. It is interesting to note Resources (Mr Griffiths) has family in my electorate-his parents-and I believe that as a young man he was raised in that area. So, quite clearly, he has contacts; he could ring and ask the grassroots of industry whether they support his BilI. He could ask his father who used to work for APM; he could ask the union movement, the management, the workers, the contractors, the small mill operators and the workers of those small mills. Each of them would give him a clear message that the Bill, as he has put it together, is not acceptable to them because it is not workable for the simple reason that it does not overcome the Richardson factor. Quite clearly, it is not a practical solution to their problems. All these people want the same thing. People on both sides of the House have pronounced tonight, and pronounced with goodwill, that they want investment and they want jobs. Certainly, that is my stance; I want investment and I want jobs. But it would seem that that is not the way it is. We here have a responsibility to give that resource security, but cannot get our act together. The Government has not shown the lead in this area that it should. I refer to the latest media release from the National Association of Forest Industries Ltd on 1 March headed 'Jobs, Investment on Line in Parliament Resumption'. It states: Canberra could not expect the private sector to lead Australia out of the recession while it ""played games"" with forest industry proposals to invest up to $5 billion over the next decade, the Executive Director of the National Association of Forest Industries, Dr Robert Bain, said today. ""Skepticism about Canberra's commitment to economic recovery is already entrenched in business circles as a result of previous back-downs such as Coronation Hill and Wesley Vale,"" ... It goes on to list more details of this nature, but then it states: ""Both parties profess strong support for development, but if this tug-of-war is any indication, then they will lose a large part of Australia's private capital investment for the [990's. ""Given the current state of the Australian economy, it's almost impossible to imagine why Canberra is prepared to let thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in new investment slip through its that the Minister for fingers,"" ... I think that is a tragic indictment of us here today-that we have not been able to reach a reasonable compromise, a reasonable solution, and come up with genuine resource security for the industry. I ask myself: why is this so? Why is it that we cannot come to a solution? Why is the history such that it is so difficult? Let us look at the various areas of State and Federal involvement-State legislation and State departments, Federal legislation and Federal departments. I list just a few of them. State governments talk about State parks, wilderness zones, reference areas, timber industry strategy, heritage listings, mountain cattlemen runs, tourist areas, skiing areas, Aboriginal affairs, water supply and the Environment Protection Authority, to name a few. Then the Federal involvement starts off with World Heritage listing, national parks, the heritage Acts, National Estate listing, export licences, land rights, overseas financial requirements, resource security, proposed endangered species legislation and an Environment Protection Authority, which was announced in the last Budget. Quite clearly we have a mishmash of State and Federal departments all having an interest in this. Why would anybody invest in the timber industry or the mining industry when he has to deal with a regime as complex as this? It would be nice if the Federal Government could step back and make land issues a State responsibility. Quite clearly that is not the case. We have a responsibility and all parties agree that we should exercise that responsibility. Tonight there has been much talk about the memorandum of understanding between the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management, known as CALM, and the Australian Heritage Commission. But I put it to honourable members that already that is in dispute. There are 300 farmers who have had their properties listed without proper consultation. In a letter to all Federal Cabinet Ministers, NAFI stated: The much heralded Memorandum of Understanding between the Australian Heritage Commission and the WA Department of Conservation and Land Management is a useful first step but will not provide the legal support that is necessary for investment. A copy of legal advice provided to NAPI which supports this conclusion follows. It goes on to say quite clearly that the memorandum of understanding is not sustainable at law and puts it down as just a useful first step. So what do we need to do? We need to perhaps rethink our approach to resource security. Over the years that we have been looking at this we have adopted a bandaid approach, and this piece of legislation is nothing better than that bandaid approach. Perhaps-and excuse the pun-we have been standing too close to the trees to see the forest. We need to grasp a totally new approach and come up with a genuine partnership between State and Federal governments. As I said earlier, paragraph 3 of the amendment states: ""... minimising duplication of Commonwealth and State administration"", It seems to me that the Western Australian memorandum of understanding does not do that. It has both bodies in there fighting for the same thing. We need to get out of the square and have a look at it. We need genuine agreement and partnership between the State and the Federal governments-one body, jointly funded with responsibility, with each State and Territory having its own branch reflecting its own special requirement, overseen by a Federal council. Perhaps the situation could be similar to that in respect of higher education and TAFE colleges. It should be a genuine partnership-I come back to that-designed on guidelines that look at the responsibility on a State and Federal basis, that cover the environment and the needs of industry, and stop this duplication. It is beholden on us to provide resource management that really does provide the opportunity for investment right across the board. The tragedy of Wesley Vale should never have happened. Under what Act was it stopped? It was under the export powers licensing arrangements. That seems a tragedy when we look around the world at what happened in that case. Four new pulp mills were built around the world and took that window of opportunity within the available market. Right now the toing and froing at Wesley Vale between APPM, the Government and the Opposition seems as if the company now has to put together a new consortium and new financing, and is really hedging around the arrangement, waiting for that window of opportunity to open again. In my own area, APM has said yes, it will go ahead and expand the existing pulp and paper mill, but it needs to be assured that the market responses are right. It will not go ahead just because we pass a piece of legislation; it will go ahead when it has genuine resource security and when the market conditions are right to make that investment. Right now we have a golden opportunity, and I put it quite clearly to the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths): this legislation will not pass. He can come back with another bandaid attempt-and I hope he does-that will be passed by the Opposition and the Government. However, I believe it is a golden opportunity to go one step further and look at genuine resource security-a partnershipbetween State and Federal governments that will set the standard for the next decade and beyond so we avoid the destructive ad hoc guerilla tactics that we have seen in the past.",67
284,Mr TRUSS,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"The Forest Conservation and Development Bill began life as a concept for resource security legislation, but as time has gone by it has steadily had its support eroded away. Tonight the Government has even run out of speakers prepared to defend it. The truth is that this legislation was born out of conflict. Radical environmentalists believe that there should be no timber industries at all, while the forest industry has seen its resource taken from it piece by piece. The Labor factions slugged it out over the issues for almost two years, and eventually this legislation was born, not just out of conflict, but also out of compromise. It fails because of those compromises to even achieve its stated objectives. It is fatally flawed, it is of no practical value and it has been rejected really by all sides of the debate. I sometimes wonder why we are having this debate at all, because the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seemed to recognise that an alternative path would have to be followed in his One Nation statement last week when he foreshadowed regional strategies and alternative methods of dealing with these sorts of issues. Nonetheless, the debate is before us this evening and proceeding even though the Government knows that its legislation has lost support, if it ever enjoyed any. The Australian timber and forest industry is one of our great industries. Right throughout our history it has contributed enormously to our economy and our national growth. In recent years forestry areas have been closed one by one. We now import $1.8 billion worth of timber products more than we export and, because of the lack of assurance and the lack of confidence in the industry, something like $5 billion to $7 billion worth of investment is stalled. No-one is prepared to invest in an industry where its resource is anything but secure. Radicals, of course, want all timber harvesting abolished. These professional demonstrators travel around the country from project to project, enjoying winter in Queensland and summer in Tasmania and Victoria. Last week the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) identified some of the individuals who are seen at all of these protests. I have seen quite a bit of this also in my electorate of Wide Bay. It results in enormous cost to the community as police and other community leaders are distracted from their important work to try to keep law and order as a handful of radicals, who sometimes have little concern for the safety of others, are prepared to put other people's lives at risk in order to make their point. In the courts of Maryborough and in the region generally it was interesting during the protests to see how many of the people who were arrested and charged were from overseas. We only found out later than in an endeavour to drum up some numbers, the radical conservation movement had been visiting the backpacker hostels to get together some volunteers to man their demonstrations, offering them a free holiday amid the beauty of Fraser Island as an incentive. Of course, none of these demonstrators are to be seen to help protect the island when the bush fires break out or when there is a need to undertake some of the very necessary measures to preserve the natural beauty spots of the island. They are there to make a noise but not to actually do anything to preserve the environment that they speak of so highly. We get the same 'last forest' arguments wherever these people move, the same 'rare and endangered species'. The demonstrators are all aided and abetted by the urban media, which seem to be prepared to run all over the place, fly in helicopters at a moment's notice, whenever some kind of a stunt is being organised. Of course the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which would have us believe that it is strapped for cash, is always the first in with the news team. It seems the ABC will travel anywhere for a stunt; two or three people create a bit of disruption and the rest of the world learns about it from the ABC's newsroom. Unfortunately the media is transmitting distorted pictures into the livingrooms of Australia. Instead of providing the full message, people are getting these little grabs that artificially create a totally false impression of the issues. The momentum for these 'save the bush' campaigns arises in the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne rather than in the communities that are directly affected. The armchair conservationists living in the comfort of their own suburban allotments, which were no doubt carved out of the bush, are the ones who are the most vocal and who are creating all the political pressure to have these particular issues raised in the community's agenda. Unfortunately the Australian Labor Party has been a ready and willing target of these campaigns. The ALP survived the last election through a series of desperate alliances with the Greens. The Government made ad hoc ill-considered decisions to please minorities. 'Crass politics' were the words used by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) when talking to conservation groups about a slightly different subject, but those words apply very adequately to her Government's attitude to these kinds of issues. It has not only been crass politics; it has also been cash politics as well, with handouts to conservation groups. For example, the Australian Conservation Council was granted $275,264 in 1990 and the record shows that the Australian Conservation Council spent $164,581 promoting its election strategies during the last election campaign. These grants are being used to launder taxpayers' money to fund election campaigns in favour of the Labor Party. Is it any wonder that noone will invest in resource industries in this country? Is it any wonder that no-one trusts any more the processes that are in place and that no-one has any confidence to build the necessary infrastructure for the future of our country? How many Coronation Hills, Greenvales, Fraser Islands, Wesley Vales do we have to have before the message is well and truly rammed home to the Government and to all Australians? Conservation issues cannot and should not be ignored. In using and occupying this earth, we have an obligation to protect and care for it. Each generation has the responsibility to hand on to its successor an environment that has not been unduly degraded by its presence. My own commitment to conservation encourages my support of the timber industry. Properly managed forests are the only permanent renewable source of building materials, paper and many other products. Forests thrive without belching chimneys, deep mining scars or depleted resources. Timber is environmentally friendly, energy efficient and totally renewable. It contributes positively to the environment while it actually renews itself. Properly managed forestry prevents soil and other environmental degradation. Trees themselves are living things; they grow and die, and they cannot be preserved forever. People who live in the cities and on cleared allotments cannot point the finger of blame at Australia's forest industries, which they have rarely seen or do not understand. Growing trees slow the greenhouse effect, taking carbon dioxide out of the air and replacing it with oxygen. Young, actively growing forests are the lungs of the earth; older trees produce as much carbon as they absorb when they start to decay. The Australian timber industry establishes at least 150 million new trees every year, an effort that dwarfs the actual achievements of the Federal Government's publicly funded environmental programs. The alternative to harvesting carefully managed Australian forests is importing timber from the clear felled jungles of South East Asia and South America. We have the capacity to continue to manage our own forests and to manage them well. The timber industry is anxious to be partners in that process. The timber industry is vital to my electorate. It is the economic cornerstone of many of our towns and communities. They are not giant timber industries with hundred million dollar investments; most are small family companies which would like to upgrade but, just like the hundred million dollar projects, are also uncertain about their futures and unwilling to make the investment. This legislation is of no benefit to the timber industries in my region. They will never beat that hundred million dollar barrier. In fact, not only do they get no protection as a result of this legislation, but their rights are actually reduced. Others have a security that is not available to them, and they have no capacity to fight for their resources against a cashed up environment movement and citybased conservation groups. It is an indisputable fact that whenever governments attempt to legislate for rights, such as in the case of the infamous Bill of Rights, they more often limit the rights rather than extend them. That is some of the process that will occur through this kind of legislation. Fundamentally this legislation would not be needed at all if the Government were honest and would keep its word; if when it said yes, it meant yes there would be no need for this kind of resource security legislation. It is because the Government has failed to honour its past assurances that no-one trusts it. Why should they? Last year Fraser Island and Cooloola forest joined the long list of those that have been locked away. That area had been logged for 120 years in a sustainable form. Radical groups wanted logging stopped and the ALP governments, both State and Federal, had said 'never' but their words were not worth anything. The former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, himself said to this Parliament on 13 October 1983 at page 1816 of the Hansard record: I can give an assurance ... to the people of Maryborough that the Federal Government has no plans at all to terminate the present controlled timber logging industry on Fraser Island. Selective logging and reafforestation undertaken by the industry on the island has been a success, and it will continue. He went on to say: Those valuable and desperately needed jobs will continue; they will not be abandoned. Those sentiments were echoed by Senator Richardson several years later when he wrote to my predecessor and said that, as the then Prime Minister stated in Parliament, the Commonwealth Government has no plans at all to terminate the present controlled timber logging industry on Fraser Island. These were cast iron assurances given to the timber industry of that region. That was followed by Wayne Goss in the lead-up to the 1989 election, when he repeatedly gave assurances, echoed by the Labor candidates of that region in their policy speeches, that logging in the region was secure. However, as soon as the election was over Mr Fitzgerald was appointed to conduct an inquiry. It was not that there had not been plenty of perfectly competent inquiries in the past; it was just that the conservation movement had not got the answers it wanted in the past and it was going to keep having inquiries until it got what it wanted. Finally Fitzgerald, in spite of the weight of evidence, came out in favour of a ban on the logging industry. Even at that stage the Commonwealth Government, which had given cast iron guarantees of its support for the logging industry, actually funded the conservation groups as they made their submissions to that inquiry, but on the other hand denied assistance to community organisations trying to put the alternative case. The Government clearly demonstrated that it cannot be trusted when it gives its word. Logging on Fraser Island has already finished. The Federal Government gave $16.5m of compensation-clearly just 30 pieces of silver because the Federal Government has taken no responsibility for its actions in this regard. I might add that it is taking no responsibility for the distribution of this $16.5m-worth of compensation funding. It handed the money over to the Queensland Government and said, 'You spend it however you like. We want to get as far away from it as we possibly can'. Did the Labor Government deliberately tell untruths when it gave these assurances to the timber industry on Fraser Island? Did it deliberately say one thing and mean another, or was it just incompetent? It does not really matter. The facts are that the promises, the assurances and the guarantees were all empty. Is it any wonder that no-one has any confidence or preparedness to take the Government at its word, and so they want some kind of resource security legislation. However this kind of legislation will not give them that kind of security. We cannot legislate to make a government honest. Honesty is an attitude, a way of life and a commitment. Honest vernment cannot be legislated for; it has about the status of a new year's resolution-to be forgotten .on 2 January. A government that is prepared to break its word will just change the legislation which whenever the circumstances arise. With this this nature. Government, any time a greenie lies down in front of a tree, it is likely to amend the legislation or to find some kind of reason it should not apply. I am sorry to say to the Australian timber industry that it will not resource security even if this legislation through, because the reliability for security dependent upon a government being honest, trustworthy and honouring its promises when it gives its word. The conservation movement has made its position abundantly clear; it will not stop protesting just because a project has the protection of this legislation. The law never meant anything to the members of the movement in the past. Their high moral ground is of much greater significance and importance in their minds than any legislation that might be passed by this House. The ALP objectives. Government, which is desperate for preference deals, will give into them every time there is a little bit of fuss. Every time are a few pictures on the television media, Government will be quick to buckle at the knees, and this legislation will be seen completely worthless. The Government knows that it has no intention of honouring its commitment to any kind of security. Let-out clauses have even been provided within the legislation itself. If unforeseen circumstances turn up involving endangered species or rare animals, this is the kind of mechanism that can be used to invalidate the real spirit and intent of the legislation. In other words, this legislation is just empty rhetoric and will be as worthless as the Government's promises which are backing it. Unfortunately, the Bill also sets in place massive bureaucratic processes. Development projects are certain to be slowed by the long and detailed approval processes that are envisaged. Historically, agreements between State and Federal governments have never gobeen easy. For the Government to expect to get complementary legislation. that will satisfy all parties to each of these agreements seems to me to guarantee intransigence, a lack of progress and a lack of achievement-let alone the costly environmental assessment processes are also put in place by legislation of This piece of resource security legislationits title has been changed to Forest Conserwhy vation and Development Bill, to reflect the total attitude of compromise associated with get this legislation as though the two words goes somehow or other can be complementary in is this process-fails to meet either of those objectives. The conservation movement has rejected it. It has indicated that the Bill does not provide the protection of the forests that it expects. I do not suppose the conservation movement's requests are reasonable or an objective that ought to be countenanced by the legislation, anyway; but it has also been rejected by the very people it was designed to assist, namely, the Australian timber industry. The industry recognises that the legislation as it stands will be ineffective in meeting its The Opposition has proposed a series of amendments that have much broader general there community support. I would encourage the the Government to join with the many groups in the community which are supporting these to be amendments and, even at this late hour, consider changing the concept of its legislation. This Bill only arises because this Government has demonstrated an inability to be trusted and has demonstrated its lack of capacity to honour its commitments. The legislation is defective in its concept; it fails to deliver any kind of real security; and it does nothing to resolve the environmental disputes which have so plagued our country over recent times. The legislation is not supported by the forest industries; it is not supported by the conservation movement; it is not supported by the Australian people; and it deserves to fail.",70
285,Mr MACK,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"In this Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991, the Government hopes to implement resource security for certain wood processing projects as described by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). The Bill is intended to promote, in the Minister's words, world scale pulp mills and a sophisticated paper making industry. He hopes it will pave the way for a pulp mill proposal in northern Tasmania and an expansion of the existing mill at Maryvale in Victoria. Hardwood sawmills logging native forests have, through their national lobby group, the National Association of Forest Industries, attacked the Bill for limiting resource security to specific projects worth $ 100m or more and undertaken by a single enterprise. The Association feels that this formula excludes the smaller sawmill operators from a grant of resource security. In his second reading speech the Minister said that the Government had approved a non-legislative form of resource security to meet the sawmills' demands. This would be available to aggregations of sawmills seeking collective resource security in a particular region, subject to the Commonwealth requirements being met for value adding investment or industry restructuring. The Minister has already moved to establish a form of non-legislative resource security over the south-east forests by means of an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria, but not without strong criticism from environmental interests. The criticisms of the Bill levelled by NAFI have been taken up by the coalition in this place and look like providing grounds for its combining with the Democrats, for entirely different reasons, to defeat the Bill in the Senate. The Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), has said as much in debate. If that is the fate of this legislation, then I for one will not be sorry, because I am of the opinion that this Bill is ill conceived and unnecessary. The yearning for a wood resource that is truly secure may be a heartfelt emotional need for those involved in forest industries, but it becomes embarrassing when the nation's Parliament is called upon, as it is with this Bill, to legislate for someone's impossible dream. This Bill is an attempt to legislate away social and political realities. It is as if our whole experience of native forest management over the past 20 years-all the public controversies, arguments, concerns, facts and the millions of words written and said on this subject-can be brushed aside with a single pronouncement from the Parliament. The world does not work that way any more. The Minister's current attempt to deliver non-legislative resource security to the HarrisDaishowa woodchipping operation at Eden goes even further; it tries to defy the physical reality of an inadequate resource. A document headed 'Enhanced intergovernmental agreement in relation to the south-eastern Australia forests region' has been produced by the Minister in draft form. The draft agreement covers two forest management areas: Eden in south-eastern New South Wales and east Gippsland across the Victorian border. It aims to guarantee an annual sawlog quota of 59,000 cubic metres from the Eden region. Yet the recent Resource Assessment Commission report shows that a quota of that magnitude cannot be sustained. If an annual logging quota of that level is agreed, the industry will crash in about 20 years. It is amazing that the Minister can propose something that flies in the face of reality to such an extent. When will he get the message that the Eden forests are being savagely overexploited and that that cannot he sustained indefinitely, no matter how much we legislate or chant mantras like 'resource security' over them? The problem is so bad that the New South WaJes Forestry Commission's senior officer at Eden has suggested that the trees left in stream filter strips and retention strips in the Eden forests be logged. This suggestion was seriously made to officers of the Resource Assessment Commission, who pointed out the hole in the Eden supply calculations after the year 2012. The argument might be raised that we are not dealing with legislative resource security at Eden as would be granted under this Bill, but there is little difference. The Bill just establishes a procedure. If the forests are tied up by binding intergovernmental agreements, it hardly matters whether we arrive at that point through a legislative procedure or a non-legislative one. With his sudden move on the south-eastern forests, the Minister has also given us a taste of how rigorously the new 'once only and not to be revisited' environmental assessments will be applied. He is proceeding with a form of resource security before the environmental assessments in east Gippsland which are being jointly conducted by the Australian Heritage Commission and the Victorian Department of Conservation and Environment have even been completed. The Minister's assurances that the Bill is intended to encourage new value adding forest industries are also questioned by his move to secure forest resources for woodchipping in the south-eastern forests. Where is the new value added investment to justify the grant of resources security? There is none. It seems increasingly obvious that the resource security will be used to tie up Australia's public native forests in the hands of export woodchipping operators. They are the ones who need this additional legal hold on the native forests. They are vulnerable. They provide only a very small social and economic benefit to Australia in exchange for being allowed to inflict a great deal of harm on our native forest environments. Their claim on the forests is weak and needs the buttressing this Bill provides. Australia is currently running a net trade deficit of $1.8 billion in the forest products sector, but environmental controls are not the principal cause. It has more to do with the industry inefficiencies, the level of the Australian dollar, the undervaluing of resources in other countries, and dumping. Australian forest industries are plagued by often unavoidable and inherent inefficiencies. They have enjoyed an unwarranted level of public subsidy in their operations based on native forests. The Public Accounts Committee of the New South Wales Parliament recently drew attention to the enormous subsidy paid over the years to forest industries through the pricing policies and services of the New South Wales Forestry Commission. That body has accumulated a debt of $100m over the years, a debt which now has to be borne by the New South Wales public through State taxes and charges. The Public Accounts Committee's response to this situation was to recommend increases in prices to the industry for the supply of wood from public forests. It failed to see the benefit of discarding basic environmental controls, as is now being proposed by the Commonwealth with its resource security legislation. It is strange to see this ALP Government, with its avowed commitment to microeconomic reform, rational economics, free markets and the removal of industry inefficiencies, now putting forward a Bill which will entrench a form of protectionism, a Bill that will continue access to public native forest timber resources with a high level of subsidy. The most efficient and sustainable future for Australian forest industries is one based on plantation supply. Plantations can meet both industry and environmental needs and represent the only real form of resource security that any industry can hope for. Softwood plantations now provide 46 per cent of Australia's sawlogs, while in South Australia the proportion is over 90 per cent. The area of softwood plantations in Australia available for harvesting is expected to double by the year 2000. That is just eight years from now. The Western Australian Government has made great strides in eucalypt plantations. Knowing that, this legislation starts to look like a last-ditch effort by particular interests, mainly woodchip exporters, to tie up the public native forest resource before their arguments for continued access to the resource evaporate in a decade or so. As with the native forest sawlog industry, it is not easy to see the case for resource security for woodchipping operations based on the forests. Employment in the timber industry has steadily declined since the advent of large-scale woodchipping. From 1965 to 1985, timber off-take increased 40 per cent while employment fell by 40 per cent, due largely to the increasing dominance of woodchipping, which is a capital intensive, value-adding industry. The woodchip industry in Australia currently employs only about people. It might be easier to see the point this legislation if it could be linked directly a credible and firm commitment to make a major value-adding investment in the Australian forest industry sector. While the Minister has tried to link the legislation what North Broken Hill mayor may not do in Tasmania, and what Amcor would probably do anyway in Victoria, no convincing case has been made. The Bill involves a major shift in the balance between the resources and environAustralian ment portfolios in the Commonwealth Government. The power of the Minister for Heritage List. Resources, through his administration of the Act, would be greatly increased at the expense of the environment portfolio. This increase in power is unbalanced and unrealistic. For example, the Act does not expressly require in its terms that one of the designated Ministers must be the Minister for the environment. The Bill is drafted in such a way as to to a situation in which the Resources Minister, as one of the designated Ministers, may veto a legitimate use of a dormant a result Commonwealth decision-making power, as all c;>f the designated Ministers must be satisfied that the use of such a power is in keeping with exceptional circumstances provided the Bill. To make matters worse, there is provision for resolving a dispute between the designated Ministers, leaving the Resources Minister with a stranglehold over The Bill is an assault on the Commonwealth environmental laws for the protection of forest environments. The inclusion in the objects of the proposed Act of the words 'to . . . facilitate the protection and conservation of forest areas of significant environmental, cultural or heritage value' is, quite frankly, a lot of humbug. The Commonwealth environmental legislation enacted over the last 17 years for this purpose, and to some extent successful in achieving it, is to be made much less effective by this Bill. The basic thrust of the Bill is to tie the low hands of the Commonwealth in the exercise of its environmental and heritage powers once 800 resource security has been granted. The of Resources Minister leaves little doubt as to to what is intended when he speaks of the initial assessment as being once and for all for the life of the project and of the Government's guarantee not to use its powers. The Bill aims with to stop the Australian Heritage Commission carrying out its legitimate role in receiving and considering nominations for the National Estate list as there will be little point in continuing that role if areas nominated are subject to resource security and are unable to power receive the benefit of section 30 of the Heritage Commission Act. The same goes for nominations to the World The confining of the Commonwealth's environmental and heritage assessment to a once-only process at inception is intended to prevent a reassessment of resource use in light of changing knowledge and evolving public attitudes. The King Canute thinking behind this legislation is always obvious, but lead nowhere more so than in this feature. The likely abrogation of the Commonwealth's environmental and heritage protection role is of the Bill's requirement that this role be integrated with similar roles performed by the States. A possible interpretation of this requirement of the Bill is that Commonwealth in agencies with environmental and heritage no responsibilities will in many areas cease to have a stance independent of State bodies or cease to make independent assessments based the process. on their own expertise. The Bill prevents the Commonwealth using foreign investment review powers to protect the natural environment where a project has been granted resource security. The Bill appears to prevent the proposed biodiversity convention taking effect in respect of forest areas affected by resource security. The Bill is remarkable in that it moves Government policy in a direction that conflicts publicised initiatives such as the ecologically sustainable development process and the Resource Assessment Commission. The ESD and RAC processes are continuing but, to the extent that they have anything to say about the management of native forests, they are in danger of being made redundant by this Bill. The commitment given by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in his March industry statement, to phase out woodchip exports by the year 2000 is abandoned in this Bill. The Bill is mealy-mouthed and unbelievable on export wood chipping. It says that export woodchips are not goods capable of benefiting from resource security. It then immediately confuses the issue by stating that, where woodchips are produced from residues, export woodchip schemes may get resource security. This is an enormous loophole which would allow every export woodchipping operation in Australia to be granted resource security. Every woodchip operation can be characterised now, or in the future with some minor corporate rearrangements, as being based on residues. All the woodchip operators need to do is acquire an interest in a sawmill drawing from the same region. The Minister in his second reading speech removes any doubt about the direction we are taking when he states that woodchip operations will be permitted past the year 2000 on a case by case basis and that a nonlegislative form of resource security may be granted to an export woodchipping enterprise which also owns a sawmill. The Bill is a minefield of new statutory terms of great significance and untested meanings. Whether the Bill will produce merely local environmental disasters or major catastrophes depends on the meaning of terms such as 'dominant purpose', 'appropriate assessment process', 'reasonable opportunity', 'undue duplication of effort' and 'major physical impact'. This new lexicon of legally charged words would provide at least a decade of expensive and wasteful litigation. It is doubtful whether the Resources Minister intended to promote a whole new field of environmental law and a bonanza for lawyers, but in his enthusiasm that is precisely where with much- he is heading. The Bill seems designed to lock up native forest resources for wood production at a time when large-scale logging of native forests is quickly being made unnecessary by the increasing supply of wood from plantations. The BiIl will also hasten the logging of the remaining old growth forests still under the control of State forestry agencies. They may be committed irrevocably to a wood producer with little or no prospect of that decision being reviewed later when public perceptions of the importance of native forests may have increased greatly. I return to my point that the only real resource security for the forestry industry is that provided by plantations. Other countries are showing us this. In Brazil and South Africa major investment in Australian eucalypt plantations has put them in a position to supply world markets with more eucalypt fibre, and more cheaply, than Australian companies can. These are countries with comparatively low per capita GNP$2,550 in the case of Brazil and $2,460 in the case of South Africa; in each case about one sixth of the Australian per capita GNP. Given the economic circumstances of such countries, we are going to see them strip their forest assets to earn foreign exchange and repay debt. For the next few decades, I doubt that we will be able to compete and therefore there is little to be gained in us encouraging woodchip exporters in Australia. I say therefore that the ambiguity of this Bill in its approach to export woodchip operations is especially regrettable. This is a bad Bill, but it would be less bad if it was amended to state clearly and simply that resource security cannot be granted to woodchipping projects. The exception made for woodchipping projects based on 'residues' should be removed. In conclusion, I reiterate that the only long term resource security for wood based projects is in plantations. We have the cap-tal and we have the land. We have a pressmg need as well, with much of our country in need of tree cover, to arrest salinisation and soil erosion. We have the example in the efforts made by the Western Australian Government and by private investors in that State-I refer to the obvious success of Bunnings Forest Products Pty Ltd with its eucalyptus globulus plantations in Western Australia. With the right mix of government policies, incentives and sensitivity to environmental protection, the next decades should be a period of asset building in the forest sect?r, leading to an era of reat resource secunty based on an adequate and available resource, not the false sense of security the Government is vainly trying to conjure up with this Bill. Australia is possibly the only country that has this capability. I realise that an appeal to the Government or the Opposition to get into the business of asset building rather than asset stripping is pointless, given the scorched - h economic irrationalist approach of both major parties. Nevertheless, within a short time they will be forced by the public to concede. Legislation like this will be seen to be what it is-an irrelevant anachronism to be placed in the 1950's museum suggested by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).",74
286,Mr BURR,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,The saddest part of the Forest Conservation and Development Bill before the House tonight is that it is before the House. If the Government had done the right thing by the Australian community there would be no Bill before the House tonight. But the plain fact is that we do have a Bill supposedly covering resource development projects and the natural resources of Australia because the Government has manipulated the natural resources of Australia and development projects based on those natural resources for its own political expedience.  ment.,78
287,Mr BURR,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"It is a manipUlative government, as my colleague says. But had the Government not manipulated those natural resources and the development projects based on those resources for its own political expedience, we would not have this Bill before us tonight. I think it is necessary for the House to recall the political interventions and the reasons why those political interventions have occurred in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the legislation. We should all recall the Government's blatant intervention over projects such as Wesley Vale and Coronation Hill, and even the Franklin Dam issue. The Government, without any rational reasons based on the economic or even the environmental factors relating to those projects, for blatant political purposes in order to maximise its vote winning appeal in the major centres of Australia, intervened in those projects in· order to gain votes. We are now -.,eing the Government bringing forward legislation in order to retrieve some credibility with the investing community of Australia and around the world. In its blatant quest for votes, the Government totally distorted the confidence of the investing community to be able to bring forward investment capital to any project that proposed to utilise the natural resources of Australia, regardless of whether those natural resources were timber or any other form of resource. The Government is now trying to recover its credibility because the political imperative has moved from one of gaining votes through the environment to one of gaining votes through employment. To be frank, I think the House should identify the blatant expediency of this Government and react accordingly. This Government-this Parliament-should not enact any legislation simply for the expedience of the government in power. Surely the responsibility of this Parliament is to enact legislation that will give certainty and confidence to the people of Australia to be able to make decisions on the law and to' proceed accordingly. But we cannot put legislation on the statute books that simply is there for political expedience. The investing community and the publiof Australia have no idea, regardless of the legislation on the statute books, how the government of the day might react from time to time. Let me just illustrate the expedience of this Government. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), in his second reading speech, stated: It is always possible for governments to grasp short term expedients in the quest for creating jobs. I suggest to the House that the short term expedient that the Minister had in mind was not one of creating jobs; it was one of creating votes, and that short term expedient was not related to this particular Bill. It has been there, inherently involved with this Government, for some considerable time. Earlier speakers, including the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) have spoken of the Richardson factor. All Australia would be well aware of the way in which the former Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, manipulated his portfolio in order to maximise votes for his political party. But surely that is no basis for enacting legislation in this House, or for the way in which any government should conduct its affairs. I believe that as Australian citizens we have a right to expect more from a government that will lay down its philosophy and its principles so that the people of Australia can place their reliance on those principles. That has not been the case with this Government. I believe that what we are seeing tonight is legislation that has been brought forward for blatant political reasons and not because it lays a basis or a foundation in order for development of Australia's natural resources to take place. Let us look at the development processes. The Minister says that if we have this legislation on the statute books it will allow the development of Australia's forest resources to proceed. I am quite sure that in saying that the Minister had in mind the Wesley Vale fiasco, if I can put it in those terms. Surely the intervention we have seen from Senator Richardson and other Ministers of earlier governments is well identified in the Wesley Vale fiasco. The Minister has now brought forward a form of legislation that will supposedly allow a Wesley Vale project or a Maryvale project to proceed. He frames legislation that says any project with a capital value over $100m will have the protection of Commonwealth legislation guaranteeing access to the resource in order for that project to proceed. One should legitimately ask whether that is fair. What about all the small businesses, the small sawmillers? Are we to deny that they too have a right to resources? But this Bill does not cover them, it only covers large projects. Perhaps we are looking after the big business mates of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this legislation. I do not know. I do not know the motivation behind limiting this legislation to projects in excess of $100m. Surely small business has a right to be considered in this sort of legislation? This is not the case in the Bill before the House. I suggest that, if genuine resource security legislation is to be considered by this Parliament, it ought to consider the resource itself and how that resource can be best put to use for the benefit of all Australians. If better value can be made of that resource in the sawmilling industry or in some other form of extractive industry, rather than large pulp or other large project industries, surely that is the way legislation ought to be framed. I am conscious of the fact that the Tasmanian Premier has proposed regional resource security legislation; in other words, that we have resource security legislation that identifies the resource of a region and then provides protection for the best extraction or the best uses of the resources within that region. I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the long term interests of Australia such legislation as proposed by the Tasmanian Premier would be much more beneficial than the legislation we have before the House tonight. I take some of the comments made by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) in conjunction with the second reading speech of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). The Minister states in the second reading speech: This Bill gives force to the Government's clear and unambiguous policy of excluding from eligibility for resource security any project whose dominant pUfpose is the export of logs or woodchips from native forests. If the purpose of this Bill is to exclude all of the resource in native forests, it is logical to presume that the only resource that it covers is in plantations. Effectively, the Minister and the Government are asking developers to go out and develop their own plantations and then have those plantations subjected to Commonwealth legislation before the developer of the plantations can actually use the resource. What absolute humbug! Surely if we are to have legislation on the statute book it must cover public resources and not privately owned resources. I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this measure as it is framed is applicable only to privately developed plantations and not to publicly owned resources. That must be one of the major weaknesses of this legislation. I have no problem with the concept of developing plantations of forests. In fact, I think it ought be encouraged at every opportunity. But to exclude all natural forests from utilisaadministration. tion for development projects is sheer folly, and we ought understand the folly of that proposition. I move on to the administrative processes. One of the features that the Opposition has been very firm on in its attitude, and particularly in the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), is that the authorities responsible for land use management in Australia ought to be the State governments, not the Federal Government. If we accept the proposition embodied in the amendment from the honourable member for Murray, there should be no reason why the Commonwealth should have an intervening power to overrule State governments. But, in fact, the intervening power is absolutely fundamental to this legislation. If that is the case, we ought to ask the question: who is responsible in Australia for land use management? Is it the State governments or is it the Federal Government? If it is, in fact, the Federal Government, why do we duplicate the administration by allowing State governments to have an administrative capacity over land use management? If, on the other hand, we accept the proposition from the honourable member for Murray that State governments ought have the administrative responsibility for land use management, why is there a duplicated Commonwealth administration doing precisely the same thing? I accept the proposition from the honourable member for Murray that it should be the State governments which are primarily responsible for land use management. They have their administration; they are much closer to the situation; they understand the situation much better. But if that is the case we ought to be prepared to withdraw the duplicated Commonwealth administration from doing exactly the same thing. This legislation proposes that, no matter what the States do, it will be duplicated by the Commonwealth. I believe that every taxpayer in Australia should question that principle. Surely it is a waste of taxpayers' money to have the same proposition repeated over and over again by another level of As my colleague the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) pointed out earlier in this debate in relation to the proposed new Wesley Vale project, the Commonwealth on this occasion has said, 'Even if this legislation is passed, before we will give approval we want another inquiry'. As my colleague the honourable member for Braddon has pointed out, in Tasmania we have already had 11 inquiries into the forest industry over a 15-year period. How many inquiries do we need to have in order to understand all of the nuances of that industry? How much more information can be extracted by having another inquiry? Surely this is not a process of trying to protect the natural resources of Australia or of the forest industries of Tasmania. Surely this is merely a process of creating more jobs for more public servants and, in the process, holding up resource development projects such as Wesley Vale for an indefinite period. I believe that the people of Australia had every right to protest at that sort of administration. To underline what I am saying, the Minister says in his second reading speech that this Bill makes: - a provision allowing the Commonwealth to monitor the State's compliance with its obligation to enforce any obligations imposed on the enterprise; What the Minister is saying in this Bill is that he expects the States to set up a watchdog organisation to monitor the developer, but the Commonwealth will set up another watchdog to monitor the States. So the watchdog monitors the watchdog. What absolute humbug! What a waste of taxpayers' money all of that will be. I return to the point that I made earlier. I suggest that, if the development of the natural resources of Australia had not been used for such blatant political purposes, this Bill would not be necessary, In that regard, I have such experts as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to give support to that proposition. I do not often agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, but in this case I am compelled to. We need to remove political interference from the process of resource development. All of us ought to understand that. In the case of Wesley Vale, which I should point out to the House is in my electorate, we must understand that North Broken Hill invested in excess of $20m to develop plans for that project only to be told at the eleventh hour, for obviously blatant political reasons, that it could not proceed. In that climate, how on earth can we encourage investment in this country for any form of development? Compounding the Wesley Vale decision was Coronation Hill, where BHP did almost the identical thing. It expended several millions of dollars improving the resource and the feasibility of that project only to be told at the eleventh hour by the Commonwealth Government that it could not proceed. In both cases the decisions were made for blatant political reasons in order for the Labor Party to maximise its vote winning capacity in the major cities of Australia. I believe that if we are to have genuine resource security legislation and if we are to try to genuinely encourage major companies to develop the resources of this country, the first feature that must be injected into that process by the Labor Party-or by any government at the Commonwealth level-is the withdrawal of political interference. Unless that determination to withdraw political interference is there, there will not be encouragement for the development of the resources of Australia-whether it be Wesley Vale, Coronation Hill or any other major project. I do not believe that determination has been evidenced to date because the mere bringing forward of this Bill means that the Government wants to have two bob each way. The major reason why this Bill is drafted in such a defective way is that the Government has attempted to pacify both the development factions within its Party and the conservation factions. The Government itself must determine whether it wants to have development and job creation or whether it wants to pacify all of the conservation factions within its own Party or within its constituency. I believe very firmly that we must have resource development which is based essentially on State legislation-where the States are given the responsibility for the management of lands under their jurisdiction and Commonwealth legislation is used only to supplement legislation at the State level. I also believe that the administrative procedures should be based largely at the State level and, again, the administrative procedures at the Commonwealth level should be only supplementary to what is happening at State level. Until we do that and until we give the certainty in legislation that it will not be used for manipulative and expedient political purposes, I do not believe we will encourage the investment that we need so desperately in Australia.",78
288,Mr COWAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member for Lyne agrees with the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr). I often agree with the honourable member and he has again spoken a lot of common sense tonight-particularly when he speaks of the States and their responsibilities so far as timber matters are concerned. If one looks at the situation, one will see that Australia is ideally suited so far as the administration of our timber industry and our forestry is concerned. Each of the States of Australia has a very efficient forestry department, with mep who are experienced and know what to do when they are put out in the bush. When I sit here and listen to the debate on the Forest Conservation and Development Bill, which is before the House, I sometimes wonder as to whether there are members of this House who do not understand what a tree is. They seem to feel that once one cuts down a tree and removes it, no matter what one is going to do with it, that is the end of it. It is the end of it in one sense, but it is a renewable resource; this is the important fact. If somebody does not remove it eventually, like the rest of us it will get old and tired, the grubs will get in, it will fall over and it will harm the forest. This is exactly what happens. I remember once going to Daintree with a delegation at the time when that rainforest area was under discussion. We were walking down a passageway to some falls. There was a forestry man with me and as we passed a tree I asked, 'Would that be a cedar tree?'. He said, 'Yes, it is'. It was a lovely tree. I said, 'What would be the value of that tree?'. He said, 'Between approximately $12,000 and $14,000'. I said, 'Why don't you remove it, because you are removing some tracts of trees?'. He said, 'It's not worthwhile; it's too old. It's going fozy; it's of no good to anybody'. So I said, 'That tree will fall over and damage the canopy of this rainforest area', and he said, 'Certainly, that is what will happen'. So that is just one tree of hundreds of thousands of trees in our forests today that will eventually be allowed to fall over and harm the forests and the neighbouring trees. I want to look at the history of forestry in New South Wales-I assume it is the same in every State of Australia. I was in the Parliament when we brought in the legislation to form national parks. We brought out Dr MCMichael from the United States of America and he guided us, drawing on his experience. Lovely areas of New South Wales were set aside for the public and for tourism. In most of those areas, people could not go in and mine or cut timber; this was always an issue. To those areas today have been added the heritage areas and to those areas have been added-by governments within that Statelarge areas of native forest hardwood land. We have now reached a situation where those little mills that the honourable member for Lyons was talking about-and I have lots of them in my electorate; they are much depleted now compared with what they were-are dependent upon a licence from forestry to cut timber. I instance Duncan's Holdings which has three large mills in my electorate and employs approximately 100 or more people. It has $30m invested in the industry. I spoke to the manager this afternoon and he said that the quality of the timber which is coming into the mill today is extremely poor. I asked why that was. He said it was simply because of the fact that the timber is not there; the Forestry Commission is not allowed to go into particular areas. Twenty thousand hectares of land with excellent timber on it has been taken away. He said that the Forestry Commission had to scratch-that was his wordin order to 'get the mill sufficient timber, often of poor quality, to enable us to keep our people employed and supply the markets that we have'. I suggest that some of the markets that it has today are not receiving the quality sawn timber that they should, simply because got that mill, like many other mills throughout the countryside, is not receiving the quality logs that it should be receiving. So it is I ask: do people know what a tree is? More trees are being grown in this country of ours than we have ever known-on the farmlets and on the properties. I am a great tree grower myself. I find it is hard to grow them at times if rabbits, hares or birds sit on them and break the tops off. These are the sorts of problems one has. One has to cultivate them properly and know what one is doing. But our forestry departments-particularly in my State of New South Wales-are going in for reafforestation programs which will ensure that this resource is available. Timber was once a great export for this country. It has been said before in debate in this House that today we have $2,000m worth of imported timber products coming into Australia. People should have a look at a map of Australia and see the wonderful soil we have on our eastern slopes and tablelandscountry which is adaptable to growing hardwoods and softwoods. Yet we are exporting only $500m worth of timber per year. We are buying timber from countries such as Borneo, Malaysia and others which the environmentalists say have to stop their clearfelling. But what are we doing? We are helping them; we are buying their timber and bringing it into Australia because we have to have it. This is a pretty poor situation when you come to think about it, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not think these issues have been raised in this debate before. These are the hidden factors behind this very legislation we are talking about here. I have said that I agree with the honourable member for Lyons: I do not mind the Commonwealth seeking reciprocal agreements with the States on environmental matters-for sure; I think that is a necessary thing. The legislative responsibility, the administration of these forests, should be left with the people who know what they are doing. We should not interfere with them. We will build a bureaucracy. And the bureaucrats love this. This country is becoming endangered today by governments which frequently impose regulations and restrictions upon people. Elderly people who have served their lifetime working and who want to retire have to contend with assets tests, social security tests and all the problems of being a superannuant, such as with taxation problems. Some of these problems are driving these people to their graves. Business people and sawmillers in this country want to employ staff. When I was a young fellow, if people wanted to leave their dairy farms-I am sure that both the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), representing electorates that are similar to mine, would agree with methey got a job in the forest with the forestry department or with a private contractor or they got a job in the local mill. Honourable members should look around the countryside today. I know the millers in my electorate. I know the product they tum out. I am concerned about them because I know the dangers and worries that this Government is putting them through. I hope that we never put them through those dangers. If we do, I do not want to be a part of it. If Government members look at our GST package, they will see that we are breaking down some of the taxes, regulations and impositions that have been placed upon the average Australian. Do we expect them to react? Do we expect to get confidence into the farmer, into the landowners, into the forestry sector, into the millers, while this sort of a situation exists? Those are the factors that I want to speak about tonight. I think there are people who do not understand what forestry is. There are people who do not understand what a tree is. From what I have heard, some honourable members on the Government side would not know that to get out of a shower of rain they have to stand beneath a tree. This is the true situation. They would not know to go and stand beneath a tree to get out· of the rain. That is a typical Australian thing; that is what we do. The other night the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) came into this House and told us that $2.5 billion of taxpayers' money was to go to kick start the economy. If he wants to kick start the economy, he has $4.5 billion or $5 billion-$5,OOO million--that can be invested in the timber industry in processing plants. And people are wanting to spend that money to employ Australians and to increase our exports. We have Wesley Vale and Coronation Hill and all these things. We have talked about a pulping plant or a chipping plant in the Clarence River valley on the north coast of New South Wales. We have timber resources all along our coast, timber that will never be used for anything else. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) might smile, but he might not be smiling at what I am saying. He and I had discussions about the chipping industry about a year ago-I am not blaming him for this-when people on private properties located below 18 degrees latitude, which is covered by State legislation, did not have to get approval to clear the land. Those people wanted to clear the land and to put in pasture. The person who was going to do the chipping-I assumed the same thing applies today-had to get approval frotp the State and the Commonwealth. At that stage I think the Minister advised me that the State was keeping matters back, and he was probably correct. But look at the duplication of these things. What does a landowner do? If I had some land and I wanted to clear some timber to put in some rye, clover, phalaris or something else-it has to be put in in the rainy seasonI would put a match to the timber and bum it. That would be the sensible thing to do. If the landowner could get approval, he could sell the timber. It would represent part of our exports, it would represent income to the processor and to the owner of the land. Now we have before this Parliament legislation that will affect, as members of the timber industry said the other day, 6,000 workers who they might as well put off. We have a Prime Minister saying that he will inject $2.5 billion of our money to kick-start the economy. If the Government wants to kick-start the economy, it should encourage the person who works the farm or the soil to start that process. If the Government encourages the resource industry and encourages the manufacturer, it will kick-start the economy of this country; there is no doubt about that. The economy will start to pick up, but it will not start under the rules that we have at the moment. I will not deal with this $100m, because I have made myself quite clear. I do not favour the legislation at all. I do not think it is necessary. It is impinging upon the responsibility of the States, and I will jealously guard the sovereignty of the States while ever I am in this place. The States are getting downtrodden under the federal system that we have in place. It hurts me to think that this occurring in a country with the great resources that we have. Is it not a calamity to see one million people out of work in a nation that has the resources of people, of soil, of iron ore and other things that we have and to see that we cannot employ another one million people, mostly young Australians, who cannot get a job? Mr Tim Fischer-Under 25.",81
289,Mr COWAN,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Yes. I think the figure for people aged under 25 years who are unable to get a job is 36 per cent. The other day I had a visit from Dr Russell Reeves and Mr Andrew Greig from Dungog in my electorate. They came to see me because they have been writing to me about the use of ethanol. I have written to the Minister for Resources concerning this matter, and I know that he is giving the matter consideration. Ethanol is a product that can be gained not only from sugar cane but also from timber resource. It can be gained from that resource that is wasted. In a forest, trees will grow naturally; they do not always have to be planted. The seeds from the trees will drop and the seedlings will come up from the forest floor. But the seedlings have to be thinned out every now and then, and the forestry department can do that. When the trees are thinned out, a terrific amount of the timber, eucalypts and the like, will be wasted. Ethanol can come from the wastes of the forest. I am pleased to say that, only recently in the 1992 Energy Challenge, ethanol proved to be the lowest of the greenhouse gas indexed products. Ethanol was used with 15 per cent diesel fuel. The people who entered that mixture won the competition, the prize for which I believe was travel between Sydney and Canberra. I would like to say many things that will commend the use of ethanol as an altemative base for fuel, which will not put extra carbon dioxide into the air. It is a cleaner product. It fits in adequately to the environmental measures that we should take. Therefore, I would request the Minister for Resources-I will be writing to him soon-to have his department look very closely at the fuel mixture which won the Energy Challenge the is other day, which he might possibly be aware of, and to make sure that his department is aware that there is a cheap product that can be provided from the timber which is thinned out in the forests, is wasted and is rotting on the forest floor. I am sure there is plenty of this resource available to make ethanol. I mention, yet again, that years ago when I was in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly I took a private trip to England, Scotland and Germany to look at private forestry. I believed that there are many areas of Australia in which we could encourage landowners to grow trees. For the first few years, the forestry department could give some direction as to the planting of trees and it could also have some say as to when the trees would be harvested. It could give guidance in the cultivation, thinning, et cetera, of the trees over the years. When I returned from my visit, the National Party in New South Wales put up a proposition that was carried as policy for years, that we encourage private landowners, where it was suitable to do so, on the eastern slopes of the New England Tablelands and various other parts of Australia to grow trees that could give some return. They need not be a hardwood, because a hardwood takes about 70 or 80 years to grow; a softwood takes much less time than that. People are utilising land and they are getting some return, because they can continue to graze their stock on these areas whilst ever these trees are growing. But, of course, it was necessary to get some agreement with the Commonwealth because, if we want to encourage Australians to do something, the best way to encourage them is to give them a taxation concession for what they are doing. If we want to kick start Australia, I would give a taxation concession to people to grow trees. We are being sensible then; to utilise soil that we have got. It is not costing us anything, but we are inclined to forget about that. This is a practical measure that we can take in this great country of ours that is going to give returns; to employ people; to build up exports-add valuable balance of payments that we talk about so much. One could go on and on. But the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who has just come in, made an excellent speech, along with the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Gippsland, in this House today. I just want to give my support, along with theirs. We should not need the legislation. We should not have to have an amendment, but we are forced to. I do not believe that the Government wants the legislation to be passed. I am sure that the honourable member for Braddon and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) agreed with the Minister this afternoon when the honourable member for Denison said, 'Yes, it is political. It is political'. That is exactly what the honourable member for Denison said. So the Government does not want the legislation to go through. It does not want the Wesley Vale pulp mill at any cost, and so it wants to blame the Opposition: our good Tasmanian friends' honest attempt to build up their little island, which is a treasure to them and a treasure so far as this Commonwealth is concerned. The timber industry should certainly be assisted. I fully support the amendment that is presently before the House.",84
290,Mr GRIFFITHS,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"On 29 November 1991 I introduced the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1991, which is, obviously, now before the House again. When introducing this Bill, I thought there may be some prospect that the House would hear rational debate on what is clearly one of the more significant issues of public policy facing Australia's forest industries. Just to put that in some context, we are talking, in the wider purview, of an industry that is our second largest manufacturing industry. If we look at our current account difficulties-they are obviously one of the key public policy issues before this country-we see that about 10 per cent of our current account deficit is a consequence of the importation of timber and paper products that I assert, I think with some degree of authority, can properly be developed in this country. Having witnessed the contribution of the Opposition, it is clear to me that the opportunity for a degree of rational debate has been lost. When I introduced the legislation, I wrote to the relevant Opposition shadow Ministers informing them that, whilst the objects of the legislation were, in my view, quite straightforward, the Bill itself is quite complex. There is no question about that. Because of this, I extended to my Opposition colleagues an invitation to meet and discuss the legislation prior to the second reading debate. That opportunity was not taken up. There were timing difficulties and so on but, given the importance of the matter, I would have thought that it was incumbent upon the Opposition to take the opportunity to have a detailed discussion on the basic tenants and the fine detail",85
291,Mr LLOYD,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,We did offer some dates.,86
292,Mr GRIFFITHS,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"Well, I was always, as the honourable member knows, quite prepared to meet. We had a brief informal discussion, obviously not a discussion that would substitute for a proper and considered debate. But in any event, towards the end of the relevant period, the Opposition shadow Ministry met and determined its current position. One of the problems that have emanated from this lack of embracing of opportunity by the Opposition is a quite ill-informed debate on what I think is an issue of national significance. I should also say that I am aware that it was not all plain sailing in the Opposition shadow Ministry. There is obviously a clear split in the shadow Ministry, and one can only speculate on why that came to pass. In terms of my own view on these issues, I think it is largely a function of the pursuit of this thing called 'product differentiation'. I think it is also in some respects in pursuit of the sort of political opportunism that we witnessed in Tasmania when Mr Gray tried to gamer short term political capital by using people in the industry as political final analysis he paid a very significant penalty for that. Notwithstanding the facade or the apparent intent of the Opposition to help support the building of a new world scale pulp mill in Tasmania-that issue has been supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) and, I suspect, by about half the shadow front bench and half of its Caucuswhen this legislation is opposed in the Senate, that will be the nail in the coffin of any chance of building that world scale pulp mill. It is not good enough, of course, for the Opposition to assert, without any foundation whatsoever, that the Government does not want the legislation to pass. The acid test of that assertion is what will transpire in the Senate. Mr Mack interjecting",86
293,Mr GRIFFITHS,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"I can guarantee that the legislation will be given the full support of all government senators in the Senate and providing the Opposition equally offers up itsupport for the legislation, it will be passed. Consequently, the pulp mill in northern Tasmania, and also the possibility of an expansion of the Maryvale mill in GippslandMr Mack interjecting",86
294,Mr GRIFFITHS,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"And a number of other value-adding initiatives, will go ahead. Those sorts of interjections reflect very badly on the honourable member who has made them. The Australian people can sit back very soon and make a judgment. The Government has put forward legislation that is worked on now in , c-ncert w-th the States and with industry, ' With all the processes within the Government. !t has brought this legislation a very long way mdeed, and at the death knock the Opposition seeks to oppose it. Why is the Opposition doing that? Why is the Opposition forsaking the national interest? It is for short tenn political expediency. Why will the Opposition not allow-because it is in,the Opposition's gift-the Tasmanian pulp mIll to proceed with the consequential impact on job opportunities, our current account tools. In the position and so on? - ere is only one reason why the OppOSItion would forsake the national interestwhilst always, at every opportunity, wrapping itself in a cloak of national interest-and that is, it believes there will be a short term political gain by adopting that position. That is why the shadow Ministry is split on the issue and that is why the local members concerned have, in the past, offered their private counsel in support of the legislation. Mr RiggaU-That is not true. Mr GRlFFITHS-I am not referring to the honourable member for MCMillan but I am referring to others. There is a split and there is nothing unusual about that, but I think people ought to have the integrity of their positions, particularly when it is their constituents that they are talking about. They ought to be able to come into this chamber and tell the truth. It has not happened on this occasion. I think it reflects very badly on those who are in that position. In terms of the issue here, what we are talking about is a decision by the Opposition because it disputes or opposes legislation at the margin to throw the baby out with the bath water and to oppose the very legislation that will be a condition precedent to the establishment of very large scale employment opportunities in this country. The honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Riggall) is shaking his head. Those are not my words, of course; they are the words of the companies concerned. The North Broken Hill company, which would build the Tasmanian pulp mill, issued a press statement last week urging the Opposition to support the passage of the legislation. And for what reason? I quote: This would be a significant step forward in the advancement of this nationally important project. That is not me saying that; it is the proponents of the pulp mill. North Broken Hill went on to say: The industry is totally unified that if there is to be a pulp mill in Tasmania both the Government and the Opposition must support the current legislation. So there we have it. The Opposition would block legislation which is a condition precedent to the establishment of that mill, and the Opposition is reneging on its commitment, given on so many occasions in the past, to facilitate the development of that pulp mill. Why? For short term political gain-product differentiation, if you like. In its so doing, there is an abdication of any semblance, I think, of responsibility on this issue. But there is more-I think much morewhich shows that the Opposition is out of step with the industry and, I should say, with the Australian community on this matter. I make these points about the industry's reaction to this issue. In March last year the National Association of Forest Industries said: The role of the Federal Opposition in this debate has been a bit ambivalent. NAFI goes on to say: The Opposition has been very quick to castigate the Government for the things it has done to the industry in the past, but it has been slow in putting their own cards on the table. I further quote: NAFI met with Doctor Hewson and had numerous discussions with Opposition parliamentarians. It is considered most unlikely that they would oppose legislation when it is put forward by the Government in the House. Well, things have changed, have they not? Either NAFI got it wrong or the Opposition put itself in a position where it misled the premier organisation representing this industry. In December last year North Broken Hill, the company intending to build the northern Tasmanian pulp mill, said: I would like to express our appreciation of the considerable effort of the Government in achieving significant progress towards ensuring the future of this vitally important industry. Again, in opposing the legislation, the Opposition is prepared to forsake the national interest. But there is more. On 23 December last year, Australian Paper Manufacturers, the company intending to invest approximately $850m in an expansion of its Maryvale plant, said: We accept the involvement of the Federal Governmentunlike my colleague the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan)and the concept of resource security. We will work with the Victorian and Federal governments and the National Association of Forest Industries to reach appropriate guarantees through legislation. To cap it all, North Broken Hill wrote to the Government on 25 February 1992. I believe it also wrote to the Opposition contemporaneously. It said: In relation to the proposed resource security legislation currently before the House, we would urge that this legislation progress as rapidly as is possible, as it is our opinion that this will provide an immediate signal to potential partners of the willingness of the Federal Government to create the necessary environment to allow the development of this nationally important project. North Broken Hill confirmed today that the revised depreciation regime announced in the Government's One Nation package meets its requirements for the Wesley Vale or northern Tasmanian mill. That is, the company that would build a world scale pulp mill in that part of Tasmania says that the Government's announced depreciation arrangements meet with its approval and will justify that part of its decision making process. The Opposition is still opposing its passage and, in so opposing, is obviating any potential employment prospects. I do not ask this question lightly, but it must be asked: is the Leader of the Opposition trying to marshal a capital strike at the expense of the national interest? The Leader of the Opposition has instructed his colleagues to oppose this legislation and, in doing so, he is adopting what I consider to be a duplicitous position of now opposing the Wesley Vale pulp mill, one that he said he would help to build but now he is guaranteeing cannot proceed. In terms of the industry, there is no doubt whatsoever that the Opposition has offered counsel to sections of the industry in the leadup to the One Nation package in an attempt to have it indicate that it would not proceed. That is, an important part of manufacturing industry in this country has been offered counsel by the Opposition to embrace a more political stance and so damage the very confidence that this country so obviously needs in terms of its economic circumstances. I regard that with utter contempt. Mr Downer-Assuming what you say is true, which it isn't.",86
295,Mr GRIFFITHS,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"I am sufficiently well informed on what goes on in the industry, and I do not have a record of coming into this chamber embracing mere speculation. I;:or my own part, I am quite satisfied that that infamous behaviour has transpired. It has not met with success, but I think people are entitled to question the motives of the Opposition in terms of how it has related to the industry and to particular people within that industry. As to the new Tasmanian Premier, a former member of this House, Premier Groom, I would like to know how he feels tonight with the Opposition in effect pulling the plug on one of the keyMr Downer-Why don't you ask him?",88
296,Mr GRIFFITHS,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"In fact, tomorrow I will have the opportunity of speaking with his Minister, who is coming here for just that purpose. He will be offering his counsel, I am sure, seeking the Government's support-an imprimatur to the legislation. At least one of the Liberal Party's State governments is significantly out of kilter with the Opposition's current position. I must say again, without wishing to make any points about this, that there is time to change and if anyone in the Opposition seriously regards the future of employment prospects in Tasmania and the issue of our current account as something that needs addressing, there is time, and responsibility would dictate that the Opposition meet and change that position prior to the matter coming into the Senate. What are the Opposition's major concerns with the legislation? As I understand it, they are fourfold. They are: firstly, the legislation should be project specific rather than umbrella in nature; secondly, the legislation should be tightened up to further limit the opportunity for governments to revisit resource access issues in the case of unforeseen circumstances; thirdly, the compensation provision should be removed from the Bill and wood compensation arrangements provided through intergovernmental agreements; and, finally, legislative resource security should be available for regionally based investment programs which do not meet the $100m eligibility threshold. Let me take each of these issues in turn. The first is the project specific or the current umbrella legislation issue. The Bill is umbrella legislation which will set a consistent and comprehensive framework for considering resource security for all major forest based investment projects. It avoids the need for separate legislation for every single project, for goodness sake! Rather, the detailed terms and conditions of each project will be contained in separate agreements between the Commonwealth and respective State governments, and these agreements will have the backing of the legislation. So in a practical sense, project specific legislation would result in a similar outcome but, importantly, would result in additional time delays whilst legislation was prepared and debated in the House for each new investment project, which could take :up two years for each case. Clearly, project specific legislation is not an administratively efficient option. In respect of unforeseen circumstances, once resource security has been granted to a project, the conditions under which resource security could be revisited are defined very strictly in the Bill. It can occur only in specified exceptional circumstances, such as the discovery of an endangered species, and the legislation requires all parties to undertake extensive consultations before any decision is made which could affect the availability of resources. In other words, access to resources would be withdrawn only as a last resort after all other avenues have .been exhausted. It is difficult to see how the Opposition could tighten these provisions, short of ruling out unforeseen circumstances for the life of each project, which, after all, could amount to 25 to 30 years. So clearly, no responsible government would make such a commitment. In terms of compensation, the Government believes that there are adequate provisions in the approaches outlined in the Bill to ensure that, even in the unlikely event of resource withdrawal, security of resources available to projects could be maintained. That has been adequately canvassed by previous speakers. There is also the issue of the Toronto Dominion Bank letter, allegedly asserting that that bank would not lend and did not find the legislation to be 'bankable'. My own view about that is that that letter had a highly partisan author, someone who has stepped outside the normal process of professional banking to engage in a partisan debate. Why do I assert that? The Australian Bankers Association, the premier organisation in this country representing all banks, has indicated that it certainly does not take the same view. I conclude by indicating that the Opposition will have very little time to reflect on its current position. In this game people are entitled to adopt a politically partisan or political position-they are entitled to put their own spin on issues-but I think it is very important for this House that the Opposition shadow Ministry meet to determine whether or not it likes the legislation at the margin, because the majority of the Opposition has been prepared to accept this as a genuine attempt, even if it does not embrace the fine detail. That is certainly the view of the industry and the relevant companies concerned. The Opposition has the opportunity of allowing employment opportunities to proceed in Tasmania, of allowing worldscale developments in this industry, and that opportunity will be presented in the Senate. The Government does not accept the amendment. (Time expired) Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Lloyd's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided.

297,Mr ROCHER,PAIRS NOES,"The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) in his summing up, in the belief that no-one would contest what he had to say, indulged himself in a great deal of drivel, particularly in his opening remarks about the position of the Opposition and how it arrived at its decision. The Minister obviously cannot accept that unlike the Australian Labor Party there are no factions in the coalition and that when we arrive at our ultimate decisions on legislation, policy or on any other matter after healthy discussion, but without the firm arm of the New South Wales Right or the loopy Left from Victoria or Western Australia, we do so honestly. We, as exhibited in healthy debate on this legislation, very clearly put our position on the legislation and it was indeed a coherent exposition on the part of the speakers who led on behalf of the coalition. The Minister falls short of his claims about division in the coalition. It is wishful thinking on his part and in resorting to the Wesley Vale project he conveniently overlooked the Richardson factor, as we understood it in 1989, and the mere fact that is not a goer at this moment has nothing to do with this legislation, but everything to do with pandering to special interest groups, with an election in mind, by the then relevant Minister, Senator Richardson. Let us not fall for the garbage heaped upon us by the Minister when he thought there would be no response. PAIRS Nothing has changed with the Government and the Labor Party generally. The coalition does not back factional deals, but the Minister is bound by them. There is no better example of that than his ascension to the Cabinet. He did a deal to back the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and was ultimately and entirely disloyal to the former Prime Minister-a fellow Victorian- Mr Hawke, in that. However, that was par for the course and went almost unnoticed among the acolytes in the Labor Party and in the press generally. When the Minister talks about splits in the coalition, he is delving the depths and is indulging in wishful thinking. One thing we can say about the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia is that we do not and have not set out to foster the interests of some minority or interest group at the expense of others. A great part of the so-called case made by the Minister in favour of this legislation and many speakers on the Government side was a preferred position of a large company, North Broken Hill. If ever one needed further evidence of this Government's pandering to big business, this is it. We all know about the Government's relationship with big unions, its but that is another example of relationship to big business. The Government is prepared to come along and support an interest group-in this case a large company with a particular point of view which is respected but not accepted by the Opposition-at the expense of others, no matter what it means for the future and no matter what it means for others who want to indulge in farming, exploiting and developing our natural resources. But, above all, the Minister conveniently overlooks-and it is not surprising, I guess-that the coalition set out clearly the terms on which it would support this legislation. We proposed an amendment which, if accepted, would have meant that the legislation would have had the support of the coalition parties. The Government chooses to ignore that and to treat with contempt the offers of cooperation and support that we have proffered. Indeed, the Minister himself used that word, as well as the word 'duplicitous' which he heard the Prime Minister use today at Question Time and thought was a pretty good word. The Minister for Resources has spumed bipartisanship. He deserves the condemnation of not only this House and the Opposition but also people who want to benefit from sensible resource legislation. The Minister has thrown away that opportunity tonight. He is the one to be condemned. I would not be surprised if the Minister is back here in the not too distant future saying, 'Please accept now what you said you would accept in the first place'. Minister, we will be condescending enough to accept it then; come along, make the offer and we will be very agreeable.",91
298,Mr RIG GALL,PAIRS NOES,"MCMillan) (10.11 p.m.)I am extraordinarily disappointed in the response given by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) in this debate. A genuine effort was made on this side of the House to accommodate and facilitate a bipartisan approach to get resource security up. But what did the Minister do? He kicked sand in our eyes and said that we were playing cheap party politics. Since I arrived in this House I have been working to get genuine investment in the industry. I was terribly disappointed when the Minister-who comes from my electorate, has his roots embedded in my electorate and understands the industry-said quite clearly that the bipartisan approach was not there, was not available and that the factional deal he was able to stitch up was the best effort he could do. He also threw the challenge to me across the bench by saying, 'Come down for the next 12 months and fight me on this issue within the electorate'. I welcome him to do that because, quite clearly, he is overlooking the interests of the timber industry and the interests of decent resource security. The truth is that the timber industry is a long term investment. Let us consider the 1939 fires and the regrowth area. Fifty years ago that area was devastated by fire, yet today it is coming on-stream. In the context of gov""ernment, that means eight Federal governments from the day a tree is first planted to the day it is harvested. The industry has had to put up with such a potpourri of mismanagement and political shenanigans going on that it appals me that, with this golden opportunity the Minister has hadwith a change of Prime Minister, a change of direction and the Government espousing a revitalisation of the Australian economy-the best he can come up with is something that will not create jobs for the expansion of APM and will not create jobs in the small mills in my area. The legislation is not supported by the union movement; that is, by the Minister's own backers in my electorate. They are against it and they want modification to it. The management wants modification to it; the workers want modification to it; and the contractors want modification to it. The small mills have been totally isolated and they are looking for a fair deal. The Minister has totally missed the point. That is a tragedy because I know personally that he does not feel that way. He has a personal point of view which cares for that particular area but he is not able to step that one pace forward to give a little bit of resource security and to give jobs which are desperately needed when about 35 per cent of the youth in the area are unemployed. Those people are wanting jobs, they are wanting expansion and the spin-off from investment. But it is not there. In the Minister's reply in this House a few minutes ago, I noticed that he concentrated on Wesley Vale. There was a pious attempt to shift the concentration away from Gippsland towards the Tasmanian situation, where undoubtedly he has had a modicum of support from the APPM proposal in that area. But he is grasping at straws because even there he has misrepresented the situation. If we pass this"" Bill there is no guarantee that the mill will go ahead tomorrow. Quite the reverse: the industry wants other guarantees as well as accelerated depreciation. Also, at that stage it wants to look at the international market and find out whether this is the time to build a modem pulp mill. Quite clearly, if one listens to the industry, it is not so. The world opportunity for the market was back at the time of the last election when a consortium was put together which wanted to invest and create jobs in the hardwood forests of Tasmania. What happened? The Government played politics. It brought in the Richardson effect-damn to jobs; damn to the people of Tasmania; damn to the people of my electorate. It just played some sort of tin god with their lives. What the Government has done is totally reprehensible because the truth is that we are looking for genuine long term investment without the predatory approach and the pandering of this Government to minority green groups. At the last election the Richardson factor quite clearly said, 'If you vote Democrat first, vote for us second'. Why? It was because the Government's position was not sustainable. It was playing politics with people's lives and saying, 'Vote for us second' as some sort of subtle selling out for the cheapest political reasons. The Government was totally condemned by the 5,000 people who demonstrated in my electorate-to the point where it lost a Government Whip; a member of the Government for the previous 10 years was voted out because of the hypocrisy of the decision at that time. In September 1990, we had 300 trucks with 2,500 people coming largely from Gippsland but also from the forests of New South Wales. Once again, these people were saying quite clearly, 'Give us a fair go; let invest in this resource without a predatory approach'. After about two years this is the best the Government can come up with: a half-baked resource security legislation by name and environmental guerilla warfare by nature. There is no resource security in this legislation. The kindest thing one can say about it is that the Government is trying to say, 'We would like you to invest in the industry. We don't give you any guarantees. We don't say that, if you invest in the industry and we find a rare species or endangered species there, we'll offer you compensation if we withdraw that resource security from you'. There are no guarantees from the Government; nothing at all. The Government is saying to the industry, 'Just put your money in and trust us'. Why would anyone trust this Government which has played the most appalling games with people's livelihoods? There are people right now who would invest in new trucks worth $100,000. 'These are family businesses that have been putting off buying one for five years and patching up the old truck because there is no confidence in the industry. These people want to create jobs, not only in the timber industry but also in the manufacturing industry and the service industries. They want to put in new investment. They are sick and tired of running around with old bulldozers and old trucks, but they are not game to invest in this industry. Many of them have been in the industry for many generations-they have been custodians of the forest for over 100 years-but they are not game to let their children follow in their footsteps because of the political football the Government has made out of resource security and the environment. What would happen today in a national park if the old trees became diseased or if we got blackberries and other non-native and exotic species in there? What would happen if foxes and wildcats got in there? How would the Government manage that area today? If the recommendation by the professionals was to clear-fell it and bring it back to some sort of lively forest, some sort of area we could be us proud of, the Government could not manage it. It'has played politics with people's lives for too long. The Government is locked up in this preservation mentality. It has been a sob-off to the Green movement, to those people who do not understand the forest industry, to those people who do not understand that this industry can be environmentally friendly, to this industry which quite clearly has an 80-year rotation, quite beyond this Government. This Government is not capable of bringing in legislation that genuinely lets people invest in the forests. The tragedy of that will be felt by the Government right now. The real tragedy is that the backlash against the Green movement will be such that the Government could very well make the wrong decisions. It could go overboard. That would be a tragedy. I saw the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), from Tasmania-the 'menace' I nearly called him; perhaps that is a more accurate description-piously stand here and say that we are against looking after the environment. That is a load of rubbish. It was a great performance and he should be on the stage. ",92
299,Mr RIGGALL,PAIRS NOES,"LA Law would do him very well. Obviously, he has forgotten his profession at the bar, because he did not even read our proposal. We said quite clearly that we wished to look after the environment. But we do not have a protectionist view. We do not have a lock-up mentality. We have a responsibility to look after the resource and its management wisely in not only today's generation but the next one and the next one-and it is not about making cheap political points; it is about looking after the environment in a sensible manner. I had hoped that today we would have the golden opportunity to move from the festering sore of the Richardson form of politics into a realistic bipartisan approach-a golden opportunity to send this nation forward with genuine investment in the nation, genuinely looking after the environment and genuinely helping the wealth creators of this nation to get on with the job. That has not been the case. The Government would prefer to have another case with Wesley Vale. Instead of coming to a bipartisan agreement on this, when there is a window of opportunity for investment it wants to make sure that that investment goes to the forests of Asia, or South America, or somewhere else-anywhere but in Australia-because it is too difficult to make a reasonable decision. That is totally irresponsible, because the governments of many of those countries do not have the environmental responsibility that we have in Australia. They do not have the resources to look after the environment that we have in Australia. Consequently, we are shutting our eyes and shifting our responsibility onto our near neighbours, the Third World countries, and saying, 'We don't care what you do with the environment, but we have looked after Australia's environment' - the most arrogant, irresponsible action of anybody. We talk about thinking globally and acting locally. That is the environmentalist position. It is a good one. It is one that I support. We ought to take responsibility for our forests in the environment that we have. We can do it responsibly and sensibly. We can transfer gradually away from the public forests into plantations. Given the industry'S 50to 80year rotation, that is something that ought to be done. But nowhere do we see this and nowhere do we see the encouragement for this. What we see is the continuation of what we have had for the last 10 or 20 years: the guerilla warfare that has gone on between two groups-no genuine approach to find a set of guidelines that would take over the mishmash of legislation and argument that we have before us; no genuine attempt to come to a responsible decision that would allow this country to get on with investment and wise usage of the resource in the interest of our children. I condemn the Minister for his actions and for his speech.",94
300,Mr GRIFFITHS,PAIRS NOES,"in reply-Opposition members have brought a lot of passion but very little conviction to the debate this evening. They are hoist on their own petard. They talk about the Government's position. They disclaim the accusation that they are acting in a highly political way in relation to this legislation. The honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Riggall) should stay and listen. His constituents have a major interest in this issue and the honourable member for MCMillan should not just tum his back and walk away from the people in his electorate, whom he alleges he has great concern about. The honourable member for MCMillan is walking out. What a disgrace. Tonight the Tasmanian Liberal Party Government condemned the Federal coalition's opposition to this legislation. A press release put out tonight said: In his strongest criticism of the Coalition stand to date, Premier Ray Groom said today he did not want ""politicking"" to determine the fate of the important legislation. He went on to say: ""I don't mind sayingthis is the Liberal Premier of TasmaniaI want the Coalition in Canberra to support the legislation",94
301,Mr KERR,PAIRS NOES,What did he say?,95
302,Mr GRIFFITHS,PAIRS NOES,"Honourable members are entitled to be shocked when they listen to the cant and the hypocrisy on the other side of the House. By way of example, the honourable member for MCMillan clearly has read neither the legislation nor the speech I made in this House. Mr Riggall-I read them both thoroughly. MrGRIFFITHS-Then the honourable member would know that in terms of plantation issues that is a theme of the legislation. But in his contribution here a moment ago he not only implied but showed that he is absolutely ignorant about that part of the legislation. One of the features of the legislation in terms of compensation is that it provides a sufficient buffer zone in a particular catchment area to ensure that, if resources were withdrawn-and only in very limited, but proper, circumstances in which there was a genuine case of endangered species being put at risk-this Government would not say that for a 25or 30-year period we would give any company in this country unadulterated access to any section of forest without that one significant caveat. Opposition members can laugh that off. The great irony is that the companies concerned fully accept that proposition. They understand that there is a buffer zone established in the legislation so that in the event of a resource being withdrawn there is an alternative resource available. The companies understand that and the National Association of Forest Industries understands that, but members of the Opposition apparently do not. Debate interrupted. NA",95
303,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order. It being 10.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted. I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Staples-I require the question to be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. NA DEVELOPMENT BILL 1991 Third Reading Debate resumed.",95
304,Mr GRIFFITHS,FOREST CONSERVATION AND,"On a whole range of issues the Opposition, in the course of this debate, has shown either an apparent ignorance of legislation or a deliberate design to mislead and to confuse. The Opposition is in a very difficult position. As I have indicated, its opposition colleagues in Tasmania-the Premier of the State, no less-have described their approach as politicking. The Premier of the State of Tasmania has indicated that he wants the Opposition to support this legislation. For goodness sake, every member representing any of the constituencies in Tasmania also knows that it is proper to proceed. Opposition members are entitled to have some difference of opinion at the margin. Hardly a piece of legislation goes through this House where members from either side of this chamber would not argue that it is not 100 per cent what they want. But the representative organisation for the forestry industry has indicated in no uncertain terms that it wants the legislation passed; the companies have indicated in no uncertain terms that they want the legislation passed; the ACTU has indicated that it wants the legislation passed; the workers in the industry have indicated that they want the legislation passed; and the Premier of Tasmania, a member of the Opposition's political sister party, has accused the Opposition of politicking and has indicated that he wants the legislation passed. The Minister responsible will be here tomorrow to discuss with me his concern to ensure that the legislation is passed. At the end of the day the Opposition takes the view that at the margin-and it is at the margin-it disagrees with the Government's approach in terms of providing a degree of certainty to small sawmills and that associated end of the industry which, after all, is the biggest employing section of the industry. The Opposition allegedly takes the view that the legislation is not strong enough. It does not understand-if it does understand it is even worse, of course-what I indicated in the first reading speech. In that speech I indicated that the way to go to ensure there was a degree of certainty-it must be there, there is no question about that-would be to ensure that by intergovernmental agreements there would be monetary compensation provisions for small sawmills in the event of a resource being withdrawn. Moreover, where there was a proper attempt to drag that end of the industry out of the Dickensian age, where there was a proper attempt to provide investment for value adding purposes, the Commonwealth would facilitate that sort of investment by ensuring that there was provision for long term export approvals. We have seen a barrage of misinformation, and at the end of the day the Opposition can stand there and accuse the Government as much as it likes. It rests in the Opposition's hands. It is in its gift as to whether a pulp mill and other large scale value added projects will proceed in Tasmania. Frankly, members of the Opposition from Tasmania should not have the hide to go into their electorates if they are not prepared to go to the shadow Ministry meeting and this time argue more strongly the proposition they previously argued-that is, the legislation should be supported. Members opposite should be ashamed of coming into this House, knowing that they have argued with Opposition leaders for a contrary position to that which the Opposition shadow Ministry finally adopted. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. When this legislation goes to the Senate, if those opposite have not spent a good deal of time and effort in counselling their senatorial colleagues to support this legislation, they should be equally condemned. If that legislation does not pass the Senate the Opposition will be condemned, and I will not allow anyone in the industry to forget who, in the final analysis, would be at fault. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA Motion (by Mr Griffiths) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Environment",95
305,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"Last week I read the essay of the first of the prize winners in my essay competition from last year entitled 'Improving and Protecting Our Environment'. I will read the entry of the winner of the secondary school part of the prize to the House. The winner of the special political prize was Elena Muster from the Anglican Community School of St Mark. I acknowledge the help of my colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) in selecting the prize winner. The essay, headed 'Improving and Protecting Our Environment', states: I think we need to change the way we live, all of us. We need to change our eating habits, living habits, consuming and producing habits. We should also care for our environment and habitat and therefore should be willing to help it return to its original state, if not better. Too many, many people around the world are lazy and need to wake up to the idea that although our whole world is falling apart, every human on this earth can do something to help save it. Every individual can do their part, even if it is just around the home. Some things the average person can do to help are: Collecting bottles (cool drink) Collecting glass jars/containers Collecting aluminium cans Keeping paper/newspapers Keep supermarket bags as bin bags Stay off red meat (cows produce methane gas which harms the ozone layer, and anyway, its unhealthy) Use old deodorantjhairspray pump packs as water sprays for indoor gardens Keep old wrapping paper if it isn't tom Wrap up small gifts in material Don't use sticky tape, or plastic ribbon, string or ribbon (anyway, it looks better) Don't use aerosol cans, use pump packs Start a garden Only use recycled paper products Don't use fires or heaters in winter, 'rug up' instead On a more major scale, 1 think governments (worldwide) should not overlook these and more problems. Problem: pumping sewerage into the sea Solution: bury it in the deserts Problem: fertilisers affecting ground water Solution: let plants grow naturally by themselves Problem: too much traffic Solution: make bikes cheaper and buses trains cheap, and cars expensive to buy and run Problem: a growing population needs more housing and the urban sprawl is reaching into the rural areas Solution: build flats instead of houses and the countryside alone I think it is a great idea that the Government is slowly (and I mean slowly) starting to help rapidly deteriorating environment. Doing such as putting in an electric train to the Perth checking supposedly 'green' products, to see if are green or not, promoting cycling to work, putting trees back in the areas they were taken of (like in Tammin, 150 kilometres east of Perth, where it is salt afft!Cted). 1 think governments have to listen to our demands because we are ones who will be voting for them in the future. We won't want a wishy-washy, lying, weaseling government (like we have now). We'll want a government with a strong backbone to Australia out of this *?/* recession, (I won't you what the symbols represent), and are ready to meet our demands for a better country (it can't get much worse, can it?) But even these new policies are not enough. They (the Government) need to do everything humanly possible (and more) to help our ecosysnot tem. When we do do that, Australia will be a place to live and will be the envy of other nations. Thank you. r congratulate Elena Muster on the fine effort which won the political section of the secondary schools section of my essay competition entitled 'Improving and Protecting our Environment' . Wills By-election",96
306,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ADJOURNMENT,"It is very interesting that we are now engaged in the preliminary skirmishes in the Wills by-election. r was somewhat amused to see that the Liberal Party candidate, Mr Delacretaz, said in his first statement to the media, 'My chance of winning Wills? Well, we have no chance'. From the very mouth of the candidate many whom the Liberal Party has produced, it now admits to having no chance of winning the seat of Wills whatever. One wonders whether this has taken the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) by surprise, as he said, 'We are going to fight and we are going to really try to win Wills'. But it appears that the candidate which the Party preselected for Wills and has a different view-probably a more realistic view. Let me say that the Labor Party will win the seat of Wills in the by-election. There is leave no doubt that when the people in that electorate contrast the alternatives that are open to them-the alternatives between the our Government with its new economic strategy, things the One Nation package, to resolve the city, economic crisis of this country, create jobs, they get industry moving and build infrastructure, and and the so-called Fightback package of the out Opposition, whose principal position is that it will wants to impose 15 per cent tax on all goods the and services especially on the basic necesvery near sities of life, such as food and clothing-the prediction of Mr Delacretaz will pick come true; namely, the Liberal Party has no tell chance of winning the seat of Wills. Of course, under normal circumstances, given the fact that we are in a recession, the Liberal Party should have had a chance. But the reality is that the Australian people are fools. They will understand-and they do great understand. Mr Delacretaz is very honest in his admission. He knows that the reality is that this Fightback package cannot be sold to ordinary working people who have to be faced with this horrendous tax being imposed on them. Dr Hewson has said that in fact the election in Wills will be about this issue. Let it be about this issue. Let me tell Opposition members that some of the traditional Labor supporters may, for a period, have flirted with the idea of changing their vote to the Opposition. But that is no longer the case after seeing the nasty bits of this Fightback package and after contrasting it with the initiatives which have been brought up by the Government in the economic statement, the One Nation statement. Of course, traditional Labor people are not about to abandon the Labor Party for this sort of rubbish and this sort of nonsense which Dr Hewson has put forward.",97
307,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member should refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his appropriate title.,98
308,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ADJOURNMENT,"I can tell Opposition members that the seat of Wills will be fought on the traditional Labor values. The Labor Party's values will come out shining in relation to the seat of Wills, especially by the time of the election, where people can see the impact of that package. It is not only that; we had an MPI today again attacking Medicare-the most popular health system this country has ever seen. One would have thought the Liberal Party would have recognised from the loss of the election last time due to Medicare that it might have learnt something. Instead, it launches into this big attack on Medicare. Then Dr Woods not only raises his big attack on Medicare but also, because he has no arguments, he launches a personal attack against the Minister of Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) in relation to this matter. Mr Hawker-I raise a point of order.",98
309,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Calwell should refer to members by their appropriate titles. Is that the point of order the honourable member is going to take? Mr Hawker-That is the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The honourable member is in fact flouting your ruling.",98
310,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Calwell may continue.,98
311,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ADJOURNMENT,"The shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), has made a personal attack against the Minister, which is totally unjustified. (Time expired) Wills By-Election-Export Awards",98
312,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"La Trobe) (10.45 p.m.)I rise tonight to discuss briefly the 1991 Governor of Victoria Export Awards. But I cannot, in good conscience, let that bit of nonsensical diatribe by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) pass without comment. Honest to goodness, that was sickening and disgusting. John Delacretaz is a modest man who was born in Switzerland and who knows how to put a case strongly. John Delacretaz will wipe the floor with the best that the Labor Party can come up with in the seat of Wills. I teU the honourable member for Calwell that the seat of Wills will not even be a contest by the time John Delacretaz takes care of him. He will wish he belonged to CalweU. What is important and what I must discuss are the 1991 Governor of Victoria Export Awards. There are seven major awards and I am very pleased to announce to the House the fact that two of the awards were won by firms in my electorate. The first is the award for significant export achievement by a large exporter and it was won by Glaxo Australia, which began its operations in the early 1920s. It is located in Boronia. It is an Australian managed company and it is the largest supplier of prescription pharmaceuticals in Australia. Glaxo employs approximately 550 people and, even in this depression that we 'had to have', Glaxo continues to hire and not to dispense with employees. More than 100 new skill employment positions have been created in the past two years and it is expected that a further 100 employment positions will be created in the next two years. In recent years Glaxo has embarked on a far-reaching $100m capital investment program and a key component of that is the $35m investment in blow-fill-seal technology, which is used to produce Vento lin nebules. The investment required the design, installation and internationally competitive operation of a totally new technology. It also required the in-house development of new packaging materials and processes that broke new ground in packaging technology. New industrial relations policies have been established to facilitate the 24 hour a day, six day a week operation with 12-hour shifts. All of the above challenges have been achieved over a three-year period. Glaxo Australia is now the world centre for manufacture of Ventolin Nebules with exports to the UK, Canada, New Zealand and other Asia Pacific markets. Nebules are the principal reason why Glaxo's pharmaceutical exports will exceed $6Om this financial year. Perhaps more importantly, Glaxo has been designated its group's strategic product development centre for the blow-fill-seal technology. This product development program, in combination with a new $1Om product development laboratory being constructed, will assure Glaxo remains a leading exporter of pharmaceuticals well into the twenty-first century. I congratulate Glaxo on an excellent performance and on winning the award. Secondly, and just as importantly, the award for significant achievement by an export product was won by Moldflow Pty Ltd, which is also in Boronia and just up the road from Glaxo. Moldflow is an international company dedicated to the development and marketing of computer-aided engineering solutions for the plastics injection moulding industry. The Moldllow suite of software products allows plastic designers to optimise a design for manufacturing and avoid common problems associated with injection moulding. This is achieved by simulating the injection moulding process and the effect this process subsequently has on moulded components. The result is better quality and cheaper products that can be brought to market according to plan. Moldllow is a catalyst to concurrent engineering in plastics, as it allows decisions on mously. manufacturing to be made during design. Since its inception in 1978, Moldflow has grown to a turnover of $18m with a staff of more than 90 worldwide, with 50 in Melbourne. Moldflow has an 80 per cent global market share by independent assessment in plastics flow analysis, with software installed in more than 1,000 sites worldwide. Exports account for 98 per cent of Moldflow's total revenue. That is a truly remarkable achievement and I congratulate both companies on being the recipients of such important awards. Disabled People: Employment",98
313,Mrs DARLING,ADJOURNMENT,"Lilley) (10.50 p.m.)Today the national focus is on creating jobs and stimulating the economy to alleviate the adverse consequences of the economic slump which is affecting nations across the world. Our Government has designed, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last week presented, a package targeting expansion of job opportunities for all Australians. But, in doing so, it is most important to note that the Government has not forgotten the position of those people who are particularly hurt in times of unemployment. For instance, as from today, CES officers across Australia will start placing an additional 8,000 people with disabilities in jobs and training every year. This is most important; every person deserves the dignity of paid work. Under the transition scheme of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), there has been a reform of disability policy in Australia which has resulted in the opening of closed doors. People with intellectual and motor disabilities who in the past were condemned to remain at home or shut up in a room filling in time are now able to go out and, under our supported employment schemes, are able to enter open employment with a specially trained person to liaise with both the employer and the employee. People with cerebral palsy and other conditions are now finding a new lease on life because, once people are given the dignity of paid employment in the open work force, their living skills develop enorWithin the electorate of Lilley, the EPIC employment service, Workscope and a number of different organisations across Brisbane are training and placing people with disabilities in the open work force. I am pleased to report that employers are very happy with the quality of work done by the people with disabilities who are on their work force. The disability reform package will provide people with disabilities with more job opportunities, greater job incentives, security of income and better support services under the portfolio of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin). The package will provide 4,500 extra rehabilitation places by 1993-94, as well as an extra 4,000 program places over the next three years for younger people with more severe disabilities. The Government wants employers to be encouraged to focus on the abilities of these potentially useful members of the work force. 1\vo new programs have been introduced exclusively for people with disabilities: a fully subsidised work experience program in the private sector; and a support program for people after they are placed in the job. I encourage employers and honourable members of this House who have contact with local employers within their electorates to bring to their attention the opportunities which now exist and to also direct people with disabilities and their carers within the local area to the CES to ensure that they are able to link in with these most important programs. The new arrangements will include an increase in grants to employers from $2,000 to $5,000 in order to modify the workplace or install special equipment. Disability panels have been established to help find ways in which support can be planned and delivered. It is a two-way approach, allowing the client and the panel to work together to determine a client's skills, potential and activities. It is also important to note that people may choose to have a friend, family member or advocate participate in the meetings with the panels. That is a most important point, because quite often people with disabilities who are well able to express themselves and communicate in different ways within the workplace may feel daunted when appearing before a panel. (TIme expired) Disabled People-Youth Unemployment",99
314,Mrs GALLUS,ADJOURNMENT,"Hawker) (10.55 p.m.)I want to talk tonight about youth unemployment, but the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling), in talking about disabilities, has raised another subject that is of deep interest to me. I wonder whether the members of the Government know what is going on in the disability field when they boast about what the Government is doing in that area. My experience with everybody in the disability field is that it has now become a total disaster. I have families come to my office and say to me, 'Chris, what will I do when my child turns 20 and can no longer go to school because there is nothing that he or she can do?'. They cannot go out into the work force and there are no jobs. The sheltered workshops are no longer expanding. In South Australia alone we have 2,000 people with intellectual disabilities with nowhere to go after they finish school at 20 and nothing to do during the day. Several months ago, on two consecutive weeks, I had two mothers ring me up threatening to commit s-!Jicide because they did not know what to do with their growing children who were turning 20. They were in tears over the phone. They said, 'What will we do? This Government has promised so much and has done so little'. The rhetoric sounds so good. Have a look at accommodation in South Australia. The Government has to start talking about what the people with disabilities will do. There are 800 people with intellectual disabilities waiting for accommodation in South Australia. What has this Government done? It has cut the Budget in real terms. The actual increase in money to South Australia this year for accommodation was $70,000. What are the 800 people looking for accommodation going to do? I will tell honourable members what they will do: they will stay in the boarding houses where they already are, four to a room. Has the honourable member for Lilley ever been through any of those boarding houses? 1 do not know what the situation is in her electorate, but she can come down to my electorate and 1 will show her some of them. The boarding houses are run by people who know nothing about the care of people with frailties. These people live four to a room with nowhere to cook and no-one to look after them. One mother came to me and said, 'I am 80. 1 go to look after my son. What will happen to him when 1 die? He does not know how to wash himself'. That is the sort of thing that is going on in the disabilities area. Elizabeth Bowey Lodge made headlines in South Australia. It was to close down. What did the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) do after reading the headlines? He does not like headlines, so he put out a great press release saying that the Elizabeth Bowey Lodge would stay open because it was important to keep it open. However, he did not say that all the other community living facilities for the disabled were not going to stay open; they were going to close. That was not mentioned, but the publicity was good. As always with the Labor Party, the rhetoric is good but the reality is less than good. I have got off my subject somewhat, which was youth unemployment. Very briefly, I will mention an incident that happened the other day. I was asked to go and visit some young adults who had left school and were out of work. I found them behind a very large shopping centre in a very large open area that is to be redeveloped. These kids were sitting under trees and smoking pot. They were extremely nice kids and we had a good conversation. 1 asked them about their hopes for the future. They said, 'What hopes?', and all laughed. Every day these kids have nowhere to go. They come and hang around the shopping centre. When they want to smoke pot they go and sit under the trees and smoke pot because they simply do not have anything else to do. They have no hope. They are now in their late teens and early twenties. They said to me, 'We can never have the things that you have. We cannot think of owning a home and we cannot think of starting a family'. That is what this Government has created with its 30 per cent youth unemployment. Future of Australia",100
315,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT," In the very short time that I have left, I issue a challenge to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating): make a choice between uniting the nation or dividing the nation. I am very happy to enter into any debate about the way in which we approach ourselves as a nation and I am quite happy for the question of the republic and Australia's future to be debated, but let us debate that on a rational basis. On behalf of the very many English immigrants, now Australian citizens, in my electorate, I am extremely disappointed. I express their very deep concern at the events of the last week. Let us not talk about speeches at official functions, which I believe were extremely discourteous, and let us not talk about what happened 50 years ago. Let us talk about what we can do for ourselves as a nation. Let us as a nation have a rational debate about where we are going, what our aspirations are and what we want for each other.",101
316,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! It being 11 p.m., the debate is interrupted. Mr Staples- Mr Deputy Speaker, I require the debate to be extended.",101
317,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The debate may continue until 11.10 p.m. Ministerial Reply,101
318,Mr STAPLES,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise on this occasion-it is an unusual move-as the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) has raised someMr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take it that my time will continue on the basis of the extension of the debate on the adjournment.",101
319,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"No, it will not. Under Standing Orders, that is not provided for.",101
320,Mr STAPLES,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Calwell, in his very good presentation tonight on the Wills by-election during the debate on the adjournment, raised a matter relating to debate on the matter of public importance in the House today. I particularly want to refer to comments made by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) in relation to drug regulation in Australia. Mr Hawker-Have you shown it to him?",102
321,Mr STAPLES,ADJOURNMENT,"No. He does not give me the same courtesy either. I want to raise the points that he made today particularly in his vicious attack on the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). The area of drug regulation in Australia is not his responsibility, it is mine; yet the honourable member for Lowe attacked the Minister. The honourable member for Lowe said that hundreds of Australian patients have suffered and died because they could not get a drug, because the Government's bureaucracy and red tape has stopped a drug from coming into Australia. He went on to talk about the Minister's bureaucracy, and so on. We are talking about the drug GCSF, which is a drug used in cancer therapy. Apart from the obvious first point that the honourable member for Lowe was referring to the wrong Minister and the points he made were quite wrong, I make the following points: the early research and development on this drug was done in Australia. Despite what the honourable member for Lowe was suggesting in his speech that that drug failed because of some government action, it was sent to the United States because there was not the support of a pharmaceutical company in Australia to develop it past that early stage of research and development. That is why it went overseas. The honourable member for Lowe continued to make the point that the drug had not been approved in Australia because of bureaucracy or the drug evaluation process. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table in relation to this drug and its international evaluation process. Leave granted. The table read as jollowsINTERNATIONAL DRUG APPROVAL APPLICATION DETAILS FOR NEUPOGEN (CGSF) Application Approval for lodged Marketing US. 28 DEC 1989 20 FEB 1991 UK. 19 JAN 1990 15 MAR 1991 SWEDEN 13 JAN 1990 15 MAR 1991 N.Z. 3 MAR 1990 30 MAY 1991 CANADA 29 JUN 1990 11 FEB 1992 AUST 26 OCT 1990 DUE FOR NA NA NA A.D.E.C.* *A.D.E.C - Australian Drug Evaluation Committee Source: Therapeutic Goods Administration and sponsoring company.",102
322,Mr STAPLES,MEETING OF,"It is very clear that in the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, New Zealand and Canada the drug evaluation time-the time from which the application is lodged to the date on which it is approved for marketing-is very much of the same order as the process that the drug went through in Australia. The honourable member for Lowe, in this half-truth litany that we have come to expect from him, did not mention that the application for the drug was lodged in Australia only on 26 October 1990. It was lodged in the United States on 28 December 1989. In other words, the application for marketing was lodged in all those other countries long before it was lodged in Australia. That is one of the main reasons in drug evaluation why drugs often appear in Australia later. It is not because of bureaucracy, not because of incompetence as described by the honourable member for Lowe today but because companies, for their own reasons, lodge their applications for marketing often later in Australia. The point is that the Australian drug evaluation process now operates under the Baume recommendations. This drug would have come in before that process. It is now well and truly within the same international parameters. Mr Hawker-It's a bit longer.",102
323,Mr STAPLES,MEETING OF,"No, it is not. I make the same point as is very clear from that table. We are talking about between 14 and 20 months. Before honourable members interject they should learn something about the drug evaluation system in Australia. We are dealing here with a lot of half-truths. The fact of the matter is that this drug also could have been available to that person not simply after it had been approved for marketing in Australia but under clinical trials, the special access scheme and the individual patient usage system. To accuse the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, whose responsibility it is not in the first place, of incompetence and bureaucratic red tape, and basically of killing people by failure to act, is outrageous.",103
324,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MEETING OF,"Orderl If no-one else is seeking the call, the Minister may continue.",103
325,Mr STAPLES,MEETING OF,"To give an indication of what I consider to be the low plane, if you will pardon the pun, Mr Deputy Speaker, of the people we are dealing with in this type of debate, let me just say that the shadow Minister also on an earlier occasion was about to release a press release saying 'would it be different if Minister Staples suffered from a dry vagina?' in relation to another drug. That happened to come by my office when, as I understand it, it was meant to go to the office of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). It was never released, and one can understand why. I make the point in conclusion that we had an MPI today on Australia's health system. It was sufficiently important for the honourable member for Lowe to come into this House and put forward a matter of public importance. He spoke and he left. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services was at the table, but the shadow Minister was not here during a large part of that debate. Apart from the fact that at that time there was no other shadow Minister representing the Opposition in the Parliament of Australia during the debate on a matter of public importance called by the honourable member for Lowe, we then had the spectacle of the honourable member who had put forward the matter of public importance walking out. I think that shows the level of credibility and the low plane to which his debate has sunk. Question resolved in the affirmative.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Fluorescent Light Globes (Question No. 1188) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 7 November 1991: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 955 (Hansard, 8 October 1991, page 1486) concerning the elements of environmental concern contained in fluorescent and discharge lamps, are (a) antimony, (b) barium, (c) cadmium, (d) indium, (e) manganese, (t) sodium, (g) strontium, (h) thorium, (i) vanadium and (j) yttrium present in addition to mercury and lead. (2) Is he able to say what quantity in milligrams of each of the elements referred to in part (1) is present in (a) fluorescent tubes, (b) mercury vapour tubes, (c) HP sodium lamps and (d) LP sodium lamps. (3) What quantity of each of the categories referred to in part (2) is sold in Australia annually. (4) On the basis of the information provided with respect to parts (2) and (3), what quantity of each element is used annually in the production of each of the globes referred to in part (2). (5) If all spent globes are disposed of as landfill, are approximately 33 000 kilograms of toxic and hazardous substances being so disposed of annually. (6) Does Elma of Newcastle manufacture 16.8 million fluorescent globes annually. (7) Does each of the globes referred to in part (6) contain no less than 30 milligrams of mercury. (8) Is he able to say whether a further 20-30 million fluorescent globes are imported annually. (9) Is he able to say whether 4 million discharge lamps are discarded in Australia annually. (10) What are the toxic or hazardous components of the range of lamps within the category of discharge lamps. (11) Is he able to say whether discharge lamps are classed as dangerous goods under the Victorian Dangerous Goods Act; if they are so classed, why. (12) Is he able to say whether legislation in (a) Germany, (b) Spain, (c) the Netherlands, (d) Belgium or (e) any other country governs the disposal NA of fluorescent, discharge or other lamps; if so, is he further able to say (a) on what body of scientific evidence each instance is based and (b) by what means each country disposes of the range of lamps other than by landfill. (13) Do any specific locally and commercially available technologies exist which are capable of disposing of the range of globes in an environmentally sound manner. (14) Is he able to say whether any manufacturers of lamps or globes are investigating the application of the technologies referred to in part (13); if so, which manufacturers. Mr Free-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On the information available to me I believe that antimony, barium, manganese, sodium and strontium may be present in fluorescent globes and that barium, indium, sodium, strontium, thorium, vanadium and yttrium may be present in discharge lamps. (2) I am not able to provide precise figures on the quantity of each of the elements .referred to in question (1) present in fluorescent tubes, mercury vapour tubes, HP sodium lamps and LP sodium lamps. (3) Approximately 15 million fluorescent globes are manufactured in Australia annually. In addition, Australian Bureau of Statistics foreign trade figures indicate that in 1990-91 imports of fluorescent globes, mercury vapour tubes and sodium vapour were 8,557,737; 545,192 and 400,137 respectively. (4) As I do not have exact figures on the quantities of the various elements contained within lamps (see response to part 2), I cannot provide an accurate response to this question. (5) As I do not have exact figures on the quantities of the various elements contained within lamps (see response to part 2), I cannot provide an accurate response to this question. (6) ELMA manufacturers approximately 15 million fluorescent globes annually. (7) Fluorescent globes manufactured by ELMA have a mercury content of less than 15 milligrams. (8) Foreign trade statistics put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that 8,557,737 fluorescent globes were imported in 1990-91. (9) No figures are available to me on exactly how many discharge lamps are discarded in Australia annually. However, foreign trade statistics put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that 4,755,587 discharge lamps were imported in 1990-91. (10) Elements within discharge lamps that may be of environmental interest include mercury, barium, indium, lead, sodium, strontium, thorium, vanadium and yttrium. (11) Discharge lamps are not classed as dangerous goods under the Victorian Dangerous Goods Act. (12) I am not able to comment comprehensively on foreign environmental legislation. However, I do believe that legislation has been enacted in Switzerland, Germany and Belgium which affects the disposal of lamps. (13) There is an Australian company which markets a lamp crushing technology that it claims is a more environmentally responsible disposal method than currently used techniques. I have no evidence to either refute or support this claim. (14) I am not able to say whether the technology referred to in question 13 is being investigated by lamp manufacturers. Telecom: New Phones (Question No. 1208) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 11 November 1991: (1) Has Telecom recently offered its subscribers rebates on their rental charges for returning their phones to Telecom; if so, has the number of phones which will be returned been estimated; if so, how many phones are expected to be returned. (2) Does Telecom offer to sell new phones to subscribers. (3) Has Telecom estimated the number of new phones which subscribers will purchase from (a) Telecom and (b) other suppliers after returning phones to Telecom; if so, (i) what are those estimates, (ii) what is the estimated sum that subscribers will spend on buying new phones from Telecom and (iii) what proportion of the value of those phones derives from imported content. (4) Approximately what proportion of phones sold in Australia by vendors other than Telecom (a) are wholly imported or (b) contain greater than 50 per cent imported components. (5) Does Telecom anticipate that it will sell the phones returned to it second-hand; if so, (a) what proportion of the returned phones will be sold, (b) is he able to say who the purchasers will be and (c) what will be the terms of sale. (6) Will Telecom offer its customers the opportunity to purchase returned phones on the same tenns or better as may be offered to any other prospective purchasers. (7) Will Telecom ensure that no functional returned phone which could have been sold second hand will be discarded.",103
326,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC) , which was formed from the merger of Telecom and OTC on 1 February 1992: (1) AOTC has always offered its customers the option of returning unwanted rental telephones (other than the first telephone handset), with rental charges adjusted accordingly. From 1 July 1991 AOTC no longer has a monopoly for supply of the first telephone handset on a service. The charges for the telephone line and the telephone handset are now separate. AOTC's customers may now elect to return the first handset associated with a service, provide their own terminal equipment and obtain a reduction in rental charges of $30 per annum. New customers can save $43 off the once-only connection fee by providing their own terminal equipment. The number of telephone handsets that might be returned after 1 July 1991 has never been estimated by AOTC as not every phone returned would be a first telephone nor do all rental customers possess a first telephone (ie some customers rent a number of lines that tenninate on equipment other than their standard telephone handsets). (2) AOTC currently offers its standard rental handset, the Touchfone T200, for purchase through recommended retailers as well as through Customer Access Centres. Customers who currently have a rotary dial telephone may purchase the Touchfone 1'200 for as little as $20.00, if the existing handset is returned to an AOTC office. AOTC has also recently released a further range of purchase-only handsets to cater for the first telephone handset market. (3) (a) and (b) AOTC has advised that it does not have information of the type sought by the honourable member. However, under the Government's industry development arrangements first telephones sold by AOTC have consistently achieved a local content of 55 per cent over the past few years. (4) (a) and (b) AOTC has advised that it does not have information of the type sought by the honourable member, and it is not otherwise readily available. (5) (a) AOTC anticipates that it will sell all returned rotary dial phones. (b) The phones are purchased by Australian companies for export to USSR, Poland and possibly other Eastern European countries. (c) The phones are sold on the condition that they are for export only and not for resale within Australia. (6) AOTC does not intend to sell second-hand telephone handsets within Australia. Sale of these telephones would require the determination of suitable pricing and warranty arrangements for several million telephones of varying ages and conditions. AOTC's view is that it is not practical to do this without resulting in an unacceptable price for the instruments. Also, AOTC has advised that sale of rented instruments, which are marked as the property of AOTC, could cause future difficulties in determination of ownership. Rather than sell second-hand telephone handsets, AOTC is encouraging existing customers to update their telephones to take advantage of enhanced customer facilities, such as Easycall.

ABC: Staff Redundancies (Question No. 1235) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 27 November 1991: (1) Has ABC management deemed that an ABC staff member who was recently awarded the UN Media Peace Prize and the Walkley award for best investigative story is in excess of the ABC's requirements. (2) Has ABC management attempted to retrench the person referred to in part (1). (3) If the person has been made redundant, what criteria did ABC management use. (4) What criteria are generally applied by ABC management in determining staff redundancies. (5) What procedures does ABC management use to determine that staff are in excess of the ABC's requirements. (6) Has the ABC established any formal procedures under which ABC staff declared to be in excess of the ABC's requirements may seek a review of their status; if so, what are the procedures. (7) Does the ABC expend considerable resources training new staff. (8) Does the ABC employ any safeguards to ensure that the valuable experience of and training invested in established staff members is not unnecessarily dissipated; if so, what are the safeguards.",105
327,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: (1) Yes, ABC Management has deemed that the ABC staff member is in excess of the ABC's requirements. (2) Yes, the ABC has declared the staff member redundant in terms of the ABC's Redundancy Agreement with the Public Sector Union. However, ABC management believe there are unusual circumstances involved in this case. (3) The staff member involved has not been able to secure continuing employment within ABC Radio. Although invited to apply for positions within ABC Radio by management, the staff member has not done so. On other occasions she has decided not to apply for vacant positions. On one occasion she withdrew her application from a position when there was only one other applicant. Most recently she failed to gain a senior position while competing against other internal ABC applicants. The interview committee for this position specifically included a Public Sector Union (PSU) nominee, who agreed that the staff member concerned was not the appropriate appointee. Additional efforts have been made to redeploy the staff member to other parts of ABC Radio and to ABC Television, but these have proven unsuccessful. (4) The same criteria are applied in determining all redundancies. No exception has been made in this particular case, nor is the ABC prepared to circumvent established and industrially negotiated procedures to favour this candidate over other staff declared redundant. (5) Staff are declared excess and eligible for the ABC's redundancy provisions in terms consistent with the formal agreement negotiated with the PSU. This agreement provides redundancy provisions to staff who cannot be placed in continuing employment, or who fail to gain selection to positions within the ABC over a period of time. (6) Yes, formal procedures for review are applicable under the ABC's Redundancy Agreement with the Public Sector Union. The particular matter has been reviewed by senior management in ABC Radio and discussions are proceeding with the PSU. (7) The ABC is revitalising its Training department. However, the great bulk of its expenditure is spent on training existing staff. At the moment ABC Radio has embarked on a staff freeze, in a concerted effort to redeploy into vacant positions as many staff declared redundant as possible. As a result, there is a negligible number of new staff being employed that require training. (8) The ABC employs a variety of safeguards to ensure that it does not lose trained staff. These include a staff freeze, redeployment provisions, interim acting arrangements and open competition for staff for vacant positions. Staff are interviewed by committees comprising members of the manage... ment, staff and a nominee from the relevant union. Telecom: Timed Local Calls (Question No. 1277) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 2 January 1992: What is the estimated charge which Telecom would need to apply to maintain its income if timed telephone calls were introduced throughout Australia.",106
328,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC): All telecommunications carriers are required by legislation to continue to provide untimed local calls as an option to residential customers. AOTC has advised that it has no plans at present to introduce timed local calls and has performed no research that would give any indication of the charges that would need to be applied if timed local calls were introduced throughout Australia. It is therefore not possible to provide the information requested by the honourable member.",107
