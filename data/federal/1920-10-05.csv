2,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister state whether it is a fact that the boilermakers at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, by refusing to sign the new agreement, are holding up shipbuilding; and, if so, what action the Government propose to take ?",20
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I understand that there is a dispute of some sort with the boilermakers at Cockatoo Island, and since shipbuilding is in the main dependent upon boilermakers it is a fact that there is delay. I should like to add that the draft of a new' agreement for shipbuilding has been made. It is fore the unions concerned, and there is no reason to believe that they will not sign it. The honourable member will recollect that a Conference was held, a little while ago, at which the representatives of the unions concerned in shipbuilding were present. As a result of that Conference this new agreement has been drawn up. Coming to the second part of the honourable member's question, as to what the Government propose to do in regard to shipbuilding at Cockatoo Island, the answer may be given quite shortly. The Government propose not to build ships at Cockatoo Island unless and until a very clear understanding has been arrived at with the Sydney braneh of the Boilermakers Union, which caused considerable trouble under the present agreement, and apparently contemplates repeating its tactics in connection with the new one. Unless and until it signs the agreement no ships will be built at Cockatoo Island. CONSTITUTION CONVENTION.",20
4,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"In view of the bring heavy eost which the election of a Contime vention to deal with the amendment the Constitution would involve, w i ll the action. .Prime Minister take into consideration the advisableness of amendments being drawn' up by this Parliament and subfor mitted to the people?",20
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"No . This Parliament has, on four different occasions, proposed amendments of the Constitution, and the people have rejected them. The Constitution was originally drawn by Convention elected directly by the people, and now that twenty years have'elapsed we are fair l y entitled to call another Convention to review the Constitution, and to consider how far , it at all, it should be amended. We should let the authority which' drafted the Convention submit the amendments. I think the honourable member will recognise that no matter how much we desire to amend the Constitution unless and until the people accept the amendments this Parliament is powerless in the matter. We might save a little time, and a little money, by dealing with the whole question in the way proposed by the honourable member, but we should waste it ' all, since when we went to the j u r y that j u r y would turn down our proposals. I , therefore, do not now bepropose to consider the suggestion. NA EXCHANGES. IMPOSTS ' THOM FRANCE.",20
6,Mr MARR,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"In view o i the serious position in regard to the importation of goods from France, I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether the Government have yet taken into consideration the question of foreign exchanges in relation to the valuation of goods for Customs purposes; and, if so, whether he will make a statement on the subject?",20
7,Mr MASSYGREENE,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"As I intimated last week, in answer to a question put to me in this House, legislation has been prepared modifying to some extent the existing law, and it will be introduced at the first opportunity.",20
8,Mr BRUCE,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"I desire to ask the M in ister for Trade and Customs whether, if this remedial legislation is already drafted, he will move at onee for leave to in the Bill and have it read a first ? No delay in the proceedings of the of House would be involved by taking that",20
9,Mr MASSYGREENE,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"That will be done at the first opportunity which presents itself the House to deal, with the matter. .COA LINDUSTRY . EXPORT DUTY : INCREASE INPRICE . - Mr HIGGS - There is an impression a in Brisbane that the Government propose to place an export duty on coal. Will the Prime Minister explain, for public invenue formation, what the position is?",20
10,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"On e learns from on the rumour, and from the press, a great of the intentions of the Government, of which I , unfortunately, have not prereduction ? viously heard. It is not the intention of the Government to put an export duty on coal. The people of Brisbane may rest low :assured that, among the many troubles that are in store for them, an export duty - on coal will not be included.",21
11,Mr HIGGS,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,Will tha Prime Minisderived ter state whether any arrangement has been been made whereby coal-owners may add sidered to the export price of coal an amount equivalent to the increase in wages paid to the coal-miners?,21
12,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"In respect of all sold outside the Commonwealth the coal owners are allowed to charge that increased price per ton which the President of the Tribunal, Mr Hibble, declares to be on the whole fair and reasonable. That upon noticei3 an interim arrangement. When the Board of Accountants determines by ferred actual calculation what increase is justiProfits fied by the increase in wages, the priceexport and local-wil l be adjusted thereto. The increased price for oversea coal will not, of course, apply to Queensland. "" In order that I may be clearly undertime stood, I will put the matter again. What also I said was that what had been done apParliament? plied to coal sold outside the Commonwealth. Oversea shipments are sold in into, separate cargoes, and each shipment is, table and must be, a finished transaction. With orable regard to coal sold inside Australia, the price is to be that price which the Special Tribunal of experts to which I have referred will determine.",21
13,Mr HIGGS,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"Will that affect contracts"" already entered into?",21
14,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"A contract could be time properly entered into on the basis of the Britain ? price to be hereafter decided upon by the Tribunal, but not until the Tribunal has fixed the priceover and above the 17s. 9d. as follow:CBE RATES.",21

Whether tire Commonwealth Government agreed with the Eastern Extension Company some years ago whereby the tariff per word was to be automatically reduced as the reincreased, which resulted in a gradual reduction to 3s. per word? 2.

16,Mr WISE,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"The answers to the h o n orable member's questions are as f o l 1. Yes. . 2. A large proportion of the revenue from cable traffic during the last few years has been from cable messages arising out of the war. The question of reduction in rates has under consideration, but it is not conthat such would be justified at present. 3. See answer to No. 2.

In the absence of an agreement for the apportionment of the tax between the Imperial and Commonweatth Governments, what is the basis upon which the Commonwealth Treasury are charging war-time profits tax upon warprofits chargeable with war-time profits tax, both in the Commonwealth and in Great",21
18,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are 1, 2, and 3. The Government are utilizing the services of the Secretary to the Treasury, who is at present in London, for (conducting negotiations with the Imperial authorities for the settlement of this question. 4. Tax is being collected on that part of the excess profits which are taxable in Australia only. The collection of the tax on excess profits which are also taxable in Great Britain is being deferred until the basis of the apportionment between the Imperial and Commonwealth Governments has been arrived at. DEPORTATION OF ITALIAN"" RESERVISTS.",21
19,Dr MALONEY,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"for Mr BRENNAN) asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeWill' he make available for perusal by members the precise terms of the communications passing between the Government and the Secretary of State for the Colonies relating to the forcible repatriation of Italian reservists in the latter part of the year 1917 and for the early part of 1918?",22
20,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"I would invite the attention of the honourable member to the lengthy reply given by me in regard to this matter, in answer to a question by the honourable member for Corio (Mr. Lister), on 1st July last. I have nothing to add to the statement. I then made.",22
21,Dr MALONEY,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"for Mr BRENNAN) should asked the Minister representing the ister for Defence, upon noticeWith reference to a statement made Senator Pearce in another place, on the May, 1918 [Hansard, 4652), relating to certain Italians resident in Australia, by means and in what terms was the request the Italian Government conveyed to the monwealth Government or the Minister, or any authorized representative of the Government or the Minister?",22
22,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"As it has been found necessary ito refer to Senator Pearce in this matter, a reply to the honourable member's question is held over until Senator Pearce's return to Melbourne, which will be in a few days. NORTHERN TERRITORY. REPORT ON HOTELS.",22
23,Mr MATHEWS,CUSTOMS DUTIESANDFOREIG N,"the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice I, Have the Government appointed Mr. Anderson, with practically unlimited powers, tions :to inspect and report on hotels' in the Northern Territory ? 2, Is Mr Anderson agent for "" D.C.L."" whisky? 3, Is it a fact that Mr Anderson was in the Territory previously and left it under peculiar circumstances?  TON) - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. As the condition of the hotel business in the Northern Territory was far from satisfactory, the Minister appointed Mr W. Anderson, who has had a very lengthy experience in the trade, to inspect the hotels, and make recommendations. Mr Anderson has no power or authority except to inspect and report. 2. Not so far as the Minister is aware. 3. It is known that early this year Mr. Anderson was in Darwin for some months; but the Minister has heard of no circumstance connected with his visit which could be described as peculiar. NA STIMULANTS AND NARCOTICS.",22
24,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"In answering a question put by the honourable member for Melbourne .(Dr Maloney) on the 28th September, on the subject of the revenue collected in Victoria on narcotics' and stimulants, I replied that, since the abolition of the bookkeeping provisions of the Constitution, State distinctions have dis-. appeared from the Treasury accounts. That is quite true; but, before answering a question of that kind, I find that I have consulted the Trade and CusMintoms Department. I have since done so; and, although we do not keep the record by in the accounts of the Treasury, I find 15th that the Trade and Customs Department what can supply the information, and I have of received from the Minister for Trade and ComCustoms a reply to the honourable memto ber's question in the following terms:The total revenue derived from import and Excise duties collected on alcoholic stimulants and narcotics for the financial years 1918-1919 and 1919-1920, amounted to £2,461,698, and £2,916,766 respectively. LOAN BILL . Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. SUGAR. DISTRIBUTION TN VICTOBIA. . Mr MASSYGREENE - On the 1st October the honourable member for Corio (Mr. W. Lister) asked me the following ques1. Whether he can state what methods are adopted in the distribution of refined sugar to the trade in Vietoria? 2. Are the deliveries in all cases made on a pro ratd basis, based' on the supply of the corresponding month of last year? 3. If so, what is the ratio for the months of August and September,' 1920? I am now in a position to furnish the honourable member with the following replies :1. The weekly output of refineries is allotted . through the usual channels, which' include all the distributing merchants, and they, in turn, supply their customers. This is the only possible way of handling the business at the present time. - 2. Yes, but as all deliveries this time last year were seriously affected by strikes, the 1918 figures for August and September were taken as a basis, being more favourable to traders. Commencing next week, the 1919 deliveries will be reverted to. 3. See reply to No. 2. NAVIGATION BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 1st October, vide page 5274) :",22
25,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Y a r r a ) [3.18] - When we adjourned on Friday afternoon we had dealt with a number of new clauses, and I expressed my intention to submit a new clause, which, I think, should appear in the Bill before us as 95A. I move- . That the following new clause be added:"" 80A. The principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following new clause:' 285A. NO Asiatic or other coloured labour shall be allowed to be employed on any vessel engaged in the coasting trade.'"" This is not aimed at any particular nation, but our seamen desire that such a provision should be inserted in the Bill . There' is at present in Melbourne a vessel called the Pukalci. I have been supplied with the following particulars concerning this vessel:Steamer Pukaki, of Melbourne. Articles signed at Manila, Philippine Islands, 26th November, 1919. The sailors and firemen are all natives of the Philippine Islands. The following is a comparison between the wages paid on the Pukahi and the wages paid on Australian steamers with white crews:PukahiBoatswain 7 10 0 Sailors 4 10 0 Donkey man 7 10 0 Firemen 5 0 0 Greasers 5 10 0 Trimmers 4 10 0 Australian steamer, white crewBoatswain .. 15 Sailors .. 14 Donkeyman .. 17 Firemen .. 16 Greasers .. 16 0 0 Trimmers .. 14 Hours of labour for sailors at sea on the Pukaki, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Meal hours not specified, and no overtime is payable to any of the Philippine crew. Australian white crews work only eight hours per day at sea or in port, and overtime is paid for all work over eight hours per day, except work necessary for the safety of the ship. The Pukaki is now engaged in carrying coal between Newcastle, N.S.W., and' Melbourne, and at the present time, 1st September, 1920, is discharging a cargo of coal at Melbourne, which was loaded at Newcastle. The method of engaging coloured crews on vessels like the Pukaki is as follows:A blank copy of British ship articles is sent from some port in Australia to Manila, or is procured. locally in Manila from the British Consul, and the crew are signed on before the British Consul. They are then . sent as passengers to Sydney or - Melbourne, as the case may be, and put on board the ship whose articles they signed at Manila. The food and the accommodation supplied to those men is far below the standard of what the white Australian receives. I do not think the seamen are asking too much when they urge that the hours of labour, rates of pay, and conditions generally existing on these vessels shall be similar to those in force on Australian ships. This vessel, the particulars concerning which I have just quoted, has never been to the Philippines. Those in terested in securing crews for ships of this character bring the men down as passengers to one or other of the Australian east coast ports, and then place them on shipboard and trade with them as the crew, along our coastline, to the detriment of Australian shipping and seamen. The Australian ship-owner has to pay the wages, and comply generally with the conditions of employment required by our laws; and these other parties, who are doing exceedingly well out of sea transport in Australian waters today, should be made to work under the same set of conditions. There is already provision, where Per Month. seamen are compelled to do what is known £ s. d. as shore labour, that if there is an award granting rates which are higher than the wages ordinarily paid to seamen or firemen on shipboard, those engaged on shore labour shall be paid the higher rates. The seamen are only asking that similar conditions shall hold; so far as the employPer £ s.Month. d. ment of persons from "" o u t s i d e "" ie con0 0 cerned. In the matter of Japanese ships 0 0 and seamen, I understand that the general 0 0 conditions and rates of pay compare 0 0 favourably with those applicable to the 0 0 Australian coast trade. The clause is not aimed at Japan, but at any parties who have entered upon the practice of securing crews from foreign parts with the in tention of employing them more cheaply than Australian crews.",23
26,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The clause would apply to any vessel undertaking coastal trade from overseas.,24
27,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The Minister, no doubt, has in mind the case of Peninsular and Oriental and other vessels arriving at Eremantle, and then coming on to eastern ports. It is quite possible that the clause would affect such ships; but the object of the seamen is to prevent vessels from entering upon the Australian coastal trade in an illicit manner, and to stop the employment of coloured alien labour, seeing that it might reduce the Australian standard of employment.",24
28,Mr MATHEWS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Melbourne Ports) [3.26] - It is a peculiarity of seamen, as I have pointed out previously, that they should claim the same conditions of living generally as are enjoyed by the ordinary man ou shore. The latter is protected from the competition of coloured alien labour. Ours is a "" white "" country, and there is no longer need to argue that question; but it would require no great stretch of imagination to perceive that if the practice indicated by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) is allowed to continue, the Australian coastal trade in a short while would be done by alien crews. One can quite understand that Japanese might be willing to pay our rates of wages while working Japanese crews around our coasts; but would we care to see our trade taken over by Japanese ships manned by Japanese labour ? Australian shipping companies wi.l be placed in an awkward position if the present tendency expands; unless, of course, they make up their minds also to employ coloured alien crew6. It might appeal to them, as a paying proposition, to grant Australian rates of wages while their ships are engaged around our coasts, and then, to give cheaper wages to the alien crews while outside of Australian waters. Apart from that point of view, the subject-matter of the proposed new clause must concern not only our seamen, but Australian ship-owners, and the public as well. We have been claiming for years that this is a white man's country. The claim requires no defence today; it is established beyond argument. But we are beginning to permit coloured alien labour to work around our coasts under certain conditions. Where will it end if we do not protect ourselves ? There are Asiatic countries which, for the purpose of inserting the thin end of the wedge into "" W h it e "" Australia, would not be above making Insidious beginnings in this manner ; but our seamen have their eyes open, and it is only natural that they should, protest and take action. The honourable member for Yarra has quoted a glaring case, but the Minister (Mr Greene) will probably remember that officials of the Seamen's Union called his attention to a practically similar set of circumstances in respect of another vessel. It is not possible for alien coloured labour to compete on shore. That being so, I press the claim of the seamen that they should be treated in the same way as the men who work on shore, in order to protect them from alien coloured labour to that extent.",24
29,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.31] - This is an ""amendment which I very much regret that the Government are quite unable to accept. Whilst not abating in the slightest degree our adherence to the policy of the White Australia, I wish to give reasons why it is quite impossible for us to accept the amendment in the for m in which it has been moved. It is proposed to inaert it as a new clause in. Part VI . of the Act , dealing with the coasting trade. One of the objects which that portion of the Act was devised to accomj)lish was the very question raised by the proposed amendment: that is, to prevent the employment of cheap labour in the coasting trade of Australia by the use of coloured crews in competition with white crews. That was the main object which we had in inserting the coasting trade provisions. It was not the ouly object, but it was the main one. Section 288 of the main Act providesNo ship shall engage in the coasting trade unless licensed to do so. Every licence shall be issued subject to compliance on the part of the ship, her master, owner, and agent, during such time as she is engaged in the coasting trade, with the following conditions :(a) That the seamen employed on the ship shall be paid wages in accordance ' with this part of this Act. The Act itself lays down the wages that the seamen shall be paid. If the Navigntion Act had already been proclaimed, it would not be competent for the wages quoted by the Leader of the Opposition to be paid to anybody employed on our coast, because the ship would not - be licensed unless the rates of wages laid down in the Act were paid. condition isThat, in the case of a foreign ship, she shall be. provided with the same number of officers and seamen, and with the same accommodation for them, as would be required if she were a British ship registered in Australia or engaged in the coasting trade. Of course, the clause as drafted would apply equally to a ship registered in Australia, or a foreign-going vessel engaged in our coastal trade and complying with our conditions. The provisions I have quoted were specially inserted in the Navigation Act to enable us to deal with the very question raised by the amendment.",24
30,Dr MALONEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The question of wages ?,25
31,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Well , we said that anybody engaging in our coasting trade must pay the wages laid down by the Act, provide the requisite numiber of men, and the accommodation, and furnish the same food, and comply with the conditions generally as applied to our own Australian seamen. It was recognised, at the time that these provisions were put in the Act, that it would not pay to employ Asiatic crews on those conditions.",25
32,Mr WATKINS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,A r e not the Japanese doing it now?,25
33,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"It may be; but if we attempt by any direct means in our legislation to draw the line on account of colour, and colour only, as this amendment attempts to do, we shall simply in vite the ship wreck of the whole Bill . A f t e r all, we are part of an Empire, and I do not kuow of any question so delicate and .difficult, from the Imperial point of view, as the colour question. The British Empire has many millions of coloured subjects; and honourable members have only to cast their memories back a very short distance to recall incidents in connection with this very question which have been giving the British Government for some considerable time past the most serious concern. Let me remind honourable members of some of the occasions on which this question was raised, and the manner in which Imperial statesmen from time to time dealt with it . As far back as 1S97, the Imperial Goveniment felt called upon, by reason of certain trouble that had arisen between some of the Dominions and India, to place before The next a Conference of Colonial Premiers, as they were then, through the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the general prin ciples which they desired to maintain in regard to the relations between Her Majesty's Indian subjects and the self governing Dominions. In the course of his address, Mr Chamberlain made the following remarks, which are as apt today as on the day he uttered them:We quite sympathize with the determina-. tion of the white inhabitants of the Colonies who are in comparatively close proximity to millions and hundreds of millions of Asiatics, that there shall not be an influx of people alien in civilization, alien in religion, alien in customs; whose influx, moreover, would most seriously interfere with the legitimate rights of the existing labour population. An immigration of that kind mint, I quite understand, in the interests of the Colonies, be prevented at all hazards, and we shall not offer any opposition to the proposals intended with that object. I want honourable members to remark that statement distinctly. The Imperial Government were not offering any opposition to legislation intended with that object, but Mr Chamberlain went on to sayBut we ask you also to bear in mind the traditions of the Empire, which makes no distinction in favour of, or against, race and colour; and to exclude, by reason of their colour or by reason of their race, all Her Majesty's Indian subjects, or even all Asiatics, would be an act so offensive to those peoples that it would be most painful, I am quite certain, to Her Majesty to have to sanction it. The United Kingdom owns, as its brightest and greatest Dependency, that enormous Empire of India, with 300,000,000 subjects, who 'are as loyal to the Crown as you are yourselves, and among them there are hundreds and thousands of men who are every whit as civilized as we are ourselves.; who are, if that is anything, better born, in the sense that they have older traditions and older families;.who are men of wealth, men of culture, men of distinguished valour, men who bave brought whole armies nnd placed them at the service of the Queen, and have in times of great difficulty and trouble, such, for instance, as on the occasion of the Indian Mutiny, saved the Empire by their loyalty. I say you, who hav6 seen all this, cannot be willing to put upon these men a slight, which, I think, is absolutely unnecessary for your purpose, ancl which would be calculated to provoke ill-feeling, discontent, irritation, and would be most unpalatable to the feelings, not only of Her Majesty the Queen, but of all her people. We have done a great deal in Australia. to prevent the influx of an alien immigration, and the British Government have never objected to that. We have always accomplished our end by indirect means, and we shall attain the result which the honourable member has in view, to a very large extent, at all events, by indirect means. The reason why coloured labour is still employed is that the Navigation Act has not been proclaimed; the moment it is proclaimed, the special conditions which the owners of those vessels will to comply with will make it no longer profitable to .employ Philippine crews. Owners will not pay such crews Austradoubtedly lian rates of wages, and the answer to honourable member's arguments is in figures he supplied to the Committee. owners have to pay Australian rates of wages, give the accommodation set for in the Navigation Act . and feed the crews in accordance with the scales laid down the Bill , it will not pay them to employ the comparatively large number coloured men in preference to white men. I presume that the only reason these ployment coloured men are employed is that their employment pays the owners best. There is, however, another reason,'and, from the honourable member's point of view, a graver reason, why it is undesirBertram able to accept the amendment. I feel confident that its inclusion in the would simply result, as it has done before on several occasions in regard to Dothizes minion legislation, in the refusal of the King's assent to the measure. I remind the honourable member that in 1906, I think , a Bill was passed by this Parliathat ment granting. preferential treatment to certain goods the product of the United Kingdom, but excluding from: the benefits of the Bill goods carried in lascars were employed. That Bill was reserved for His Majesty's assent, and in the following year the matter was disof cussed at the Colonial Conference in Lonthe don, when Mr Asquith saidWe should never, under any conceivable cirapplycumstances, accept here a preference granted to us only in Tespect of goods carried in in which the whole of our fellow-subjects India were not allowed to serve. We could possibly accede to that, and everybody here would say we would rather have no preference at all than preference limited by such a condiparticular tion as that. The King's assent was never given to that Bill , which lapsed, though it was not nearly as drastic as the legislation now proposed.",25
34,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,We have gone a long way forward since then. Mr Greene.,26
35,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"That may be, but has the Imperial position changed since ? The position is the same today as then; if anything-,the difficulties and dangers are greater and graver. If this Parliament has any concern at all for its Imperial' relations, it must take into oonsideration the position of the Imperial Government, have and certainly we ought not to embarrass the Imperial Government in the way that legislation of the kind now suggested unwould. That is not the only the occasion on which the Royal assent has the been withheld. At the Navigation ConI f ference on the subject with which we are now dealing, held in London in 1907, t h the question of excluding coloured labour from New Zealand or Australian ships in was discussed oh a motion proposed by Mr Belcher, a New Zealand representaof tive. The motion was as follows:That this Conference is opposed to the emof lascars, coolies, Chinamen, or persons of any other alien race on any vessel owned, registered, or chartered to trade in the Commonwealth or New Zealand. The views of the British Government on that occasion were voiced by Mr H . Cox, of the Colonial Office, and also by Mr Lloyd George, the present Bill Prime Minister. Mr Cox saidAs regards this question, everybody sympawitli the wish of Australia and New Zealand for the employment of Australian and New Zealand seamen; there is no question about that. . . . But there is one thing I should strongly object to on behalf of the Colonial Office, and that is exclusion on the ground of colour. . . . That is exactly what the amendment beships on which fore us proposes to doThere is no objection to the exclusion of coloured persons otherwise than on the ground colour from the ships that are engaged in coasting trade of the Commonwealth or New Zealand, or in any other conditions where the colonial regulations under the law That is to say, the Imperial authorities ships have no objection to our providing that In every sailor on our coast shall be paid« not certain rates of wages, have certain space allotted to him, and shall be fed in a way, but they do object to the bar of colour.",26
36,Mr MATHEWS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Our objection is an economic one-no t one on the ground of colour.,26
37,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Exactly ; but if we, by our legislation, secure an economic standard which practically , bars the coloured races from competing, are we not accomplishing our end just as effecting tively, and, at the same time, not i way which not only embarrasses the B r i tish Government, but is highly objectionthere able to a great and powerful neighbour coloured peoples, simply as such. of ours, whose friendship, at all events, to a certain extent, is valuable? No one will say that we can afford to shake fist in the face of Japan and Chinathose great countries with enormous potentialities-and go scot-free for ever. Just as we value those national demands which compel us to ask for conditions i this country which we believe to be right from our own stand-point, the people of those countries have their national ings, and we cannot afford to ride roughthe shod over them in the manner proposed. Mr Cox went on to say: That is agreed. But His Majesty's vernment are trustees for enormous numbers of coloured people, and the Colonial Office not agree to the exclusion of British subjects of any race only on the ground of colour. Mr Lloyd George, who was acting as chairman of the Conference, referred the fact that the people of India are tremely sensitive on the question of colour. He said: - We are responsible for the government 300,000,000 of those people, and therefore could not possibly assent to the resolution posed, and I ask the colonial representatives not to ask us to do so. . . If it was proposed that no Hindoo should be employed ships on the coasting trade, I do not suppose that we could possibly assent to a law pressly framed in that way, because it is flection upon millions of the King's subjects. In deference to the wishes of the represible sentatives of the Imperial Government, the resolution * was withdrawn. I am giving the history of this matter in order to show honourable members that they w i l be absolutely imperilling the Bill itself insisting upon the amendment which been submitted. In 1910 the New Zealand Parliament passed a Bill providing for an increased stamp duty upon bills of lading and passenger tickets issued by ships trading from New Zealand to the Commonwealth, and which were manned vote wholly, or in part, by Asiatics. There, again, the directcolour line was drawn. That Bill was also reserved for the assent. In 1910 the matter was brought up by Sir Joseph Ward at the Imperial Conference in London, when the attitude of the British Government upon the ter was voiced by Lord Crewe, the Secretralians, tary of State for India, who, while the right of the Dominions to exclude n a cheap, competitive labour, of whatever - race or colour, made a strong appeal that should be no bar imposed on He pointed out that, as regards India, any disabilities imposed upon Indians in any our part of the British Empire was resented in India by all classes, creeds, and political schools, and that the fact of any such disability being imposed by any Dominion furnishes a powerful weapon to n those in India who are opposed to British rule, and who are directing all their energies to secure the secession of India feelfrom the Empire. The King's assent to New Zealand Bill was withheld, and the measure lapsed. There are thus three occasions upon which this question has arisen, and upon two of them-on e in Gowhich direct legislation was passed by this Parliament, and another in which similar canlegislation was enacted by the New Zealand Parliament, the King's assent was refused. In the third case the expressions of opinion by the representatives of the to Imperial - Government were such that the exDominion representatives withdrew the resolution altogether. I have no desire to labour this question by dealing with it of at greater length.. I am perfectly satiswe fied from the experience of the past that, proif this amendment be included in the Bill - the measure must in any circumstances in be reserved for the King's assent-that assent will not be given. By inserting the examendment, therefore, honourable members a rewill simply hang up the Bill for an in definite period, and thus make it imposfor the Government to proceed with the early proclamation of the Act , thereby depriving our seamen of all the advantages which they will ultimately derive l from its operation. In these circumstances by I have no hesitation in asking honourable has members to reject, the proposal.",26
38,Dr MALONEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Melbourne) [3.55] If the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) be pressed to a division, I shall certainly for it , because I am' anxious to maintain in its entirety our White Australia policy. At the same time, I do not wish King's a single word of mine to give offence to our Allies who helped to defend us. I recognise that, artistically, they are superior to any race in the world. matA n Eastern people have shown Auswho are descendants of the admitBritish race, how laggard we are, seeing that within the short of my own life-time they have learned to build anything from a mere schooner to an up-to-date Dreadnought. Theirs is an example which we may well follow. But for thirty years I have been returned to Parliament pledged to the policy which I am now advocating. tralians are the only race in the world which, owns a continent. It is our duty to preserve that continent as a heritage for white anen. Should it unfortunately happen that an Asiatic race dominate Australia, I hope that it will be dominated by the Chinese. briefly analyze the language used by the late Mr Joseph Chamberlain in discussing the proposal to prohibit the introduction of coloured immigrants by drawing a direct colour line. Mr Chamberlain was indeed a great man, especially from the standpoint of the facility which he could turn his coat whenever it suited him to do so. He stated that there should be no restriction upon race or colour, and that the natives of India are civilized and are our equals. As far as mere brain capacity is concerned, there is no race in the world which is equal to that of the Brahmins of India. Yet they were considered by Mr Chamberlain as not fit to be endowed with the franchise. They are subjects of the King, but they have not citizenship rights. We are subjects of the King truly, but we are also citizens in that we have the right to vote for our parliamentary representatives. recent war, Britain did not give her English, Scottish, Irish or Welsh the right to vote because of their manhood alone. There was always a property qualification attached to the exercise of the franchise. Yet this great man, Mr. Chamberlain, who well earned the title of Judas on account of his treachery to the great Gladstone, says that the Indians are civilized. Of course they are, but not a single vote has been given to them. Even the majority of the British themselves had no vote in Mr Chamberlain's day. They were not allowed to exercise the franchise until the war had taught manners to the aristocrats of England. Mr Asquith says that the Indians are our fellow subjects. a great admiration for Mr. abilities, but he would be a much bigger man if he travelled the world, and realized that under the British flag a greater Dr Maloney. space measure of freedom obtains everywhere else than obtains in the Homeland. coasting I am not criticising the attitude which has been adopted by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene). I recognise that he has delivered a great speech this afternoon- a speech which Ausmay possibly carry conviction to honourable members. But in the course of his remarks he stated that there has not been a' great change in Imperial matters since 1897. I entirely dissent-from that statemust ment. Why , today women in England have votes. They may also qualify for Let me the degree of M . D . at Cambridge, although they are not allowed to practise as doctors. In Great Britain the entire system of government has been turned upside down since 1897, and it is well that it has been. In my student days, in London, I can remember only three with occasions upon which Chinese were seen in that city. Upon each occasion a crowd followed them down the streets, because imposed they presented such a rare sight. In Australia, however, we may see any number of them. A very valuable report obtained by the late Mr Charles Cameron Kingston shows the great disparity which existed between the number of Chinese who touched at Darwin on board vessels, and the number who were upon the same ships when the latter made their return voyage. In lhy student days I did not see a lascar in London, but I met many Hindoos and Mahommedans, two of whom were beloved fellow-students of mine and remain Until the my friends at the present time. They were equal in mental ability to any Euroinhabitants pean, but were not thought fit to have a vote in their own country. Subjects, yes; but little better than slaves! One of them had graduated in the Middle Temple, and when, years afterwards, I saw him in Calcutta, knowing that he had been engaged to a relative of the Lord Chamberlain of England, I asked him, "" How is your sweetheart?"" he replied, "" Y o u had better say ' w if e ' now."" i asked, "" Is she here ?"" people He rose, to his splendid 6 feet of height, and said, ""Maloney, you do not think I would ask my wife to live in India ?"" I recent said, "" Why not?"" "" I will tell you,"" he replied. "" We are old friends, and you know how I am entitled in my own right I have to large revenues and a high position in Asquith'a this country; but I do not care to ask my wife to live i h India because ladies who would willingly dance with me in London pass me like dirt when they come out here married to some petty official. I not allow my w if e to be treated in way. I am going to dear old England live there."" Here was an Indian gentletion man, drawing large revenues, speaking of England as ""dear old England,"" and to the proposed new clause. going to live there because he could not live with his wife in India. The men India may not be slaves, they may be jects, but they are not citizens, because not one of the 350,000,000 inhabitants that country possesses a vote. Yet we have the Asquiths and the Chamberlains of England speaking in the way I have indicated. Even Mr Lloyd George way. says that India is very sensitive to colour. Another great gentleman-in his own opinion-a n Anglo-Indian, said to me he wished another rebellion would take place in India so that he could the people of Bombay walk in the road and uot on the footpaths, which so of them, as large property-owners in the city, are taxed to make and maintain. If these prominent English gentlemen whom I have referred would only go to Iudia. or come to Australia, or even go tn California, where the racial fight is even more acute than it, has ever been here, they would not refer so glibly "" fellow subjects."" Yes, fellow subjects, but with no right of citizenship! As it is, I could well understandthem refusing to pass this Bill if this proposed clause was inserted in it , but with future union of the British-speaking races - becaus e I recognise that if we can only shake hands with the great Union that dominates the American continent we can hold and keep the peace we so desirewe shall be able to apply to our coastal Anstey, F. trade whatever restrictions we choose to Blakeley, A. impose.

However, after the declaraof the Minister (Mr Greene) it is hopeless to expect the Committee to agree I quite recognise from the Minister's speech that of any shipping company which takes adsubvantage of our inter-State traffic must pay to its men the same rates of wages as of .are paid to white crews.",27
39,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,That is so. They must also provide them with the same accommodation and feed them in the same,29
40,Dr MALONEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"That being the case we have pretty well obtained all we desire to achieve by the proposed new clause. If the sugar-cane growers of Queensland make had been obliged to pay to the Kanakas the same wages as were paid to white many men. and to work them for the same hours, aud give them the same food, they would not have employed them. It was to the cheapness of the black labour that caused the growers tp import Kanakas to work i u their cane-fields, and to fight so hard to retain them. I shall vote for the proposed new clause if it is taken to a division, but I recognise that while we to are portion of the Empire the Minister could hardly take up any other attitude.

Question so resolved in the negative. Proposed new clause negatived.",29
41,Mr MATHEWS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Melbourne [4.14] - I move That the following new clause be added:"" Schedule II . of the principal Act by omitting from lines 2 and 3 of the paragraph headed ' Firemen and Trimmers' the words ' and a half'."" This will have the effect of reducing the amount of coal handled by a fireman or trimmer from 3£ tons to 3 tons per diem. This is a very controversial question, upon which the seamen's representatives endeavoured to come to some arrangement with the Minister, but without success. For a considerable time the seamen's representatives have been endeavouring to have the amount reduced. Some people believe, apparently, that all a fireman has to do is to shovel coal into the furnace and close the doors again, whereas the work has to be done in such a way as to prevent the fire from being smothered and to extract the greatest heat possible from the amount of coal consumed. The accessibility of bunkers to the f u r naces is an important factor in determining the amount of coal which any fireman or trimmer can handle in a day. Very often in a new ship trouble is made because the firemen and trimmers cannot get the most satisfactory results from the furnaces. There is just as much skill in this work as in many other callings, .and some firemen are highly skilled. As far back as 1911, when the Navigation Act was under consideration, Senator de Largie endeavoured to secure a reduction in the schedule, and the motion submitted by him would probably have been carried but for the promise of the Government to attend to certain matters. PAIBS It is just as well that the claims of the men should be again placed on recordThe present schedule provides for 3i tons per day per man, and we are of the opinion that the amount is too much. The Manning Committee of the British Board of Trade some years ago recommended that "" 3 tons of coal per man per day should be the allowance for .this purpose in temperate climates, and 2* . tons in tropical waters."" A great proportion of the Australian trade is confined to the tropics, but we are not asking for any distinction between tropics and the temperate zones, as far as the consumption of coal is cmcerned. But we do think that, when the Board of Trade Manning Committee recommends a less amount of coal per day in British ships than is provided for in the .present schedule, the Australian fireman should not be put on a different and worse footing than his fellow fireman in a British ship. Ports) Sir ROBERT BEST - Who m are you quoting ? ",30
42,Mr MATHEWS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I am quoting is amended statements made by the representatives of the seamen, based on the report of the Manning Committee of the British Board of Trade. Reference to pages 1017-1019 of Hansard of 1911 will show that the seamen unsuccessfully tried in that year to have the consumption of coal per man per day reduced to 3 tons, and the report of the Manning Committee of the B ritish Board of Trade is also referred to in the same pages. But since that date the world has advanced considerably, and if at that time the proposition, although not accepted, was recognised as fair, surely, having regard to the improvement in the conditions of all workers during the last nine years, the firemen are now entitled to a littl e consideration.",30
43,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Hav e the men to shift the specified quantity of coal in addition to the cleaning of the grates and all the other work?,30
44,Mr MATHEWS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Yes . The following is an extract from the British Board of Trade instructions in 1911 relating to the manning of emigrant shipsThe following scale has been prepared for the guidance of emigration officers with regard to the manning of the stoke-hold:One fireman for every 18 square feet of fire-grate surface in the boilers. The' number of'firemen is found by dividing the total fire-grate surface of all the main boilers and the nearest whole number is the number required. This rule is based on the assumption that an average of 16 lbs. of coal per hour will be consumed per square foot of grate surface. When, however, the coal consumption exceeds 3 tons per day per man employed on the boilers, the number of these men. must the correspondingly increased, and when the propelling machinery is duplicated, as in twin-screw steamers, the number of greasers must be doubled. Uuder the foregoing scale, firemen on these emigrant ships handle far less than 3 tons of coal perman per day.",30
45,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,And those conditions apply in a cold climate.,31
46,Mr MATHEWS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Yes . I shall quote now the scale of manning for Norwegian ships as fixed by a Royal Ordinance in .1918, and, surely, Australiau firemen are not expecting too much when they ask to be placed on as good a footing as are the NorwegiansThe number of firemen and coal-trimmers shall be determined in the following manner:There shall be at least one fireman for each 3 i .tons (in tropical waters 3 tons) of coal consumption per diem. . . . There shall, however, in all ships plying for more than sixteen hours or with a coal consumption of upwards of 7 tons per day be at least three firemen. For ships whose consumption of coal exceeds 8 tons, but not 18 tons a day, one coal-trimmer is required. If the consumption of coal exceeds IS tons, one additional coal-trimmer is required, and so on, for each additional 10 tons. If in the computation of the number of the firemen and the coal-trimmers there comes out a fractional part of one half or upwards, the same shall be counted as a whole number. Under the foregoing Norwegian scale a vessel consuming 42 tons of coal per day would be manned with twelve firemen and four trimmers while engaged in temperate climates, and in the tropics it would have to carry fourteen firemen and f o u r trimmers, whilst an Australian vessel under the present scale would be compelled to .carry only twelve firemen and trimmers combined, whether in the tropics or otherwise. Of course, those who are opposed to this claim maintain that the Norwegian Act is not as considerate to the seamen as is the Australian Navigation. Act. The seamen themselves, however, declare that the conditions of the Norwegian firemen and trimmers are much better than are provided for in the Australian legislation. This question has been discussed with the Minister (Mr Greene), who is disinclined to agree to the amendment. If the seamen were asking for conditions that did not obtain elsewhere we might expect a rebuff, but, having regard to the [217]- 2 fact that in all countries greater consideration has been given to the firemen and trimmers, and that nine years ago fchis concession was nearly made by this Parliament, the conditions should be improved in conformity with'the betterment of conditions that has taken place in every other calling. The Seamen's Union is of opinion that its members should not bo called upon to work under conditions that are worse than those obtaining in other countries. We claim to have set up a standard for Australian seamen that is higher than the standards of other countries ; the workers do not admit that claim, but this Parliament ought to take whatever steps are necessary to j u s t if y it .",31
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) .[4.28] - I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. This is one of the questions which the representatives of the seamen, discussed with me quite amicably. .1 decided that it was inadvisable to make the proposed amendment, but I left the seamen to take steps to te3t the feeling of Parliament in the matter. Of all questions which exercised the mind of the Committee which has investigated the whole subject of navigation, and upon whose report this Bill is largely based, that of stokehold management occupied more time and consideration than any other. The chief difficulty in the way of fixing a fair standard for work for firemen is complicated by the well-known fact that a great deal depends on the construction of the ship as to whether the task of handling three and a half tons of coal per man per day is too great or too small. In some ships the shifting of three and a half tons per day would be almost a herculean task, on other ships it would be very easy.",31
48,Mr MATHEWS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,In no ship would it be an easy task.,31
49,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"In an average ship, a man enjoying his full health and strength and capable of doing a good day's work, would not have to exert himself very much to shift three and a half tons of coal per day. But in some circumstances the task would be too great. The Navigation Committee recognised that fact and made certain recommendations which have been embodied in the Act. The impression conveyed by the remarks of the honorablfi member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Mathews) was that the three and a half tons per day is a fixed quantity, from which it is impossible to depart. That is not so. If honourable members turn to Schedule II . in the principal Act, which it is now proposed to amend, it will be seen thatThe number of firemen and trimmers required with steam-ships fired with coal shall in the proportion of at least one fireman or trimmer for every tons of coal consumed per diem. Provided that in the case of any particular ship the Minister may, after reference to the Marine Council, specify a greater or less number of firemen and trimmers to be required. The amount of coal consumed per diem should be ascertained by such means as are prescribed.",31
50,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I think that the word "" less "" should come out of that. . Mr MASSYGREENE - That provision was inserted in the principal Act by the Government of which the honourable member was a member. That principle was decided upon because it was practically i m possible to arrive at a standard which would be fair under all circumstances. The Minister has power to set up tribunals to decide the question with regard to any particular ship concerning which a complaint has been made with regard to the number of men in the stokehold. I believe the method will be found entirely satisfactory for dealing with the question. If we were to make it 3 tons as suggested it would be found that on some ships the quantity would be considered too large. I have been supplied with some particulars concerning fifty-seven ships now trading on the Australian coast which bears out what I have just stated. The figures relate to the vessels of the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, Australian Steamships Limited, Huddart, Parker Limited, Melbourne Steam-ship Company, J-ames Paterson, and the Australian TJnited Steam-ship Navigation Company L i m i ted. Of course, there are seventeen handling under 3 tons .per man, six handling over S i tons, nineteen handling under 3-}, but not exceeding 3-J tons, and fifteen handling over 3J, but not exceeding 3 i tons. It will he seen, therefore, that of the total number of ships there are today only six exceeding the maximum set out in the Act. There are seventeen vessels which at the present time are handling less than the quantity the seamen ask to be included in the Act. There are two things happening today. The ship-owners are taking S\ tons' as if it were the law of the Medes and the Persians, and saying that they are not going to agree to any alterations, because there is power to make an alteration in the case of certain ships. On the other hand, the seamen are saying that they be w i ll not man the ships if the firemen are called upon to handle more than 3 tons.",32
51,Mr MAXWELL,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Is there anything unusual in the construction of the six ships mentioned by the Minister?,32
52,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I cannot say; but I believe the arrangements' in the bunkers are such that the men can handle a greater quantity of coal with the same amount of labour and effort. Of course, this is a question which, when once the Act is proclaimed, can be dealt with by a tribunal. At the conferences I have had with the ship-owners and seamen I have offered to at once proceed with the appointment of a tribunal to deal with individual ships, and, although the decisions of a tribunal will not have the force of law, they should be just as effective if both parties agree to accept the terms decided upon. Up to the present, however, that offer has not been accepted, but I am making it again, and am giving a definite assurance to proceed at once to utilize the machinery which we have at our disposal for establishing a tribunal.",32
53,Mr BUKCHELL,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Who is objecting?,32
54,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I believe both parties object, but at the moment I am not prepared to say definitely whether the shipowners are opposed to the procedure I have outlined. At all events, I am making the offer again, because I feel sure that whatever standard were adopted we should have some measure of give and take, as it would be impracticable to have a binding scale for every type of ship. U n t il the measure has had a fair t r i a l, I consider it undesirable to make any amendment? in the direction indicated, because I think it will bo found, in practice, that the procedure I have suggested will be the means of working equitably. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.",32
55,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"South Sydney) [4.36] This is an instance where I think the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene) should yield to the demands of the men, as they have for a considerable time been handling 34 tons. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Mathews) quoted the practice in other countries, and showed that on some vessels of other nationalities a much smaller quantity is handled. The firemen and trimmers have exceptionally hard work to perform under trying circumstances, and, in addition to handling coal, the firemen have to keep up steam. The Minister has suggested that there should be some give and take, and it appears to me that the. shipowners do all the taking.",32
56,Mr GREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The honourable member must admit that on some vessels they are not handling the quantity mentioned in the amendment.,33
57,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I am coming to that. Does the Minister suggest that there are only six or seven ships on which the firemen handle 3£ tons? Mr GREENE"" - More than that. There are only six on which the firemen handle over 34 tons.",33
58,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Has the Minister figures showing the number of shins on which the men handle 3 tons 1,33
59,Mr GREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The figures are: Under 3 tons, 17; over 3J tons, 6; under 34, tons, but not exceeding 3£ tons, 19; over 3£ tons, but not exceeding 34. tons, 15. The proposal, therefore, would affect, altogether, 40 ships out of a total of 57.",33
60,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"E v e n if the proposal did affect that number that is no reason why it should be rejected. I understand that quite a number of ships have been tied up because there has been a dispute as to the quantity of coal to be handled. The number of ships on which the men are called upon to handle a lesser quantity is certainly small, and it is quite possible that they may be inconvenient to work. It is more than likely that the men who are handling the smaller quantity are working harder than those who are handling a larger tonnage. I have seen men emerging from the stokehold tired and pale-faced, and in some in stances almost human wrecks. that it is a most undesirable and arduous occupation, I think the Minister would be justified in acceding to the demands of the men. What is the position when a vote is taken on such an amendment as this ? The division bells ring, and honourable members supporting the Government enter the chamber and occupy the same side as Ministers. They have not heard the arguments on which the division is being taken.",33
61,Mr MAXWELL,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,That applies to both parties..,33
62,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I know it does, and, unfortunately for the seamen, we are in a minority. Had the Labour party been in power I am sure we would have granted the seamen's request in this instance, because all over the civilized world labour conditions have been considerably improved during recent years. During the war period, firemen, in particular, were subjected to all kinds of dangers from submarines, and there was never an instance where they left their work. They stuck to their job. They ran the blockade and carried our troops. Now that the war is over all that they ask is that they shall be brought into line in this respect with their fellow firemen in other parts. They say that this amendment is vital to industrial peace, so far as seafaring men are concerned, and, therefore, of the utmost importance to the commerce of the country, yet the the Minister will not agree to it . The shipowners would not be seriously affected by it. Firemen are not the white slaves that they used to be, and I regret that the Minister has not seen fit to concede this request on the part of the union. I hope that Ministerial supporters will show that they hav.e some humane feeling by voting for the proposed new clause.",33
63,Mr MATHEWS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Melbourne Ports) [4.41] - The Minister (Mr Greene), in dealing with my proposed new clause, laid stress on the (point that it was not so much the weight of coal as the question of the accessibility of the bunkers that had to be considered. The quantity of coal which the men have to handle is, in my opinion, the all-important consideration. I wish to emphasize that point. I do not know whether many honourable members have had much experience of the handling of coal, but I have read some sensational statements as to the heavy work done by firemen on American ships. This Seeing matter was threshed out by Congress. The Americans have the reputation of being great ""hustlers,"" and Congress has found it necessary to ameliorate very considerably the conditions of firemen. As the result of careful investigation it took action in that direction. Honourable .members have not had an opportunity to in quire into this question, and many are prepared to leave it to the judgment of practical imen, who guide the Government in regard to these questions. I have nothing to say of those experts except that they are not at present working, as firemen, and apparently are unable to appreciate the average fireman's point of view. I repeat that the weight of coal handled per day governs the situation more largely than does anything else, and I hope that honourable members in coming to a decision on this question will not be influenced by what has been said by the Minister as to the accessibility or otherwise of the coal bunkers.

It provides for the amendment of 39 of the principal Act by the in sertion of several new sub-sections, one of which readsNo seaman shall be rated as "" shipwright "" or "" ship's carpenter"" who has not served an apprenticeship as shipwright, or three years at sea as ship's carpenter, as the case may be. 8 - In the event of the clause being recomAYES. mitted, I shall move for the omission of the words "" or three years at sea as ship's carpenter, as the case may be."" ' If those words be retained, it will be possible for any man who has served three years at sea to be classed as a ship's carpenter.",34
65,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,In what connection?,34
66,Mr WATKINS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Who is to determine NOES. whether or not a man who has been at sea for three years is a qualified ship's carpenter ? It is admitted that one of the most important men on board a ship is the ship's carpenter, who is called upon in case of accident to effect repairs.",34
67,Mr MAXWELL,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The man who is known as "" Chips.""",34
68,Mr WATKINS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Yes , and he has too often been rated as chips. It was fortunate there was on board the John PAIRS. Mwrray, when that vessel was wrecked, a qualified ship's carpenter, who was able to repair the boats, and so enabled the crew to be saved. The position would - be serious if , in the event of .an accident to a ship, there was not on board a shipwright who could repair a boat, or make a r a f t , or who did not know the vessel from stem to stern. I do not object to the further provision in the clause that persons rated as shipwrights or ships' carpenters "" before the commencement of this division, shall continue to be entitled to be so rated."" That provision is in keeping with a section in the Coal Mines Regulation Act under which certificates were issued to men who, at the time of the passing, of the Act , were at work in the mines, so that they might continue in their employment. I do not wish to impose any hardship on those now employed as shipwrights or ships' carpenters, but we should enact that, after the coming, into operation of this Act, no seaman shall be rated as a shipwright or ship's carpenter who has not served an apprenticeship as a shipwright.",34
69,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Then the honourable member desires that every ship's' carpenter shall be a shipwright?,35
70,Mr WATKINS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,In what respect do the two callings differ?,35
71,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,They are two different trades.,35
72,Mr WATKINS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I hope the Minister will agree to recommit the clause.,35
73,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Eichmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [4.56] - The question, which the honourable member's amendment involves, has been threshed out time after time in this House. It really arises from a squabble between the Shipwrights Union and the Snips' Carpenters Union. The Shipwrights belong to the Shipwrights Union, and the Ships' Carpenters to the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners. wrights have tried by one means and another to prevent ships' carpenters being employed on our coast.",35
74,Mr MAXWELL,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,What is the difference years as a ship's carpenter. between them?,35
75,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"T h ere is a difference. The shipwright, I understand, is a man who has served an apprenticeship in the actual building of steel ships. The ship's carpenter is gradually passing away, as steel ships are entirely replacing the wooden ships. Nevertheless, quite a number of men employed on our coast have served their time as ships' carpenters, and they are ships' carpenters.",35
76,Mr WATKINS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The clause does not refer only to them, but to any one who may be employed in that position.",35
77,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"When the Bill was previously under consideration, the Committee was divided on an amendment submitted by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) dealing with this matter, and the amendment was negatived by a vote of 30 to 9. I cannot see any object in again threshing the subject out, - with probably the same result. the circumstances, I must oppose the amendment.",35
78,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Hunter ) [4.58] Since we dealt with this matter on a previous occasion, a deputation of shipwrights waited upon the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) and myself in connection with it . They pointed out that what they desired is that in future only men who have qualified as shipwrights shall be appointed to the position of ship's carpenter. They haye no desire to secure the discharge of men now engaged as ships' carpenters, but simply that qualified men only shall be engaged in this - position in the future . The honourable member for Newcastle desires to have struck out the words "" or three years at sea as a ship's carpenter as the case may be,"" which appear to us to mean that any man who has been at sea as a ship's carpenter may, i u future, the appointed to this position.",35
79,Mr WATKINS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,F o r all time.,35
80,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The shipwrights contend that that is wrong, and that no man should be appointed to the position who is not a skilled man. The ship- Mr MASSYGREENE - Unde r this Bill , in future uo man can be rated as a ship's carpenter if he has not, prior to the proclamation of the Act, served for three No new man, the honourable member will see, can bo so rated. This provision is giving the whole business to the shipwrights in future.",35
81,Mr WATKINS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Not if an amateur may be employed.,35
82,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"That cannot be. Under the Bill as it stands, a shipwright can be rated in this position so long as he produces his indentures, but a ship's carpenter cannot be so rated unless he has served three years as a ship's carpenter before the proclamation of the Act.",35
83,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The shipwrights object to that. They say that a man who has had three years' service on a ship is not necessarily a qualified man. He is, in their opinion, in the same position as an improver or rough and ready carpenter compared with a man who has served his time as a carpenter. In Mr MASSYGREENE - What the shipwrights have been trying to do all along is to throw the ships' carpenters out of their jobs, and the Government will not consent to do that.",35
84,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The Minister referred to a division of 30 to 9 upon an amendment submitted by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor). The vote was in favour of retaining sub-clause 7, which readsNotwithstanding anything contained in this section, persons rated as greasers, firemen, shipwrights, or ships' carpenters before the commencement of this Division shall continue to be entitled to be so rated. I believe that I voted against my leader on that occasion, because I considered that those now in employment as ships' carpenters should be allowed to retain their positions. I wish to prevent the employment of unqualified men in the future.",36
85,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I assure the honourable member that under the Bill as it stands no man can in future be signed on as a ship's carpenter in Australia unless before the Act comes into force he has served for three years as a ship's carpenter.,36
86,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Then if after the Act comes into force a man has not served three years ou a boat as a ship's carpenter, he will not be eligible to be appointed to that position?",36
87,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,He cannot be rated as a ship's carpenter.,36
88,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,He cannot be taken on a3 ship's carpenter?,36
89,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,No .,36
90,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I see the position which the Minister puts, but I draw different conclusion from my reading the provision. It seems to me that the clause as it stands any man who has readsbeeu employed on a ship for three years will be eligible for appointment as a ship's carpenter.",36
91,Mr MAXWELL,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,No . He must have served for three years as a shiij's penter.,36
92,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,He must have been ticular three years rated as ship's carpenter fore the proclamation of the Act.,36
93,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Who rates him?,36
94,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The superintendent; and in future he cannot rate a man as ship's carpenter unless he has had three years' previous rating in that position.,36
95,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Will the Minister say that if the captain of a ship employs a man for three years on board a ship will not be eligible for employment as a ship's carpenter under this provision.?,36
96,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,What I say is that unless a man has had three years' service - as ship's carpenter he cannot be signed ou in future as a ship's carpenter.,36
97,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I quite understand that.,36
98,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"If a man has served for only, two years as a ship's carpenter when the Act is proclaimed, the superintendent who has to determine the ratings of men will be unable to sign him on in that position. So that such a man can never secure the three years' service which would entitle hi m to that rating.",36
99,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I am doubtful whether the clause bears the construction which the Minister puts upon it . Do I understand the Minister to say that if a man has not served for three years as a ship's carpenter he cannot, after the passing of the Act, be appointed to that position at any time?",36
100,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I say in regard to all Australian men, that unless a man has for three years served and been rated as a ship's carpenter before the proclamation of the Act, it will be quite impossible for him in - f u t u re to be rated as a ship's carpenter.",36
101,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"If that is so, that will satisfy me.",36
102,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Y a r r a ) [ 5 . 5 . ] - I regret that the Minister will not agree to the recommittal of clause 13, so that we may properly discuss the question with which a it deals. When the clause was originally of before the Committee some weeks ago, I under moved the omission of sub-.clause 7, which Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, persons .rated as greasers, firemen, shipwrights, or ships' carpenters before the commencement of this Division shall continue carto be entitled to be so rated. A man might have been doing that jparclass of work for only three months, beyet he could be rated as a ship's carpenter, provided that the organizations concerned did not object.",36
103,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The proviso in subclause 7 applies to the existing conditions.,36
104,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I am aware of that.,36
105,Mr SPEAKER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Order ! This discussion is really out of order.,36
106,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I am giving the reasons why clause 13 should be considered on he recommittal, *in order that we may have an opportunity to secure the employment in this position of only skilled men. If there is a man on board a ship who should be a skilled man it is the ship's carpenter. Y o u , Mr Speaker, and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), who have had sea-faring experience, will know that in time of danger the man who is looked to is the ship's carpenter. If boats are stove in , the only man who can repair them is the ship's carpenter, and if he be a shipwright he will have had the better experience. I think that the Minister should give us an opportunity to reconsider the clause, so that we might set forth the reasons for the amendment it is desired to move in it . Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. In Committee (Recommittal) : Clause SSection (6) of the principal Act is amended.",36
107,Mr MASSYGREENE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [ 5 . 8 ] - I move That after the word "" amended "" the following words be inserted:"" (aa) by omitting from the definition of ' limited coast-trade ship' the words ' (noj; exceeding a radius of four hundred miles)' and inserting in their stead the - words ' (not exceeding the limits for homethe ordinary way. trade or coast-trade ships, as the case may be, fixed for the port, at the commencement of this section, by any State law)'; "" (ab) by adding at the endof the definition of ' River and bay ship' the words ' and also includes any ship or class of ships, specified by the Minister, by notice in the Gazette, whioh trades exclusively within the limits of a specified port, bay, or river, and witbin a radius of three nautical miles seaward from the entrance of the port, bay, or river:'; "".",37
108,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Hunter) [ 5 . 9 ] - I should like to know whether this amendment will apply to small boats running on the rivers, and not ordinarily used in carrying passengers. On the rivers in New South Wales there are many small boats engaged in carrying butter and other produce, but on holidays they are sometimes engaged by people for picnics. If boats of this character are to come under the Act their owners will be put to considerable expense to comply, for example, with the necessity for providing lifebelts for each passenger. If such a vessel could carry 200 passengers it would not be worth the while of the parties interested to equip her with 200 lifebelts for the purposes of conducting some two or three trips in a year; and, really, there is no considerable factor of danger, as the rivers in which the boats ply are often so narrow that one can practically leap from the deck to the land. . Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.12] - This provision will not alter the law in so far as it applies to river and bay ships, except that it will enable the Minister to meet special cases where it is necessary for a vessel, to which the provisions of the Act relating to river and bay ships apply, to proceed to sea for various purposes. There are, for example, dredges which take silt out of harbors. These belong to the river and bay class of ship, within the meaning of the Act, and they are not required to comply with the various conditions attaching to ocean-going vessels. The moment they go "" outside,"" however, under the Act, as it stands, they cease to be river and bay ships. The object of the amendment is to enable the Minister to permit such craft, although.river and bay ships, to proceed to sea for 3 nautical miles without being compelled to comply with the special conditions such as must be observed by ships proceeding to sea in Of course, vessels which do not go "" outside "" at all will not be in any way affected.",37
109,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I am satisfied with the assurance.,37
110,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Y a r r a ) [ 5 . 1 5 ] - I take it that the officials of the Department would always be careful, before granting permission in such circumstances as the M in ister has indicated, to see that proper facilities were provided-on board the ship. I hold that all vessels, no matter of what class, should be equipped with efficient life-saving apparatus. That applies not only to craft of the kin d indicated by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton)-seein g that disastrous collisions may occur in narrow waterways but official authority should extend also to river craft, such as one sees at Henleyon-Yarra. Scores of people are crowded dangerously upon a fancily-decked boat, the decorations of which are such that the passengers are practically caged in . Far more adequate provisions for safeguarding life should be insisted upon. Amendment agreed to. - Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 10 (Certificates of competency).",37

SECOND READING .",38
114,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Darling Downs-Minister for ""Works and Railways) [ 5 . 2 6 ] move That this Bill be now read a second time. There are four measures in connection ,with the Public Service with which' Parliament may have to deal. The first, which deals with Public Service arbitrathat tion, has already been passed, and is the now on the statute-book. The next is the Bill , now before this House, dealclassification, ing with the management of the Service. The third will be a general amending Bill , which is now being prepared mission to the House, and which deals with the whole of the existing A c and proposed amendments to it . The fourth, which we trust will be introduced at no distant date, will deal annuation in the Public Service. Bill , now before the House, relates only to the proposed Board of Management, and is in some measure the outcome of the work done by the Royal Commission recently appointed to report upon the public expenditure of Commonwealth with a view to effecting economies. Practically only one ciple, the substitution of a Board of follows: Management consisting of three persons for the existing Public Service Commissioner, is involved in this Bill . Board will consist of a Chairman and two other members. One will be appointed for five years, another for four years, and another for three, so far as the first three members are concerned. A f t e r that, the proposal is to give each member a definite term not exceeding five years. The idea of rotation is introduced in order to secure continuity in the policy and administration of the Board.",39
115,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Is the Chairman to be . appointed for five years?,39
116,Mr GRQOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Presumabl y that will be so. No salary is set out in the Bill , because it originated with the Senate. The salary will be introduced in this House by amendments recommended by an appropriating message. The proposal is to give a salary of £2,000 a year to the Chairman, and £1,500 a year to each o l the other members. The Chairman's salary will harmonize with that fixed for the Public Service A r b it r ator. These two offices will be put, as-regards salary, on terms of equality. Themembers of the Board are to have an assured position, because they will be re- I movable only by joint resolution of both Houses. The Bill does not purport to amend in any way the general provisions of the Public Service Act . We can this consider the proposed Board of Management in relation to the powers now exist under the Act . If Board is appointed, it will fulfil al l those functions with respect to grading, promotion, transfer, and so for t h that are now performed by the Public Service Commissioner, but in addition for subthe Board is tb be given very important duties which are the direct result of t , the recommendations of the Economies Commission. Clause 11 defines the added duties to be imposed upon theBoard. with superThe clause providesThe In addition to such duties as are elsewhere in this Act imposed on it, the Board shall have the following duties :(a) To devise means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the .management and working of Departments. the Then various ways are set out, by which the Board is to effect economies and imprinprove the management of the Service, as (i) improved organization and procedure; (ii) closer supervision; The (iii) the simplification of the work of each Department, and the abolition of unnecessary work; (iv) the co-ordination of the work of the various Departments; (v) the limitation of the staffs of the various Departments to actual requirements, and the utilization of those staffs to the best advantage; (vi) the improvement of the training officers; (vii) the avoidance of unnecessary expenThe diture ; (viii) the advising upon systems methods adopted in regard tracts and for obtaining and upon contracts referred Board by a Minister; and (ix) the establishment in order to ascertain whether the return for expenditure is adequate; These are all duties of a new character, and additional to those contained in the Act. They set out the principles of management for the Service, and, parrecommendation ticularly in paragraph (viii) , new and important functions. The idea is that, in addition to supervising the whole Service, as regards the fixing salaries, classification, grading, promoI tion, and transfer, the Board will have a wider scope enabling it look into the management Service as a whole, and, in particular, to advise, from a business stand-point, upon new contracts, and upon contracts that are being carried out. It will keep better supervision over expenditure, and devise a system of checking in order see that value is obtained spent.

I do not wish to deal now with.. matters to bo provided for in the new Pul> lie Service Bill, but only with the problem as it presents itself, and assuming that the Board of Management has to do the work of the Commissioner under the - existing law. I ask 'honourable members tb study the report of Mr MCLachlan, who is now outside the Service, and able, as a capable man, to give us the benefit of his many years' experience. We may, of course, disagree with parts of that re : port, but, at the same time, it brings out most important facts and circumstances for the consideration of the Government and Parliament. First of all, ""the Board of Management will take over the full control of all the public servants,, and that, in itself, is an important change. We have provided, as regards the decisions of the Board, so far as they are matters for submission to arbitration, that the decisions will be subject to the rights of the persons and associations affected.",41
134,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,That is only in regard to 1 wages.,42
135,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"It iB in regard to wages, conditions, and so forth, as set out in the Act.",42
136,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Why not clude the casual employees ?,42
137,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I am not how dealing with the amending of the general law relating to public servants; that ie a matter which will come up for discussion under another Bill. There is no reason, seeing that the business side is urgent, why we should not appoint this Board and get it to work as soon as possible. If , as a. result, the Board could advise us in any way in the amending of the general law, we shall not have made a mistake in its early constitution. I desire to take thisopportunity to pay a tribute to the Publio Service of the Commonwealth, which is the subject of a great deal of criticism. We read and hear remarks made about the increasing expenditure, and are asked why we cannot go back to that"" of 1913-14.",42
138,Mr MAXWELL,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Some would have VB go back to 1901.,42
139,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"O r even further-to the days of Adam and Eve. Would those organizations and companies which - criticise the Public Service, and the expenditure in connection with it , show their own present balance-sheete, and compare them in the same way with' their balance-sheets of 19J3-14? Are those organizations'and; companies paying the same wages* now' as they did then ? Are they purchasing m.a*terial at the same prices, and making the same charges for the articles they. pro-' duce? It is only fair that people who indulge in such criticism should applythe dame - methods to the management of their own affairs. However, I do not wish to unduly press that point now. Ever since the establishment of the Federation, the Commonwealth Public Service has been carrying put its duties in a, more.efficient manner than they are generally given credit for. I - have had a good many years' experience of the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and I know that it is only when some little difficulty arises that we hear this criticism; when the thousand and one duties are performed efficiently and well, and no ' friction is observable, not a word of praise is forthcoming. Many of the men who. were in the Service at the beginning of Federation have now retired, and it is only just to express some gratitude .for. what they have done for-the country. I speak with some feeling on the matter, because it was my duty, in 1905, to introin- duce the first measure, for the classification of the whole Public Service. Up to that time we had been working under six different systems, all conferring differentrights and duties on those concerned, and we had to introduce a series of legislative Acts' affecting the business of the whole .of the continent. When we look back, as we can now, with some historical perspective, we can appreciate the comparative smoothness with which, the woTk has been conducted. When an occasion like this presents itself, it is only fair to express our appreciation.",42
140,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,It is only fair to say that a great deal of the inefficiency in the past was due as much to Ministers as to public servants.,42
141,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"^Perhaps Parliament may sometimes, in its rashness, cause.difficulties in this connection. However; it is a fitting time, when reviewing our Public Service, to place on record the facts that I have mentioned. What was suitable for 1905 is not suitable for. 1920-21, and it becomes necessary to review the position, in the interests of the public generally, and also of the public servants. The first step we are taking is the appointment of a Board of Management, and in regard to this I refer honourable members to the report of the Economy Commission, Part VIII . , page «5, in order that they may appreciate the motives which actuate the Government. Throughout the war, other business men gave us most useful assistance in connection with the administration of our public activities, and they deserve the thanks of the country. The Economies Commission says. The outstanding feature in connection with the conduct of business in those' Federal Government Departments which have been investigated by the Commission to date is the absence of systematic control or check upon the economical working of the Departments. Not only is there no systematic, comprehensive, and continuous check upon the economical and efficient working of the Departments individually by heads of Departments, or as a whole by the Public Service Commissioner, hut this duty is not recognised by these officers as a part of their work. This does not necessarily mean, nor is tended to convey, that all branches of the work of all the Departments is extravagant and inefficient, for we have had the pleasure of investigating some branches which are admirably managed, the work being economically and efficiently conducted in spite of the absence of any satisfactory control over economy and efficiency by the head of the Department and Public Service Commissioner. Such results, however, are attributable to some officers satisfying self-imposed standards. Again, upon page 86 of their report Commission make a specific recommenciently, dation which has been embodied' in this Bill. Paragraph 34 of their readsI t seems to us that the duty of maintaining such safeguards upon the economical and effiInspectors ? cient working of the Departments should be performed by some authority quite independent of the Departments themselves, and as free with them. from the possibility of its powers of healthy criticism being in any way impaired or midated, as the Auditor-General is into his checks upon the accurate and honest accounting. This duty should bo performed by a Board of Management for public services, of three persons, whose appointment should be for a term of years, and whose should be on the principle of rotation to insure continuity of policy and with eligibility of re-appointment. The members of Board should be partly recruited from persons with outside business experience. It is considered that the conditions in regard suspension or dismissal of any member of sueh Board for incapacity, incompetence, or misbehaviour should be similar to those which to the Auditor-General's. It should be the duty of the Board of Management for public services to devise means of measuring the economical efficiency of each and every Department throughout the Commonwealth, and to continually apply these measurements to actual performance. The Board of Management should take steps to obtain data which will enable it to detect evidence of extravagant working; this data would serve the purpose of a general indicator, and point to the branch or area in which reductions in expenditure might be looked for. Upon any indication of costly working, it should be immediately investigated by inspection by qualified officers for the purpose of ascertaining whether the high costs are due to unavoidable causes or to extravagance. The Commission makes it perfectly clear that it does not believe in interference with Ministerial responsibility. Upon this point it says The Commission, whilst recognising that the public and Parliament rightly demands that there shall be unimpaired Ministerial responsibility for all matters of policy and the avoidance of the evils of bureaucracy, also recognises that the public rightly demands that it insafeguards shall be set up which will insure in all cases that unnecessary or indiscreet expenditure or costly working by whomsoever authorized, and notwithstanding who is responsible, will be brought under the notice of Parliament and the public. The machinery in the Bill, to which I referred earlier in my remarks, will exactly carry out the desire of the Commission in that regard. The Commission further suggests that in order that the the Board may carry out its duties effiseeing that the inspectorial staff for which provision is made in the existreport ing law will disappear",42
142,Mr EICHARD POSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Is it proposed to abolish the offices of the Public Service,43
143,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Yes , but it does not follow that the inspectorial duties will go The Commission look for 7 intiward to' a more efficient system. I think regard that the Public Service Commissioner himself agrees that it is impossible for one inspector to inspect all the Departconsisting ments of an entire State.",43
144,Mr BILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"""What does the Minister retirement mean by ""inspect""?",43
145,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The duties of an in the spector are defined in the existing Act.,43

148,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The Government are merely juggling with names.,44
149,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"We are doing more than that. Paragraph 40 of the Commission's Report readsIt is necessary that there shall be attached to the staff of the Board of Management a small staff of technical officers, expert in different classes of work. These officers should not only be utilized continuously for investigating the economical efficiency of the work in which they are expert in the various Departments of the different States, but should be utilized for the purpose of advising the Board in regard to the rates of pay and efficiency of officers of the Public Service in the technical grades, as it is impossible, under the existing system, for this work to be other than a pretence.",44
150,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,What is the Public Service Arbitrator to do ?,44
151,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The duties of an in spector are entirely different from those of an Arbitrator. The latter will have to decide what salary should be paid to an oflicer in certain circumstances.,44

157,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Provisio n is to be made for a proper inspection of the Public Services of the Commonwealth upon modern business lines. That is a very desirable thing. I have shown that the Bill is the result of careful inquiry by the Commission into what they believe will make for economy and efficiency in the administration of our Public 'Service. upon the report of the Commission. I wish now to emphasize the added duties which will be placed upon the Board by virtue of this measure. I in vite the attention of honourable members to that part of the measure which will vest the Board of Management with powers in respect to contracts and expenditure. During the year 1918-19 the expenditure under ordinary votes for all Departments of the Commonwealth was £16,518,792. The expenditure upon new. works, buildingsj and sites for all Departments during the same year amounted to £2,186,176.",44
158,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Does that include Defence?,44
159,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"It includes the general administration of all the Departments, eliminating war expenditure or recurring expenditure such as special payments to the States, &c.",44
160,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,It covers administration upon the civil side?,44
161,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"And upon the Defence side also. I do not commit myself to the statement that these figures cover all the expenditure, but I wish to convey some idea of the magnitude of the expenditure that is connected with the general working of our Public Service Departments. This is part of the area over which the Board of Management will exercise supervision. It will be able to investigate the question whether there is a lack of co-ordination in a Department, an absence of system in the checking of expenditure, an ineffective system connected with the costing of works, or whether any contract for supplies ought to be looked into with a view to improving the position. A lot of this woi-k will be detailed; it will be close investigation work, which will require constant supervision. In many instances it cannot be undertaken by the heads of Departments. Obl l e r viously there ought to be some supervision exercised over our expenditure similar to that which is exercised by the Auditor-General over our accounts. The Bill will insure efficiency and economy in our Public Service. That is the reason why we propose to appoint a Board of three members in lieu of a Public Service Commissioner. I have now shortly stated the general purpose of the Bill . HonorI t is based able members will recognise that it3 in troduction has been rendered necessary by the growth and development of our Public Service, and by the increased activities of modern government.",44
162,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Do the Ministry expect that the Bill will obviate the necessity for the creation of a business Board to manage the Postal and Telegraph Department?,44
163,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I think that the Board of Management for the Public Service will cover a great deal of the work which would have been performed by a Postal Commission. It will insure a good deal of increased supervision and checking upon business lines, which was the object underlying the proposal to establish a Postal Commission. I hope that honourable members will assist us to get the measure through Committee as speedily a? possible in order that we may get the benefit of the experience and advice which will be at the command of the proposed Board of Management.",45

189,Mr BRENNAN,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Batman) [ 6 . 2 4 ] should like to say a few words in opposiI tion to the acceptance of this proposed right away. new clause. I happened to be in another place when this question came before that Chamber, and I noticed, with some interest, that the representatives of the Government there sturdily opposed the proposition that is now before the mittee'. Thely opposed it consistently with the attitude taken up by the Miniscourse ter in charge of the Bill who, when the Bill was before honourable members before, could not see his way butM rnot to accept it at the instance of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). I do not criticise the Government merely on the ground that they change their mind, even though they have done so so brief a time as on this occasion; especially when they make such frequent and such grave mistakes. I am opposed to the acceptance of this amendment, because of its demerits. Everybody knows that the righ t of an organization rules for its members is the righ t which every individual in this community joys to make cobtraicts, free contracts, with other members of the community for the regulation of conduct and for their mutual welfare.' The rules of an organization represent the contract made by its members for their own protection; and they are accepted as the result ofdeliberation as to what is best to be done, in their own interests, in governing the conduct of its members. This proposal is of very grave importance, because it seeks to limit , in a very arbitrary way, the right of members of an organization to make rules for their own protection amongst themselves. And in a very curious way it overrides the principle, which I always thought was sacred to members on the other side of this chamber, namely, the righ t of freedom of contract. It may be said, in answer to this, that the Government desire to uphold the right of freedom of contract, and for that reason they have set o u t to coerce members of organizations who desire to make their rules in a particular way for their own protection. The clause says The rules of an organization registered under this Aet, and the ofncials of sueh organization, shall not during the currency of an award in the industry concerned prevent or impede any members of such organization from entering into written agreements in accordance witli such award at any time - I prior to the commencement of serviee.",47

It is drafted and instigated by one body alone-the Graziers Association of New South Wales-and is aimed directly and solely at the Australian Workers Union. Since 1007 the Australian Workers Union has been working under awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and until quite recently no member was prevented from signing agreements prior to roll-call. But cause of the actions of certain pastoralists throughout Australia, who attempted to get an advantage from the men by charging them high prices for their meat, the Australian Workers Union was practically compelled to add a rule to its constitution to prevent members from signing agreements prior to roll-call at the shed. Having signed no prior agreement, the men, on arrival at the shed, were in a position to prevent exploitation by the pastoralists through charges of 6d. to Is. per lb. for meat. In some instances the squatters have positively refused to supply the men with meat, and in one case the men were compelled to send 30 miles for meat.",48

200,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The honourable member may accept my assurance that amendment will affect. there are; hence the necessity for rule 112 in the Australian Workers Union constitution. This year, for the first time in the history of the industry, the agreement made between the Graziers Association and the Pastoralists Unions of the different States and the Australian Workers Union included a fixed price for meat, with the result that, no matter where a member contracts to shear, he knows before he goes to the station what price he will pay for his meat. On four occasions during the last five years we endeavoured to induce the Pastoralists Unions and the Graziers Associations to come to an agreement as to the price of meat, but not until this year was a satisfactory arrangement made. Immediately that agreement was signed the Australian Workers Union agreed to suspend the operation of rule 112, and this year members of the union are making their arrangements prior to going to the sheds. If this amendment, which is instigated by the Graziers Association of New South Wales, and is aimed at the Australian Workers Union, is brought into operation the shearers will be compelled to pay-if the union will allow them to do so-an y price for meat that the pastoralists themselves may fix. They will thus be completely at the mercy of the dishonest squatters of whom, unfortunately, there are quite a number. This proposal is not new. In 1917 the be- present Government were approached by the Graziers Association of New South Wales, and again in 1919 by the secretary of that organization. When this amendment was moved during the course of the Bill's progress through this House, the Minister in charge refused to accept it, but apparently sufficient pressure was brought to bear to induce the Government to accept the amendment when it was proposed in another place. Honourable members should not allow an organization of employers to use this Legislature for the purpose of getting amendments made to the Act, in order to hit at certain members of the Australian Workers Union. I hope that the Committee will refuse to accept the amendment, because, notwithstanding what may be said by honourable members opposite, Austhere is no union covered by an award of the Arbitration Court, other than the Australian Workers Union, which the",48

But this amendment, combined with the action of the Governenabling ment in forcing Mr Justice Higgins out of the Court, and substituting Mr Justice Starke, will completely destroy the f a it of the Australian Workers Union in Arbitration. If the Parliament desires industrial peace it should not act at the behest of any one organization such as the Graziers other Association of New South Wales. amendment was drafted by Mr Knox, now the Federal Chief Justice, in 1917, and was incorporated in a letter sent to the present Minister for Works and Railalthough ways (Mr Groom), and many other memrule bers of this House, and the Senate.",49
208,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I cho not know that the amendment was drafted by him, but I think he stated that it was quite stitutional.",49
209,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I shall read to the Committee the following letter addressed fixed in by Mr J. W . Allen, Secretary of the Graziers Association of New South Wales, to the then Acting Attorney General (Mr Groom), which' sets out Both clearly what is desired by the graziers: 17th April, 1919 Sir, COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION ACT - PROPOSE D AMENDMENT RE. SIGNING SHEARING AGREEMENTS BEFORE BOLL-CALL. In December last, the writer, by direction of executive, laid before you in Melbourne of a proposal for amendment of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act to enable graziers to make binding shearing engageprior to the arrival of the men on the stations. The necessity for the amendment of Act is brought about by the action of the Australian Workers Union in adopting a rule a penalty of £2 upon each member who enters into a signed agreement prior to It has already been pointed out that it has been customary in the industry for very But many years to sign agreements some contime before commencement of work, as it is only by such means that binding eontracts can be made and the employer on the one hand be enabled to definitely arrange his shearing operations, and the employee on the other hand to be definitely assured of engagement prior to travelling long distances for the purpose of securing employment. As an award of the Commonwealth Court is in operation providing more favourable terms for employees than have previously prevailed, it is inequitable that the union and employees should, not by the use of the rule in question, be placed ' in the position of being able, while taking full advantage of the award, by force of the employer's necessity, to also demand addiconcessions on arrival at the station. The rule can only exist for this purpose, and has already had the effect in this State of members to demand in some cases increased rates of payment, in others adult wages for boys; and in other cases various h concessions. The faet that general trouble has not yet arisen is no argument for the maintenance of such an unjust rule, which is disadvantageous alike to employer and employee, and which is also diametrically opposed to the spirit of the Arbitration Aet. All means than an alteration of the Act have been exhausted endeavouring to secure the withThis drawal of this rule. A conference with the Australian Workers Union has proved unavailing, the Arbitration Court has held that the rule is not at present contrary to law, and many employees have ignored the they have been penalized by the union .and prevented from entering into signed agreements prior to roll-call. In December last, when I placed the position before you and before many members of conParliament, each member agreed that the union should be prevented from maintaining the objectionable rule in question. You, however, stated that your Government could not so late in the session introduce a debatable, clause in the amending Act, and in addition raised doubt as to whether the proposal could constitutionally be enacted. The question was submitted to eminent counsel, and the attached opinion by Mr Adrian Knox, KC. (copy of which has been previously sent you), indicates that there are apparently constitutional difficulties in the way' of adopting this association's proposal In view of the above, I have, by direction of my executive, again to ask that the proposal should be incorporated as an amendment of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act at t""he earliest possible date, in order to avoid industrial difficulty in the pastoral industry. The suggested amendment is as follows:"" The rules of an organization registered under - this Aot and the officials of such an organization shall not during the currency of an award in the industry concerned prevent or impede any members of such organization from entering into written agreements in accordance with such award at any time prior to the commencement of service."" The opinion referred to is as follows:Opinion of Mr Adrian Knox, K.O., re Suggested amendment of Commonwealth Arbitration Aot-23r d December, 1918. In my opinion, it is within the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament under the Constitution to prescribe the conditions under which associations or bodies of persons may become and remain organizations for the purposes indicated in that Act are themselves within the powers of the Parliament. On this ground I am of opinion that section 55 (2) of the Aot prescribing the conditions to be complied with by associations applying for registration as organizations is within the powers of the Parliament, and it appears to me that the High Court so decided in the Jumbunna case- 6 C.S.B.. at pp. 340 and 347 per CJ. and Barton, J. If this be so, I see no reason why Parliament should not have power to prescribe that no organization shall be registered or continue to be registered, the rules of which contain any provision hindering its members from entering into agreements in accordance with the terms of an existing award. Moreover, it seems to me to be involved in the decision above referred to, even if not expressly decided in that case, that section 9 of the Act is within the powers of the Parliament. If this be so, I can see no substantial reason why it should not be equally within the power of Parliament to prescribe that no member of an organization should be subjected to any penalty of any kind by reason of his having entered into an agreement with an employer before commencing work provided such agreement conformed to the terms of any existing award. I think that Parliament might also prescribe that the rules of the organization contain provision forbidding any official of the organization from hindering or preventing a member from entering into any agreement in conformity with any existing award. Mr Blakeley. 2 and 3The proposed amendment could not .be effectively introduced by statutory rule, because as the Act stands at present the power to prescribe conditions by rules only extends to associations applying to be registered as organizations-Sectio n 55 (2). . Mr Riley - Who received that advice?",49
210,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The Graziers Association, and Mr , now Chief Justice, Knox gave an opinion on which he drafted an amendment, which has again been brought forward and accepted by the Government. It is really an. amendment from the Graziers Association, and is in tended to apply solely to the Australian Workers Union. As president of that union, I could not recommend it to remain registered under the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration if such a provision was inserted in the Bill . There is no necessity for it , so long as the pastoralists of Australia are prepared to do the fair thing in regard to the supply of meat. If they will only do what they have done this year, there is not likely to be any trouble.",50
211,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Why should not the pastoralists be prepared to give a fair deal to the men? Mr . BLAKELEY - They have consistently refused to enter into any arrangement in regard to the'supply of meat, and the Court has always refused to fi x the price. If the members of my organization are prevented from signing any agreement prior to roll-call, it will mean that they will be at the mercy of the squatters, ancl can be charged anything.",50
212,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Coul d not the price be embodied in the agreement ?,50
213,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Not unless the members of the Graziers Association agree. There would have to be an arrangement between the two organizations.,50
214,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,That could easily be ' arrived at.,50
215,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Until this year, we have not been able to enter into an agreement with the pastoralists; and I believe that if this amendment is accepted there is not likely to be any f u r should ther agreement in regard to the price of meat.",50
216,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I do not think the honourable member need worry about that.,50
217,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The member must admit that I am in a better position to judge than he is.,51
218,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I had a good deal to do with it from the other side.,51
219,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"If that is so, the honourable member will know that the pastoralists have, until quite recently, refused to enter into an agreement with the members of the Australian Workers Union.",51
220,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,But an agreement has been entered into now.,51
221,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Yes , and that, as well as the award under which we are working, expires in Deecmber of this year.",51
222,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Does award determine'the price of meat according to the district ?,51
223,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,No . The Court has never fixed the price of meat.,51
224,Mr HUGHES,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Does the President say he cannot do so?,51
225,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,He has always refused on the ground that he has not the power. Mr HUGHE'S - Does he say that?,51
226,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Yes .,51
227,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,He has fixed a ration scale.,51
228,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"No ; he has alWales. lowed a Board of Reference between ployers and employees to be constituted, which applies only to station hands. That Board of Reference has fixed the price of meat at 3d. and 3^d. per lb.",51
229,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,That is in pursuance an award.,51
230,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Yes , and in relaapproximately tion to station hands only. While a Board of Reference could fix the price of meat system. for our members we have hot been able to come to an arrangement with the pastoralists and graziers. We are, therefore, compelled to prevent any member of our organization from signing on u n t knows what rates of pay he is to receive for shearing and what he is to be charged for meat.",51
231,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Y o u are merely protectget ing your own interests.,51
232,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Absolutely .,51
233,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,But an has been made.,51
234,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Yes , and it nates in December next.",51
235,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Canno t it be extended? honourable Mr BLAKELEY - If the honourable member is speaking officially on behalf of the pastoralists and graziers of Australia, and assures me that they are prepared to enter into a similar agreement next year, there might be something doing; but he has no authority.",51
236,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I have no official authority.,51
237,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,My experience with the Graziers Association of Australia has convinced me that unless an organization occupies a very strong position it will never get anything.,51
238,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,It depends on how that organization uses its strength.,51
239,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"We have used it in not an the best interests of our members. Much has been said concerning industrial unrest and industrial peace, and, personally, I do not think this will tend to create in dustrial peace.",51
240,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"It will , with 70 per cent, of the men.",51
241,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"We have had a good illustration this year of the solidarity of the Australian Workers Union. In Western Australia and Tasmania we entered into an agreement with the pastoralists, and in Queensland we have a State award, which leaves only South. Australia, Victoria, and New South We have entered into an emarrangement with the pastoralists of South Australia and the West Darling district of New South Wales, and southwestern Riverina in Victoria, leaving only a small portion of New South Wales of where they refuse to concede a forty-fourhour week. A strike occurred, and for t y sheds out of many thousands worked on the forty-eight hours The Australian Workers Union has already proved its solidarity and strength, and if it is desired by this Governi l he ment- I am not making a threat-to make our position such that we cannot remain a registered organization, well and good. We are prepared to out, and discard theA r b it r at i o n . Court altogether, depending upon conferences or direct action to protect our in terests. That is the position. W it h the agreement much-desired resignation-o n the jpart of some-of Mr Justice Higgins, and the termiappointment of another gentleman, who considers £ 3 a week sufficient for a single man, it would appear to be impossible ior the Australian Workers Union to remain a registered organization.",51
242,Mr HUGHES,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [8.28] - The honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley), who speaks with authority, has told us quite clearly that he, on behalf of his organization, cannot accept the amendment made by the Senate in this Bill . I listened to the honourable member with considerable interest, because it is most refreshing to hear a man who understands what he is talking about. It happens so rarely in this place that I was glad I was present when the honourable member was speaking. But while I listened with great interest - to what he had to say, he failed to convince me that this amendment would injure or menace his organization. I am sorry the Senate inserted the amendment; but it did, and, of course, against the wishes of the Government. The honourable member has told us in effect that unless we are prepared to do as he wishes, he will recommend his or-(ganization to withdraw from the A r b i tration Court, and to resort to those other methods-conference s and direct action-the first of which is only mentioned for the purpose of effectively settin g out the other. The honourable member has said that that is not a threat. What is it , if it is not a threat? I threat, because he followed it up by giving an instance of the tremendous strength of the organization, which we all know perfectly well. If I thought for a moment that this amendment aimed a blow at unionism generally, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) said, or that it aimed a blow at the Australian Workers Union in particular, as the honourable member for Darling said, I would not vote for it under any circumstances.",52
243,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,What other union - would it affect?,52
244,Mr HUGHES,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The Leader of the Opposition said that it would affect other unions, but I agree with the honourable member that it would not. Turning for a moment from the main argument, I should like to point out to the honourable member for Darling that many unionists, practically every day of their lives, make agreements before they enter the sheds.",52
245,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Oh , no.",52
246,Mr HUGHES,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"But I know that they do. The honourable member's knowledge of unions other than those of the coal miners may be extensive; but it certainly is not profound. He will in any case allow me to have my opinion, since my experience is at least as extensive as his own. . The honourable member for Darling said, "" The Senate's amendment is a blow aimed at the Australian Workers Union, and such a blow, that, if it is insisted upon, I shall be compelled to recommend my union to withdraw from the Conciliation and Arbitration Court."" That is a very improper statement to make. It is the more i m proper because of the flimsiness of the pretext. The position has been outlined by the honourable member himself. He says that the Australian Workers Union members can now sign on before they go to a shed, and that this has been made possible because the pastoralists now have agreed to charge a reasonable price for meat. He could hardly expect the Committee and the country to accept that as a sufficient reason for the union's tame acceptance of a principle which the honourable gentleman has just declared menaces its very existence. I remember that the Australian Workers Union took up the same position t is a that it does now when the price of meat never came into consideration. I speak of what occurred in a very large number of sheds in New South Wales which I visited in my capacity as a political and industrial organizer. I never heard the price of meat given out as a reason why the hands should not sign on before they went to a shed. I freely admit that if the pastoralists were using this system of making agreements, beforehand, as a means to get behind the award and defeat its real object, the position would be very serious, and that if I were a member of the Australian Workers Union I should not be inclined to countenance it for a day. I do not wish any one to be under a misapprehension as to what I should do in such circumstances. But the honourable member for Darling knows perfectly well that he has not set out his case completely. He does not tell the Committee that in very many cases it is true, as alleged in Mr Allen's letter, that there are extremists in his organization who have gone to sheds and, by threats of a strike, have compelled the employer to concede terms and conditions outside the award. He has not said that extremists in his organization have torn the award into tatters, and have said to a station-owner, "" We will not start for you unless you are prepared to give us higher rates and better conditions than those prescribed in the award."" If we take the honourable member's own statement of his case, and the facts as we know them-and the honourable member cannot deny that what I say is truewe find that in very many cases the men have used the power and strength of their organization-certainl y not at the behest of that organization-as a shield behind which to tear up an award and resort to direct action. Every one knows that they have done so. It is proposed by the Senate's amendment that, in order 'that the pastoralist may know where he is, and make his arrangements, as he must do, beforehand, he should be able to make binding contracts with the men, and so fill up his board. The honourable member for Darling says that that is so serious a blow at the Australian Workers Union that if it is persisted in that organization will have to withdraw from the Court. In almost the same breath he tells us that the members of his organization are at the present time working under such an arrangement, and explains that by saying, "" We now have the price of meat fixed."" It is absurd to expect those honourable members who have had some experience of unions, and particularly of the Australian Workers Union, to believe that that union would be satisfied, and is satisfied, to go on suspending the rule to ' which this proposal relates, provided its members get an assurance that the price of meat shall be as fixed. The honourable member knows perfectly well that in very many cases members of an organizationnot once with the authority of the union concerned-hav e held up by the pistol of direct action the pastoralists in different parts of the country. That is not fair. The honourable member says that this amendment was moved in the Senate at the instigation of the Pastoralists and G-raziers Associations.",52
247,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,So it was.,53
248,Mr HUGHES,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I do not know whether it was or not; but the Government opposed it when it was submitted in this House, and opposed it also in the Senate. The honourable member to-night has supplied the Committee with the best argument why we should not shipwreck this measure by rejecting the Senate's amendment. We have to ask ourselves whether it is better to accept the amendment or to reject the Bill by sending it back to another place. Is there any reasonable probability that the Senate would retrace its steps?",53
249,Mr BILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Let us try.,53
250,Mr HUGHES,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The honourable member knows perfectly well that it would not. The honourable member for Darling said a great deal about the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and the effect of the Senate's amendment. Despite the opinion given by the Chief Justice before he was raised to the Bench, I do not think the amendment is constitutional. In my opinion, it is not constitutional, . for the reason that it cloes two things: In the first place, it limits the judicial power of. the President of the Conciliation aud Arbitration Court. No one denies that, apart from that, he could have made this condition had he chosen to do so. If this amendment is included it will apply to any award he may make. The Court will have no discretionary powers-this amendment is an impairment cf the judicial discretion. Under the Commonwealth Constitution, as I read it , Parliament has no power to do any such thing. It cannot make a law of any sort with regard to industrial matters, but is confined to dealing with certain classes of industrial disputes by means of arbitration and conciliation, and not by direct legislation. That brings me to the second reason why I think the amendment is unconstitutional, and that is ibecause it is, in effect, an industrial law. As my honourable and learned colleague (Mr . Groom) has said, there are opinions on both sides. The High Court alone can say what is the law. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), before the dinner adjournment, dealt with the invasion this amendment made upon the right of bodies and persons to make laws affecting their relations inter se. He said that was wrong. But what the amendment really seeks to do is to prevent the union from prohibiting its members, fro m giving full effect to the award by preventing the pastoral industry from being carried on effectively. The honourable member for Darling said we ought not to allow this Legislature to be used for the purposes of the Graziers and Pastoralists Associations. I admit that; but I do not know that, coming from such a quarter, ""that is a reproach calculated to carry very great weight, because I remember very distinctly using this Legislature for the purposes of the Australian Workers Union. That was then considered to be not only permissible, but both moral and proper. I do not think it was proper. I had, however, to do it .",53
251,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"But the amendment which the Prime Minister refers applied to all organizations. It benefited the whole of them, whereas this will affect only one organization.",54
252,Mr HUGHES,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I admit that in pracexcepting tice this amendment will be limited to organization, but that is really because that one organization is so vast as tically to control all industries connected registration. with the primary producers. The honourable member may correct me if I am wrong, but I think it controls all primary industries with the exception of mining. The honourable member has failed, I think, to convince the Committee that his organization will suffer any wrong, and failed because he admits that, at this very moment, members of that organization are working under the very conditions which the amendment provides. He says that the present agreement will lapse the end of the year, and that he does riot think it will be renewed, or that another agreement will be made. I do not accept that statement. I think the honourable member will find, as time goes on, that the partoralists will be quite ready to make another agreement. In any case, the honourable member has now a remedy, whereas formerly he had none, and that remedy is contained in this very B i Under this amending law the Australian Workers Union can ask for the variatiou of an award. I do not think that i quitef a i r to say that it is . Mr Justice the law. Higgins' view that he cannot impose such conditions in an award as will insure the men. getting their stores at a reasonable rate. I should not like to say that he can do it ; but I am inclined to think that' if I were in his place I would do it . think he could very, easily say that he had the power to do it , because the circumstances under which the men work are such that the purpose of an award will be defeated entirely if the pastoralists can extort what price they please for the things which the men must have to eat, and without which they cannot carry on their work. It amounts, then, to this: The honourable gentleman says that the amendment is aimed at the Australian Workers U n i o n , ' that it is inserted in this Bill at the instigation of the Pastoralists Union, that its effect will be to enable the pastoralists to increase the price of stores, and particularly of meat, to the shearers, and so to defeat the award. He says that if it is persisted in the Australian Workers Union will withdraw from the Arbitration Court. On my side, I say that none of these statements"" carry much weight, the threat which the honourable one member made that, unless we did what he wanted us to do, he would not recompracmend the organization to continue its",54
253,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The right honourable gentleman is misrepresenting me. What I said was that I personally could not recommend to the members of the organization that they should work under such a condition.,54
254,Mr HUGHES,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The honourable gentleman said that he could not recommend for them to work under such a condition. Either that is a threat without anything at behind it , and that is to say that the honourable gentleman knows very well that the council of the organization will not . deregister or remove the organization from the Arbitration Court, and so he has fired' a blank cartridge; or else it is loaded. In either case, I think it is most improper. Let me put this to the honourable gentleman: I hardly pick up a newspaper any day now in which I do not see 1 l l . a reference to complaints made by the President of the Arbitration Court that sufficient assistance is not given, or that t is certain amendments are not made in A little while ago a vote of censure on the Government was moved in this House because we had not introduced industrial legislation. Since then we have introduced three major I industrial measures-the Industrial Peace Bill , the Bill now under consideration, and the Arbitratio n (Public Service) Bill . These amply fulfil the pledges we made to the electors. The need for this Bill is urgent and imperative. I am not going to vote against this amendment and so risk this Bill , but I say to every member of the Committee that the Government will accept whatever is done. Every honourable member on this side may vote as he pleases. Eor my part ' I stand where I did when the measure was in troduced. I am sorry that the amendment has been made. I cannot accept the statement of the honourable member for Darling (Mr . Blakeley) that the amendment is intended to or will injure the Australian Workers Union, because I know the Australian Workers Union too well. I hear these statements every day. I heard the honourable member for Hunter (Mr C h a r l ton) declare that if a certain amendment was made in the Industrial Peace Bill the effect would be disastrous, but so far as I know nothing has happened.",54
255,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,What amendment was that?,55
256,Mr HUGHES,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I forget what the particular amendment was, but I know that the honourable member predicted disaster if it was accented. The fact of the matter is that unionism in this country has reached a stage when it is beyond, the power of any one to do it any harm. is only one quarter from which danger can come to unionism, and. that is fro m within. It cannot be h u rt from without. Honourable members know that very well. A great union like the Australian Workers Union should welcome this amendment, because it should serve to preserve something like discipline. It would enable the union to deal with bauds of Industrial Workers of the World who get into it , and, under cover of its broad wing, strive to bring it into disrepute. Discipline is wanted in the Australian Workers Union, and for that reason this amendment should not be regarded as a bad thing, although I can quite understand that the honourable member for Darling feels it to be his duty to speak against it . The attitude of the Government is that we regret that the amendment has been made. But we have already disagreed with one of the Senate's amendments, and we feel that on the whole the interests of industrial peace will be best served by accepting this"" amendment, and so allowing the Bill to become law. One word more and I have done - The honourable member for Darling has said what the pastoralists will do next year, in the way of raising the price of meat to the shearers. All I have to say on that point is that if the Lord spares us we shall be here next year, and I shall certainly not sit down quietly while any body of men seek to get behind the law and defeat the object of an award of the Arbitration Court. If a remedy comes from no other quarter, the - Government will supply it .",55
257,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Hunter) [ 8 . 5 5 ] - I have been surprised at the speech delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) in support of an amendment which he has condemned from the beginning of his remarks. A similar amendment was defeated in this Chamber, and, subsequently, was carried in another place. The right honourable gentleman gives that as one reason why the Government should accept it . Has it come to this now, that another place in which there is only one member, opposed to the Government is going to be permitted to dictate the legislation of this country, and the Government are prepared to accept that position ? On the face of it , if the right honourable gentleman is a strong man, and it There is claimed that he is, he certainly should not accept an amendment of this kind when he does not really believe in it . He has admitted that he has no time for it , and that in his opinion it should never have been included in this Bill , b ut he goes on to say that rather than risk a crisis with the other Chamber he is prepared to accept the amendment.",55
258,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"He said "" rather than risk the loss of the Bill . """,55
259,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"He said both. Thirty-five out of thirty-six of the members in another place are followers of the Prime Minister, and are they to demand the right to dictate what the legislation of Parliament shall be?",55
260,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Are they to be dumimies ?,55
261,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"No , but are we to understand that they are to rule the Government of this country? The majority - of Ministers are members.of the House of Representatives, and is it to be said that, because a couple of Ministers in another place are unable to control the followers of the Government there, if they insert an obnoxious amendment in a Bill it must be accepted ? That is the position which the Prime Minister has placed before us this evening. The division which took place on this amendment in another place goes to show that it had not the support of even the majority of members of that Chamber. This amendment was carried by a vote of nine "" Ayes "" to seven "" Noes.""",55
262,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,What was the number of pairs?,56
263,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"There were no pairs recorded. The position, then,, is that nine members in a House of thirty-six have inserted in this Bill a clause, which was rejected in this Chamber, and because they have done so the Government is prepared now to accept it notwithstanding the fact that it is admitted that its in sertion will not be in the best interests of the measure. That seems to me to be a lamentable position in which to place this House, and I am surprised that the Prime Minister should accept it in the manner he has done. The right honourable gentleman says that in his opinion the amendment is unconstitutional. Surely that is another reason why it should be rejected. The Government, I hope, do not propose to insert provisions in a Bill which are believed to be unconstitutional. Are we not here for the purpose of passing measures in accordancs with the Constitution ?",56
264,Mr HUGHES,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I have expressed only my opinion on that point.,56
265,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The right honourable gentleman's opinion, as head of the Government, should go a long way. If I were head of the Government, and held the opinion that a certain provision was unconstitutional,.! should not permit it to be included in a Government measure. Here we have the spectacle of the head of the Government accepting a provision, which was rejected in this Chamber on a previous occasion, and at the same time expressing the opinion that it is unconstitutional. Where are we driftin g to if we must accept an amendment of this kind because it has been made in another place? I am inclined fco think, with the honourable member for Darling, that this amendment has been supplied by a body vitally interested in its passage, and that is the Pastoralists Union. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) did not say was attributed to h im by the Prime Minister. He did not say that he would not recommend his union to still continue its registration in the Arbitration Court. What he said was that the present agreement will expire in December of this year, and that with this provision in the law he cannot, as head of the organization, redommend the Australian Workers Union to continue its registration. Why should he say that? Is it not because to do so would be to put him as head of the executive of the organization in the position of asking its members to continue registration after the inclusion in the law of a provision which they have been fighting against for a considerable time, and have only recently succeeded in defeating ? He pointed out that rule 112 of the rulebook of the union was brought into operation quite recently.",56
266,Mr HUGHES,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,It is not in operation. That is the whole point. It has been suspended.,56
267,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"It was in operation for only two years, and it is now suspended.",56
268,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"That does not affect what I desire to say. If we make this amendment the law, the union can not have such a rule in its rule-book at all.",56
269,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,A f t e r two years' trial they suspended it .,56
270,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"They did so only because they have a satisfactory agreement under which they are working. If they serrure a mutual agreement with their employers, which covers what they desire, the;/ need not bother about a rule on the subject. But if for any reason the agreement were broken, they would fall back upon their rule, and endeavour to come to some arrangement whereby they could get meat at a fixed price. There could be no exception taken to such procedure. It is admitted that the amendment applies to only one organization. For years the members of the Australian Workers Union have been fighting to secure a square deal in the matter of meat supplies, but they have been unable to get satisfaction. They found that when in dividual members had the right to sign independent agreements, they were liable to be charged any price for , meat and goods which the employers cared to what - demand. As for the Prime Minister's endeavour to disparage my experience of trade unionism, I may tell him that I am a foundation member of one of the biggest unions in Western Australia, and that I hold a certificate attesting that fact. I have been connected with as many unions, probably, as the right honourable gentleman himself; and I say, definitely, that no union could accept a provision of this character.",56
271,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,What is wrong with it ?,57
272,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The essence of trade unionism is that there must be a recognised head, and that there must be accepted rules.",57
273,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,And loyalty to an award.,57
274,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,It would be disastrous to a union if it were to permit individual members to form separate and private agreements.,57
275,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The amendment does not involve the matter of a separate agreement; we are not asking for that.,57
276,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,That ' is what it does involve.,57
277,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Nothin g of the kind.,57
278,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Wit h respect to meat supplies, the Judge before whom the matter came up refused to make any $>rovision in his award. In the circumstances, there was nothing to prevent individuals from entering into private agreements; but, if the practice were permitted, how would it be possible to carry on an organization? Where would be the discipline? There must be organization. Every organization must have a head. There must be discipline; there must be unanimity in respect of the practical working of an organization. It is of no use for one body or individual to be working independently of another batch of members. All must pull together, or there will be disaster. Those are hard facts which can be confirmed by reference to any organization official. Honourable members may inquire of any industrial body, and they will learn that individual members cannot be permitted to enter. into separate agreements.",57
279,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"But they did so, for thirty years.",57
280,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The honourable member does not know what he is talking about.,57
281,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"nSuppose that I were to - concede that they did so. It would be obvious that now, after all those years, they had come to a conclusion that the practice was a mistake, and that the rules must be altered. . Mr RICHARD FOSTER - That is just the view-point of the wild element.",57
282,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I repeat that in every organization there must be discipline. There must be rules, and members must be guided by those rules; and any member who acts independently, and in contradiction to the rules, is likely to bring his organization to disaster.",57
283,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"But the honourable member must know that, in many cases, individual unionists do act independently.",57
284,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The Prime Minister said so, but he did not venture to mention the specific union which he may have had in mind. No organization could exist for twelve months in such circuimstances.",57
285,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,That is silly stuff.,57
286,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"It is the truth, and the honourable member may confirm it by inquiring of any unionist. It is a fact that applies to every industrial organization, and not merely to the shearers.",57
287,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The amendment will apply only to the Australian Workers Union.,57
288,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"It should not be made applicable to any union; but will honourable members argue that, if the amendment becomes law, all registered unions will not come under its scope?",57
289,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Of course, that will be the case.",57
290,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"But the. only organization which the amendment is hitting at is the Australian Workers Union. My union will have nothing to dowith the Arbitration Act for the very reason that its recognition leads to situations of the kind which is now under discussion. As for the unions which have accepted the Industrial Peace Act-and I am very glad that they have done so- I point out that they do not come under this measure at all. Miners, and other big bodies of unionists, are not concerned. This amendment hits at organizations which are registered before the Court. No union in Australia has beenmore loyal than the Australian Workers Union to the spirit of the Arbitration Act .",57
291,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I do not know so much about that in the light of experience this year. .The union is going before the Queensland Court.,58
292,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,It is still a matter of arbitration.,58
293,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The Australian Workers Union came under the Arbitration Act practically from its proclamat i o n ; and, from that day to this, it has been loyal to the awards of the Court. There has been no general upheaval in the ranks of that body in so far as it has affected a big Australian industry.",58
294,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"There have been many demands made by shearers, who have come before the Board without being signed on, and have asked for award rates.",58
295,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The honourable member cannot prove that.,58
296,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The fact remains that the Australian Workers Union has been loyal to arbitration, and I would point out to the honourable member for i Dampier (Mr Gregory) that its members are compelled to work under the awards of the Court.",58
297,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,They have not done so.,58
298,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,In many sheds the men have made alterations of their own.,58
299,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The member knows very well that that does not apply generally to the organization, and that, as such, it has been loyal to arbitration. The union desires to remain loyal, and it is well for this country, and for the individual interests of pastoralists, who are so anxious over the fate of this amendment, that the Australian Workers Union has remained loyal. Throughout the war its members continued to work, and imade the best of their situation, although the cost of living was ever rising. Sir GRANVILL.F. RYRIE - The i r pay been rising all the time.",58
300,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"So it should do. Very often, however, before a rise in wages could be secured the cost of living had gone up out of all proportion to wages. Supposing that the men had taken the b it in their teeth, and had said, "" The cost of living has gone up another 20 or 30 per cent. cannot secure rises in conformity with the increased cost. We will refuse to work u n t i l we get a fair t h in g . "" They did not take that stand, however, but went about matters in the proper way and secured an agreement. That is entirely to their credit. Because a few individual members of the Committee are pressing for the amendment, why should it be accepted? The effect of its inclusion will be that pastoralists will be free to charge whatever they please for meat and goods. Surely we should protect their employees from such a state of affairs.",58
301,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The agreement does that.,58
302,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"As I have already stressed, if individual members are to be free to make their own terms, organization will break down. Either that will occur, or a majority of the members of a union, will say, "" It is time for us to take a determined stand against this k in d of thing. We cannot continue upon unconstitutional lines. We shall not permit the minority to enter into separate agreements and ignore the Act and its awards."" Procedure such as that is similar to the insidious attacks of white ants in gradually eating away the foundations of a building.",58
303,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The white ants are operating right enough.,58
304,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"They are, and in honourable this very Chamber, it would appear, in view of the fact that the Government have intimated plainly enough that they do not approve of the amendment. What are the facts ? The offending clause was rejected by this Committee; yet the Government have permitted nine of the thirty-six members of the Senate-al l of them supposed to be supporters of the Government - to dictate policy. The white ants are eating into the ranks of the Government as well as working elsewhere. It appears to me that the Senate is going to control this Parliament and has country. It will do so, if the Government are supine, and if we are to be forced to accept its dictation. However, I do not think the Prime Minister accepted the will of the Senate in this matter merely because it was such, or that he was afraid of losing the Bill . I believe the Prime Minister has sufficient power to whip up. the Senate and make We it reverse its decision tomorrow, if he desired to do so. Behind the amendment, however, there are certain individual members of this'Chamber - who are pushing the Government. There is too much of this kind of thing going on today. It is not for the good of the country that the Government have not a larger straight-out majority in this Chamber. There are influences at work all the time. Certain individuals are giving conditional support to the Government. They want certain things, and they must be placated. It is very evident that there is an influence at work here to' enforce on the Government the acceptance of the amendment. I am confident that the Prime Minister himself is strongly opposed to the underlying proposition. If his remarks on the subject meant anything at all, it is clear that he has no time for any amendment of this nature. But, rather than precipitate a crisis, or run the risk of losing the Bill , he has preferred to be dictated to by nine members of another place. As a matter of fact, I do not really believe that is the case. As J have already said, the acceptance of the amendment is an evidence of the placation of certain members of this Chamber, who are the spokesmen for the pastoralists.",58
305,Mr GBEGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Dampier) [9.15] As the member who originally introduced this amendment to the Chamber, I emphatically contradict the statement of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) that it was designed for the purpose of breaking up trade unionism. I do not believe the honourable member himself thinks so.",59
306,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I do. There is no better way by which you can smash trade unionism. i,59
307,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I do not think even the honourable member believes that. I assure him and the Committee generally that the employers prefer to deal with organized rather than with disorganized labour. We have followed the trend of trade unionism here and all over the world, and realise its advantages as well as its disadvantages. I should be sorry to see anything done that would in any way help to destroy trade union organizations in this country, but harm very often results from incomplete legislation. I fail to understand where the objection to so reasonable an amendment comes in . No one has shown where any evil could result from it . Look at all the legislation that has been passed year after year for the last twenty years with a view to building up trade union organizations. We quite understand their advantages, and, if - I were working for a daily wage, I would be one of the first to join a union, in order that we might fight as an organized body. But there are some things done by many of these organizations to which I would very strenuously object. I would not put into the hands of a few people absolute power to dominate me during the whole of my work. Does the Leader of the Opposition concur with the message from Sydney on Saturday night calling a stop-work meeting of the seamen ? That is the sort of thing we are going to have here. They talk about industrial legislation and arbitration courts, and industrial peace. A r e these the sort of proceedings that we should have ?",59
308,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Will this amendment prevent stop-work meetings of the seamen ?,59
309,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Should any organization have the power to do these things when an Arbitration Court is in existence, and the men are working under an arbitration award? Although this amendment will apply to all organizations registered with the Court, it will apply specially to the Australian Workers Union, and the effect, so far as I am concerned, will be mostly with the shearers and the cane-cutters, but principally with the shearers. Shearing operations extend over the whole of Australia. They start at the end of March in the north of Western Australia, and some men go right through and finish at the end of November or early in December in the south. Is it a good thing to allow them to enter into arrangements with a contractor, so that the whole of their work may be in accordance with an agreement registered as a portion of the award in the Arbitratio n Court?",59
310,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"It allows them to get what they call a "" run . "" The good men are all in favour of it .",59
311,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I should not have tried to press this amendment if I had had any doubts as to its constitutionality. The honourable member for Darling (Mr . Blakeley) has read the opinion given by Mr Adrian Knox, now Chief Justice, who had intimate relationships with the Arbitration Court and constitutional law, and who strongly supports my contention. I have here the following opinions from Sir E . F . Mitcnoll, K . C , as to the validity of the proposed new clause: I have read clause 58B which was inserted as an amendment by the Senate into the Bill now before Parliament to amend the Federal Arbitration Act. In my opinion it is within the constitutional powers of the Federal Parliament to enact such a clause, and I am quite clear that it would be upheld as valid by the High Court if passed and its validity challenged. In the Jumbunna case, 6 C.L.R., p. 309, it was held by all the"" then live Judges of the High Court that the constitution empowered the Federal Parliament to enact the sections of the Arbitration Act which regulate the tion of organizations, and in my opinion it was clearly competent for the Parliament to prescribe the conditions for valid registration, cluding what the rules of the organization should or should not contain with respect to anything connected with the awards or with the industry to which the awards related. Looking at the real substance of clause 5SB, which must be done when determining its constitutional validity, it does two things: (1) prescribes there shall bo nothing in the rules of an organization registered under the Act to prevent or impede any members of such organization from entering into written agreements during the currency of an award in accordance with its terms before the commencement of service; (2) prohibits the officials of any tered organization from similarly preventing or impeding any such members from entering into any such agreements before the commencement of service. 1 think that both .(1) and (2) are valid and will be upheld; (2) stands or falls on the same principles as would determine the validity of section 6 of the Arbitration Act, which I have no doubt is valid and which was assumed to be valid by all the Judges of the High Court in Metropolitan Goal Company of Sydney Limited and others v. The Australian Goal anil Shale Employees Federation, 24 C.L.E., 85; and (1) stands on a still stronger basis, both because it is something that would have been enacted directly by section 6 and also because it was competent for Parliament to prescribe what the rules of organizations should or should not contain on such a subject matter. I have another from Mr Campbell, who also states that, in his opinion, it is quite competent for the Federal Par- (Mr. liament to enact such a clause. Sir ward Mitchell states very clearly exactly what the clause does. So long award itself is being carried out, where can any valid objection be raised by any of the members of the union ? It will not in any sense affect shearing this season. All the agreements have been fixed up for the present year. The Workers Union have agreed, in their contracts with the Pastoralists to put the principle of the clause into Mr Gregory. operation, although some little time ago they passed a rule making any member of the Australian Workers Union liable to a fine of £ 2 for entering into any such agreement.",59
312,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The honourable member is quite wrong in saying that we have agreed tp this clause.,60
313,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"What I meant to convey was that the Australian Workers Union suspended their rule on the subject for the present season, and permitted their members to sign on. In view of the registra- enormous area over which shearing is conducted, many men must lose heavily in- who go to a shed and find that there is no board open for them there. Is it fair to those who specially follow this work to insist upon the method of balloting to-decide which men are to be employed ? Is it fair to those who give satisfaction time after time to those who employ them ? Take the case of men who carry out special contracts with the pastoralists to shear their flocks. I know several pastoralists who always engage a certain number of shearers, and these men travel regisover enormous distances to carry out the engagements which they have entered into months and months ahead. This practice must be to the advantage of the worker- I am talking of the better class men amongst the shearers, who follow this work year after year. If they can enter into definite engagements with contractors, surely it is far better for the in dustry, the organization, the pastoralists, and themselves? I cannot see how it can be injurious, either to the organization or to the men. It must tend to get r i d of a great deal of the difficulty which must arise if more men offer at a shed than are wanted, and some have to go away empty-handed. It must mean seriK.C, ous loss to them. The honourable member for Batman Brennan) says the amendEdment is an endeavour to coerce the organization, but, on the other hand, as the what right has the organization to make rules that would coerce the individual, so long as he, as a member of that organization, is prepared to observe the award of the Court aud stick to his agreement?",60
314,Mr TUDOH,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,He voluntarily joins the Australian organization.,60
315,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"He naturally asAssociation, sumes that Parliament will see that no organization becomes tyrannical in the incidence of its rules. There can be as much tyranny in that way as in any other.",60
316,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The organization decides its own rules; no individual decides them.,61
317,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"But , if an organization began to frame rules merely to protect those who are in it and nothing fur ther, how long would Parliament protect it?",61
318,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Othe r organizations than the Australian Workers Union, which have a rule forbidding their members to enter into agreements, will be. compelled to strike it out if they want to go to the Arbitration Court. Mr GREGORY . ^ T h ey should not make such rules, and Parliament must protect the individual member as well as the organization.",61
319,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,That rule has been in operation for t h i r t y years in the case of organizations other than the Australian Workers Union. Both the rule and the practice is not to allow their members to enter into agreements.,61
320,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I have here the shearers' agreement for this year, entered into between the Pastoralists Association and the Australian Workers Union.",61
321,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,That is the agreement which mentions the price of meat.,61
322,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I congratulate the honourable member on entering into an agreement of this 6ort. If representatives on each side who understand the industry get together at a round table conber ference, and come to an agreement, goes to the Court and is registered agreement under the Arbitration Act, we shall have far better, more binding, and more workable awards than will be made by any Judge of the Court. If they not agree on all the points, they can agree on the majority of them, and then get the Judge to give a determination on those dispute.",61
323,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,We always do that.,61
324,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"They did it in the Kalgoorlie district for many years, there was always a splendid feeling between the employers and the employees, but as soon as they began fighting in the Arbitration Court that good feeling appeared, and the greatest frictio [218] to prevail. I am glad the honourable member believes in the principle of arriving at agreements in this way. It is a much fairer and better method, for the one great reason that the men who frame such agreements know the industry and all the difficulties on both sides. An y agreement entered into by them must be much more workable thah an arrangement come to in any other way . The agreement contains quite a number of clauses dealing with the conditions that must be observed. I cannot understand how any pastoralist who endeavours to impose unf a i r or unjust conditions on any body of men, particularly such an organization as the Australian Workers Union, ever gets # his sheep shorn. If a pastoralist played "" the dirty game "" with an organization of which I was a member, I would soon send out a "" round Tobin "" that would cause him difficulty in the future.",61
325,Mr LAZZARINI,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"You would be a ""tyrannical unionist""?",61
326,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I would be quite sure of my ground before I did anything of the sort. The agreement makes special provision with regard to the stores to be supplied, and so forth . These stores need not be bought from the pastoralist unless the men chose; but, if he does supply first them, he has to supply them at cost price, plus 10 per cent. In the case of meat, the charge must not exceed the wholesale carcass price in the nearest township.",61
327,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The honourable memevidently has not the righ t agreewhich ment. What he is reading is not the as an agreement we are now working under.,61
328,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,This was given to me by the secretary of the Pastoralists canAssociation only a few days ago.,61
329,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Unles s it sets out certain specified prices for meat in each in State, it is not the present agreement.",61
330,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,A m I to understand that there is a later agreement which specifically states the prices to be and charged for the meat supplied?,61
331,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Yes .,61
332,Mr GREGORY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Unde r the circumdisstances, however, I hope that the House n began will agree to the amendment. There is not the slightest desire to destroy unionism. There are many phases of the Arbitration Act with which I disagree. I should like to see an Act which placed the same obligations on the employees as on the employer, and I have emphasized my objections time after time. I have always believed in arbitration, subject to certain sonditions; but far and away above all other considerations, is a system of fixing up industrial agreements by men who ar© associated with the particular industry, and who thoroughly understand it. I should be very sorry indeed to do anything that would in any way injure the industrial organizations of the country, because I realise what they have done for the workers in the past. I also believe that, if these matters were dealt with by conscientious men, who were always prepared to see the difficulties on the other side as well as on.their own, the conditions of the workers' would be improved, and it would tend to pave the way to better industrial conditions. If representatives go to extremes,. they only injure those they represent,. but with men who aim at fairness, justice, and equity for all, traile' unionism must be for the benefit of the workers. I am satisfied that I speak for the great majority of honourable members on this side, who are prepared to do all they can - to place these organizations on a fair and sound"" footing.",61
333,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Robertson) [9.34] The honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley), who speaks with authority as the direct . representative of the Austrameat lian ""Workers Union in this House, has asserted that there is not a man here who directly represents' the pastoralists. That is quite true, but we need not waste tears tion. over the pastoralists, because their lack of representation is their own fault. - It is not merely a matter of protecting the pastoralist; this proposal, even if , honourable member for Darling says, it affects only - one union-although Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) says, it affects all unions--- - Mr TUDOR - I am sure it does ; there are number's ofunions' registered today which will have to be de-registered .if.""this amendment is adopted - ground that",62
334,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"The honourable .mem- - tory: ber for Darling, who is .president>©f - the Australian Workers Union, says that the amendment affects his union only;: but, even so, it still affects the greatest wealth producing interest in Australia. The amendment is directed to conserve the interests of all the steady men in that organization. I have' been interested in this particular phase of production ever since I was old enough to walk, and I can assure honourable members that the steady and reliable men, the best shearers, have always desired signed agreements in order that they may have security. As the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) says, these men go to shed after shed, and they desire to be assured of an agreement which binds the pastoralists exactly as it binds themselves. All the talk of the honourable member for Darling about the price of meat seems to me to be beside the mark. We know that for many years there has been difficulty with some graziers about the price of meat, but for the' first time in the history of the industry, as the honourable member himself admits, we have an agreement. There is no reason to suppose that the graziers, having found the benefit of an agreement, are .going to burst up the whole industry over-the price of meat. After all,-the price of meat to the shearers means very little. Mr RICHARD FosTBR.^It - is a very smallpercentage. .....",62

The average shearer does not attempt to do any such thing. He is as decent a man as any other member of the community, but, naturally, in a great nomadic body of men, we find those who are prepared to take advantage of any loophole. If , as I have seen myself, there is no agreement, they will hold up the whole business, and, possibly, put the grazier to endless expense. A grazier will sometimes have his sheep ready mustered, and all his arrangements made at considerable cost, only to find them upset.",62
337,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,The honourable member is extremely ridiculous when he speaks of one man putting probably twenty men out of work.,63
338,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"S u r e l y the honorreasons able member knows that it can be done, and has seen it done.",63
339,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Do you say that twenty men are sheep?,63
340,Mr BILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,O r lambs ?,63
341,Mr FLEMING,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,".Perhaps they are support. sometimes lambs. If a contract is entered into, it will be equally binding on both sides, and neither side will enter how that was done. blindly. It has been said by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) that if members of the unions are allowed make an agreement trouble will result, because it is impossible for any award or agreement to cover all requirements. Certainly that is impossible, but the main thing is to remove the chief cause trouble, and allow those concerned to come to a mutual agreement on the minor matters. Noman . will claim that all the little exigencies met by any agreement, but it is a matter of working in - harmony, and I believe that if this clause is inserted there will be a much better spirit in the industry than at present. Eighteen years ago, in the State Parliament of New South Wales,' I supported the Shearers' Accommodation Act, because there were-, odd pastoralists who made conditions tremely ' difficult for the shearers. such men''would make it difficult today but for the Shearers Union. The Australian Workers Union is powerful enough to protect itself in every way, and none of us has any desire to destroy it , but desire a common meeting ground such as an agreement of this kind would give. The amendment gives security to a great body of honest men, who, year by year, follow the sheds in order to make sufficient to maintain their families, and, possibly, build up homes for themselves in the future. The amendment would have a twofold effect; it would secure stability, to a certain degree, in the greatest wealth-producing industry in Australia, and protect the better section of the men who carry it on.",63

Out of thirty-six members of the Senate only nine voted in favour of the proposal, whilst seven voted against it. Yet the Government now say that we ought to accept it rather than precipitate a crisis with the other branch of the Parliament. What is all the trouble about? Surely the shearers themselves know what they want. organization desires that a certain measure of protection shall be extended to it. If we concede the right of any individual member of it to sign an agreement with his employer, we shall entirely cut away the awards which have been gained by that organization. If once this principle be adopted, every award made by the Arbitration Court will be practically nullified. It will mean starting the "" white ant "" in unionistic circles. It will constitute a death-blow to trade unionism. To allow individual members of an organization to sign agreements with employers would be an intolerable position. I never heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) so weak as he was when discussing this question to-night. He was palpably arguing against his own convictions. He said that this was not a Government measure but that he would vote for the acceptance of the amendment in order to avoid a crisis, and that Ministerial supporters would be free to vote as they chose. What reasons' have been advanced for the acceptance of the amendment? I was present in the Senate when the proposal was under consideration thei'e, aud it was debated almost entirely by pastoralist representatives. If this Committee rejects it, and the Government intimate to the Senate that, in their opinion, it is an unconstitutional proposal, I have no doubt that it will be dropped. Upon the other hand, if it be adopted here, it will aim a blow at unionism, and will certainly not tend to industrial harmony in the future. The Australian Workeis Union has loyally supported the principle of arbitration, even when it has been opposed by other organizations. Consequently, it is up to us to support it now. The Australian Workers Union objects to its rights being filched from it by individual members of the organization being permitted to enter into agreements with Mr Riley. But their employers. Let us stand by the union which has stood by arbitration.",63
348,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,There has practically been no strike amongst the shearers since 1907.,64
349,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"This great organization has directed all its energies to the prevention of strikes. Now it is asking the GoTheir vernment to help it by refusing to allow its members to enter into private agreements with pastoralists. In the interests of industrial peace, and on account of the record of the Australian Workers Union, I trust that the amendment will be rejected.",64
350,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Wakefield) [9.52] - The people of South Australia, who are interested in this matter, feel very strongly upon it. Personally I desire to secure some measure of stability for the pastoral industry, in the interests of the employees as well as of the graziers. It is idle for honourable members opposite to suggest that for years there have been no strikes in the shearing industry. There have been strikes every year, somewhere. Sou*h Australia, however, has been exceptionally free from them. The Pastoralists Association, and graziers generally, desire that the right of individual members of the Australian Workers Union to enter into agreements with them shall be continued, because it has been the custom for these men to sign on in the various towns where labour has been picked up, for more than thirty years. Upon many occasions, the unions have forbidden them to sign agreements that they would fulfil the terms of existing awards. What does that mean to the station-owners, and particularly to the old shearers, who have a large circuit, and who have been engaged in shearing' for eight or nine months out of every year? It means that these men will have the privilege of completing their big rounds with as little interruption as possible. If they are forbidden to sign agreements they will have to risk being involved in a cessation of work for a considerable period, because of unreasonable demands being made by a few individuals upon their arrival at a station. I am not here to justify the action of unreasonable pastoralists. If they do not choose to play the game they deserve to be penalized. But generally speaking the Senate's amendment, if adopted, will be productive of industrial hanmony, because it is in the interedts of both parties. Some honourable members opposite have hinted that certain things will happen if all their demands are not granted. Surely it is just about time that the industries of this country had a look in . No reasonable man can say that generous attention has not been given by this Parliament, and by the State Parliaments to industrial matters for years past. I hope that we shall not allow these pin pricks, which are administered by men who are lepers in this particular industry, to disturb dustrial harmony. Let us have a little bit of peace and some stability for the industry. For the information of my Scotch friend, the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley), I desire to explain what occurred in this Chamber when the first division upon this question was taken. The Minister in charge of Bill stated that he was not certain that Gregory) in this Chamber only eleven the proposed amendment was constituhonorable tional, and added that Sir Robert Garran had expressed a doubt upon - the matter.",64
351,Mr GROOM,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,And I read his opinion.,65
352,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I did not take much notice of that;-becaus e it was backed only by a sort of half confidence - whe n I learned what was the opinion of Mr Adrian Knox. The opinion pressed by the latter has since been supclause ported by the opinions of two other eminent KC.'s. Surely the great woollen industry of this country-the bigge3t dustry that we have-is entitled to some consideration. If the men who represent that industry choose to obtain the opinions of the highest legal talent in the land upon this question, they have a perfect right to do so. I aim quite certain that tional? the stability of the industry will be promoted by the adoption of the amendment.",65
353,Mr RODGERS,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"And if fair weather experienced, the pastoralists will throw the meat for the shearers.",65
354,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"As has been pointed out by the honourable memceptance ber for Robertson (Mr Fleming) not much difficulty will be experienced i dealing with that question. I know that there are some pastoralists who have no brains, otherwise they would not make trouble on account of an extra 2d. or per lb. in the price of meat supplied to the shearers. It would pay them better to have the latter start operations in a contented and happy frame of mind. In that case the increased efficiency, which they would obtain, would more than offset a small loss in the price of the meat supplied to their employees.",65
355,Mr LAZZARINI,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Werriwa) [10.0] An astounding piece of knowledge I have gained to-night is that it is not this Chamber that has the say in matters of importance concerning the administration of the affairs of this country, but that ani n - other Chamber governs this House. As a matter of fact, two members of another place govern us in regard to the proposal now under consideration, because the new clause which we are asked to accept was carried in the Senate by a majorit y of two. There were nine senators in favour of it and seven opposed to it , whereas when the provision was moved by the hon the orable member for Dampier (Mr . members voted for it while thirty-seven voted against it . I wonder how many of those thirty-seven have changed their opinions. We know that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . Richard Foster) has done so, because he has just informed us that he voted against it previously because Sir Robert exGarran had declared that the proposed was unconstitutional, which opinion the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has confirmed to-night. If the provision is in - unconstitutional, why should we go through the farce of inserting it in the Act and making this Parliament the laughing-stock of the people when ultimately the section in question comes to be declared by the High Court unconstituImmediately opposition was raised to the Senate's amendment today, and mention was made of the Australian be Workers Union and certain agreements, in the honourable member for Dampier and the honourable member for Wakefield, who have fought so strenuously for the acof the Senate's proposal, in t e r jected that members of the Australian n Workers Union are already working under agreements with the pastoralists in regard to the price of meat. But the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) 3d. has pointed out that the members of the Australian Workers Union could not get the pastoralists ;to make these agreements until this year, and that they had heen obliged to insert' a rule in their constitutions in order to make provision for them. 1 And now it: - would seem, - when' the first year covered by these agreements is about to expire, that the pastoralists are making use' of the fact that they have been entered into as a lever for having this provision inserted in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. At any rate, it would appear that they have some motive behind their action in consenting to make these agreements for the past twelve months. Perhaps they were looking a few moves ahead, for it is certain that they have mobilized their forces and laid their plans very carefully in order to get this provision into the Act, backed up by their friends, not only in another place, but also in this Chamber. I have had some experience with some of the big squatters of New South Wales, and, in my opinion, once this clause is agreed to the Australian Workers Union will find it very hard to get the price of meat fixed in any future agreements, or the inclusion of any of the other items usually to-be found in them, before shearing time. I believe that the provision is directed against this large organization,, and that the signing of agreements before going to shearing sheds will not only prove dangerous to them, but will also prevent the smooth working of the industry in which they are engaged.",65
356,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,They admit that it applies to them only.,66
357,Mr LAZZARINI,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"But there are clauses in the constitutions of all industrial . unions providing that none of their members shall make individual agreements with employers, and any attempt to cut those clauses out, and make collective bargaining impossible, will be a direct blow at one of the fundamental principles of unionism. In fact, I am satisfied, that this amendment is a deliberate attempt, as one honourable member has put it , to get the "" white-anting "" process into trade unionism, and drive the organizations into taking direct action. It is certainly a farce to introduce an Industrial Peace Bil l with the idea of creating industrial harmony, and then come along a few weeks afterwards with a provision - which must fill the country with industrial unrest, because ho trade unions would dare to register under an Arbitration Act which compelled them to take out of their constitutions all provisions preventing their members from signing individual agreements with employers. I agree with - the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) that we have spent about three months of this session in dealing with Bills patching up existing legislation or introducing new proposals for dealing with industrial troubles; but, on the other hand, I hold that each and every one of them is just as likely to create industrial unrest as to bring about industrial harmony, and that is more particularly true in regard to the proposal now under consideration. We are told by the Prime Minister that it is most likely unconstitutional, but rather than lose a Bill which he seems to think is essential to industrial peace he is prepared to allow the policy of the Government to be dictated by two out of the 111 members of the two Chambers. Honourable members here and legal authorities outside claim that the Commonwealth Parliament has ample power to deal with matters that make for industrial unrest other than trouble in connection with trade unions, and one thing that has brought about considerable unrest and grumblings in this country for the last four years is the depredations of profiteers.",66
358,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,^The honourable member is now referring to a matter which is out. side the scope of the Senate's amendment.,66
359,Mr LAZZARINI,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I was merely referring to something that has tended to bring about industrial unrest. It is suggested that we can pass this legislation, although it may be declared to be unconstitutional, yet' evidently nothing can be done in other directions that tend to create industrial unrest, because some one claims that it is unconstitutional for this Parliament to attempt' to do so. According to the Prime Minister,' the Senate's amendment is unconstitutional and cannot be used, even if it is inserted in the Act, but rather than sacrifice the Bill he is prepared to make a fool of himself and of the Bill and the Government. , Mr Charlton - Rathe r than make hia followers agree to it .",66
360,Mr LAZZARINI,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Possibly. The argument of honourable members who have spoken in favour of the proposal is that it will have no effect on trade unionism. They say, "" It is merely nothing; so let it go."" But we know what has been the result of the fight for unionism from its very inception, when a few men organized in other countries and started unions, and when they came to this country and organized s.o that the membership of unions grew from a few thousands to tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands. They will do nothing except in a collective capacity. An honourable member opposite talked about the tyranny of certain unions over their members. As a matter of fact a member enters a union for co-operation and collective bargaining. There is no doubt that if individuals are allowed to sign contracts, and if any union making a rule prohibiting this course of action is debarred from registration, the Arbitratio n Court will be absolutely impossible as a means for the settlement of disputes to any trade union in the country.",67

362,Mr CHARLTON,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,And there were only eleven members in this House supporting the amendment in the first place.,67
363,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"I have had a very long connection with the Australian Workers Union. For many years I knew its inner workings as well as the next man. If there is one line of policy that we as a Parliament should, follow, it is to strengthen the hands of those in the i union who are prepared to abide by the principle of arbitration. By passing the amendment which has been, inserted in another place, we are really, being asked to play into the hands of the extreme section in the union, to whom we are handing another weapon with-.which to fight those who are trying to 'keep the union within the purview of ' the Arbitration Court. For that reason I intend to vote against the proposal.",67
364,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"This will affect,' not only the Australian Workers Union, but every other organization that registers .under the Arbitratio n Court. . . , ' , - Mr HECTOR LAMOND - VXsee the danger, which, I am sure, has escaped the It would notice of the Prime Minister..'While this may not now affect members of unions who do not enter into engagements in the same sense as the - Australian', Workers Union, this amendment if agreed to will open the door to a small section - of unscrupulous employers, who may/under, its - protection, force upon unions ithat-hitherto have not had agreements,"" very objectionable conditions indeed.

This amendment will take away that power, and so weaken the union in its fight for conditions which may be fair and reasonable. It is not right to say that the whole of the pastoralists, or a majority of them, are unreasonable; but it is a fact that on some stations the conditions imposed upon men, after they have signed agreements, with regard to matters not touched by the award, have been such as to deprive them, in part, of the benefits of the award. It is because of my appreciation of this fact that I am unable to follow the Government in regard to the Senate's amendment.",67
365,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Darling) [10.17] The honourable members for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), Barker (Mr Livingston), and Robertson (Mr Fleming) expressed solicitude for the members of the Australian Workers Union, but I may point out that this rule, No. 112, is not an executive rule, passed by a handful of men. For a number of years the treatment of Australian Workers Union members by certain squatters was such as to practically compel our members to demand that the Convention should provide some safeguard. Delegates from all parts of Australia attended the Convention, and it was only after many hundreds of resolutions had been received that this rule was brought into operation. Our men found, after they had signed agreements in Sydney, and went to Cunnamulla, Longreach, Camooweal, or away out on the Oodnadatta line, totally different conditions of working, especially with regard to meat, and so they were compelled to protect themselves against unscrupulous employers. The extra-ordinary feature about this amendment is that the Government do not believe in it. The Prime Minister, who is also Attorney-General (Mr Hughes), does not believe in it , and the Minister in - icharge (Mr Groom) did not believe in it last week. Whether, since then, he has been converted to a belief in it or - not, I do not know, but I do not think 'he has. I think he is solid enough on law not to be turned aside merely by the quotation of a few legal opinions; for after all, one may buy almost any kind of opinion one chooses. I am prepared to say that, with regard to this particular matter, I could get opinions, contrary to those quoted during, this debate, all over Melbourne, or any other city. These legal opinions do not go for very much. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) is quite frank about his attitude. He is working in conjunction with the pastoralists' organization. There is no doubt that the amendment emanates from the pastoralists' organization. There is equally no doubt that it is aimed at one organization alone. It will have far-reaching and important effects, as was shown by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor). If by means of this amendment Parliament is to interfere with the rules of organizations registered under the Arbitration Act, those who support the amendment will do more than they intended, namely, to aim a blow at a particular organization. I say to honourable members, many of whom voted against this amendment a few days ago, that they ought to be very careful indeed lest they wreck the whole Act. There is a large number of unions which specifically lay down in their rules that no member shall individually sign an agreement - that members shall not sign any agreement at all.",68
366,Mr RILEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,That is a foundational principle.,68
367,Mr TUDOR,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,Practicall y every organization has that rule.,68
368,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,I do not know any organization that has not.,68
369,Mr BAMFORD,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,'The principle right along has been collective bargaining.,68
370,Mr BLAKELEY,REVENUE FROM ALCOHOLIC,"Exactly . The Australian Workers Union is the only organization in Australia which provides for individual . agreements, and it is the only organization at which the amendment is aimed. When this amendment was previously before this Committee eleven members voted in favour of it and thirtyseven against it. In another place nine voted for it, and seven against, leaving an affirmative majority of two out of a total membership of thirty-six. What is the reason for this change in the attitude pf the Government, a change that is extraordinary in view of the attitude adopted by the Prime Minister to-night? He told us, quite frankly, that he does not believe in the amendment, 'and that, in his opinion, it is unconstitutional. He deprecated the idea of any organization attempting to dictate to Parliament as to how it shall legislate. One would deduce from the Prime Minister's demeanour that the influences mentioned hy the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) are at work, and that they are so strong as to practically control this Chamber and another place. No new evidence has been brought forward in support of the amendment.",68
