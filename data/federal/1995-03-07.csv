1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 12.30 p.m., and read prayers. NA Zakharov, Senator Alice Olive",11
2,Mr HOWE,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on 6 March 1995, of Senator Alice Olive Zakharov, a Senator for the State of Victoria since 1982, places on record its appreciation of and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement. Olive Zakharov was born on 19 March 1929 in Melbourne. Olive held a degree in arts from Melbourne University and also gained professional qualifications in counselling. These skills were effectively employed in her career as a teacher and student counsellor. Olive also worked in many other occupations. She was a registered psychologist, a pathology assistant, a shop assistant, a mail officer, a waitress and a fruit picker. She grew up in the Depression years and later experienced the enormous difficulties of being a single mother without the support mechanisms that are available to women today. She was willing to turn her hand to almost any job to support her family. Her unswerving commitment to social justice and peace was born in these early years. Olive came to the Senate in 1983, having already established a career and raised her family. She had been a long standing member of the Labor Party and was an executive member of the Montmorency branch for 20 years. When asked why she started her parliamentary career so late in life, she likened herself to the veteran runner Cliff Young when she said, 'Late runs can be very successful.' She also said that this question, when asked of women, points to a lack of understanding about women's lives and about her own life as a sole parent with children to raise. When she reached the Senate, among her many contributions were her role as Temporary Chairman of Committees and, significantly, her work as chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. She also served effectively in the estimates committee processes, on the Senate Standing Committees on Community Affairs, Regulations and Ordinances, Senators' Interests, National Resources, Environment, Recreation and the Arts, on the Joint Committee on ASIO, on the Joint House Committee, and on the Senate Select Committees on Video Material and on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill. This broad range of participation shows us her commitment and dedication her long to making the world a better place. Olive was acknowledged as the Humanist of the Year in 1984. She was a noted participant and contributor to the peace movement, being a member of the Campaign for International Cooperation and Disarmament and of World Women Parliamentarians for Peace. Olive represented the Australian peace movement in 1988 as a witness of the first destruction of a nuclear missile in the USSR and the START treaty, and was Australian delegate to the Vienna Peace Conference in 1987. A committed trade unionist and feminist, Olive was involved in affirmative action development. Her earlier life and work experiences as a part-time student and employee strengthened her understanding of the female's role in society and also heightened her strong commitment to social justice. A long-time crusader for women's rights, she was well known for her stand against domestic violence. The measure of her courage and personal strength was demonstrated when, in 1993, she spoke publicly about the mental and physical abuse she .had suffered. She was prepared to do this because she thought it would make it in some way easier for other women to confront their own experiences of domestic violence-and seek support. Olive worked hard to improve women's working conditions, focusing particularly on sexual harassment issues. She was a strong supporter of the sexual discrimination legislation. Her fight for women, the disadvantaged and, more recently, the rights of homosexuals was well known and widely documented. Her commitment came from the heart. She worked at making herself accessible to her electorate and even made sure that her office was located in a shopping centre which was well serviced by public transport. This may seem a small thing, but it demonstrated support for effective democracy by being available at all times to people who needed help. One of Olive's favourite quotes which she would refer to was from Hamlet. This, she said, epitomised her personal philosophy: This above all: to thine own self be true. And it must follow, as the night follows day. Thou then be false to any man . . . and to this, Olive added 'woman'. Olive was a socialist, a unionist and a feminist, and today we remember her term of office to the people of Victoria and the women of Australia. I know that the death of Olive Zakharov has come as a shock to us all and we are deeply saddened. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) also extends his sympathy to the family and will be issuing a separate statement about Olive later in the day. On the day that Olive was involved in the accident, which ultimately was to lead to the loss of her life, she came racing across Station Pier to lobby me about the Seamen's Mission building down in Port Melbourne which she felt ought to be preserved. I remember at the time feeling what an effort it must have been, knowing how long Station Pier is if you have to run it. She went on later that day to a function associated with the commitment that she had to the gay rights movement. I suppose I got to know Olive Zakharov as well as I got to know any member of the parliament. She was always a low key person, but she was at the same time a person of enormous commitment-commitment to values of social justice, to building a more peaceful world, to creating a society which was more participatory and to earning some recognition for the enormous challenges women face as they come into this parliament. Olive was, on our side of politics, a pioneer-someone who I think was able to demonstrate, through her own commitment and her own work, the importance of broadening the representation of this parliament so that one day there will be equality of sexes, one day there will be in this parliament. a recognition that women have the opportunity here to speak for that half of the population they represent. On behalf of the government,Â· I extend to her children, Martin, Robin and Jeannie, our most sincere sympathy at this time of their bereavement.",11
3,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"On behalf of the parliamentary Liberal Party, I would like to associate myself with the motion just moved by the Acting cannot Prime Minister (Mr Howe). The distressing circumstances of Senator Zakharov's death are known to all of us, and I particularly want to convey to her three children our sympathy and to record both my respect and that of my parliamentary colleagues for the faithful way in which she representedJtl:1e,;values,thatshe held and the beliefs that she brought to this place. I do not pretend that on some issues I would have had similar views to the late senator, but that is the nature of politics and, as the Acting Prime Minister said in quoting those memorable words from Hamlet, being true to yourself and what you believe in is the best thing that people can bring to publicJife. I did not know Senator Olive Zakharov very well. I suppose it is the nature of this place that, if you are in the House of Representatives and somebody else is in the Senate, and they are on the other side and they are not a member of the cabinet or of the shadow cabinet, you do not see a lot of them. But my recollection of her is that she was an immensely courteous person whenever I met her, and a very friendly one; I do recall a few months ago hearing an interview that she gave on a current affairs program on the issue of domestic violencesomething to which the Acting Prime Minister has referred. I think one can say without any fear of contradiction that, whatever our differences may be on other political issues, all Australians would be united in feeling a sense of revulsion on the issue of domestic violence. And violence against women, either in the home or in any other part of the community, is something that ought to earn the continuing condemnation of people right across the political spectrum. It is one of those issues that does unite what are often classed as 'conservative' groups in the community and others that are classed as rather more radical, progressive groups in the community. I thought that what she said on that occasion had great impact. She certainly was, to use an old and revered Australian expression, very much a 'battler' in her early life. The difficulties she obviously experienced and the responsibilities involved in bringing up three children on her own-and obviously in very difficult circumstances-qualified her very clearly for that description. She was committed to a number of causes that, of course, in the 1960s and 1970s would have found her on the other side of the argument, certainly from me and, I guess; from most of my colleagues, and perhaps even from some of her own colleagues at that particular time. But this is not an occasion do other than to note those things with the respect that strongly held differing political views deserve. I would like, therefore, to in every way associate myself with what has been said by the Acting Prime Minister. I know the loss of a colleague in these sorts of circumstances is not only distressing for the colleague's family but also for those who have been very closely associated with them. I know there will be many people in the Australian Labor Party today who will feel very keenly her loss. I respect that and I understand that and, on behalf of my party, I join the Acting Prime Minister in conveying sympathy to her family.",12
4,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"I too join with the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) .in supporting this motion of condolence with regard to the untimely death of the late Senator Olive Zakharov. There are two things I would like to add. Senator Zakharov chose to pursue her interests and activities as a senator in fields far and wide. It is not generally known that she took a particular interest in travelling to Antarctica as part of her Senate work in conjunction with the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and others, and maintained an interest in the Australian government and scientific activities in our Antarctic territories over her period subsequent to visiting that place. She also travelled to a lonely military outpost on the Russia-China border a few years back to witness the destruction of some weaponry in that location-an issue which, I must say, she was consistent about over her whole lifetime. It must have been a particular reward and delight for her to be there as part of that particular treaty adherence to see, physically, the destruction of that Russian weaponry in that location. I was very saddened by the news of her accident a few weeks back and sent messages through on that occasion, and now on the news of her death. It is appropriate that, as we consider this condolence motion, I refer again to that very courageous press conference and interview to which the Leader of the Opposito tion referred. I could do no better than quote her two most relevant answers on the question of domestic violence where she emerged to put down her own personal circumstance in a way which, I hope, will make a contribution to lessening the degree of domestic violence which exists. It is far too much and, in a perfect world, there should not be any, but that is not reality. However, it is a testament to Senator Zakharov that she said on that occasion on 9 November 1993: Well, I was in a violent domestic relationship for some years-not violent in the sense, I guess, my life was never in danger and I didn't end up in a casualty department of a hospital. But I did have to seek medical attention on several occasions, and certainly I was subject to not just a physical violence but a great deal of verbal violence and threats over a number of years. I discovered that a problem that I'd had with my eyesight relates to a head injury. That head injury was inflicted by my then husband in a serious case of concussion. She went on to make the very valid point: Well, I think for one thing it shows that you can go through these experiences and survive them and lead a full and happy life afterwards. There are people in positions where they can influence policy and so on who do understand about the situationthe situation of women and children who are the victims of violence. I am very happy now to feel free to take that step in the hope that it will help other women across Australia. I salute the work of Senator Zakharov. I did not by any means agree with all that she pursued as a senator and as a member of the Labor Party from the state of Victoria, but in my own visit to Antarctica and elsewhere I encountered her on many occasions and found her to be a perfectly pleasant lady to spend time with. She was obviously a soul mate of the Acting Prime Minister. I extend the sympathy of members of the National Party of Australia to members of the Zakharov family and to the Acting Prime Minister.",13
5,Dr LAWRENCE,CONDOLENCES,"I very strongly support the motion of condolence and the tributes already paid, and no doubt those that will be paid, to Olive Zakharov. I had not known Olive for as long as many. Nonetheless, when I and my staff first heard of her accident and now of her death, we were struck by a sense of emptiness as she had been one of the crutches that held us up and helped us to do jobs that we do. So many of the issues that I confront as the Minister for Human Services and Health and as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women were worthy issues that Olive had committed her life to. As we have heard, Olive was committed to equality for women, the aged and the frail, the disabled, the mentally ill, sufferers of AIDS and, generally speaking, the less disadvantaged in our community. Her record shows very clearly that her commitment to social justice was not transient and had no element of opportunism about it. For Olive Zakharov, issues of social justice were not soft issues issues to be picked up and dropped depending on the political environment or for a photo opportunity. Her parliamentary record, and indeed her record before she entered parliament, show a consistent and unwavering commitment to the most disadvantaged in our communities. In this respect, Olive Zakharov was the heart and soul of the Labor Party-a nononsense worker but also a very passionate worker. She was a senator who was prepared to fight against injustice in the community and also prepared to fight to keep the important rights that had already been won. Olive did not like to see any backsliding, and she would remind us constantly that we should not allow it. I am sure many members would be aware that last year Labor women fought particularly hard and won a rule change which will ensure greater representation of women in our parliaments. It was a matter about which Olive Zakharov felt very strongly. In the leadup to the decision to ensure Labor women made up at least 35 per cent of all winnable seats by the next two elections I spoke a lot, but Olive did a lot to make sure that the rule was changed. She argued, as many of us did, that until our parliaments better reflect the composition of the Australian community our parliaments would necessarily be weaker and democracy would continue to suffer. The victory that we had on our' SIde of politics represents an important victory for Australian women. It was also a victory for Olive Zakharov because, as her career indicates, it is not easy for women to become politicians in the first place and, when they do, they have a lot to offer that is not always recognised. Olive, as many of you will know, was the only woman Labor representative from Victoria. Her story of preselection is sadly similar to that of many female politicians, and I am sure she would not mind if I take the opportunity to remind us of that. She was never ordained for a safe position on the Senate ticket. She won it from the third spot on the Labor ticket. She was elected as senator for Victoria in 1983 and re-elected in 1984, 1987 and 1993. So she has been with or us for the life of this government. Olive Zakharov's continuous re-election against the odds in many respects demonstrated her enormous courage and her preparedness to bat on for the sake of women's representation in our parliaments. Her experience of government coupled with her work and life experiences made her an asset to the women's movement and will continue to make her an asset in her memory. She will remain an asset too to the Labor Party and to this parliament. I know I speak for a great many people in this community, including a great many women, when I say in her passing she will be sadly missed.",14
6,Mrs SULLIVAN,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, it was with a great feeling of shock that heard on the radio this morning of the death of Senator Olive Zakharov. I knew Olive from the time she was first elected to the Senate almost exactly 12 years ago when I also was in the Senate. Our mutual interest in education put us in one another's company from the beginning, although on opposite sides of politics. Olive was a person who may not have been very well-known to members on this side of the House of Representatives unless they came from her state. She may even have been a little misunderstood. Olive was a gentle, quiet but firm personality who was always courteous, very considerate and very reasonable. She was an idealist, as was revealed in debate in parliament and through her other activities which have been outlined today. Olive was also doggedly egalitarian. You learned this, as you would know, Mr Speaker, through serving on the Joint House Committee with her. Even there she was always trying to look after the little person. At yesterday's meeting committee members decidedto send a message of good wishes to her for her return to health, but that message will never reach her or her family. I do not think we should spend too much time talking about Olive's courage in revealing her domestic violence experience because it is almost starting to sound--certainly from the radio broadcasts-as though that is all she did. Of course that is not so. Nevertheless, I am not sure that all the men in this parliament understand what sort of courage it took on Olive's part to speak about domestic violence. Domestic violence is a crime for which, classically, many people blame the victim. They think that the victim has done something shameful and has brought it upon themselves. Olive was prepared to run the risk of that sort of ridicule, whether public or private. She was also prepared to risk something that is precious to all of us who are in public life-that is, the loss of her personal privacy. It must have revived many painful memories for her, memories she would have wanted to have long since put behind her. She would have been aware that it would revive painful memories for those she loved, her family. Olive I never wore these experiences as a badge but talked about them only to help others. She made the point that being a victim of violence was not something of which any woman should be ashamed, but rather something we should all-those of us who are fortunate enough to be in a position to do something about it-be as brave as she was in tackling.",15
7,Ms MCHUGH,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, it is extremely difficult for those of us who were close to Olive Zakharov to speak now. It is too soon, and the grief is too painful. But I will not cry: you don't cry in the parliament. Indeed, tears for people you love should be very private tears. But as this motion goes to the family I have to speak, so I will say something very briefly to the family and then to the parliament. I say to the family that we actually share your loss in a most direct and personal way, firstly in understanding only now that the loss is such a shock, even though we were prepared for it; and, secondly, that Olive is just not there for us where she has always been. The family of course understands that so well. Since the 1983 election there have been all those committees, all those caucuses and all those meetings, and Olive was always there. There were even the little things you could do together in the parliament, such as eating together. It is simply impossible to believe that she is no longer there where we always looked for her. Beyond this place there were the marches, the rallies and all those tiny groups that others were too busy for but that Olive had time for. She was always there for women and for those in trouble. She never forgot their struggle because she had been through it. To the parliament and to the observers of the political process, I want to say this: Olive was not here for fame and fortune-she was not famous in media terms-but her role is of immense influence and significance to all those who were surprised to find that a politician is someone who is loyal and true, whose commitment is personal and whose dedication to unpopular causes is solid, unflinching and steadfast. Those causes so often become eventually acknowledged as mainstream concerns and often because of the years and years of unrecognised work by people like Olive Zakharov. So Olive's role is extremely important to the political process. But almost always this role is ignored by the media. If a politician is not playing the political game, is not becoming famous, is not climbing the ladder, that politician's role is almost always unacknowledged and even derided as not being successful. But what should be recognised is the role and the contribution of the backbencher, the committee worker and the winner of elections. That is what people like Olive do for their party. When Olive stood in 1993 she had every reason to look forward to retirement, to look forward to having at last the time to do the things that she had never had time to do or had been able to afford to do, but she realised there was no woman standing for the Labor Party from Victoria. So, as has been said, for a cause she stood for the third seat and, of course, she won. I will say something about what Olive meant for me. The best thing about Olive was that she was so hardline. You always knew exactly what Olive felt about everything. Olive one day said to me that she wanted to come around to my office and see me. I asked, 'What is it?' She said, 'No, I must come to your office to see you.' I thought, 'Good heavens, where have I failed? Where have I not been sufficiently hardline? Does Olive have to rebuke me?' But when she came she gave me a little plastic case in which was mounted a piece of that metal from the first destruction of nuclear weapons - a pretty important achievement for those who had stood around for years supporting the fringe issues. I will have that with me always. I have it with me always wherever I go. It reminds me of something else I have with me always-the scissors and letter opener that belong to Jessie Street that were given to me by her son. Those objects will be with me always, as they are, representing the achievement of two very different women from very different backgrounds who fought for exactly the same causes. It seems to me that, just as it was years and years before Jessie Street was fully recognised and her role in the Australian community fully recognised, so it may be some time before we know how to recognise Olive Zakharov's work. But the thing that I would like to say for the future is that I hope we begin now to work out how we can make Olive's place more recognisable in history in the future than perhaps it was to most Australians during her absolutely wonderful lifetime.",15
8,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,CONDOLENCES,"Dawson}--I want to speak briefly on this condolence motion. About three years ago I was with Olive on a visit to Scotland and found that that was her homeland. At that time Don Dobie was with us, so there was a bit of mixing of the two classes. On that occasion Olive, in a very dignified way, let us know what it meant to live in poverty, to be brought up in poverty, to have to work to support a family at a very early age and to be subject to class distinction. Having known her from that episode, that did not poison her mind in any way whatsoever in her attitude towards others and in the job she had to do. lt certainly struck me that her attitudes were formed from what she went through in her youth. Her personality was one of compassion and warmth to anybody who knew her. Nobody on either side of the House would ever say that Olive's and my politics would ever meet, but, when I was the shadow minister for disability services, I felt that those people throughout Australia who handled disability services knew that when they put a case to the committee for which she is the chairman they would be received and those decisions would be made on the facts and not on politics. I just want to say to Jeannie, whom I met on that occasion, that Mavis and I send our very warm sympathies to her and to the other members of the family. I am sure they have lost a great mother and a great inspiration, but they have a great example to follow.",16
9,Mr BARRY JONES,CONDOLENCES,"Olive Zakharov was a blithe spirit. She had borne the burden of poverty and had known and overcome hardship in her own life but rejected bitterness and frustration in favour of activism and compassion. I am touched to see a large number of members from both sides of the House present for this tribute for somebody from the other place. She came to the Senate at the age of 54, but her 12 years of service were years of growth, challenge, even adventure. As the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) pointed out, she was a great enthusiast for the Antarctic. Her interests were global, local and personal. She was passionately committed to the cause of peace and disarmament, and to overcoming global poverty-in which women and children were particular victims-and environmental pollution problems. At the local level she was equally passionate in her commitment to community values, working against injustice, to networking and to thepre'servatiort of things of value. The story that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) told about her last words on the Seamen's Mission building being preserved is very characteristic. At the personal level, she worked to overcome personal prejudice and legal discrimination against sexual minorities and victims of AIDS and mental illness. She wanted to improve the lives of women and children and protect them from domestic violence and the impact of poverty, and she wanted to secure social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. She epitomised the best values of the Labor movement: the human face-alas, not the only one-of politics. As national President of the party to which she devoted so much of her life, I pass on my deepest respect to Olive's children and family. She touched us all, and in her passing leaves us in her debt. The words from Hamlet that were quoted were taken from a speech by Polonius-not, I would have thought, a particularly appropriate role model for Olive Zakharov. We could have paraphrased John Donne and said: 'No woman is an island, entire of herself, but a part of the continent, a piece of the main ... Never send to ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for the.'",16
10,Mr CHARLES,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to support the motion by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe). I did not know Olive well but, as a Victorian, she came to my electorate several years ago to open a new centre for the physically and mentally disabled in order to help them find active workplaces in the community-an issue to which she and I were both committed. I am certain there are many issues and many sides of the philosophy of political debate on which we would not have agreed, but I have to say that I found her a woman of absolute integrity. It seems to me that she held belief strongly, firmly and rightly and that she did an excellent job in her way of representing her views and her beliefs. I believe that we are a stronger parliament, a stronger representative of the people of this nation, that we have such diversity and are able to debate such issues in a strong manner but as ladies and as gentlemen. Olive Zakharov was courageous. She was a warm, friendly and kind woman. I pass my condolences to her children and her wider family.",17
11,Mr HOLDING,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to support the condolence motion before the House. I want to speak of Olive Zakharov in another context. She was, of course, as we all know, a distinguished senator, but for me she was not merely a constituent; she was a close political colleague. She lived in Port Melbourne in a street called Swallow Street, which is certainly not the flashest street in my electorate or in Melbourne. On one occasion a Labor government decided that it was going to put a development into the whole Port Melbourne area, which she and I opposed. With some courage and commitment, and on behalf of a local community, she formed what is still known as the Swallow Street Association. That was a commitment by her, taking on people in her own party on behalf of people who were her community. She loved them and served them and they loved her and respected her in return. It was typical, as the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) said, that on what we now know to be the last day of her conscious life she turned up at a function-apparently her invitation had been mislaid or not receivedhaving run almost the full distance of Station Pier in order to lobby-I hope successfullyhim and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). Why? Because there is an old building that neither the state government nor the local community know quite what to do with, but that is an historic building and an important building. I do not think she stopped running for the rest of the day because in a matter of a few hours she was at the Mid-summa festival, a festival for gay and lesbian people. It is often forgotten that, when it was not such a popular cause to support those groups, Olive Zakharov, because she could not stand any kind of discrimination and because of her commitment to people, was one of the first people in this parliament to say there is no such thing as a second-rate Australian. Her death I think diminishes all of us, but her life and her commitment to the Australian people strengthens all of us. I certainly was privileged to know and work with her on a variety of causes. She is one of the few senators that I know who did not merely have a commitment to and involvement with the great issues that faced the nation but never forgot the people of Swallow Street, never forgot the people of Port Melbourne, and was as actively involved with important local issues as she was in her commitment to her broader political role. I believe she has left her community and her party an enduring legacy because her life inspired many of the younger women in the Labor movement. I believe that at some time in the very near future they will enrich this institution and their commitment and capacity will have been strengthened because they knew and worked with Olive Zakharov. For that life we must all be grateful, for her commitment to her party, to the trade union movement and to this institution is something which I believe will loom large in the history of our movement and in the history of this parliament.",17
12,Mr RONALDSON,CONDOLENCES,"I also support this motion and, on behalf of regional Victoria, pass on my condolences to Olive Zakharov's family. The commitment that Olive Zakharov had to regional Victoria is probably not well known in this House, except to Victorians. She was a regular attendee, she opened a number of hostels and other types of institutions, and I found her to be a lady of incredible strength. She was just one of those people's people. I remember the first time. I arrived at the airport after my election she was there and she knew who I was, as I suspect she knew who all the new members were, irrespective of which side of politics they were from. She was the first to extend her congratulations and to wish me well. I am sure honourable members know what a busy life Olive Zakharov led. What they may not know is that her timetable in regional Victoria involved her in working extraordinarily long hours. I know, from speaking to her at functions, that she had often been to two or three functions before she arrived and that she would go to two or three afterwards. She is a lady that will be very sorely missed. I think she represents everything that we in this place should represent.",18
13,Mr HOLLIS,CONDOLENCES,"I support the condolence motion moved for the late Senator Olive Zakharov. I served with Olive on the Joint House Committee and, as you would know, Mr Speaker, she always put the rights of the workers to the fore. I also served with her on a delegation to China. Perhaps it was typical of Olive's broad range of interests that, at the time of her death, she was coming from the Mid-summa festival of the gay and lesbian group in Melbourne. My strongest memories of Olive are through our common interest in Antarctica, which other honourable members have referred to today. As members of the parliament, we had the great privilege of visiting the Australian Antarctic Territory. As a consequence of her visit and long interest in Antarctica, she became a founding member and strong supporter of the Australian Parliamentary Antarctic Alliance, which began and continues as a bipartisan group of members of this parliament who have visited Antarctic. Our annual dinner to be held in May will be greatly diminished by her absence. Senator Zakharov was the chair of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, which in December 1985 tabled a report examining issues relating to the exploitation of the natural resources of the Australian Antarctic Territory. She visited Casey base in late 1984 and early 1985, travelling on the MV Iceberg and becoming probably the first female member of the Australian parliament to travel to Antarctica by ship. I know that Senator Melzer also visited Antarctica, but she flew there. Olive, like many of us, went on the MV Iceberg and endured that two-week journey. I think she was the first female member of the Australian parliament to travel to Antarctica by ship. In May 1984, as part of the inspections for her committee inquiry, she took part in the Macquarie Island airdrop, which involved dropping mail, fresh fruit and vegetables from a RAAF Hercules at a height of only 200 feet. I have been told that she greatly enjoyed that experience. Because of her professional background, she also took a very keen interest in the selection procedure for the Antarctic expeditioners. She always showed a keen interest in environmental issues. This was highlighted by her chairing of the Senate natural resources committee, which conducted an inquiry into issues relating to the possible exploitation of the resources of Kakadu National Park. I and many of my colleagues will greatly miss Olive's presence in this parliament. I think the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) summed it up very well when she said, 'You could always count on Olive to be there. She would always have a friendly word for you.' My condolences go to her family.",18
14,Mr NEHL,CONDOLENCES,"I certainly do not relish the opportunity of speaking to this motion and supporting it. I would much prefer not to. One does not get to know all of the senators even after having been here for 10 years. They seem to keep breeding over there, and we keep seeing new faces with little red badges. Olive Zakharov was one senator that I did come to know, like and be very fond of-although certainly we were politically opposed-and I think that is a result of her great enthusiasm. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) have mentioned her interest in Antarctic. As convenor of the Australian Parliamentary Antarctic Alliance, I want to formally mention the great enthusiasm that Olive had for Antarctica. The Australian national Antarctic research expeditions have lost a great supporter. I can recall the very first time that I became aware of her and saw her name: it was on the MV Iceberg, the vessel mentioned by the member for Throsby. The former member for Banks, John Mountford, the Leader of the National Party and the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and I were bouncing along and approaching Casey when 10 and behold the telex produced Christmas greetings from Olive Zakharov. That was when I first became aware of her. Of course, in subsequent years I became very much aware of Olive Zakharov, particularly as I had the opportunity of serving with her on committees and, as others have said, on delegations. The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) mentioned the Joint House Committee. Again, Olive displayed her intense enthusiasm and dedication for everything that came before that committee. I will mention one thing in particular. Although I am certain she would not have been in the situation of having children come to the House to use some form of childminding facility, as you know, Mr Speaker, she was absolutely steadfast in her drive on the Joint House Committee to seek that sort of facility. Again I commend the tremendous work she did for Australia and, in supporting the condolence motion, send my sincere sympathy to all of her family.",19
15,Mr KERR,CONDOLENCES,"I do not think I can add anything more moving than the tribute paid by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) earlier today on a personal basis to Olive Zakharov, but I do think I should mention a contribution she has made to this parliament which has not been touched on to date; that is, her service as a member of the Labor Party's Caucus Committee on Legal and Administrative Affairs. In this regard, Olive was exceptional for two reasons. Firstly, few members of our parliamentary party put themselves forward to serve on that committee. It is usually seen as fairly dry and technical, and there is only a handful of volunteers. Secondly, and more importantly, most who do put themselves forward have legal qualifications. Olive did not, but she justice as being the reason why we enact laws. The role of the committee was enlivened by the fact that she would come along to every meeting-and I mean every meeting-and put a common sense point of view and look to principle at all times. Certainly, both the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and I were made aware in our every endeavour that the matters we were dealing with were not simply technical or black-letter law but also issues that profoundly affected the rights of individuals. Olive Zakharov has left some very important legacies. Her commitment to the rights of creative people-journalists, artists and the like-has significantly affected the way in which I, and the government as a whole, addressed some of the issues which have come before us. In the area of civil liberties, her commitment to personal individual rights was very important. Her recognition that women in the community are in a vulnerable position and have been afflicted by violence and the like led her to accept that there were needs to be addressed in that regard. That also has had a very significant impact on the way in which our government has operated. I too join with the comments regarding her commitment to Antarctica. Her commitment to the rights of those who are part of the gay and lesbian community, I think, is well known and has already been commented upon. In every regard, Olive Zakharov was a woman of immense importance to the Australian community, whose role and contribution often were not seen in the public light and, unfortunately, are now being recorded posthumously. I share in the expressions of sympathy to her family.",19
16,Mr FORREST,CONDOLENCES,"I think it is a very sad day for the House, but as a new opposition backbencher I can stand here and say that in the short space of 20 months I was able to get to know Olive Zakharov very well. She was truly a senator representing all of Victoria, but she had an abiding interest in electorate of Mallee. From the very time she entered the Senate in 1983, she had shown that interest. I would add my voice of condolence to the family, backed by the tremendous saw respect with which she was regarded, particularly by rural women across the north-west of Victoria. She was an extremely hard working person and a great example to all of us. This place is available to ordinary Australians and Olive Zakharov epitomises the definition of an ordinary Australian. When we meet people we instantly either like or dislike them. I first met Olive Zakharov at the opening of an aged care facility in my electorate and I instantly liked her. She was invited to the openings of many aged care facilities and schools by people who respected her. I met her on these occasions and developed a very strong working relationship with her. At the opening of an aged care hostel in Red Cliffs I thanked her for the work she had done in ensuring that the funds were available. We needed funds for an aged care facility in Donald. I said, 'Olive, can I have your support on the next one? You can have all the kudos, you can have all the media and all the press; just get me the money'. She said, 'John, I don't want the kudos either'. I think that epitomises Senator Zakharov's character. I am pleased to be able to rise and add my condolences. This morning I spoke to my predecessor, Peter Fisher, and he described Olive Zakharov as a fine lady. He asked that his condolences be expressed in this place. My staff appreciated the cooperation extended by her office on every occasion when we were seeking to find out the status of funding applications. It is a very sad occasion. I was very saddened to hear of her accident. I am very sad right now as I hear the bipartisan expressions of tribute to a fine Australian. It would be my prayer that the expression of these sentiments allow her family to recover from their great grief.",20
17,Mr CLEELAND,CONDOLENCES,"My relationship with Olive goes back to the late 1970s when Olive was a member of the Montmorenthe cy branch of the Australian Labor Party and I was a member of the Greensborough branch, both of which formed the then Diamond Valley electorate. In those years in the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party there were certain strong factional divisions. Olive was on one side of the factional divisions and I was on another. At the time, Olive was a teacher at the Montmorency secondary college. She was a very active member of the Montmorency branch and she was also very active as a teacher. At that time it was not exactly lar to advocate sex education. Olive was in the local media advocating sex education and advocating it in a way which offended some of the sensibilities of the more prudish bers of the local community. She was a forerunner in many areas of social change. Whilst Olive and I often did not agree on issues within the greater Labor movement, nevertheless Olive was always consistent on the position she took. She never varied. As long as I have known Olive she was anti-nuclear; she was for peace. The Palm Sunday marches in Melbourne will never be the same because Olive will not be marching. Her views on feminism have always been strong and consistent. She has always been a focused person on these issues. As has been mentioned, she was a socialist. Her views on social justice and the fairness of economic distribution never varied from the time. I met her. She came from an area of Melbourne which has produced two particularly striking Labor women-Pauline Turner, who unfortunately died, and Olive Zakharov, who has unfortunately died. That area of Melbourne has been blessed with both of these women and the Labor movement in the Diamond Valley area has been blessed with both of these women. I hope her family accepts the genuine sympathy I extend to them today. She will be missed in the Labor movement and she will be missed in the broader community.",20
18,Mrs CROSIO,CONDOLENCES,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security)-I too rise to speak in support of the condolence motion moved by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and I do so not as one who knew Olive personally. I met Olive in 1990 when I came into this House. I feel in listening to the previous speakers who have offered their condolences that there is another part of Olive that needs to be related. Mr Speaker, as you are aware I normally do not speak on condolences because they are very personal things, but I would like to join the other speakers on this occasion. I came into this place in 1990 as a very new member of the federal parliament. I remember at the time that a family law bill popuwas going to come before the House. I was not on the legal and constitutional committee of caucus to which the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) referred. I asked whether I could mem- speak on what I believed should have been changed in relation to that particular bill. I had to go through the process of notifying the chairman. I appeared before that committee when I thought I had done all my research. I acknowledge what the Minister for Justice said about the legal eagles surrounding that table and I looked across at Olive and thought, 'I have a soul mate here. She will understand what I am talking about and she will certainly offer that support to me.' When I put up the proposition that I believed in mandatory reporting it was not our legal people who really tore strips off me, it was Olive. She stated from across the table that I did not understand the ramifications of that decision. After a lot of duress, the legislation certainly went through as it was. What I appreciated more than anything else was the fact that Olive Zakharov, the person, spoke to me outside and said, 'This is why I feel this way.' As I said, I did not know her that well then. She said, 'This is why I will always take this stand.' She took the time, effort and trouble to talk to me. As a new member of parliament at that time, I found that a lot of my colleagues did not often do that. They do not often stop and say, 'This is why I am doing something' or 'This is why I did it.' I too was quite shocked when we heard about the accident. I agree with others who have known her personally what a loss this will be to everyone. I appreciated Olive's presence in a number of other committees that we were involved with because she was not a hypocrite and could not stand hypocrisy. She was always very straight, to the point and honest. I admire that in her. We did not always agree. In fact, there were many times we openly disagreed, but at no time did I ever think I disliked Olive Zakharov. I could not dislike Olive. She was a person I admired and I will continue to admire. Other people have mentioned her work and also mentioned her maiden speech. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) read a quotation and it brought to mind a very simple thing I read once when someone I knew died. I would like to have this recorded in Hansard on behalf of the women who loved her: 'Olive Zakharov, you went to sleep without goodbye, but you have left loving memories for us to keep.'",21
19,Ms DEAHM,CONDOLENCES,"Being a new member in this place, I have only known Olive for two years. In that time she has been a very special person to me,particularly in relation to our work on the caucus women's group. Members may have seen Graham Richardson's appraisal of the women in this parliament in the January edition of the Australian Women's Weekly where he assessed us and made comments about us. After praising Olive's obvious attributes, which have been spoken of today, he said, 'She hides her light too well under a bushel.' I think the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) has said that very aptly. Olive Zakharov was not a publicity seeker. She was not a person who was scrambling up the greasy pole. She was a person who got in there and did it. I think that is a huge example for everyone in this place, men and women, because sometimes when we let our ambitions get ahead of us we forget what we are actually here for. I made a mistake one day in a committee. I made the comment, 'It is all right for you senators, you do not have constituents to worry about.' That was the wrong thing to say in front of Olive. She told me very smartly that her constituency was the whole of Victoria. I know from my colleagues, and I have heard it today, that she worked that electorate extremely hard. She did that with huge dedication. Last year I had the privilege of convening a small group to look at the implementation of the age pension equalisation scheme which is coming in later this year. Olive was a member of that. I valued enormously the amount of experience she had in legislation that and also her knowledge of women's issues. That was a very difficult area. There were a lot of arguments for and against equalising the pension age. To me, Olive's was the voice of great sanity in that debate. When we did our draft report, she was the one who came up with the most concrete suggestions-for minor changes but on things that were extremely important. It has been mentioned several times that she came into this place late in life. I came into this place a year later in age than she did. I felt very strongly that there was a place for people coming into this place at an older age because we have had a lot of life experience. We have learned a lot from the places we have been, the work we have done, the people we have met and the experiences we have had. I have had very different experiences from Olive but I think experience plays a part in this place. I am not trying to put down the younger people who have come in, because they have another dimension. But, like Olive, I am a late runner and, I hope, a successful one. To be able to emulate what Olive has done would be something enormous for any of us. Ms eRAWFORD (Forde-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development)- Mr Speaker, I rise to speak on this condolence motion in relation to Olive Zakharov because, in particular, I think Olive was genuinely one of the most decent and kind people in this parliament. When I first came here in 1987 she welcomed me to the status of women committee, saying, 'It's great; we are going to have another woman who can do some work with us.' Child care was then the major issue. Some time later, Olive probably was not quite so happy about the extension of fee relief and some other things in which she did not particularly believe but on which she later supported us. I think that was indicative of her. She certainly, as everyone has said, spoke up. She was also a very active member of the education committee. Of course, it is full of ex-teachers-many of whom are on this side of the chamber-and we all had certain views about teachers and the way things should done. But it was Olive who would always bring us back to the focus, which was that children and developing children were the reasons for having education. Many other people have talked about her work in rural communities and for families. I just want to say that I am saddened because, since she had become a grandmother with her daughter living in Brisbane, she had said, 'I will be able to come and see you and perhaps visit some of your rural women and we talk about the kinds of things we have develwhether oped in rural Victoria.' In that sense, her death is for me and for all of us a great I simply want to say that all of us who remember Olive will remember her genuine kindness, which she extended in a very individual way. At times when people had put their own private sadness, she was the one who was able to talk to them about that. While that is reflected in her political work, on a personal level she was very kind, very seen. generous and very supportive and she always showed that in a very soft and gentle way. For that we will always be grateful. We need to remember her for that because we could take a leaf out of her book and make the world a slightly gentler place.",22
20,Ms FATIN,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, I rise to support the condolence motion before the House. Like my colleague and friend the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), I hope I do not shed the tears here today that I will shed for Olive Zakharov. she a colleague of mine, she was also a friend. She and I came into this place together 1983. We did not know each other before that time. Since then, in the 12 years that we have been here, we have worked together even though we were in different houses in this place. I suppose the areas in which we worked together most were in and around the caucus status of women committee and in our tion, the Left faction. She was such a proud member of the Left faction of the Australian Labor Party and of the feminist movement. Of course, we have heard today from so many people here of her many contributions in this be place and outside the parliament. Olive represented not only Victoria but also Australia. No matter where she was, she was able to speak for so many of the constituencies in this country that have been referred to today. Olive's work on the status of women committee is what I remember most. She was the sort of woman that I and others measured ourselves against. As some of our colleagues have said here today, she was very direct. She wC5 totally committed to the women of Australiacan whether they be women on the streets, they be women struggling to gain education or advantage in some place in this loss. country, whether they be women in rural will areas, whether they be urban women, whether they be older women or whether they be younger women. Olive was always there to their case, to argue their case and to make sure that those of us who occasionally might waiver for one reason or another did not do it if it meant that some disadvantage might be I rise to pay tribute to my friend and to my colleague. I extend to her family, her friends and her staff my deepest sympathy. I know all that many people throughout Australia would want those of us here today to extend that sympathy to Olive's friends. We have lost a very great Australian. We have lost a woman who I believe will go down in history. She will never be forgotten by many of us. I believe that Australians will get to know the work that she has done for them in this place Not only was and in this country.",23
21,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,CONDOLENCES,"I also rise to support the condolence motion of the in Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) in respect of the loss of Olive Zakharov. I too have been here only a very short time. At my first status of women committee meeting, Olive took me aside while we were waiting for others to come in and said, 'Gee, Silv, it's terrific to have another woman in here.' I know exactly what the honourable for Forde (Ms Crawford) facfelt on her introduction to Olive. Another thing Olive said to me which I will never forget-as I said, she touched my life only briefly-was, 'Silvia, always do what you think is best and don't ever be daunted by those that will try to pressure you to change your mind.' I thought at that stage that Olive meant that, if there was something I wanted and strongly believed in, I should fight for it no matter what. From listening to what a lot of other people have said here today and hearing a lot of things that I did not know about Olive, I know that that is exactly what she meant. I will take that small beacon of light that Olive offered me back in May 1993 and take it with me throughout my time here in parliament. Like Olive, I was a late starter. But, like honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) and others of my age group, I did come in here with a lot of life experiences. I know I have had lots of life experiences that I can offer not only this place but the people of Australia. Olive was a very bright light that often was not seen. I can see from today that she is a light that will shine not only for the women of the Australian Labor Party but for the women and the people of Australia. I support the motion.",23
22,Mr GEAR,CONDOLENCES,"Canning-Assistant Treasurer}-I would like to associate myself with this motion. Like Olive I was elected to the parliament in March 1983. My first and most prominent memories of Olive are on backbench committees, in particular the education committee. Much has been said about Olive's contribution in terms of her committee work. As I listened to speeches, I was reminded of the fact that around this place at least it is usually the people who stand in this position or who have positions of prominence that get all the attention. Indeed, in some places and according to some commentators it is the amount of column inches you get around this place that determines your worth. I have never thought that. It is very sad that we have to be here today to remind ourselves that that is not the case. You could not get a better example than Olive Zakharov because she was always there doing the hard work. I was surprised today when listening to the contributions, as I think many of us were, at some of the work that Olive did. She was never someone who sought the limelight, but she was always someone who put in the hard yards, someone who was always willing to make sure that the people she represented were represented to the best of her ability. Olive Zakharov was a good friend. I will miss her greatly. I extend my condolences to her family.",24
23,Ms HENZELL,CONDOLENCES,"Capricornia}-I realise many people want to speak to this motion. I think it is a great tribute to Olive that so many members from both sides of the House have spoken with such feeling. I suspect Olive would have been quite embarrassed by this the spotlight of attention. Unobtrusiveness was almost her trademark and that I suspect lead many of us to not see her value. She would be very quiet in meetings until someone raised an issue about which she cared, then she would simply be quietly determined. The steely inner core of Olive Zakharov was produced and suddenly you were aware of the history and her connection to the struggle. Newer members now have to take up the baton of that connection to the struggle that she was involved in all of her life. I simply want to speak to her family. Those of us who have lost a mother know also what a critical time this is and a sense of a closing off of the past. For us and for the family, maintaining an awareness, a knowledge and a closeness to the things that Olive felt strongly about are important. I want to share with the family some prose from Cymbeline that was very important to me and my sister when our mother died. I hope that it will be of some importance to her children and her family: Fear no more the heat o'th' sun, Nor the furious winter's rages. Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone and ta'en thy wages. Golden lads and girls all must, As chimney-sweepers, come to dust. Dear Olive was one of the golden girls, and we must carryon the struggle.",24
24,Mr STAPLES,CONDOLENCES,"Jagajaga}-It is a sad honour for me today to rise and speak of Olive Zakharov, senator for Victoria-that was her title and responsibility which she took frighteningly seriously. I met Olive Zakharov back in the 1970s when I joined the Labor Party in the Diamond Valley area in Melbourne. She had been deeply involved for many years, long before I was; in fact, long before most. She worked in education, as we know, not just as a teacher in front of a class but a student counsellor, characteristically very much involved with helping people through her work. I am sure that today there are many hundreds and thousands of people from her days in education who know how much they owe Olive Zakharov for what she did for them in those formative years of their lives. Just as there are many hundreds of thousands of people throughout Victoria, indeed Australia and other parts of the world, who met or saw Olive Zakharov and who in one way or another would never have failed to be impressed. Overall, her contribution and commitment have been one of the most diverse and constant that I have known of anyone in public life and in public office. She was elected in 1983 as a senator for Victoria, as we know. As a number of members, in particular those members from rural and regional areas and from the opposition, have mentioned today, she travelled endlessly to far off places, out of the way places-places where the aircraft did not reach. She spent many hours on those long bumpy, dusty roads to get to peoplevery characteristically an Olive thing to do. There are today so many people in rural and regional Victoria and rural and regional Australia who know Olive and will certainly mourn her passing. As a former minister for aged care and family services and such like, I know the commitment that Olive had to those sorts of issues. There are believers, there are true believers and there are true, true believers. Olive was a true, true believer. She was a woman who believed in and acted Labor's finest principles and traditions. She touched, dealt with and fought for issues that others would not touch and, in some cases, could not be bothered to touch. That was symptomatic of the way she moved around the countryside, involving herself with people, bringing back the messages to the government and to the ministers-such as me-to get what she thought those people deserved. She had a way of dealing with people who were suffering disadvantage or suffering injustice. She was not prepared to see them go through it any further. Her workload was as immense. Some might think she was a workaholic; I do not think she was. It was just that she could not bear to see people suffer disadvantage, to see people suffer injustice. That applied globally; it applied across the world in so many organisations she involved herself with and in the issues she took up-political, environmental, social and human rights. Principally, she was always putting to the fore the role and status of women. She did it globally, locally and individually. She was a person with incredible vigour. I suspect, as I think we all do, that her mind would have been dealing with a lot. of those matters that were constantly driving her when she stepped out onto the road. Probably, she was dealing with those matters that she perceived as her duty as a senator for Victoria and as her duty as a human being. I share the honour to have known her, to have worked with her, to have learnt from her and to have been inspired by her. I have a criterion of success in political life: if you can leave politics with your integrity undiminished, you have in many ways been successful. For Olive Zakharov, her already great integrity became deeper and deeper as time went on and as we got to know her better. What is more, she encouraged that deeper integrity in everyone around her. Principally, we honour her today as a senator for Victoria and, indeed, as a human being; primarily, we honour her as a woman who has been a magnificent success and inspiration and an example of the best of the human spirit. Thank you, Olive Zakharov. Mr GmSON (Moreton}-It is a moment of great sadness when we lose a good friend and a colleague. I have known Olive Zakharov for five years since I came to this place in March of 1990. I knew her as a good comrade in the Left; I knew her as an active participant on the caucus community services committee, of which I have been a member for five years; and I knew her on the social justice committee and on extraparliamentary groups such as Parliamentarians for East Timor and Parliamentarians for Global Action, both of which reflected her very strong commitment to human rights, to peace and to disarmament. I also knew her as a member of the ASIO committee, a committee that has not been mentioned here yet. It was always a delicious irony for Olive Zakharov that she managed for a period of time to be acting chair of the ASIO committee. ASIO headquarters probably had quite a big file on her because of her political activities in the 1960s and 1970s, she thought it was very good that she now was in charge of the parliamentary supervision of the people that had haunted her for so long in her political activities. My best impressions of her come from the work on the community services committee, which I now chair. My first remembrance of her, after I had been elected to the caucus community services committee, was her part in the dynamic duo of Pat Giles and Olive Zakharov. They were certainly quite a formidable team. When they had an issue that they wanted to pursue, or if anybody dared raise a matter that they felt was very much against the best interests of social justice, they certainly let you know about it. I took them on only once and lived to tell the tale, but I never did it again. They certainly were ferocious fighters for social justice. As the chair of the community. services committee, I will miss the great contribution she made to social justice in this country. I do not think it is fully understood outside this place what important work does occur on those committees: the caucus committees, which give advice to government on what policies and programs we should be putting in place, and the House of Representatives and Senate standing committees. Olive was a very hard worker on all those committees. She played a really important role in keeping us on track and constantly vigilant about social justice and what we on this side of the House were seeking to achieve in our policies and our platforms. It has been said by some of my colleagues that she has inspired a lot of young women to be involved in politics. She has also inspired a lot of men. She was certainly an inspiration to me as a role model as a very effective grassroots, committed representative of the people. If I could in any way emulate the way in which she operated, then I would be very proud to have been able to serve the people of Australia the way she has served. I think people do not often understand the hard work that is involved in being an effective grassroots representative of the people and in picking up the issues. One of the and important roles that senators can play is by picking up the issues that are not necessarily politically popular at the time. She certainly fulfilled all of the responsibilities and obligations as a senator in being strong and supporting a whole range of groups that did not have a lot of votes around them or did not have a lot of numbers of people involved but were very important components of our community. For that, she will be very sorely missed by her colleagues, by the broader Victorian community and by the Australian community. I offer my sincere condolences to her family at this time.",24
25,Mr DODD,CONDOLENCES,"I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to participate in this condolence debate for Olive Zakharov. I think it has more or less all been said but it is very clear that Senator Zakharov was a long time activist. I met Olive on several occasions before I came into the parliament, but I had my close contact with Olive as a member of the Joint Committee on ASIO. It is clear, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said, that Senator Zakharov had been a victim of the surveillance and intrusiveness of that organisation during the Cold War and that she could have acted in a vindictive manner. She could have had some grudge to bear with ASIO and its officers, but she did not express that. As other members have said, she acted with total dignity and was always totally courteous to officers of ASIO as well as other witnesses before the committee. Because Olive cared, she rose above that. Olive was concerned about social justice. She was a woman of principle, and that shone through. It was for me a great honour to know and to work with Olive Zakharov inside and outside this parliament. Olive was a member of a great generation of left wing women, a generation that fought for peace, a generation that fought for the trade union movement at a time when it was not easy to do that-during the Cold War when members of organisations like ASIO, and I appreciate the irony that has been put forward by the honourable member for Moreton, were running around snooping into people's lives. It is a credit to Olive Zakharov that she rose above that and became an activist in this parliament. I pass my personal condolences to the members of Olive's family. We have truly lost a great Australian.",26
26,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CONDOLENCES,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health)-I also wish to add my condolences in support of this motion. I have known Olive Zakharov for 16 years, which is quite a long time. It is obviously not possible to sum up one's feelings and ail the issues that one might like to comment on in a few minutes. But I want to refer to three small matters which illustrate how I feel. The first is her maiden speech on 25 May 1983. I will quote directly from that maiden speech, where she said: My commitment to social justice, focused now in my commitment to the Australian Labor Party, goes back as far as I can remember. My childhood was spent during the Depression of the 1930s and my father, who was a teacher, spent most of those years out of work, his only income being for rate journalism at tuppence a published line. Some of my most vivid early memories are of men coming to the door to ask for money or food and men in the streets picking up butts, providing second hand tobacco for a cigarette. These memories and talk at home about the rise of fascism in Italy and Germany and the Spanish Civil War helped shape my commitment to peace and social justice which has finally brought me to this ber. That quote from her maiden speech sums up exactly the kind of person that she was. The most tremendous thing is that those sentiments in 1983 continued throughout the whole of her parliamentary career, as people have mentioned. She had the same commitment to social justice throughout it. It was not just a commitment in terms of the structures of the party; it was a commitment in terms of the basic ideals and principles of the party. I remember at the end of last year that she was sitting in the back row at the last state conference of the Labor Party. It was about 4 or 5 0' clock. All these tremendous issues had occurred. There were all the personality infights and the usual stuff that goes on at Labor Party conferences. Everyone had left, but we were still discussing fundamental education and social justice policies. Olive was sitting at the back-she was not right at the front being prominent-listening. I joined her and said, 'What is going on?' She said, 'It is very interesting. We are now discussing all these policies on social justice and education and they have all left. What is happening to the party?' I said, 'You are still here. That is important.' She said to me, 'We have to rejuvenate this party for a further commitment to social justice.' That sums up what Olive Zakharov was about. Olive had real courage in her support of the party. Everyone said that the third spot in the Senate would not be winnable in the last election. So all these very ambitious people were not interested in putting their name forward in that third spot. But Olive Zakharov still had that commitment to the party. She still felt that we could win that position. Against all the odds-and probably in the light of her own reputation-she stood for the third position and won it. The party had the pieceadvantage of that position, which the pundits had said would not be won. So she had courage as well. Olive did many things for me personallyÂ· and for many of us here. We have all heard so many speeches about what she has done. I can only say that the kind of spirit, dedication and support for principle that she showed is a shining beacon for us all. cham- We will remember her for many years. This session here today has been a great testimony to her.",27
27,Mr ROBERT BROWN,CONDOLENCES,"The bipartisan and genuine tributes that have been paid to Olive Zakharov today will be a source of immediate and continuing comfort to Martin, Robin and Jeannie. I take this opporpoliticians. tunity to publicly express to them my personal sympathy and the sympathy of my wife, Brown. Olive was one of a group of six people I had the privilege of leading to European institutions in 1987. Of the six members from both sides of politics in the federal parliament, there are only two of who remain-the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and me. Three of the others have left the parliament as a result of retirefashionable ment. Olive Zakharovis the only one who left the parliament as a result of death. It has been said that Olive Zakharov was socialist, a feminist, a humanist and an activquiet ist. She was certainly all of those things could not have been otherwise, because of background and experience and because of the struggles she had-struggles which she with her children. The moulding of Olive Zakharov could only have been in that way and in that form. Above all, Olive Zakharov was an outstanding humanitarian. I am indebted to our national president earlier today reminding us of the level at which Olive Zakharov applied her and talents. She was concerned about global issues but, as the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) reminds us, she was also concerned about her immediate neighboursgoes those people who lived in her street and her locality. One would almost feel that Olive Zakharov, because of the diversity of those issues she pursued, the vigour with which she pursued them and the way in which she applied those herself so fully to those issues, was motivated by a belief that there was so much so little time to do it. Even on the day she met with that terrible accident, as. has been pointed out by others, she was involved in pursuing things quickly, getting things and maximising the amount that she could with the time available to her. To a very large extent, that probably accounts for that disasbe trous accident. Sometimes members of parliament may feel marginally embarrassed when we ponder the attitudes that a relatively large proportion the national community may have towards I will conclude by saying that Olive Zakharov is one of those people about Joy whom we can think, if ever we feel any embarrassment about our vocation or our that profession, because Olive Zakharov brought on a delegation honour to them both.",27
28,Mr CHYNOWETH,CONDOLENCES,"I was elected in 1983 at the same time as Senator us Olive Zakharov and I have many fond memories of her. We marched together quite often up and down Bourke Street when it was not to complain about nuclear issues. has I made my maiden speech on nuclear issues and Olive was one of the first people to a actually speak to me after that and give me encouragement. She also encouraged me and in other areas-the Antarctic is one that has her been mentioned. Some of us worked very hard to stop mining in Antarctica and Olive shared worked behind the scenes as well. Some members of her family were members of the Dunkley FEA, and to them. I express my condolences. I speak on behalf of all the members of the Dunkley FEA in saying that for we are extremely sorry about what has happened to their mother and loved relative. This concerns is a sad day for Australia. Olive was not one of those people who put herself forward; but she was a person who worked hard behind the scenes. I think that for the majority of members of parliain ment from both sides. Some of the backbenchers do not get recognition for what they do, but they put in. There is always someone up the front to take the glory, but there are a lot of people behind them. Olive was one of persons. I feel proud to have known her and feel privileged to be able to speak into do and support of this motion.",28
29,Mr GRIFFIN,CONDOLENCES,"I support the motion before the chair. There is one way that my relationship with Olive is different from .done that mentioned by other members: I am a do former employee of Olive, having worked for her in 1987 and 1988. I do not think it could classed as the traditional employer-employee relationship. At times, with two strong personalities, things got tense. I did not always agree with her, but the longer I have of been here the more I have come to appreciate her. 1I have come to appreciate the fact that whereas 1 always thought 1 was right and she was wrong, in reality it was probably more the other way-not that 1 got the chance to tell her that. Oliv- was a very committed person, as has been srud by other people here today. She was a very hard worker. She took committee work in this place very seriously and always worked hard on them. Many of the reports she has been responsible for are a credit to her. Her activities in rural areas, in attending functions and in supporting community groups are legendary in the Victorian branch of the ALP. 1 know that on one occasion as a candidate, 1 was in the electorate for 'the entire day. At the end of that day 1 looked at her and thought, 'I don't know how you do this and how you keep up this pace.' 1 felt quite embarrassed that, effectively, I was being made over by a 60-year-old. On women's issues, health issues, peace issues, environmental issues and the disadvantaged-and on many others-Olive was always there, having a say and playing a role. She always knew what she was talking about. People did not always agree with her but she always made sure they understood what she had to say on the issues. Her door was always open; her office was always available. I have some great stories to tell about that, but I am not telling them here-it would not be appropriate. She provided real support to me in seeking election to this place. I thank her for that. The Victorian ALP is like any political organisation-everybody cops a bagging at some time or other for different reasons. I know that I have copped them-everyone from Victoria who is in this chamber has copped them-and Olive copped her share. But in terms of integrity, honesty and diligence I can honestly say that I have never heard a person say a word against Olive. That is more than can be said about a lot of us and i- a real tribute within any political organisain tIon. As has been said, she was a socialist and a feminist, and she was proud of that. She always fought the good fight. Her accident was tragic but the fact that it occurred after attending a function as part of her duties was strangely appropriate. She took her job seriously and she was always on duty; it did not matter what time of day it was. 1 would like to extend my sympathies to the family, particularly to the kids, Robin, Jeannie and Martin; and to her sister Ethel. I extend my sympathies also to her friends, particularly to her staff, Barbara Higgins, Mary Murray and Carolyn Hirsch. Barbara had been with Olive since the beginning of her great adventure in the federal parliament and was a tremendous source of support to her-as they were to each other. That needs to be put on the record. Her family and friends can all be very proud of what she did and of who she was.",28
30,Mr OKEEFE,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to add briefly to the tapestry that is unfolding before us today. I first came to know Olive when I was a young man in the trade union movement. Mention has been made of her activism as a high school teacher. I remember the early days of the VSTA when it was a lonely organisation, not member of the national structures, and was under heavy attack from the government of the day. We were very isolated, and the organisation was having some success in a fairly narrow band of industrial policies. A voice started to come from within the show, saying that we ought to be thinking about more than just class sizes and working hours-the traditional teaching issues. It is more than 20 years ago that this voice was saying, :-y aren't you thinking about peace, women s Issues, equal opportunity and other issues?' Those issues became part of the policy tapestry and led in part to a lot of input within the Victorian branch of the ALP as well. At the same time, we started the credit union movement in the teachers field in Victoria. What is now an organisation with about 40,000 members and $100 million or so deposits started literally in a lounge room with a shoe box and a few members who saw this as a way of achieving some financial equality for people who did not have power in the financial system. Olive was one of those very early founders. Within our own party, it is worth noting that in Victoria in 1990 when we lost the nine federal seats and were decimated in terms of resources to reach people who were wanting to reach us, Olive took on an enormous workload-an incredible workload of simply getting in a car and travelling around rural Victoria. To this day I still do not understand how she did it. But she did it. To a large extent I think her performance in the last election from the third position on the Senate ticket is reflective of the personal support that she developed. I would like briefly to tell a little tale one time that she chastised me. I think the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) will remember the time when my behaviour was not something of which I am proud. I became frustrated in a joint committee meeting when some senators from the other place were with us and I said some things that perhaps I should not have said. To ease tensions I left the meeting. Olive followed me out and said, 'You know, I might agree with what you said, but I certainly do not agree with the way you said it, and I think you should ring up those people and apologise.' I said, 'Olive, you must be out of your mind. I'm not going to ring them up and apologise.' Anyway, I went back to my office and I got a phone call from Olive who said, 'I think you should reconsider this,' and just left it at that. A couple of days later I met her at the airport and she said, 'Have you?' I said, 'Yes, Olive,' and she said, 'Oh, good.' I considered myself to have been gently chastised by Olive and I am proud to have been so. We do not think of these things very much in this context, but it is now very clear that there are many people who will remember their association with Olive with pride. We trust that knowing this will help her family through this very difficult time.",29
31,Mr JENKINS,CONDOLENCES,"It is with a deep sense of loss that I join the debate on the condolence motion upon the death of Olive Zakharov, somebody who I am not afraid to describe as a comrade-a comrade in every sense of the word. At the start of this parliament there was much talk of generational change. I believe we should also stress the importance of generational diversity in this place. Olive's political values were influenced by experiences as a child during the Depression, observations of the rise of fascism in Italy and Germany and, as with many of her generation, the politics of the Spanish Civil War. These were experiences similar to those that influenced my predecessor as the member for Scullin, my father, who has great admiration and respect for Olive. As chair of the parliamentary Left, I often observed Olive's quiet, efficient interventions of the when she thought things were going wrong. If Olive identified something as trouble, it was trouble with a capital T. Many have admitted to having been on the end of a withering but deserved rebuke or contra view from Olive. From time to time the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) was not immune from this. Whilst, of course, we grieve today for the loss of Olive, I hope we will also celebrate her great commitment to peace and social justice. May her life serve as an example and inspiration to all. My deepest sympathies go to her family, her staff and the many whose lives she has touched on our shared loss of a great Australian.",30
32,Mr GORMAN,CONDOLENCES,"I would also like to join this condolence motion on the ground that I have known Olive Zakharov since 1983. We came into the parliament together and I must say that she extended some advice to me when I got a little out of order at the caucus meetings. I always accepted that there would be a quiet word that I should not use bad language, I should keep my temper and things like that. I appreciated it very much. I then came into much closer contact with Olive when we both joined the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation recently. I must say that, if she was not the first one at a meeting waiting for it to start, she was certainly the second one. I join with Peter Dodd in his remarks that her contributions to meetings and help to members were of great benefit. I extend my sympathies to her family and to all her friends.",30
33,Mr SCIACCA,CONDOLENCES,"Just very briefly, I want to associate myself with this motion. I do for one moment pretend to have been a great close friend of Olive Zakharov. In fact, when I first came into the parliament in 1987 I was one of those avid right wingers who had been told that you had to be very careful of the Left. I then thought of the name 'Zakharov' and thought it must have been some Russian communist spy or something. I really did not know what to expect. Over the years I had a number of good associations with Olive. We served on committees together. She was just a good person. I thought that I should really get up last because, of all the people who knew her, I did not know her all that well and so I did not feel that I should get up too early in the debate. I do want to say that she was a very compassionate woman. All of us in this House have at some stage or other either been involved in tragedies-or will be involved in tragedies-because that is life. A couple of years ago, when I had my own personal tragedy, I will never forget that one of the first notes that I received was from Olive Zakharov. I remember the little piece of paper that went around and the foundation that was started for my late son. She was the first person to send a cheque. I remember making a mental note at the time: Olive Zakharov, you are just a good, unobtrusive person. I was very upset to hear what had happened to her. I remember going to one meeting of the caucus committee on the status of women and she was there. She was always there. I remember when I was making up the numbers in the caucus legal and administration committee and also when I was at caucus consumer subcommittee meetings, she was always there and she always made sense. Sometimes it made me feel bad even voting against her. This afternoon I am actually delivering a briefing to the caucus committee on the status of women on, of all things, women at war as a result of Australia Remembers. Olive has been talked of very highly in this House today. She will be remembered. As I have said once before, when you are remembered you are never really gone. I want to give my not sympathy to her family. I think the worldcertainly, this parliament-will be a lot worse off without Olive Zakharov.",31
34,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"I have known Olive only as a member of parliament. The time she came into parliament was when I first met her and so I have only known her for 12 years. There have been many who have testified to her difficult life-her tough and extraordinary experiences. I have only known her when she has lived a life of pure joy. I have rarely come across somebody who enjoyed being a member of parliament more than Olive. As we look back over her life, I think it must be understandable that what she experienced in here were some of the moments of relaxation, of joy and of a sense of achievementthat was denied her in much of the other things that she had to do through her life. Mention has been made of her age. We will have to get used to that. The more women that come into this place, the more our age levels will go up. That is simply a fact of the situation. Most women will not leave home when they have young children to care for, no matter what facilities are made available. What a great thing it will be for us all if they are like Olive because they will bring to this place such an extraordinary depth of human experience. I was Minister for Defence for five years and Minister for Employment, Education and Training for two years. So for seven years I cut directly across Olive's interests. In fact, hardly any of my views coincided with hers. I do not think Olive was a believer, in the religious sense, at all but there is a requirement upon those who are that, when you are in honest disagreement with someone, you care for their souls. Olive always cared for your soul when she was in disagreement with you. It was not just a policy issue that was a matter of concern to her, it was a question of the development of your personality which also had to be taken into account. I must say that made her a most delightful person to do business with. Olive is going to be terribly missed in this place. It is an absolute tragedy not have a retirement that would give her the relaxation to look back upon a lifetime of achievement. But that has not occurred. least all of us here have that opportunity look back upon that life and treasure it.",31
35,Mr SNOWDON,CONDOLENCES,"Northern Territorywho Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training}-Many fine words have been spoken this afternoon about Olive Zakharov, and most of the speakin ers can speak far more eloquently than I. I only want to add to this condolence motion reference to Olive's steely determination protect the interests of the environment. As the member for the Northern Territory, apart from my other activities in the parliament, I have had a lot to do with Olive over a number of years, particularly in debates over the development or otherwise of Kakadu National Park. We have heard about Olive's steely determination and the forthright stands which she took on issues. In the debates that took place, particularly the debate on Coronadiscovered tion HilI, Olive never lost sight of her tive to protect the cultural and natural heritage values of Kakadu National Park or, even in though it was not her electorate, to represent the interests, as she saw them, of the tradifamily tionalowners of that park and of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people more gener-- . My colleagues, members of the Left, have indicated that Olive was someone whom you referred to and deferred to in discussion. Whenever she intervened in a debate, invariably it was well thought out. When she decided she wanted to participate in a strugmore gle, it was always with the same steely determination. When she decided she wanted to make an issue of something or of someone, she never missed the mark. Although the area of Kakadu was not in her electorate, Olive fought for and sought to defend the people who live in the area and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. On behalf of those people and on my behalf, I would like to thank Olive Zakharov for her contribution to my life and that she did to the life of Australia.",32
36,Mr SAWFORD,CONDOLENCES,"I would At like to join in this condolence motion. In to 1988, when I first came into this place, I joined the caucus employment, education and training committee. One of the first people welcomed me to that committee was Olive Zakharov. A significant aspect of her commitment was that, up until the time of her death, she remained a dedicated and valued member of that committee. One of Olive's other commitments to disadvantaged groups this country not mentioned by other speakers in detail was her commitment to children, particularly children aged between five to 12 to years-an age group that suffers a great lack of power in this country. One of my greatest regrets about Olive Zakharov-symptomatic of the relationships that we have with senators, even on our own side-was that I did not know her closely. Yet, after the last meeting that she attended, we discussed an issue and, for some reason or other, got onto our family backgrounds. We that there was a strong possibiliobjecty-in fact, we now know-that we shared a distant relationship of maternal families back the last century. Olive and I made a little pact that we would try to follow up our histories at some time in the future. In Port Adelaide, a number of graves in the . Cheltenham cemetery carry words that reflect feelings of the Labor movement. Those words are also on the graves of my parents. When we realised Olive was in great difficulty after the accident and the prognosis was not good, the meaning of those words became even apparent. That saying is, 'It matters that you try for right, irregardless of the consequences.' Olive Zakharov, through her life in this place, tried for what she believed was right. She tried for what mattered, and that is a lasting legacy to all of us in this place. I National Park thank the House. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.",32
37,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I thank the House. NA LAND CORPORATION (AT SIC AMENDMENT) BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 March, on motion by Mr Keating: That the bill be now read a second time.",32
38,Ms HENZELL,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Capricornia) (2.26 p.m.)I am pleased to return to my contribution on the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporahappy tion (A TSIC Amendment) Bill 1994 which I was speaking on last night prior to the adSenate journment. As honourable members will the recall, I was outlining the interesting history which I believe starkly contrasts the opposition's view on land for Aboriginal people with what this government has been able to do. I remind the House that the land fund bill has been described as an act of good faith with Aboriginal people. I have to that I believe the opposition's debate on the previous bill and on this bill, and the Senate machinations, have been acts of bad faith. I wish to read from the publication circulatknows ed by the Minister for Aboriginal Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) so people can understand what we are aiming to achieve. Page 1 reads: The Native Title Act secured for those indigenous states: Australians who could establish a continuous association with their traditional lands the right recover that land. However, most Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders cannot establish that association in the face of European encroachment on their lands and their culture. The legislation now produced by the Government offers those indigenous people the opportunity, continuing indefinitely, to reclaim at least part of their cultural heritage by regaining control over land. The arguments we have heard in this debate once again illustrate the continuing lack of understanding about the issues involved. Indeed, the amendments that the opposition is still talking about really indicate its lack of understanding about what is important to Aboriginal people. Some of the 67 amendments that the Senate made to the old bill involve issues that have been rejected by most spokespeople for Aboriginal people in this country. For instance, attempting to decide who is most severely dispossessed and making grants of money available to individuals as well as corporations are absolutely outside what would be appropriate, as Aboriginal people have told us. It is not surprising that there are individuals and groups of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country who may have , put a different view, who may not be entirely with the first bill, but the vast majority have indicated, and indeed did indicate to the select committee, their opposition to amendments. It is disappointing that the opposition is continuing to hold onto these amendments. There is very clear evidence from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) that he intends to allow the bill to pass both houses of the parliament, purely because he does not wish it to become the trigger for say a double dissolution, and he has clearly signalled that he will reinstitute those amendments. He does not have the courage of his convictions to oppose the bill because he that he would then have to face the and Torres political consequences. In my earlier remarks I referred to an article in the Age of 6 March by Mark Baker. I would like to mention that further. The article to In shelving rather than dumping the Coalition's objections to the land fund, hethat is, the Leader of the Oppositionhas also avoided the damaging partyroom brawl that would be provoked by any attempted policy change. But in walking away from an issue on which the Coalition fought so hard for so long, Mr Howard risks being seen as afraid to face down the Government and unwilling to fight for what he believes in. That is going to be a very telling issue. I was personally very concerned and very angry about the opposition leader's comment about the guilt industry in his speech on the second reading. On 2 March, he said in this House: I hope that the debate on Aboriginal affairs from now on will focus on policies and measures that improve the dignity, the independence, the lifestyle, the health, the education, the employment prospects and the family stability of Australia's Aborigines. They are issues that nobody would argue about. However, he went on to say: It ought not to be distracted by arguments who is more compassionate. It ought not to distracted by challengeable concepts of interside generational guilt. Of course injustices were to the original people, but those committed by current generations of Australians and, so far as I am concerned, I am not going to be a party to the guilt industry ... This is huge hypocrisy. For the alternative leader of the government of this country stand up and wave away the collective responRobert sibility that all Australians have to the session is one of the key issues that contrasts the present government and those who would aspire to sit on the government benches. found his comments totally objectionable, I believe that others will too. His comments are in stark contrast with those of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who in all his speeches has made it very clear that we have a collective responsibility. are responsible for dispossession, and we to face up to those responsibilities. made this clear in all his speeches. In the second reading debate on the first bill, the Prime Minister said: For the first time in our history, the inherent rights debate of indigenous Australians have been recognised given statutory protection. indicate that as a nation we have had the collective courage and wisdom to acknowledge the violence and destruction done to indigenous Australians and their culture since European occupation. They signal that as a nation we are willing to accept responsibility to work towards a new relationship. The comments the Prime Minister made in his second reading speech on this bill, and those he has put on the public record on a number of occasions, contrast clearly with the position of the opposition leader. The country will judge who has the moral integrity on this matter, and it will certainly have the support of indigenous Australians and the wider Australian community. I commend this recannot vised land fund bill to the House.",33
39,Mr NEHL,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"In listening to the various debates on a number of items of legislation to do with indigenous Australians, one cannot help but be continreading ually struck by the high level of pious sanctithe moniousness that comes from some of my friends on the other side of the House. The member for Capricornia eMs Henzell) has just as to taken the high ground once more with her be reference to moral integrity and that only her of the House has the moral integrity that done is required to deal out justice to indigenous injustices were not Australians. Before she leaves the chamber, I would just like to assure her that that is not the case. There are people on this side who do care, to and I am sure the member for Charlton (Mr Brown), who is to follow me in this disposdebate on the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (A TSIC Amendment) Bill, will acknowledge the correctness of what I I say. There is a wide ranging display of and attitude and caring. We do not all agree on everything, but it is not the case that the government members are the repository of all wisdom on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I do not say that we are We either--of course not-but we have to re have member that we are looking first and foreHe has most at Australians. I never get terribly carried away with any form of discrimination because I loathe, detest and am opposed to it. But too often in the on indigenous Australians a position is and taken of discrimination. I do not think that is These developments the way to go. The member for Capricornia made some reference to collective responsibility. She criticised the Leader of the Opposition (Mr our Howard) for making the point that he would not become part of the guilt industry. I make no apology for endorsing what the Leader of the Opposition said. I personally feel no guilt. I acknowledge what has happened in our history. I certainly acknowledge that earlier Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were not treated properly, well, humanely or with justice. That is a fact, and nobody denies that. We have to acknowledge history, but we live in the past. We have to learn from the past and go forward to the future. It is interesting to note that the first version of the land fund bill was introduced towards the middle of last year. I think the second debate was introduced some time in August sitting. At that time, after the bill was introduced, the opposition came up with seven amendments. The Minister for Aborigithe nal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) absolutely criticised the shadow minister, the honourable member for HindTorres marsh (Mrs Gallus), because she could not present the amendments to him before they had gone through the party mechanism. I 5. think that criticism was totally unfair. Whether it is legislation of the government or the coalition parties-be it bills or amendmentsgive it goes before the relevant party room first. Interestingly, the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) totally rejected the amendments out of hand before they were even pUblic. The Prime Minister had not seen the amendments when he rejected them. He said, 'There's no way that they're any good.' I do not think that is a manifestation of good government. A great deal has been said about consultathe tion right around Australia. 'exhaustive consultation' has been used. I do not know what that exhaustive consultation is. I am yet to see any report or indication of what consultation took place. I believe that the Land Council of New South Wales was not consulted. This House should recall that the largest number of Aboriginal people Australia live in New South Wales. Indeed, great many Aboriginal people live in my electorate of Cowper, on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. That so-called exhausand tive consultation did not include consultation with a great many individuals or organisathe tions. I know that government speakers will say, 'We consulted with ATSIC, which is the representative of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.' That is the theory, we should remember that only 31 or 32 per cent of the Aboriginal community who were entitled to vote in the ATSIC elections actual- honourable ly voted. It is true to say that urban Aboriginals cheated by this present Labor government. They were excluded from any benefit from Mabo and now, basically, they are excluded from the indigenous land fund. I do not think that is the way to go. I think they are quite right to feel cheated. I know that a stage been talked about. We have had Mabo and now the indigenous land fund. Stage 3 will social justice package. We do not know yet what will be in that package. I hope that it represents some justice for Aboriginal and Strait Islander people. Although there has been no mention of it, I wonder whether there is going to be a stage 4-or even a stage I wonder whether stage 4 is not an extension of some form of legislative apparatus to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people control of all the seas of Australia, including the marine resources within the seas. I know that in the Northern Territory there is a claim on the Timor Sea which even goes beyond Australia's territorial waters. This is something of which all AustraliansAboriginal and non-Aboriginal-should be aware. If there is any move along these lines the government should come clean and tell all people of Australia just what is in line I think the term down the track. What is the benefit of the indigenous land fund to the people of the Torres Strait? If the land fund is there to buy land for people who cannot establish a native title claim, what is the situation with the people in the Torres Strait? How are those people going to benefit? in What benefit does Getano Lui, George Mye, a Flo Kennedy, the Mosbys or any of the people who live on those wonderful islands in the Torres Strait gain? The islands are there the people have the islands. No more islands are going to suddenly appear out of sea that those people can go and buy with the assistance of the indigenous land fund. The minister should tell the parliament and the people of the Torres Strait how they will but benefit from the indigenous land fund. In the closing minutes of her speech the member for Capricornia accused us on this side of the House of a lack of understanding. I think she may have been feel quoting something; if so, she was endorsing the statement that the people of the Torres Strait cannot establish traditional links with land that they may have been associated with. I am sorry she is not here because that is so absurd; it is a nonsense. I have been on 3 has Thursday, Darnley, York, Murray, Badu and Prince of Wales islands. It is wrong to say be that the people of the Torres Strait cannot establish traditional links. A lot of those people have moved away for jobs, because people they are very hard working people, but they have not been removed from their islands. They are still there. They have not been picked up and blackbirded somewhere, as happened to some other poor people. The honourable member for Capricornia is slightly off the beam when she suggests that that was the case. The Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill spoke to 224 separate Aboriginal organisations by way of consultation. I would not suggest that that is exhaustive consultation. However, I would ask-not purely in a rhetorical sense-where was the so-called years exhaustive consultation undertaken by the government? One of our amendments to the original bill dealt with so-called individual ownership. honourable member for Capricornia, along with other speakers, has referred to that amendment in an attempt to bucket the sition by saying that this amendment is stupid and so on. When I first spoke on the legislaworse tion I made the point that the parliament taxpayers of Australia make grants of money or goods to individual Australians all the time. In that amendment we were not saying that only individuals or family groups or communities should get anything out of the indigenous land fund. Bear in mind that the bill says that only corporations can get it. We were saying, 'Yes, corporations can, but also, where appropriate, individuals, communities and family groups may also get it.' Someone else has made a point about corporations this debate. Is a corporation so much a natural part of Aboriginal culture? Are corporations reallyÂ· part of the natural community inframoment, structure of Aboriginal people? I think not! I come now to the so-called health housing amendment. I have to stress that when we put forward that amendment-I been spoke on it in this place-we were talking about land to be purchased by the indigenous land fund having to be viable. That is what we were saying; that is what the amendment said. It spoke of viability in relationship health, housing and so on. I will be concentrating here on Aboriginal rather than Torres Strait Islanders. All too often, on both sides, we link them together. I do not think that they should be. The Torres Strait Regional Authority was established a year ago, and that was a step in the right direction. We should not automatically join Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders because the situation in relation to health and housing for Aboriginal people is absolutely appalling. I do not think that anybody on the government side who is fair and not consumed by the pious pomposity of sanctimonious selfrighteousness would deny that in the last 200 we have failed. Quite frankly, in the last 12 years of this government we have failed as well. We did not propose that money from the land fund should be spent on health, housing The and education; we said that there should be viability. The member for Charlton and I have travelled around Australia together looking at oppothis problem. We could not help but be appalled that in 1995 Australians are living in than Third World conditions. It is not and just happening in the outback. There is a popular conception that these conditions exist only in the Kimberleys or the Pitjantjatjara lands. We have been to some of those places and conditions are not good, but in the urban areas conditions are often very bad as well. You do not have to go any further than my own electorate of Cowper, and you have heard me speak on this before. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in has been to Kempsey in my electorate-the member for Charlton has been there-to New Burnt Bridge, which is in the news at the to Old Burnt Bridge and to Crescent Head, and the housing conditions in those and places are absolutely frightful. There are some better areas. There have some successes, I have to be fair dinkum--of course there have been. But when we look at the overall situation and see people without water, with their electricity running across the ground via an extension cord, if to they are lucky, and with no sewerage, we have to ask, 'Is this Australia in 1995?' But that is not the only area experiencing problems. I was very fortunate to spend a few days in the Torres Strait in January. I visited Thursday Island, Darnley Island and Murray Island. We talk about the need for water, but on Darnley Island there was no water to flush the toilets. We talk about health conditions, but people there had to use the beach and wait for high tide to come along and flush it. That is not very healthy; that is not very hygienic. We have to admit that we as a parliamentI do not single out the government-we as the people of Australia, have desperately failed the area of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We have failed in education. The figures on literacy and numeracy are appalling. We have failed. As I have said before, there are some great role models. There are people from missions-Charlie Perkins-and people from the islands who have succeeded. They have strived, worked, got an education and they have got somewhere. But, if you talk to the average Australian Aboriginal, their level of education is absolutely appalling. The rate of illiteracy is just sickening. Nobody will be able to adjust to life in a modern society without education. We have to go beyond the purely academic three Rs. We have to educate people for living; we have to educate them for survival in a modern society. It is not easy, but we have to teach people how to cope with society. I am reminded of some people I knew when I lived in Armidale, in northern New South Wales, back in the mid-1960s-a couple of Aboriginal people called Jim and Ivy Smith. Jim was the chairman of the local Aboriginal community in Armidale which had dreadful houses, made of corrugated iron, with no lining. You can imagine what they were like in winterabsolutely freezing-and in summer they were pretty crook too. The kids were always sick. Jim, his wife and some other people came and visited me in my home. I have never forgotten the point they made. The reason for their visit was that the University of New England had got my wife to conduct some drawing classes as part of an adult education activity for the Aboriginal community in Armidale. Naturally, I went to pick her up after the class and I said to them, 'Come home and have a cup of tea or coffee,' as one does, and they came home with us. During the conversation, Jim, who unfortunately is dead now, asked, 'Are you a member of the Aboriginal Advancement Society?' I said, 'No. Does it do any good?' He said, 'Well, we have a meeting every month and we pass motions and we read the minutes of in those at the next meeting and then we pass more motions.' He said, 'I'll tell you what: when they see me at the post office in Beardy Street they will stop and talk to me. They are very friendly. But this is the very first time. I, my wife and these other people have ever been in the home of a white Australian.' That really shocked me. I dealt with Aboriginal people when I lived in south-west Queensland, 56 miles east of St George. I worked with Aboriginal people and got on very well with them-of course, they are people. The 'p' in politics-you will get tired of hearing me say this-stands for people. What we have to come back to with the land fund is the realisation that employment, health, education and housing are vital things. Basically, the Aboriginal people in my electorate have got land. They want the money to build the houses, they need some sewerage, they need some roads-and, boy, do those kids need some health care for the otitis media. I have got no real argument with this bill, but what I will say-and I will say it until the cows come home-is that, if we have to do something for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, we must include health, housing, education and jobs.",34
40,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"I have about five minutes now of the total time available to me before my contribution to the debate on the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (A TSIC Amendment) Bill will, understandably, be interrupted by question time. In response to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), when the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) adopts, as he suggests, the high moral ground-I certainly would not describe it that way; I would describe it as a position of conscience-and when she criticises some members of the opposition, let me assure the member for Cowper that she does not include him. Nor would I. The member for Aston (Mr Nugent), for example, would not be included by us when we criticise some of the member for Cowper's colleagues. I would also hope that the member for Cowper in his party room consideration of these questions would be a little less fulsome in his support for the attitude which has been adopted by many of his colleagues and by the attitude and the role which has been adopted by the opposition generally, both here and in the Senate, in connection with this legislation. I believe it would have been less fulsome than the support he understandably makes available for the position which the opposition adopts when he debates the question in this chamber. To my mind, the performance of the opposition parties generally, including the two Greens in the Senate, in relation to this legislation has been one of the most shameful examples of the numerous attempts which have been made from time to time by opposition parties, opposition spokesmen and opposition activists to sabotage major political initiatives in the advancement of Australia's indigenous people. I believe that their approach to this question has been marked by prevarication, clearly by misrepresentation, by obfuscation, by opportunism. I think it has been a most unfortunate exercise. I make reference to the two Green senators whose attitude and approach, I believe, has been unconscionable in relation to this question. Despite the honourable objectives which those two Green senators and the international green movement have in relation to the world environment, I believe that, as a result attitude to the bill which this bill is now designed to replace, those two Greens have disgraced the green movement with the hypocrisy which they have shown. I have noticed that the Greens in Queensland have suggested that they may not support or provide any preferences for the Goss government in the next state election because of what they refer to as the Goss government's attitude towards the environment. That is one of the reasons why I refer to their hypocrisy. I ask them: what do they think about the social environment of Aboriginal people? They use the appalling excuse that the reason they opposed the land fund bill was that it did not provide sufficient funds for the purposes for which it was being set up. But the operation of that fund and the way in which it is designed to be established will be providing, at the end of a 10-year period, almost $1.3 billion for the continuity of funding to make it possible for the Indigenous Land Corporation to have access to the financial resources which will be necessary for it to continue to acquire land in order to make that land available to Aboriginal corporations, Aboriginal groups, for uses to be determined. Reference has also been made to the general question of the consultation process which was adopted by both the government and the opposition. Let me remind everyone that the bill which this bill now replaces was introduced into the House of Representatives on 30 June 1994, the middle oflast year. It was allowed to lie on the table to allow full examination, full consultation, full discussion, full criticism and full analysis until 30 August when the second reading took place. The second reading took a total of almost 11 hours of debate in this chamber. The consideration in detail stage in this chamber took almost 10 hours of additional time. When it went to the Senate, the second reading stage took almost five hours and the committee stage took 22 hours and 30 minutes. It is doubtful whether or not any legislation has occupied the time of this chamber and the time of the Senate to the of their extent that this legislation has. As a result of those changes that were adopted in the Senate, most of which would have had the effect of tearing the heart out of the legislation, destroying the purpose of the legislation, it was obvious that the government could adopt only one position and that was to reject the majority of those major amendments and reintroduce this legislation. That is the stage that we have reached.",37
41,Mr SPEAKER,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Order! It being 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Charlton will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Logging and Wood chipping",39
42,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Resources. I refer the minister to cabinet's decision to wait after the 25 March New South Wales state election to announce the government's decision on woodchipping in that state. The federal government has claimed that the ostensible reason for the delay is that New South Wales forestry information needs to be re-examined, even though it accepted the New South Wales evaluation process some two weeks ago. Given this acceptance, is it not a fact that New South Wales information is as good as that provided by Victoria and Tasmania-two states in which the coupes to be logged have already been announced? Is it also not a fact that the only reason the member for Eden-Monaro can call your nondecision a cop-out is that Minister Brereton told cabinet not to release New South Wales coupes before the state election?",39
43,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, because he could not be more wrong. Not only is New South Wales treated the same as any other state, but New South Wales asked to be treated differently. It did not open up its forest practices like the other states did, even though they were non-Labor states. New South Wales wanted to be treated differently. This government not only treated New South Wales fairly but also gave New South Wales 43 of the coupes that have been released-I 10 coupes have been released, 43 in New South Wales. Despite the fact that its forest practices were not exposed to scrutiny, it has received a very fair deal from this government. Other states did open up their forest practices to the Commonwealth and we have been able to be involved in some of that process. But New South Wales did not. It will have to wait a short space of time until the process is complete. Hindmarsh Island Bridge Mr MARTYN EVAN8-My question is directed to the Attorney-General. I draw his attention to allegations of poor security by the Australian Government Solicitor's office in the handling of documents related to litigation involving the Hindmarsh Island bridge project in South Australia. It has been further alleged that these documents have been made available to various people without proper authoriuntil sation. Has the Attorney-General examined these allegations? Is he in a position to report to the House on the results of his inquiries?",39
44,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How did your lot get them, Lavarch?",39
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for O'Connor! It is very early in question time. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. As I understand it, various legal proceedings have been threatened in relation to this matter. If that is the case, these matters are matters of law and are sub judice. On both those grounds, firstly that the question asked the Attorney-General for a legal opinion and secondly that legal proceedings have been intimated, which the Attorney-General will be forced to confirm, the question is out of order, as is any supposed answer.",39
46,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, to the point of order: firstly, the question did not go to any legal opinion. It went to the processes of the office for which he is responsible. Secondly, there are no legal proceedings pending. Mr Costello-Is that an assurance?",39
47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition! The question, as I heard it, did not ask for a legal opinion. Mr Costello-Are there any legal proceedings pending?",39
48,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If there are any legal proceedings pending, I will certainly not canvass them in any answer I give on this matter . Yesterday the honourable member for Barker, together with the honourable member for Hindmarsh, asked a series of questions in the House the substance of which dealt with the secure holding of confidential information which was attached to the so-called Fergie report, which related to the Hindmarsh Island bridge case before the Federal Court. The express statement of the honourable member was that these documents were held in a most haphazard manner and were but flotsam circulating around Australia in such a way that they found their way to the honourable member for Barker's control. Given that the documents were held by the Australian Government Solicitor in Adelaide and given that that office was responsible for the dispatch of the documents to this parliament and to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I certainly did make inquiries about the security that was in place to make sure the documents were given the respect they deserved, to find out how it could be that the documents ended up in the hands of the honourable member for Barker, and to find out the sequence of events that followed that. I have been advised that the documents were given to the office of the Australian Government Solicitor in Adelaide some time before December last year, during the preparation of the Hindmarsh Island case. That case concluded in December and on 4 January this year the documents were dispatched by way of courier to this House. I should explain that there was not simply one solitary document or a small group of documents, which may have been the impression one got when listening to the honourable member yesterday. In fact, a very large body of documents was forwarded back to the House in a large cardboard box. The documents about which the question was raised yesterday were sealed in a brown envelope. This envelope was marked 'Confidential-Appendices 2 and 3, to be read only by women'. The envelope was then placed in a larger outer white document. This was sealed with sticky tape and was placed in a larger box, together with the balance of these documents. This box was secured. It was then labelled twice, the first label being the Ansett Air Freight label, which directed the parcel to the minister for ATSIC, with the minister's suite number given and a contact name, Sean MCLaughlin. There was a second label, a white AGS label, on the box and it was directed to the office of the minister for aboriginal affairs, again giving the minister's suite number. The box was then marked 'Strictly Confidential, only to be opened by Sean MCLaughlin'. I table for the benefit of the House a statutory declaration by Mary Theresa Milaris, an administrative officer with the office of the AGS in Adelaide, which attests to the circumstances of the dispatch of the documents. The box was then delivered to Parliament House on 6 January. It would appear that after it arrived at the House's loading dock it was incorrectly labelled by the dock staff, 'To the member for Barker, care of the ministerial wing.' The box was then delivered to the member for Barker's office on 6 January. I table a letter from you, Mr Speaker, to the minister for aboriginal affairs which sets out those factsÂ· and circumstances, together with the label that was placed on the box at that time. The box then arrived, inadvertently, in the office of the member for Barker. The box was then opened by the staff of the honourable member, and the honourable member himself has stated very clearly that the contents of the box were photocopied-the complete file was photocopied. Not only were all the documents photocopiedOpposition members-Daryl! Daryl!",39
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order.,40
50,Mr LAV ARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The outer envelope containing the particular confidential documents was opened. The second envelope, which was clearly marked 'Confidential-To be read by women only' was opened. The confidentiality markings on the outside of the box were also ignored. Then the material was completely photocopied. The honourable member, in statements he has made to journalists' questions, has said that they were photocopied once. However, I understand that in a conversation which he had with the f,\boriginal Legal Rights Movement, which was held on loudspeaker and heard by some three witnesses,he said that the documents had been photocopied many times. Mr MCLachlan-That is absolutely not true, and you know it. Opposition members-Lies!",40
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,41
52,Mr LAV ARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not a lie. I think we will find out who has been lying in this matter. The box and its contents were then delivered back to the minister for Aboriginal affairs. Having arrived in the member for Barker's office on 6 January, it was received by the minister's office on 9 January, some days later. I am advised by the staff of the minister, his advisers, that they had no knowledge that the box had been on some sort of detour in the meantime. Interestingly enough, 10 and. behold on 2 February this year the solicitors acting for applicants in the Hindmarsh Island bridge case filed a new application for further and better particulars, asking for a deferral delivery of the judgment. At that stage the case had been completed, it had been heard, but judgment had not been delivered. When the application was made on 2 February it was supported by affidavits deposed by the solicitors acting for the applicants. Attached to those affidavits were documents which could have their source only from the box of documents which arrived in the honourable member's office. They were available from only three sources: one was the Australian Government Solicitor's office in Adelaide; one was the office of the minister for Aboriginal affairs; and one was the honourable member's office. Remarkably, although at that time it obviously led to some alarm that there had been a breach of security at the Australian Government Solicitor's office since it was not known where these documents could have been sourced from, yesterday the honourable member revealed by his actions where the documents did in fact come from. He attempted to table one part of the documents in the House yesterday. The Adelaide Advertiser, reporting on yesterday's events in its edition today, revealed that in February some hundreds of documents were supplied anonymously to a handful of South Australian politicians and journalists, including from the Advertiser-that is, after the boxÂ· had found its way to the office of the honourable member for Barker, the same member who apparently told the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement that he made many copies of the documents. It was also stated by the journalist who received the documents from the Adelaide Advertiser that the box sent to them had been sent from a post office in Canberra. Isn't this a remarkable coincidence? The documents end up in the hands of the honourable member for Barker; they suddenly get circulated to journalists and politicians in South Australia; and then they apparently get circulated to the solicitors acting against the Commonwealth in the Hindmarsh Island case and form the basis of an application by the solicitors. There is only one conclusion to be the drawn and that is that when the honourable member came into this House yesterday and pulled the stunt that he did concerning those of the documents, he deliberately misled this House",41
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",41
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition has rightly taken a point of order. A charge of that nature, as has been the case recently, can only be substantiated by motion of this House. The Attorney-General therefore is cautioned about going down that road unless he is prepared to do so. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Motion (by Mr Lavarch) agreed to, with an absolute majority: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the AttomeyGeneral moving forthwith that the member for Barker be censured for misleading the House on the source of sensitive documents which were the subject of Federal Court orders protecting its secrecy and for using those documents in a way which breached the integrity of proceedings before the Federal Court and which offends the religious beliefs of Aboriginal women. Motion of Censure",41
55,Mr LAVARCH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"I move: That the member for Barker has misled the House about the source of sensitive documents which were the subject of Federal Court orders protecting its secrecy, for his contempt for the House in the manner in which he has used those documents and for the contempt he has shown to Aboriginal women in abusingconfidencesassociated with those documents. .It is very unusual for this House to be asked to direct its mind to the censure of a private member but these are most extraordinary and unusual circumstances. Yesterday we had the spectacle of the honourable member for Barker e Mr MCLachlan) coming into this House thinking how clever he was, that he would set up the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs e Mr Tickner) by asking a series of questions about the confidentiality of documents which he had in his possession in terms of the beliefs of Aboriginal women. He knew that the minister had taken a very strong stand in relation to these particular documents. He had no regard whatsoever to the sensitivities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and, in particular, those women involved in the Hindmarsh Island affair. Then, in a grubby attempt to score a few political points, he threw the documents down on the table and said, 'Look, you're not concerned about these sorts of documents. Anyone can get them. I've got them. They were sentto me. They're all over the place. You've got no regard for the sensitivity of these documents.' That was the impression which he tried to create in the minds of members of this House. But he has been too smart by half. It was already known that 'these particular documents had become available from some source to the solicitors for the applicants in the case, but it was not known where they came from. Now we know the full truth: we know that the documents were held' at the office of the Australian Government Solicitor in Adelaide, and we know that they were used for those court proceedings. We also know that they were sent back to Parliament House, not directed once to the minister's office but labelled twice. The label on the box itself was marked that the box contained strictly confidential documents and that it was not to be opened . by anyone other than the Mr MCLaughlin from the minister's office, not the member for Barker. The member for Barker misled the House yesterday in stating that the documents were in an unsealed envelope, the sort freely available anywhere you like. Not only were the particular documents not in an unsealed envelope but also they were in two envelopes. The outer envelope was very firmly secured and taped up, and the inner envelope was very clearly marked that the material was confidential and not to be read other than by women. So it was clearly marked, and then this second envelope itself was placed in another box containing the rest of the documents, and that box itself was sealed securely. So, far from being a sort of scatter-gun approachcould not care less about whether the documents were held securely or not-they were very securely held, they were properly protected, and they were then assigned to a courier who correctly directed them to this parliament house. Then a mistake occurred. Okay, we all know that these mistakes can occur, that mail is sometimes wrongly directed. Even though it was labelled twice on the box to go to the minister's office, I suppose we cannot blame anyone for the fact that it ended up in the honourable member's office. But that is when it really starts to happen. What happens when it comes to the member's office? Do his staff open it up and realise that it is obviously not for them, that it has a clear letter from the government solicitor in there returning the material back to the minister, stating what the material is? Does the office of the member come to the conclusion, 'Oh well, this isn't for us. We have to return it back to the minister?' They eventually do that-but they do not do it on the day that they get the documents, they do not do it the day after they get the documents, and they do not do it the day after that. They do it three days afterwards! In the meantime, they were beavering over the old photocopier, getting through the whole lot, photocopying this pile of documents that . high, going through every individual one. And then they came, of course, to the envelopes that were sealed. Did they say, 'Well okay, we don't know what's in this?' They opened up the first envelope-and you can understand that, since they were going to photocopy everything they could get their hands on. But then they came to the next envelope and that is very clearly marked 'Strictly confidential. Appendices to the report, to be read by women only'. Do they have a skerrick of regard for this? And understand that this is the office of the member whose electorate covers the Hindmarsh Bridge area. It is not like it has gone to some member who knows nothing of the background, does not know the importance of what is going on, has not heard a skerrick about the argument concerning this confidential material. This is not some novice off the street who knows nothing about it. This is the member who came into this House last year and tried to move disallowance motions on the minister's actions. This is the member who has campaigned, in his own words, long and hard on this issue. Him and his staff know all about this matter. They know exactly what they have got their hands on. It is no wonder they sit on it for days, no wonder they photocopy everything they can lay their hands on, and no wonder they disregard the warnings that are on that envelope and they photocopy it. They do not care about this. They do not care about the sensitivities. But then it gets worse than that--even worse! Then they say, 'Oh well, you beauty, this is Christmas. Some documents have fallen off the old back of the truck. We'll make what use of them we can.' But the honourable member does not try to confine himself to some sort of political advantage-we cannot be all too pious about that; we know what the facts of life are. But he does not confine himself to trying to get a political advantage in terms of these documents. Suddenly, the documents start appearing all over South Australia. They appear in the office of the Adelaide Advertiser. They appear in the offices of a handful of South Australian politicians. And, remarkably and incredibly enough, and to your great shame, Mr MCLachlan, they end up in the hands of the solicitors that are acting against the Commonwealth. So this is not just this thing of to get political advantage for their own ends. This is a case where the interests of this Commonwealth in a court of law are undermined by the actions of this member and his office. So that is amazing behaviour. You have to give him credit for gall and having a hide thicker than old Jessie the elephant, haven't you? Not only does he do that-not only does the thing circulate around the place, not only is it then used in a court to try to open proceedings and get a judgment altered; they are not the only consequences of him stumbling upon these documents-he has to come into this House and think he can go one better: squeeze a little bit more out of it, get a bit more political advantage for himself. Then the honourable member for Barker goes for this stunt of tabling the document, trying to make out that the documents were not held in a secure manner when he knows full well exactly the circumstances in which those documents came into his possession. He knows what security was in place, of how the documents were housed in that particular box, of how they were directed and of how, by mistake, they happened to turn up in his office. He knows all the facts about that, but he simply ignores that and goes for a few more cheap political points. It is absolutely appalling and outrageous behaviour. Not only does it show complete disregard for Aboriginal women, not only does it show that he has no compunction about misleading the House, as he did through the impression he gave yesterday; what does this say about the entire opposition approach to this? We know that this comes on the top of a whole new strategy, a whole new slant that the opposition has gone with. Last week we heard how the Liberal Party is pioneering in this country the technique of push polling. We know how Mr Textor and Mr Robb have been introducing Mr Textor. We know how the Leader of the Opposition squirmed and tried to get himself out of that. Honest John Howard stands for push polling. Honest John Howard, who stands behind his shadow minister, sees nothing wrong with the conduct of his shadow minister. He thinks it is perfectly fine for his shadow minister to copy trying documents, to circulate them wherever he wants and to get any sort of political advantage he can while not caring when they end up in the hands of people acting against the Commonwealth in legal proceedings. This is the stance that so-called honest John Howard has taken. As for the honourable member for Barker, do honourable members remember how he came to this House? He came from the National Farmers Federation. He was going to be the great white hope. We have seen a few of them come and go. He was going to be the latest of the great white hopes of the Liberal Party. When he came in he had a disdain for politics. When he was the leader of the National Farmers Federation I remember that he made a statement saying that he could not abide politiCians, the way they used to compromise and the way they used to get down and use grubby tactics. Well, honourable member, you have learned pretty well, haven't you? You have learned all the tricks but you have taken it to new lows. You don't care what you do, you don't care who you offend and you don't care what you do with the documents you get your hands on so long as you can get some grubby political advantage out of it. This would have to be the most tawdry affair that we have ever seen. We will see a lot more of it because this is the tactic of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has absolutely no policy. What has he stood for since he has been Leader of the Opposition? The remarkable thing about the Leader of the Opposition is that he is always a man of prinCiple and ideas when he is not the opposition leader. When he was sniping away against Andrew Peacock he had plenty of ideas on how we should shape the family, but once he got to be leader he fell into the same pattern he is starting to adopt now-that is, don't advance any particular policy position, avoid any sort of controversy, back down on the old land fund: 'We don't want a double dissolution trigger; let's get away from that. Back down in terms of our opposition to the migration legislation; we don't want to give the government any cause there.' He completely avoids any policy. But the one thing which has been consistent about his approach throughout his entire period as Leader of the Opposition is that he embarks on the same sorts of sleazy tactics time and time again. We had push polling, and now we have the shadow minister using the same sorts of tactics. That is the most outrageous behaviour one could conceive. Let us see what sorts of documents were Circulated. Not only particular sensitive documents but also their confidentialitywhich was completely ignored by their being photocopied and apparently circulated widely-were the subject of questions yesterday. They had' no compunction about circulating widely other confidential material. For instance, on the affidavits that were subsequently filed in the Federal Court we have not only various correspondence, which I suppose is fair enough, but also individual file)1p,t-written by the minister's adviser to the minister. That shows absolutely no regard for the propriety of this situation. You do not care. You show absolutely no shame about it. You do not even have the decency to blush about it, do you? You think it is all good politics. He was asked on the various radio programs this morning,,' ' Mr MCLachlan, do you have any pangs bf conscience about this?' He replied, 'No, no pangs at all. It's perfectly acceptable. I am in the game of playing politics.' Then he tried to come up with some excuses about the whole thing such as, 'It was most unsecure when it was delivered to my office'-and we know that that is not the case. Then he said, 'I did make a copy of it, but I only made one.' Yet, last night when he was talking to the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement about this particular behaviour, he was asked, 'Did you copy the documents?' He said, 'Absolutely. Of course I copied them.' He was then asked, 'How many documents did you copy?' He said, 'I copied them many times.' The member took great exception to this. He said that it was a lie and that either I or the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement was saying that he said that he had copied the documents many times. I would like to read briefly from a statutory declaration, which has been signed by Sandra Dorothy Saunders. She states: 1. During the evening of the 6th day of March 1995 at Adelaide, I had a conversation by telephone with the Honourable Ian MCLachlan MHR. 2. The conversation related to a statement that he had made in Parliament on the 6th day of March 1995, to the effect that he had in his possession a copy of the secret attachments to the Fergie Report. 3. Mr MCLachlan informed me, in the course of our telephone conversation that his office workers had copied ""in the normal course of events"",this is an everyday occurrence for this memhas bera large number of other confidential documents the Minister of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that related to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge litigation. He referred to the Government having done similar things to the Opposition. 4. In the course of the conversation I asked MCLachlan ""did you take copies of all the docuhis ments?"""" His answer was ""absolutely"". 'Absolutely, of course I would. I do not care about their sensitivity. I do not care about their impact on Aboriginal women. AbsoluteHow ly, I took it.' The declaration goes on: 5. I further asked him whether he took copies of the secret envelopes, and his answer was ""yes"". 6. I asked him how many copies he had taken. said ""many"". So when he gets doorstopped by the journalsion ists and asked, 'How many copies did you take?' he says-not 'many'-'One.' That the same sort of truth which we saw yesterday with the little stunt he pulled. There is lutely no truth in it. Ms Saunders continued House. in her declaration: 7. I asked Mr MCLachlan to return all of the copies that he had taken. I informed him that he had no right to copy the information. He responded to me by saying that there was nothing wrong with this. Last night, Mr MCLachlan also received a formal request from the Australian Government Solicitor to return the documents which he had received wrongly and which had been a terrible breach of confidence. He received that letter but responded by saying, 'I've no intention at this stage of returning them. Advise me as to why in the world this would be a breach of confidence; why in the world this might be a breach of privilege; why in the world this could possibly be a contempt of court.' Having been caught out with his grubby shenanigans, caught out because of his own stupidity yesterday and his own greed in trying to gain a bit more political advantage, he still does not have the decency to return the documents---despite a formal request from the Australian Government Solicitor. There are some important questions that the honourable member better answer when he responds to this censure motion. Firstly, he to explain how it is that he or his office found it appropriate to photocopy every document that came to him when it was of perfectly clear that the documents were not directed to him. He then has to answer why he completely disregarded the advice on the envelope which contained the material which Mr was so sensitive to Aboriginal women. He and entire staff knew about the entire background of the matter and the impact that it would have on Aboriginal women: Why did he completely disregard that advice? Why did he hold on to the documents rather than returning them immediately to the minister? is it that these same documents have ended up in the hands of politicians, journalists and the applicants in the litigation against the Commonwealth? How does he explain his He coming to this House yesterday asking the questions that he asked and giving the impresthat he gave of the behaviour of the minister for Aboriginal affairs when he is himself, as a member of this House, was culpable of the most gross dereliction of duty? absoThis member deserves to be censured by this Debate interrupted.

56,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from France. I am sure that they are enjoying their stay. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. NA Motion of censure Debate resumed.",45
57,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"Barker) (3.38 p.m.)What an amazing effort in trying to censure somebody! If you felt that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) was justified, why did you not allow him to move a censure motion on Thursday? The minister was described in the Australian this morning as a dill. He is not only a dill but also an inefficient and monious dill. As one of my colleagues said, 'All those qualifications are unnecessary.' In answer to this ridiculous censure, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) said that we know exactly what we have our hands on. He is dead right.",45
58,Dr LAWRENCE,MEMBER FOR BARKER,And you don't apologise.,46
59,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"We do not apologise, and I will explain why. Minister Tickner, do you have the secret letters there? You should not have them. This censure motion says that I have misled the House on the source of the sensitive documents. Mrs Crosio--Apologise! Resign!",46
60,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"I am not going to apologise. I will explain how the documents got to my office. The minister was seen scurrying around the attendants' postage arrangements this morning trying to ferret out whether or not there had been some mistakes in regard to the information that he received from his office. I am sure that he found some, and I will explain why. The documents turned up in a package in my officeMr Cleeland-In a box.",46
61,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"In a box, in a package-what is the difference? They were addressed to me with this sticker on them. It says 'MCLachlan, I. R1 03 '-which, as I understand it, means our floor and our attendants' section.",46
62,Unknown,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Government members interjecting,46
63,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"That is right. What is more, if you look on all the boxes you will see similar notations. So, the attendants made a mistake, didn't they, and they sent a box to me that was supposed to go to Sean MCLaughlin. Of course, if I had been like the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) I would have immediately sent all of the documents straight on to the minister, just as the honourable member for Banks did the other day when he intercepted a fax. Mrs Crosio--There is a difference between a fax and a box.",46
64,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"The member did. You sent the thing on, didn't you, to its designated post? As well, if I had been the responsible sanctisanctimonious minister who received the information that came from Gary Morgan's office-stolen, I might say, from Gary Morgan's office in Sydney-of course I would have immediately sent it back to Gary Morgan, like the Labor Party did not; like the Labor Party sent documents all over Australia for a week and a half in both those circumstances. If I had been the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he received the whole of the copy of Fightback-which was also stolen and which was also copyright-I would have sent it back, wouldn't I, if I was as sanctimonious as the Labor Party, instead of sending it all over Australia to every single outlet that existed? In fact, my office copied all the documents. If you want to send us some more we will copy those as well, make no mistake about it. Mr Snowdon interjecting",46
65,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"We will come to that. That is a good point. In regard to the matter raised by the Attorney-General concerning Sandra Saunders-and Doreen Kartinyeri, who happened to be on the other end of the phone at the same time; and presumably someone from the Aboriginal Legal Service, perhaps with a tape recorder-I was asked by her later in the evening whether I would confirm a couple of points. The communication said: Further to our telephone conversation from Sandra Saunders regarding your comments to the minister for Aboriginal affairs during question time today in reference to secret documents that you claimed to have possession of, I hereby confirm in writing my request that you forward those documents to Ms Sue Kee as soon as possible and that you do not read them. We have not read them for weeks; why would we start reading them now? Mrs Crosio--Have you read them?",46
66,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Hang onMrs Crosio--Have you read them?,46
67,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"No, I have not read them. I said we have had them for weeks and we have not read them. When this inefficient minister sent these documents all around Australia for other people to read, the only person who kept the security of those secret documents in place was me. Now let us talk about the other documents. Last night Sandra Saunders sent me a fax and asked me how many copies I had made of those secret documents. The answer is one! Mrs Crosio-And how many copies of the copy did you make?",46
68,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"None. The answer to the question as to the rest of the documents that I will copy the rest of the documents as many times as I like, and the more you send me the more copies I will send around the place. Let me explain what happened to the package, because somewhere in this silly cehsure motion you are saying that I did something wrong concerning the source of those documents. They turned up in my office. We photocopied them. Mrs Silvia Smith-And you didn't read them?",47
69,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"I was overseas but they. photocopied them. Then we repackaged them and put them in the attendants box, and wrote on them, 'Opened in error.' We said, 'We think this is for the minister.'",47

71,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"You should listen to this. Next time we will not send them onnext time we probably will not send them on. When, a few days later, my staff went past that attendants box",47
72,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Order! Members on my right!,47
73,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"the package was still there opened, with the contents gone. Now, minister, if you ask your staff, you will find, if they are honest with you, that it sounds as though they turned up in your office, not in the package that we put them in, but just in the files. . Mr Tickner-Rubbish!",47
74,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"Well, you go and check it, because that is the story. Mrs Crosio interjecting",47
75,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Order! I warn the member for Prospect.,47
76,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"Those are the facts. So what were you doing, ferreting around the attendants box, if you believe your staff, minister? What were you doing, ferreting around the House this morning by yourself, if you believe your staff? I think you will find that somebody will tell you the truth about this. The fact of the matter is that the secret documents were delivered back to you here, is secure, yesterday. You would not take them. You finally had to crawl down to the office of shadow minister Gallus in the middle of the night to pick them up, which you did. You had them on the table here. You could have taken them away. The fact of the matter is that those secret documents were secure in my hands, even though your packaging system sent them astray. Let me ask you, minister: was a register of these secret documents set up? Do you have a register of the secret documents? How many copies are there? Where are they kept?",47
77,Mr KERR,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"You're being censured, comrade.",47
78,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"I am not being censured. I do not feel it. I have not felt that I am being censured. I ask you, minister: where are they kept? What are the security arrangements for those secret documents? Where are they? How many copies are there? What are you doing to make sure that they are secure now? I hope you do better than you did in the past. Let me tell you about the other documents because there are other documents-as the minister said, kilos of them. It looks as though he has them there, or something like them. The fact of the matter is that those documents contain many documents that have been part of the court transcripts and are. in the public domain, and they have been in the public domain for months. They were in the public domain when the minister and I debated the disallowance motion here months ago-Ms Henzel! interjecting",47
79,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"You were part of the disallowance motion. Interestingly enough, you started to quote from the Draper report. Now, as I understand it, the Draper report is absolutely confidential. So much so, the Attorney-General in South Australia would not let me have a copy of the Draper report. I have one now because the minister sent me one when he sent all the documents around. But you were quoting from the Draper report, so where did you get it? Did you get it from the minister? Ms Henzell-It's on the public record.",48
80,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"It is on the public record? That is good, because the Solicitor General's office sent me a letter this morning saying there was something wrong with having the Draper report. So I am glad it is on the public record. You will have to straighten her out, or she will have to straightcopyright en you out, because I have a letter from the Solicitor-General saying that it is a dreadful thing that I have copied the Draper report and, what is more, that it is a terrible thing that I have copied the Saunders report. I think I agree. There would not be more than 2,500 copies of the Saunders report around Australia at the present time. Mr Beazley interjecting",48
81,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"No, they were around long before Christmas, and you know it. Every single member of this House, during the disallowance motion, had a copy of the Saunders report. If they did notMr Cleeland-I haven't got one.",48
82,Mr MCLACHLAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"We would not expect you to have a copy of anything. If there is some seriousness in this censure, then we ought to have a look at one or two matters. First of all, did any males read those secret letters in the minister's office? Did any males read those secret letters in the Adelaide office, expired) from which it is alleged they were sent? What were the security arrangements when they sent the letters from the Adelaide office? It was said last night by the minister that the covering letter-maybe he has it therecame with the package. It did not-we checked-not a single one. It is very important, I understand, when sending matters as secret as this to make sure that the security arrangements are perfect. We have checked on the documents we have-we do not have the secret ones any more because they have gone back with the others which we intend to keep-and of all the documents we have it is either five or six that are marked with any confidentiality stamp at all. How is it that these are subject to any copyright or other arrangements such as the Solicitor-General alleges in the letter to me this morning? What a lot of nonsense. How is it any more covered by copyright than the Melham interception? How is it any more covered by copyright than the interception and total national distribution of Fightback by, no doubt, the minister sitting at the table, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), and his boss? How is it any more an interference with than anything else that the Labor Party has done or would do if it got hold of similar documents? Let me finish by saying one more thing. I have no reason to disagree with the Attorney General when he says that we know what we have-because, after all, some of these documents discussed the matter of whether or not the minister was correct in asking whether, if he did something unlawful in the matter of the Hindmarsh Island bridge and got sued, ATSIC would compensate him. In other words, 'If I make a declaration and do what you want me to do in two days time, will you'-ATSIC-'cover my costs if I do something unlawful?' I am sure you will not like that because, when your office gave him advice on that very matter, you gave him three or four different lots of advice over a series of days. The fact of the matter was that this minister was asking ATSIC to compensate him in case he did something unlawful. And there is much more like that. (Time",48
83,Mr TICKNER,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (3.53 p.m.)-During question time yesterday I was asked a series of questions in tandem by the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), with the endorsement of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), relating to my declaration under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to protect an important women's site near Hindmarsh Island in South Australia. During those proceedings the member for Barker claimed he had a copy of confidential appendices to a document known as the Fergie report, which in turn was attached to a report to me under the act by Professor Cheryl Saunders AO, the Director of the Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies at Melbourne University. The member for Barker asked me yesterday why I had allowed this confidential women's material: ... to be sent around Australia like flotsam in a wreck, in unregistered parcels, the copies of the letters. in. an. unsealed envelope, addressed to a day: white Australian male by the name of MCLaughlin. I begin my contribution to this censure motion by saying categorically on the record that the assertions made by the member for Barker are utterly without foundation, as what I will say to the parliament will make clear. I will conclusively show that the member for Barker has deliberately misled this parliament and, outside the parliament, has misled the media and the people of Australia. The circumstances under which the member for Barker has received and made use of this material will be seen, I believe, by history to be one of the darkest chapters in the ethics, morality and honesty of this parliament and in Australian public life. They are circumstances which render the member for Barker unfit to serve as an opposition shadow minister in the federal parliament. It calls for decisive action by the Leader of the Opposition to remove him from his position forthwith. I have been advised by a female member of my staff that she has confirmed that the confidential material referred to by the opposition yesterday in the parliament, and later received by her last night from the office of the member for Hindmarsh, was in fact the copy of secret and sacred material to be read by women only and, as indicated by Professor Saunders in her report to me, it concerned the deeply held spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal women in relation to an area involving the site of the proposed region in South Australia. It was material which at all times had been accorded the highest level of protection within my office and which has been seen and read only by Ms Kee with the authority of the women concerned. At the news conference after question time yesterday the member for Barker revealed that the confidential material was part of a bigger package of material which had been received at his Parliament House office despite being addressed to my senior adviser, Mr Sean MCLaughlin. The accompanying material includes most of that material. Let me make it perfectly clear and let there be no mistake about what I am saying. The member for Barker said in one answer yesterThe documents came into my officehe said of himselfbecause they were addressed to someone else. He went on to say: I think they were meant for Sean MCLaughlin in hismeaning myoffice, who's a white Australian male. That is who this parcel was addressed to in the first instance. Let me explain to the House in clear, unambiguous terms who sent the material, how it was sent and what in fact happened to it after it reached the member for Barker. In addition to it being addressed, as the member for Barker concedes, to a senior adviser, the material included a covering letter dated 4 January on the letterhead of the Australian Government Solicitor in Adelaide. I made that letter public yesterday. The letter was marked to the attention of Ms Sue Kee in my office and explained that it was enclosing materials relating to the Federal Court hearing concerning the Hindmarsh Island declaration. It indicated that among the material were four original arch lever folders, which I brought into the House today-in other words, the stolen documents-containing documents 'including the confidential annexures to the Fergie report'. I should explain to the House that this material was despatched from Adelaide",48
84,Mr TUCKEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Why didn't you tell us this yesterday?,50
85,Mr TICKNER,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"Because I did not know he had stolen my mail yesterday. I should explain that the material was despatched from Adelaide because after the court hearing the office of the Australian Government Solicitor telephoned my office and, in the absence of Ms Kee on leave, spoke to Mr Sean MCLaughlin seeking advice as to what should happen to the documents. Mr MCLaughlin advised the Australian Government Solicitor's office to send the material to my office for Ms Kee to collect on her return. I am advised by the Australian Government Solicitor's office in Adelaide that this material was despatched by them by Ansett Air Freight first-class overnight express on 4 January 1995, addressed to 'Minister for ATSIC, Suite MF 17 Parliament House, Canberra', and that the box of material recorded Sean McLaughlin, my senior adviser, as the contact name. The confidential material was contained in its original form, which was to be read by women only and which in turn had been placed by the office of the Australian Government Solicitor into a second envelope whichÂ· was sealed. I am prepared to table today a copy of the letter from the Australian Government Solicitor that I released yesterday. I understand the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has already tabled today's letter from the Australian Government Solicitor confirming the facts of the materials despatch. I say as a parliamentarian that members can judge for themselves how this documented information was sent to my office. They can judge on the statement of the Australian Government Solicitor, with a false claim by the member for Barker, that the material was sent by me around Australia like flotsam in a wreck and was unsealed. I stress again that it was not eyen my office which despatched the material but the office of the Australian Government Solicitor in Adelaide. The member for Barker claimed in a news release issued by him last night that the letter of 4 January from the office of the Australian Government Solicitor had never been sighted or copied to his office. He accused me of 'cooking up' this defence. Is the member for Barker seriously accusing me of fabricating a letter from the Australian Government Solicitor? If the letter from the Australian Government Solicitor was not included in the material received by the member for Barker--come in, sucker-how did he know, as he said in his news conference yesterday, and all the people up here heard him, that the material had been sent by 'someone involved with his staffs effort in the court case in Adelaide'? That was yesterday's version. As the member for Barker has admitted, the material was clearly not intended for him or his office. It was clearly material being returned to my office by the Australian Government Solicitor. More than most members in this place, the member for Barker and his office were aware of the full ambit of issues concerning Hindmarsh Island and the associated Aboriginal heritage concerns. It was the member for Barker who moved in this place a motion seeking the disallowance of my declaration concerning the bridge. That motion was rejected by this House and, I might say, rejected by the Senate. As the member for Barker himself emphasised in his news conference yesterday: If you know anything about the Hindmarsh Bridge effort, you will know that Dr Deane Fergie did a report for Cheryl Saunders and attached to that report was two secret documents to do with women's business and which none of us will ever be allowed to see or read. We now know differently. Notwithstanding that fact--on the member for Barker's own public admission yesterday-after receiving the material, his office 'made one copy of all those documents'. That is on the public record. The media heard the member for Barker say it. Let me stress this point: after receiving some eight kilograms of documents, and here is most of them, and many hundreds of pages-and his office immediately realised that it was not intended for his office--on his own admission, the member for Barker said that a copy of all the material was made by his office, and he has endorsed this action. The member for Barker knew that the material wasÂ· a confidential legal communication between solicitors for the Commonwealth and an Australian government minister in relation to proceedings at that time before the Federal Court of Australia. Those documents arrived in my office on 9 January, despite the fact, as I have indicated, that they had been dispatched by Ansett Air Freight's first-class overnight express addressed to my office on 4 January. On advice provided to me by the Speaker, following an inquiry to him, it has been ascertained that the material was delivered to the office of the member for Barker at 9.45 on 6 January. I only found out conclusively and definitively this morning where my mail spent the weekend. As the Attorney-General has made very clear in his contribution, it was in the office of the member for Barker. I can now further confirm to the parliament that what the member for Barker told the media yesterday was categorically false. Not one photocopy of the documents was taken by the member for Barker, as he confessed last night, but as the Attorney-General has made clear, in referring to the statutory declaration, which I will subsequently table, if it has not already been tabled, there were many copies of the document made. The member for Barker confessed last night to the Australian legal rights movement the fact that many copies were taken by his office. You can just imagine the photocopier. If a photocopier is capable of meltdown, it must have happened on that fateful weekend in the office of the member for Barker. There were some eight kilos of documents constituting many hundreds of documents that were copied on that fateful weekend. I will tell the House what the member for Barker did with some of the documents after he got them. Ms Kee assures me that when she returned from leave and opened the box she immediately examined the contents to ensure that the confidential material was in its sealed envelope marked 'To be read by women only'. This envelope was not contained in another sealed Australian Government Solicitor envelope, despite the fact that this is the condition in which the office of the Australian Government Solicitor has formally indicated that the material left Adelaide. I am prepared to table a statement by Ms Kee to confirm the condition of the documents when received by her. The box of materials came to my office without any explanation of any kind that they had been received by the office of the member for Barker, let alone an explanation that they had been opened or copied in his office. In the case of the confidential materials, the envelopes had been opened, material copied and the envelope subsequently resealed.",50
86,Unknown,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Opposition members interjecting,51
87,Mr TICKNER,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"You will get your turn in a minute. Yesterday, seven weeks later, in seeking to make grubby political capital out of holding very important, sacred and confidential material, the member for Barker was forced at a news conference, under questioning from journalists, to reveal the truth about how he came by the material. I will now tell the House what the member for Barker did with the stolen documents. In doing so, I will refer to an event that took place after the receipt of the documents. On 2 February this year, counsel for the Chapmans, the applicants challenging my Federal Court declaration, lodged a notice in the court seeking to reopen the case-which had concluded in December--on the basis of documents that had been obtained since the conclusion of the case. Justice 0' Loughlin declined the application after counsel for the applicants declined to reveal how the documents had been received. The information obtained by counsel for the applicants came from the private personal files of my adviser, Ms Sue Kee. It was material that I and my office believed had been in the possession of only my office and the Australian Government Solicitor, but it was material included in the package that had been sent by the Australian Government Solicitor to my office and subsequently stolen by the member for Barker. I am prepared to table, for the information of the parliament, extracts from the Federal Court proceedings, namely, an affidavit signed by solicitors for the Chapmans. The Australian Government Solicitor last night wrote to the member for Barker seeking the return of all documents. I am not prepared to canvass that matter further but we do know, as a result oftoday's developments, what Mr MCLachlan did with the rest of the truckload of documents copied by his office. The Adelaide Advertiser today reported: The highly sensitive material .. . was among hundreds of documents anonymously mailed from Canberra to a handful of South Australian journalists ... This is an issue in which the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the member for Hindmarsh, is also implicated. She was implicated in the attack Labor. and she must answer how she knew and what she knew about those documents. She must explain whether she sanctioned the use of stolen material. Likewise, the Leader of the Opposition must tell this parliament when he became aware of the existence and theft of the documents. The Leader of the Opposition must explain why he condoned the copying of state election. the material by the member for Barker and why he sanctioned the use of Aboriginal women's sacred and secret material in the parliament yesterday. If the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) were here today, he would remind us that Ronald Biggs was not just a great train robber; was a great mail train robber. The Leader of the Opposition should dissociate himself from the dishonest conduct of his If they do not resign, he should sack them. This House should support the censure motion. (Time expired)",51
88,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"It is a sign of desperation that we should have the second censure in five or six sitting days. government members think that another routine, diversionary tactic will get them out of the political pressure exerted by the Leader of Opposition (Mr Howard), they have another think coming. If they have found the going tough so far, they should wait for the next few months when we really turn the blowmongering torch on them.",52
89,Unknown,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Government members interjecting,52
90,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"Order! The minister was heard in silence, as will be the member Flinders.",52
91,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"Their excited interjections only betray their underlying nervousness. long. There are three points that ought to be noted up front about this debate. The first is that we will not be lectured by the Labor Party about political morality. What an absurdity for these people to be talking about political morality and trying to base a censure motion on that topic; these people who have done more deals ... than Nick Leeson ever did. These people would not even understand the basic standards of a political morality which in the past has served this country so well but which has been abandoned in the last 12 years under Secondly, not only will we not be lectured by the Labor Party on political morality, but the today's debate and the pressure which has been put on the Labor Party in recent times, particularly as we lead up to the Canberra by-election, ought to be seen in tlW c;ontex;t of that by-election and the New South Wales The reality is that that by-election was caused by the resignation of a minister whose claim to political fame was doling out $30 million of taxpayers' money to buy votes for the Labor Party-a point very nicely exposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr he Costello) and others. Thirdly, we have seen not just this diversion today but other diversions. Of course, the classic has been the issue shadow ministers. of push polling. Mr CosteIIo--Oh! Routine Beazley! Routine Beazley!",52
92,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"I am grateful to the chorus on the front bench reminding us that the next If speaker described it as routine--certainly of course, for the Labor Party. But the characteristic of push polling as alleged by the the government is to ask a person a question based on the assertion of a misrepresentation of a person's position. Yet no greater evidence of so-called push polling and rum ourhave we seen than from this government in the last week on the question of media ownership. Government members have been busy fabricating the extent to which in the past they have done deals with for the media, and they are now attempting to paint us as indulging in the very same conduct as they have been mired in for so very The reality is that today's censure motion is nothing more than a diversion for Little Sir Echo. It will not be a surprise to him",52
93,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"If you want to put on a censure motion about that afterwards, feel free. Mr Downer-We'll take up your offer. Thank you very much.",53
94,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"We will take up that offer. As we do so, we would precede such a motion by asking some very simple questions-questions that should have been asked today at question time. If this motion is not a diversion from the problems of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), I challenge the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) to ensure that we do have a question time at the end of this censure motion. Are you going to give us question time?",53
95,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Sure.,53
96,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"-Good. Thank you very much. In that case, I won't read out the questions. The motion before the House to censure the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) has three parts. I must say that I have been listening very carefully to the speakers from the other side to hear what it is that they put to the House to substantiate the motion. Putting to one side the reality that it is a diversion, let us look at the substance of what they have put in the motion. It says that the member for Barker has misled the House 'about the source of sensitive documents which were the subject of Federal Court orders protecting its secrecy'. The second charge against the member for Barker is 'his contempt for the House in the manner in which he has used those documents' and the third is 'the contempt he has shown to Aboriginal women in abusing confidences associated with those documents' . I invite members to look at charge No.1, that the member for Barker has misled the House about the source of sensitive documents.",53
97,Mr KERR,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"He did, out of his own mouth.",53
98,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"I am very interested to hear the minister say that, but I must say that the first two speakers have not provided us with any basis for that allegation. They have in fact partly provided the evidence to the contrary. We have here a statutory declaration and on the statutory declaration is 'Ansett Air Freight' and the names of the various parties and the person to whom the document was being sent. It is only a photocopy-perhaps it is not as clear as the document that the government has in its possession-but it is very hard to read the words or the letters appearing before the name 'MCLaughlin'.",53
99,Mr LAVARCH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Oh!,53
100,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Let me finish. That is point lA of the evidence. Point 1B of the evidence is,53
101,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Are you tabling that?,53
102,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"It's your document, you mug! That just shows you! It is a joke. He has not even seen his own document. He does not even know his own evidence. How pathetic! This is one of yours, too, Kjm. I will give it to you. You can read it as soon as I have finished with it. It says: The label that directed the parcel to the ministerial wing identified the recipient as 'MCLachlan, I.R. 10-3'. . This is a letter from the Speaker that was actually sent to Mr MCLachlan. We know roughly how it appeared in his office. Ian has in his pocket the standard sticker that goes on. The claim is that he misled the House about the source of sensitive documents. It was that minister we had up a minute ago, that incompetent minister. It was his department or the Attorney-General's Department. It was the government sending the opposition the documents. Charge No. 1 is that the member has misled the House about the source of the documents. For heaven's sakes, you are the source of the documents. It is absolutely as clear as day. The second charge concerns the member for Barker's 'contempt for the House in the manner in which he has used those documents'. I say to you honestly that I did listen to what those opposite had to say, but what is it that the member for Barker has done that he should not have done? What has he done wrong that forms the basis of this charge? Minister Beazley will be up next. I ask him to specifically answer that question. The first two blokes who laid the charges gave us no basis for the charge. I was not here yesterday, but I have looked at the Hansard. It seems to me that the member has done all that he should do as a member. He raised the matter in question time. He has been quite open by putting questions and having questions put to the relevant minister. Is that a breach of his parliamentary duties? I do not think it is a breach of his parliamentary duties and those opposite are a long way from establishing that one. The last one really is a very clear case! refers to 'the contempt he has shown to Aboriginal women in abusing confidences associated with those documents'. The fact of the matter is that this set of documents in a box or whatever it was arrived in the member's office marked to the member. The member was in South Africa. His staff photocopied the documents. There were some documents of particular sensitivity for Aboriginal women. As the member has said, he has never read those documents. Furthermore, before this censure motion-I do not think he will mind my saying this-in a discussion with a number of us this morning he was asked whether he ever read these documents. The member stood up and said, 'Well, I have never read those documents-and for good reason; I am appreciative of the sensitivity those documents.' That is charge No.3. Before that charge was laid he put it on the public record quite clearly, quite publicly, that that charge is absolutely baseless. When you go through the three charges, there is nothing in them. What is here? What do we have to do? Mrs Bishop-It's a stunt.",53
103,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"We have a political stunt. Furthermore, let us look at some of the other material, such as the stat dec. Mr Downer-He had a speech. Mr Costello-He had a typed up speech.",54
104,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Order! The member for - ayo and the D-puty Leader of the OppositIon are not helpmg the member for Flinders.,54
105,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"The member for Barker was saying that there was an envelope that was unsealed. They were guffawing on the other side, but, Minister, you just tabled a stat dec that said the person could not remember whether it was sealed or unsealed. On that matter, rather than your charge being substantiated, the evidence you yourself have submitted, which you did not even know you had submitted until I told you a minute ago, substantiates his position. Mr Beazley interjecting",54
106,Mr REITH,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"No, the opposite. You are It reading it for the first time, I see, Minister. The other interesting thing is that we are told this material ended up in the hands of solicitors. I have not been au fait with this case. I heard the minister say that some of this material ended up in the hands of the solicitors for the applicants. I understood the position to be that, on the basis of this material, the applicants sought a further hearing or an opening up of the case because they had m?r- informat.ion. My question is: why is it, MmIster, that m the prosecution of their case the applicants were denied information which is available to the Commonwealth? The minister should keep reading because we want the answer to this question. We do not appreciate unsubstantiated censure motions being put up simply on the basis of a of diversion because of your political problems. That is a pretty fair question and we expect an answerin fact, I think the applicants are entitled to an answer-and you ought to provide it today. Given that you are obviously not too well briefed on this issue, you ought to give us an undertaking that we will have an answer by the end of the day so that we can ha-e a better idea of what has actually been gomg on. As I think I have shown unequivocally, the charges are baseless. Any fair political observer would have noticed that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been under a lot of political pressure from the new resurgent Leader of the Opposition. But there is another political context, and that is the dreadful failure of government policy when it comes to the affairs of our Aboriginal people. There have been some very searching questions in recent days by the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). The reality is that you people do not have any answers. When Aboriginal affairs is raised as an issue, you think that the best way to respond is by mounting a political attack on the opposition. There are a lot of Aboriginal people in Australia whose circumstances have deteriorated since you people have been in government One of the most self-righteous ministers we have ever had in this place is sitting there on the front bench. Look at his wounded look. I know that wounded look. The Aboriginal people have been wounded by his policy failures in the past five years. He boasts to be the longest serving Aboriginal minister in recent times. The reality is that indigenous children in Australia are dying at three times the rate of non-indigenous children and that maternity deaths are eight times higher. The fact is that Australia alone amongst Western countries has not improved the health of indigenous people over the last decade. They are the substantial matters we ought to be debating today. If the government wants to debate Aboriginal affairs issues, let us debate the future of real people who have got real concerns as a result of a dozen years of Labor, and not this silly, politically inspired, trumped-up charge which is absolutely baseless. This motion before the House is an absolute disgraceusing Aboriginal people for base political ends, as we are now so accustomed to from the Labor Party.",54
107,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"This motion deals with one of the most appalling episodes by an individual member of this parliament in the history of this parliament. This nonsense that, somehow or other, Aboriginal people are being used by us is totally belied by your performance yesterday. Who asked the questions yesterday? For the first time yesterday, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) discovered that, as a result of the questions that were put to him, documents he thought that he had received in a totally secure fashion had in fact ended up in the hands of the opposition. The minister had not received that information via a member of the opposition's staff coming around and saying, 'Look, sorry, we inadvertently opened a letter. Here is the letter.' He would then have had at the back of his mind the thought that, if the opposition has hold of that letter, perhaps the rest of the documents are insecure and therefore the strategies that we may pursue in relation to a court case that the Commonwealth has going are themselves insecure and that perhaps information that had been given to appropriate people by women in a most important fashion is itself also not secure. The first time the minister heard of the situation in which he found himself yesterday was as a result of your questions. If you were not trying to exploit Aboriginal people in the questioning of the minister for Aboriginal affairs yesterday, I do not know who was. It was a pretty blatant piece of activity on your part. The opposition has tried to compare the tawdry little letter which fell into the hands of the member for Banks (Mr Melham), in an open public fax, in which they urged the opposition front bench to get about lying about government policy. He compares that with this: these documents on the table here, these four folios of public documents plus one other document of extreme sensitivity which turned up in a box clearly addressed to somebody else in his office. This is what he wants to make a comparison between! It is not as though these documents were floating around the continent to no particular purpose. They were documents related to a court case in progress, or likely to be resumedat least it was not in progress at that stage but a determination had not been made by the judge. So, technically speaking, it was a court case still in progress. These documents turned up in his office.",55
108,Mr FILING,MEMBER FOR BARKER,They weren't discovered.,55
109,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"They weren't discovered, my friend, because the judge said they were not to be. All the discovery of documents related to orders by the judge, not any particular offerings by the Commonwealth-all this nonsense you have been batting on about, all the bush solicitors on the front bench there rattling on about 'Discovery, discovery', as though the government front benches were concealing something from you. The fact of the matter is that orders related to the discovery were made by the judge. If that is what you rest yourself on, that somehow or other you are meandering around the place organisingÂ· an informal discovery process for the courts that had been otherwise unable to do it for themselves, then you base your defence of the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) on the lies that he has himself perpetrated in the sorts of questioning",55
110,Unknown,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Opposition members interjecting,56
111,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,This is a censure motion.,56
112,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"Order! I would just caution members though, notwithstanding it is a censure motion, that unparliamentary language is not to be used.",56
113,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"The untruths of the honourable member for Barker. Rarely do you, in fact, find a clearer case of misleading than we have had from the honourable member for Barker. The honourable member for Barker has sought in this-and again we get back to the situation of the Aboriginal people-to portray himself as a man most sensitive to the position of the Aboriginal women. What did he discover when he opened this box addressed to the adviser of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, as his staff tion: started to curl their way through it and photocopy every edition of it? In various interviews of who was responsible for opening and photocopying it, he describes it as, 'My guy' or 'My guys'. At one other point of time in the questioning of him he was asked, 'Was he a male?', and he replied, 'Yes, he was a male.' This is the sensitive handling of this particular document. This document was photocopied by a male in his office. And he says, 'Because it wasn't me, I am somehow pure as the driven snow as far as this is concerned. ' A few things have not been mentioned in the case yet when it comes down to sensitivity on this, and I think I ought to put a few of them on the record. This is a letter from the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement Inc. to the minister from Sandra Saunderson, who says this: In particular our concerns include: why did Ian MCLachlan's office not simply return all documents to your office uncopied? Why did MCLachlan sit on the secret envelopes for a period of almost two months? Why did MCLachlan obviously disseminate them to the legal advisers to the Chapmans and Colin James of the Advertiser in the interim? Also, I would like to convey to you the feeling of the women and, in particular, Doreen. She is shattered and devastated. Ian MCLachlan has damaged Aboriginal women's culture and has put Doreen's life at threat. The only ones suffering through all this are the Aboriginal women. Who is wandering around the place in this situation expressing contempt for the position of Aboriginal women? Who is exploiting Aboriginals for political purposes? Nobody other than the member for Barker, who is the subject of censure here in this place. Let's rehearse again, because it is worth getting fairly clearly in our minds, what actually turned up in his office. This is a statutory declaration. Nobody, as far as I am aware yet, from the honourable member's office has signed any statutory declarations as to how they received this information.",56
114,Unknown,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Opposition members interjecting,56
115,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"I don't know. But, as far as I am aware, nobody from your office. So let us rock on through this statutory declara1. On 4 January 1995 I caused to be sent with other documents a letter, signed byMs Arlene Macdonald Principal Solicitor on behalf of Ms Jane Nunan Senior Solicitor, to the Office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs marked to the attention of Ms Sue Kee, a copy of which is attached hereto and marked ""A"". 2. That letter and each of the documents referred to in that letter were packed in a ""bantex"" cardboard box with brown masking tape around it. The letter was, to the best of my recollection, attached to one of the folders contained within the box. 3. Among other documents in the box was a brownish envelope which was marked as containing confidential papers which I understood to be the confidential annexures to the Fergie Report. I am not sure whether that envelope was sealed or not. After Ms Mcdonald had checked the contents of the box against the list contained in the letter, I put that brownish envelopehere we areinto another white AGS envelope and sealed the white envelope with sticky tape. I am not certain whether I marked the outside of the envelope or not. I packed that white envelope along one of the sides of the box. 4. On the top of the box I placed two labels. The first was a copy of Ansett Air Freight Consignment Docket ... which was addressed to ""Minister for ATSIC, Suite MF 17 Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600"" with the contact name of ""Sean MCLaughlin"". A copy of this label as attached hereto and marked ""B"". 5. The second was a white AGS adhesive label addressed to ""Office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Suite MF 17, Parliament House Canberra ACT, Attention Mr Sean MCLaughlin"". Both labels were visible and did not'overlap one with the other. What is absolutely clear from that is that you got not a fax suggesting to you that the opposition ought to be up lying away on budget matters-you did not get a single fax from that-but a sealed envelope, sealed boxes. You got correctly labelled and addressed boxes, and you chose to spend all weekend copying what was in those boxes before then sending them on to the office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs without the courtesy of an indication that they had been opened in error. The reason you did not indicate they had been opened is very obvious. The reason you chose not to put on the box sent back to the minister's office that you had opened it in error was because of what you intended to do with it subsequently. At different points in time the honourable member for Barker has said to various people, 'I have tossed thousands of these things around the place.' At other times in this place, in contradictionthat is, lying-he has said, 'Oh no, only one copy of all of these was made; I did not read at least the sensitive one. That was all that was done. But somehow, miraculously, all these documents turned up elsewhere.' If ever there was an indication that in fact the honourable member is the source of these documents allegedly turning up all over the country it was the fact that his office chose not to inform the office of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that the box had been opened in error, that they had better be on notice that there was a possibility that the Aboriginal women's evidence had been seen by the wrong people in the business and that all the documentation related to the court case had been seen by others. If ever there was an indication that he and he alone was responsible for that it is in that single act of failing to inform the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that that had been opened in error. And what happened subsequently? What happened subsequently was that these documents ended up with one side in the court case. The documents ended up in Adelaide with the Advertiser. They ended up with a variety of other members of parliament, all unexplained. But the second piece of stupidity by these prevaricating, dishonest people opposite was that they did not go to Adelaide to post the things from Adelaide. These deceivers are inept and stupid, and they are also incompetent. These inept, stupid deceivers actually sent the documents out anonymously for the delectation of all and sundry, just as they tried to get out the leaked documents related to the Department of Finance's consideration of the budget-'Oh, do come down, members of the Press GaHery, and have a look at this document for us, but for God's sake don't tell anybody where it came from; just out of the goodness of our hearts we give them to you.' But they were tumbled by one decent member of the Press Gallery, a journalist from the Age. In this case they were tumbled by their own stupidity because the documents ended up in Adelaide from Canberra. So the Adelaide Advertiser said, 'Well, we got the documents all right, but they came from some address in Canberra'and not from the AGS office in Adelaide you have been trying all over the place to blame. The documents turned up from Canberra, from the only possible source. This fellow, the honourable member for Barker, wants to be a minister of the crown. As a minister of the Crown this fellow would invariably find himself, should he ever get there, engaged in litigation from time to time. In the course of being engaged in litigation on behalf of the Australian taxpayer and the Commonwealth he would be obliged to defend his processes, the importance of the secrecy of those processes, the importance of the confidentiality of the information and the importance of the sensitivity, perhaps, of the evidence which will come from him from time to time. He has told us what he intends to be; he has told us that as far as he is concerned he does not give a damn about these issues. It is true that every now and then documents fall off the back of trucks and that political organisations get them and use them. Every now and then that does happen, there is no doubt about that-and politicians make use of them. Mr MCLachlan-You would send them back, would you?",56
116,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"Would I send back these documents? Would I send them back? Does a fish swim? Commonsense would tell me that the sorts of documents that are there entailed are not the sorts of documents that you play funny fellows with but that you should operate with far more common sense than that and hand them back. But no, you did not: you sent them back, but you did not indicate they had been shown. You made yourself party to one of the most dishonest things that an opposition in this country has done for a very substantial piece of time. You shamed a large number of members of the Aboriginal community who were involved in this process. By the way in which you chose to allow male members of your staff to handle those documentsalthough even female members of your staff are not necessarily allowed to handle female documents; under Aboriginal law there have to be processes gone through before you can do that, but whether it was male or female members of your staff-you shamed them. You are a disgrace to the membership of this place; you are a disgrace to the front bench of the Liberal Party. You ought to be censured, and you will be.",58
117,Mr MCGAURAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"No amount of bluff and bluster will cover up the paucity of the censure motion before the House, nor cover up the basest political motives behind it. This House should concern itself with one set of documents only-the sensitive and secret letters attached to the Fergie report. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) protected, in a way the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) did not, their security. He guaranteed that they were not read by him or by anybody else. The only censure this House should concern itself with is that relating to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs for his incompetence in handling these documents, the most sensitive documents imaginable, in that they were sent around in such a careless fashion. Surely they demanded a courier service of the best kind-not being plonked, as they say, with Ansett mail. Anybody who uses the airlines' postage services knows that they are not entirely responsible. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is the guilty culprit in all of this. The honourable member for Barker protected the sanctity of those secret letters, and nobody from the government side can dispute that. You have not produced any evidence, apart from a series of assertions and allegations, that the honourable member for Barker read those sensitive letters. Quite the opposite is the case; the honourable member for Barker protected them. In any speech in the censure motion, the government has totally failed to substantiate charges against the member for Barker. The first count, if we were to accept it in those terms, is for misleading the House on the source of the sensitive documents. The source of the sensitive documents is the minister, and the minister alone. The second aspect of the censure motion is that the member for Barker used the documents in a way which breached the integrity of proceedings before the Federal Court. We have a very rare admission from the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that he did not disclose all of the documents during that Federal Court hearing. The minister has not claimed privilege for those documents, so how can you now say that, apart from the sensitive letters, those other documents are so secret and so important to national security that they should never be released by the member for Barker? You did not claim privilege in a court of law for those documents. Rather, you did not make them available for discovery. I am quite sure that the proceedings of the Federal Court will take this matter further and that it will be very interested to know why the minister now stands angry before the legislature because some documents are circulating the community that he previously had not made available for discovery. We have an incompetent minister. On any criteria, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is quite incompetent. All of this sanctimonious and pious bleating is not going to cover up the fact that the overall health and living conditions of Aborigines generally throughout Australia have deteriorated not only in his five years but over the last 12 years of a Labor administration. The government has a problem: it cannot send in the Federal Police to harangue the member for Barker and seize the documents, as it tried with the leaked budget submission documents of some weeks ago. Instead, the government is trying to use the forms of this place and its numbers to trump up some charges and carry a censure motion. It somehow believes that the member for Barker will be blackmailed into doing its bidding. Concern yourselves with one set of documents only: the sensitive letters. They were not read and they were returned to the minister in this very chamber. This censure motion is a pretence; a device by the members of the government to manipulate the proceedings here to suit their own political agenda and to hit at the member for Barker, who gets under their skin because he has credibility with the environmental groups and with rural Australia that they only dream of. The environmentalists know that he is a practical environmentalist. He is not an urban theorist like so many of you. This man has actually done something for the environment. He aggravates you, doesn'the? We must not forget this personal dimension. Mr Reith-They hate success.",58
118,Mr MCGAURAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"They hate success. Labor can never help itself. It always has to tear down the public's popular figures because it has no-one to compete. There is no doubt that the viciousness and the personal attacks are their stock-in-trade or routine, as the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) would have us believe. With the Minister for Finance, every dirty trick imaginable is routine. The breathtaking hypocrisy with which the government comes to this censure motion leaves even those of us who have witnessed a few stunned. The Minister for Finance and those before hirri tried to portray the use of a document' misdirected to the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) as part and parcel of the rough. and tumble of politics. What they forgot to remind the House is that the member for Banks boasted to the media that he misled a female staffer from the Liberal Party who came around to collect the document According to press reports, when . she came around to collect the document he said to her, 'It must be in the fax machine.' She went up to the fax machine and, of course, he had already collected it and had it on his desk. Where are the ethics there? He lied, and he lied for a political purpose.",59
119,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Order! I remind the member for Gippsland that he pulled up the minister' earlier about that.,59
120,Mr MCGAURAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"I will withdraw that, but the member for Banks, who boasted to the media about his deception, carried it beyond the ordinary political rough and tumble. Talking of stolen material, did it not make you weep tears of shame and suffer from embarrassment when they spoke about stolen material? After it had been stolen, it was hand delivered to the member for Barker's office with his name on the outside. You want to talk about stolen material? What about the burglary of the Roy Morgan organisation, which allowed you to canvass all over Australia? Why do you not send in the police there? Where are the copyright issues there? Where is the Solicitor-General now? It is always one rule for everybody else and another rule for the hard men and women of the Labor Party. But this time you have overplayed your hand, and you have revealed yourselves to be political opportunists who will seize on anything to distort the picture. The sloppiness and incompetence of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is laid bare for all in. this parliament to witl').ess. The minister cannot even get his story right. He stood before this parliament half an hour ago and claimed that the envelope in which the sensitive lettersthe attachment to the Fergie report-were contained were sealed, covered and could only be broken into as part of a larger box. It is quite the contrary. The statutory declaration by Mary Malaris, the administrative officer responsible for sending the box to Parliament House, states: I am not sure whether the envelope was sealed or not. In his contribution, the Minister for Finance continued the misrepresentations when he said that the envelope containing the sensitive and secret letters was marked in addition to being sealed. Ms Malaris went on to say: I am. not certain whether I marked the outside the envelope or not. . This document containing this very se.cretive and sensitive material was carelessly and negligently handled. The member for Barker received this material not of his bidding. did not deceive anybody like the member for Banks or the Labor Party apparatchiks did regard to the Morgan poIling material. It landed on his doorstep. There is no use in your trying to portray member for Barker as trafficking in sensitive documents. You need concern yourself only with the sensitive letters. He will deal with the other material in that box as he sees Do you stick the Solicitor-General onto every journalist who receives a leak from a governdebate ment department? No. The Federal Police? No. It is just when members of the opposition are involved that you send in either a law enforcement agency or the legal henchmen. The member never read the secret letters, and the remainder of the material should not, and we will not allow it to, be equated with the sensitive letters attached to the Fergie report; There is a clear differentiation between the two. You have totally failed to substantifor ate your case in regard to the sensitive letters. This is purely and simply an attempt to attack the member for Barker, to intimidate him and to bluff him into revealing documents for which he will decide their future destination. I presume that we are moving onto question time at the end of this censure motion. If not, this has to be seen simply as a political device to divert attention from the Prime Minister's little altar boy.",59
121,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,You shouldn't say that if we have question time.,60
122,Mr MCGAURAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has a lot of answering to do. So, Minister for Finance, we are moving onto question time, are we? .",60
123,Mr BEAZLEY,MEMBER FOR BARKER,Yes.,60
124,Mr MCGAURAN,MEMBER FOR BARKER,"There is no doubt about the government: it will do only what it thinks is in its own political interest. What hypocrisy by the government in trying to appeal to some higher notion of conduct in public life. Fancy of government members trying to lecture anybody, let alone the opposition, about the ethics of parliamentary behaviour. They have only the most base political motives. They will exploit every possible situation to their He own perceived political benefit. This government has no morals and no in standing in the community. There are a great many issues that we want to pursue, and you take up the time of the parliament with the patently trumped up charges that are only designed to attack the member for Barker in a very personal sense. You will always individually and personally attack members of the fit. Liberal and National parties. You know no other practice of politics. You will never issues and policies on their merits. You will always attack individuals. That is how you operate outside of the parliament, and that is quite obviously how you operate inside this parliament. This censure motion is a joke. You have not, apart from all of the generalisations and all of the contrived outrage, lan.ded a single punch on the member for Barker. You have not in any way established that the member Barker has committed any misdemeanour, let alone an indictable offence. Quite the opposite: the member for Barker is perfectly entitled to deal with those documents as he sees fit-apart from the sensitive letters. You will have to answer why those documents were not discoverable in the Federal Court. If Tickner, R. E. they are so privileged, why did you not claim that privilege in the Federal Court? The member for Barker enjoys the respect and support of the federal National and Liberal parties. Nothing you do in this parliament by way of trumped up charges will diminish his standing.

127,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think so, Mr Speaker. Packer, Mr K.",61
128,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications. I ask the Minister: given that Mr Kerry Packer has now stated that the Prime Minister's allegations of a secret deal with me regarding media policy are' categorically untrue' , is the minister now  truth?",61
129,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think we have every right to ask questions about this issue when the Leader of the Opposition has had so much trouble owning up to who he has met and what he has been talking about. This could be settled very simply. The Leader of the Opposition could tell us what he has said to Mr Packer and he could tell us what Senator Alston has been saying to PBL' s executives in his many conversations with PBL' s executives over the last few months. He could also  any reasonMr Tim Fischer-I rise to a point of order. The minister was asked by the Leader of the Opposition a very direct and clear cut question. He is not allowed to go on a major bushwalk. He ought to come back and give a direct answer in respect of the Leader of the Opposition's question.,62
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! As far as the standing orders are concerned, the honourable the Leader of the National Party has raised a very valid point and I invite the minister to come to the substance of the question.",62
131,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We do not disclose our sources, but I tell you what, we can ask the Leader of the Opposition a question. We can ask wheth that a Howard government would relax or abolish or weaken the cross-media ownership rules.",62

137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition!,62
138,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why should I?,62
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because the standing orders say so, that's why you should.",62
140,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen reports that the Trade Practices Commission can ensure the diversity and plurality of media ownership? What is the government's response to these reports?,62
141,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the honourable member for Moreton can I say that I have seen statements from members of the opposition indicating that they would seem to be relying on the Trade Practices Act to ensure that there was plurality and diversity in the media, to quote the expression used by the opposition communications spokesman, Senator Alston. In so doing, it is quite clear that the opposition has no regard for the cross-media rules. The disregard for them was shown",62
142,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I thought ministers were supposed to be asked questions dealing with areas of their responsibility. As far as I am aware, the Trade Practices Commission is within the ambit of the Attorney-General. I am just wondering in what way the Treasurer is getting into the ambit of the Minister for Communications or the Attorney-General?",62
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I understand that the Trade Practices Commission comes under the Treasurer's responsibility and, to that extent, the Treasurer is in order.",62
144,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is absolutely right, Mr Speaker; it has been for years. As I was saying, the disregard for the cross-media rules was shown in the comments of the shadow Treasurer as reported in the Herald Sun on 18 February when he said: The cross-media ownership rules are designed, I think, to make media owners cross, but having little other discernible effect. That demonstrates what the opposition thinks about the cross-media rules. Essentially, what we seem to be seeing from the opposition is that it would rely on the Trade Practices Act as being sufficient to ensure that we had plurality and diversity of media ownership--in particular to deal with the possibility of Mr Packer owning Fairfax as well as Channel 9. This morning on ABC radio the shadow Treasurer was interviewed and he was asked this direct question:  and Channel 9? He responded: Look, what we have always said is we want strong anti-monopolistic laws run by the Trade Practices Commission and we have always been opposed to market monopolisation-always, always. The journalist, Cathy Job, asked: Would that be a market monopolisation? Senator Alston said: Well, that is what you have the Trade Practices Commission there for. He went on with a bit of a diatribe against the Prime Minister. Then he came back and said: You give it to independent people and you let them make the decisions. That has always been our policy and it always will be.  own both Fairfax and Channel 9?', the shadow Treasurer is clearly saying, 'We would rely on the Trade Practices Act.' In that context, it is interesting to see what the chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Professor Fels, has said about this issue. He has already said that the Trade Practices Act  controlling both Fairfax and Channel 9. The Australian of 18 February, in an article headed 'Control bid for newspapers ""too big a risk for democracy''', states: The chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Professor Alan Fels, said there were no real  Fairfax. The Trade Practices Act was designed to limit concentration of ownership of any particular market, he said, but newspapers and television were  effectively be treated as a new player in the newspaper market. ""Generally speaking, the history ofTPC laws has been that television and newspapers have been regarded as being separate markets,"" Mr Fels said. ""Accordingly, there is a reasonable likelihood would be regarded as a new entrant to the newspaper market."" What is clearly being said there by the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission is that TV and newspapers are separate markets. Tests of concentration of ownership under the Trade Practices Act would address these markets separately, so there is no real trade practices hurdle to Packer controlling Fairfax. When the shadow Treasurer is asked the  to own both Fairfax and ChanneI9?', he says, 'That's for the Trade Practices Commission to decide.' But what he is really saying is yes, because that is what the Trade Practices Commission chairman has already said would be likely to be the case. In other words, the opposition has a policy  9 and Fairfax, and that has been the hidden message so far. It has not been said explicitly but it comes through quite clearly when you look at what Professor Fels has said and when you take away the fig leaf of the Trade Practices Commission-which is what it is. It is being held there to say, 'Yes, we'd go through the proper process. We'd have the Trade Practices Commission. We wouldn't allow any sort of deal to be done. We'd go through an independent process.' But the chairman of that independent process has already said that that would most likely result in Packer being allowed to own Fairfax as well as Channel 9. Mr Speaker, we clearly have an opposition which has now made it quite clear to the Australian public that its policy is to allow Mr Packer to own Channel 9 and Fairfax. Of course, in so doing, it is absolutely playing in ",62
145,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is untrue, Ralph.",63
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor constantly runs a commentary when ministers are on their feet. Can I suggest very strongly that he not do so in the future.,63
147,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There is a responsibility of ministers he in this place to tell the truth. When ministers start rewriting our policy, that is Goebbels' principle and I believe I am entitled",63
148,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"OrderlResume your seat. That is not a point of order and I warn the member for O'Connor for taking such spurious points of order. Packer, Mr K.",64
149,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my. question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Minister, yesterday you said that the.Â· Prime Minister's claims that senior executives inside the Packer camp had informed him that the Leader of the Opposi change media ownership laws were 'dead right'. If these claims are dead right, as you claim, will you inform the House who these alleged senior executives are? Is it a fact that the senior executives you are referring to are, in fact, Graham Richardson and Peter Barron? If not, who are they?",64
150,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer you to my earlier answer, and I make the point that on five occasions this morning you were asked whether you  anyone else to own a television station and a newspaper in the same market, and on five occasions you walked away from it. That is the point. As the Treasurer pointed out, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that he thought that the Trade Practices Act should be relied upon, and that the opposition supported tighter trade practices laws to enforce these rules instead of the cross-media ownership rules. . Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Earlier, in relation to the last attempted evasion by the minister, you directed him-and he is getting his instructions from the Leader of the House now-to answer the question. The question is very simply this: is he referring to Peter Barron and Graham Richardson? If not, who?",64
151,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Whilst the honourable deputy leader does draw my attention to what I said earlier, I also point out that ministers have on various occasionsMr Downer---':'""You are changing the ruling.",64
152,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am not changing anything. I. am saying that, if you read House of Representatives Practice, the chair has some limited discretion in what it can ask ministers to do, but I would ask the minister to be relevant to the question;",64
153,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point I make, Mr SPEAKER Mr Costello-No, be relevant.",64
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister has the call. You will listen to the answer. . Mr LEE-The point I make is that the Leader of the Opposition, in his many comments on this issue, has said that his private and his public comments are the same. Therefore, Mr Howard has obviously told Mr Packer in his telephone conversations and Senator Alston has obviously told PBL and its executives the same things they are saying in public-that is, 'I will rely only on the Trade Practices Act.' That is what you said this morning on AM. This is what I find ironic: you were the shadow Attorney-General who opposed a tightening of the Trade Practices Act and the Leader of the Opposition was the person who watered down the Trade Practices Act. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is on the question of relevance and I take a lead from what you have already said. The fact isÂ· that this minister is blatantly flouting your direction and your request to him. Furthermore, Mr Speaker, as part of my submission to you, the fact is that you have wider discretion than you are prepared to exercise. You have the authority and the support of this parliament to require ministers to desist. If the government does not like it, then it can take the matter up with you at that point in time. As previous clerks have said publicly, you have a wider discretion than that which you have been prepared to exercise. You should exercise it. Mr SPEf\KER-What I am relying on is the section in House of Representatives Practice which quotes former speakers as having said just the opposite to what the honourable member for Flinders has put to me. Prescriptions",64
155,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. I ask the minister: what has been the impact of the introduction of the 20-day rule for the provision of prescriptions?,64
156,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am sure members would be aware that the pharmaceutical benefits safety net provides very significant financial protection to people who use medicines in quantity. Mr Bruce Scott interjecting,65
157,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Maranoa.,65
158,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Butwe were very concerned before the end of last year that we had seen very considerable increases in what was clearly hoarding. People, when they approached the November-December period when the safety net issue was raised, were going in and getting repeat prescriptions more frequently than was necessary for their illnesses. They were hoarding those medicines because they wanted to save money and, as a result, had material in their cupboards that often would degrade and therefore would not be useful for the illness or disease that they had. It also posed a substantial risk to other members of families, particularly young members who might be able to get hold of such large quantities of medicines. I am sure members will be aware that we introduced a so-called 20-day rule as at 1 November last year, so that the resupply period for drugs relating to those long-term illnesses was some 20 days. They were designed to last the patient a month, so there was not really any significant problems for patients. In any case, the pharmacists could override the 20-day rule if they thought it was necessary in the interests of the patients. I am very pleased to inform members that we have already seen a very significant reduction in the cost of the PBS because of this rule and some other changes that we brought in last year. I hope all members will recognise that it has not been at the expense of patient care but rather it has reduced hoarding and the dangers associated with that. In fact, since November last year the number of prescriptions that have been dispensed is down 1.2 million prescriptions as at the same period last year. That has resulted in savings to Australian taxpayers of some $30 million just in that very short period. Not only that, it poses less of a risk. I would like to congratulate pharmacists on that achievement. They have worked very closely with government to ensure that significant saving and to reduce the danger to people hoarding medicines. I would like to say to the doctors in the community that we would like to cooperate with them, too. What we have seen, despite that very significant reduction in the number of prescriptions and in the cost to the PBS, is an increase in the cost of drugs that doctors are prescribing. Sadly, some of them are trying to pervert the process of generic substitution. So I urge them to take a leaf from the book of the pharmacists and to look after their patients and the Australian taxpayers at the same time. Packer, Mr K.",65
159,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Last night on PM you stated that you were aware of information about an alleged secret deal between the Leader of the Opposition and Mr Kerry Packer in relation to the future of the cross-media rules that was given to the Prime Minister by someone in the Packer camp who is absolutely in a position to know. Given the utmost seriousness of that accusation, your accusation, I ask a direct question: what is the unspecified information that has been given to the Prime Minister?",65
160,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the National Party has misquoted me. I suggest the next time he asks a question like this he quote me accurately.,65

162,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left. World War II: Campaign Awards,65
163,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel explain the significance for the Australian community of the Prime Minister's recent announcement concerning World War II campaign awards?  MCEwen for his question and, indeed, his interest in defence matters generally. Last week the Prime Minister announced that the defenders of Darwin during the Japanese bombing in World War II and previously unrecognised Australian servicemen who took part in the Syrian campaign in World War II were to receive campaign awards for their service to Australia during World War II. Recognition of these campaigns follows recommendations from the government's committee of inquiry into defence awards which reported to my predecessor,Senator Faulkner, last year. Veterans of the Syrian campaign will receive the Africa Star and those who defended Darwin will receive the 1939-45 Star. I sure all members of this House will applaud that result. I am sure that allÂ· honourable members agree that, in this year, the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, as we celebrate the ending of that war and victory, these two groups of Australian veterans will at last receive their due recognition. The Syrian campaign was a short and bitter campaign against primarily the Vichy French involving predominantly Australian forces but also including British, free French and Indian troops. Most of these troops had previously served in North Africa elsewhere. However, a small proportion of the Syrian veterans did not serve west of the Suez and thus had failed to qualify for the Africa Star, despite their direct participation in the allied campaign in this part of the world. I am pleased to inform the House that, with the approval of Her Majesty the Queen and the issue of the Africa Star, these veterans will receive that long overdue recognition. All Australians I think are now aware of the bravery shown by those in Darwin during one of the only times that our country's soil has been the subject of attack. Those stationed in Darwin lived under harsh operational field conditions-with isolation, enemy submarines and aircraft patrolling the waters into Darwin, and uncertain supply routes. They were subject to a total of 63 air raids which took place against Darwin from 19 February 1942 until 12 November 1943, and a further four against other targets in the Northern Territory, leaving a total of 261 dead and 413 injured. The committee of inquiry drew parallels between Darwin and the Battle of Britain and the Battle of Malta. Veterans of the Darwin campaign have been seeking this due recognition for 50 years. As is the case with the Syrian campaign, Her Majesty the Queen has, after requests from the government, agreed to extend eligibility for the 1939-45 Star so they will finally receive it. My latest advice is, given the significance of these medals, a great many will be issued by ANZAC Day so that those veterans concerned can proudly march with their comrades in remembering those who fought and fell 50 years ago to save this country from tyranny. Packer, Mr K.",65
164,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Minister, given your evasive answers, do you stand by your claims that you made on PM last night or not? Do you have evidence or not, or are you in fact withdrawing the claim that there was some information, some evidence-yes or no?",66

168,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Assistant Treasurer. Has the Assistant Treasurer seen reports that some retailers charge their customers a fee to use electronic funds transfer for EFTPOS facilities? Can the minister inform the House of any actions he intends to take in relation to those charges?,66
169,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I have seen a story in today's edition of the Australian which reports that some retailers are charging their customers for the use of their EFTPOS facilities. The community is rightly concerned about banks imposing fees and charges on their account customers, and I think there will be similar concerns about fees on EFTPOS transactions. This matter is very relevant to the issues currently being examined by the Prices Surveillance Authority in its inquiry into bank charges. EFTPOS facilities have spread rapidly in Australia, largely because consumers welcome the convenience of ready access to cash. EFTPOS also makes it much easier to operate a bank account. In fact, banks use as one of their strong points on fees that EFTPOS is free and therefore banking through EFTPOS is free. There are two issues here: firstly, where retailers use EFTPOS where the customer makes a purchase only and, secondly, where retailers give cash but no goods are bought. Both of these instances are of concern to consumers. What I want to know is whether there is a cost that retailers are currently absorbing and why some of those retailers, and only some of them, are passing it on. What we want consumers to know is what they are being asked to pay and whether those charges are soundly based. Because of its relevance to the current inquiry, I have today asked the authority to examine the issue of EFTPOS fees imposed by retailers when it reports to me on fees and charges on bank accounts.",66

174,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know it is of interest to you, Mr Speaker, because of your previous work on this. As I was saying, as this will involve additional work I have agreed to give the authority an extra month to bring its report to me. It will now report on 19 June. Minister for Communications",67
175,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My. question is addressed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Minister, in July last year you said, 'I'm not sure I have demonstrated yet that I'm good enough to be a minister handling difficult issues.' As it is now clear  and the Leader of the Opposition is unsubstantiated, as it is now clear that you cannot even stand by your own claims on PM last night and as it is now clear there obviously never was any deal, do you now have the courage to apologise?",67
176,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made it very clear this morning on AM, we know what the deal is because he has said that you will rely on only the Trade Practices Act to enforce cross-media ownership rules.",67

180,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me just remind the House of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said this morning. The transcript states: Costello-Look, what we've always said is that we want stronger anti-monopolistic laws run by the Trade Practices Commission. That is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said this morning and, as the Treasurer  can buy Fairfax. Mr Rocher- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is that the minister is indulging in tedious repetition. He has already given us that answer. The second point of order is that he is not relevant and not answering the question.",67

182,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister is in order. He has the call.,67
183,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that he wants to rely on the strong anti-monopolistic laws of the Trade Practices Commission. He was the shadow Attorney-General who opposed Michael Duffy's attempts to tighten the Trade Practices Act. He was the one who tightened the law, and John Howard, the Leader of the that Opposition, in 1977 in the Fraser government was the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs who weakened the Trade Practices Act. So the two people who are most responsible for weakening the Trade Practices Act are the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is clear that the day this parliament repeals the cross-media ownership rules and relies on the Trade Practices Act is the day  papers and television stations in the same markets. That is the reason why this man, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on five occasions avoided saying whether it was undesirable or not for one person to own newspapers and television stations in the same market.

I thought it was to a point of order, but he subsequently moved for the suspension of standing orders. That is in order to do so. Mr Costello-I have moved my motion. Are you going to take the suspension? No?",68

Isn't it interesting! On the first question of the day we get the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) up here about letters that have been mislaid and we can go on with a debate, three speakers on each side, but in relation to the great issue of Australian politics today, we are not allowed to debate it in this House. We are not allowed to debate the fact that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) is an absolute, utter disgrace. You Orders are humiliated today. This is the minister who was asked before whether he stood by allegations he made on PM last night, and he cannot answer. He cannot answer whether he still stands by something he said at 6 p.m. last night. This is the minister that was drawn into the web of deceit of a lying Prime Minister. I will tell you something, minister, you do not ever want to get in behind him, because if you get in behind him you will be as exposed as you are now. It is no secret you are known throughout Australia as Little Sir Echo. Why you are called Little Sir Echo is that you wake up every morning, you read the newspapers, you see what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said and you go out and you echo it. You echo it on the news media, you echo it on the television, but the fact is you have no idea what you are saying. You have no idea of the allegations you are making. The Prime Minister has dug you right in in relation to a secret deal. You go on PM and say he is dead right, that you have got it out of the Packer camp, that you have executives that will say it, and you cannot come up with a single name. In fact, to your absolute humiliation the person who is supposed to have given his executives this information denied it-denied the whole thing. He said  out the statement. You are relying on executives whom you cannot name, in conversations that you cannot date, the substance of which you cannot explain to pass on informa Where do you stand today? You stand absolutely humiliated. If you had a shred of credibility, if you had a shred of decency, you would have stood up and apologised. You would have said, 'I was misled by the Prime Minister. I got it wrong. I apologise to this House.' I will tell you something: unless you have done that by the end of your speech to this House today, you are somebody who can have no credibility whatsoever. You are absolutely washed up. It was interesting, was it not, watching the Prime Minister standing on the steps of the presidential palace in Singapore? You could not help but feel embarrassed for the Prime Minister of Singapore, Prime Minister Goh, looking at somebody whom he obviously thought should have been a statesman but had turned maniac standing on the steps of the presidential palace. Was he talking about trade interests in APEC? Was he talking about Singaporean-Australian relations? No, he was talking about grubby little allegations that you cannot substantiate back here in Australia. Then the merchant of venom moved from Singapore across to Bonn. It was not enough to have engaged in the smear in Singapore. Oh, no, he engaged in abuse in Bonn and returned to the whole subject again, trafficking across the globe in falsehoods, in a tissue of lies that you left holding the baby here in Australia are severely embarrassed by and cannot substantiate. Mr Reith-He is the baby.",68
189,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,"As the Manager of Opposition Business said, you are the baby. It is a situation where the baby-sitter has turned into the baby himself, where it is selfminding, where you have been left without adult supervision. Mr Reith-There is nobody minding the baby.",69
190,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,"That is the humiliation and the embarrassment-there is no adult supervision for you in this country at the moment. If you want to engage in secret deals, the person you really ought to be looking at is the President of the ALP because he has been criticising your own media ownership laws. You have to read the newspapers. He is saying that they are not working, that they have not been operating in practice. He has been saying that the crossmedia ownership laws are piecemeal. Do you know what, Mr Speaker? I have a terrible feeling that maybe the President of the ALP is in the conspiracy with the Leader of the Opposition. MaybeÂ· he is part of it, too, because this is the way these people work in doctored unsubstantiated allegations. All you do is you pick up something in the newspaper and it may be an honest expression of views, it may actually be an observation of fact, it may actually be the kind of thing you say yourself, that the cross-media ownership laws are not working and they need to be reviewed. But it is not enough for you to deal in the substance. It is not enough for you to say, 'Here is a substantive argument, here is a policy.' Oh, no, that is not enough. What you need to do with that is turn it into a secret deal, a secret cabal. Do you know the thing that always amazes me about the Prime Minister? What amazes me about the Prime Minister of this country is that he always accuses other people of the standards that heÂ· observes. That is the absolute shameful thing. He cannot contemplate anybody in relation to media policy actually making a decision on their merits. He cannot contemplate that. In his world, in that closed world of fantasy and fiction that he half inhabits in a twilight zone, favours are bought and sold. That is the only rationale for making a decision. . In the face of every concrete piece of evidence it must be that there is a deal. Because that is the only way that. he works himself, everybody must do it. Because that was the wayÂ·he worked at Kirribilli and that was the way we got the cross-media ownership laws in the first place, it must be.",69
191,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,That is the way you gave Alexander the leadership.,70
192,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,"The fact is, Sir Billy Bunter, routine Beazley-you just calm down-people do not all abide by the same standards as this Prime Minister. I have to tell you that I am very proud the Leader of the Opposition does not. I am very proud of that. It would be a bad day for Australia if we were operating according to the Prime Minister's shabby, grubby little standards .. I do not know what he thinks he is doing in Germany. Did he go across to wage war on Kerry Packer? Is that why he went? Did he stand on the steps of the presidential palace in order to argue about cross-media laws? Did he gather all of those journalists into the back of the plane and issue his press releases by confetti? Is that the purpose of his visit? The fact is that the Prime Minister's outbreaks are getting closer and closer together. In this half real twilight zone that he inhabits, the distincMinister tion between allegation and fact is rapidly disappearing. It is about time that we got some answers. It is about time that this debate was brought on. It is about time that you be made to account for your statements. It is about time that, in the absence of adult supervision, you grow up. It is about time that you come in and either apologise and unreservedly withdraw or put it down chapter and verse so that you can be held to account and the Australian public can get some value and some answers out of you as a minister.",70

196,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,It is the time of the Leader of the National Party that is being hindered.,70
197,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I second the motion. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been hawking around this country-and now Singapore and Germany-a fairytale with regard to an alleged deal. In accordance with parliamentary convention and tradition, there is just one place he should have been hawking this tale, if he had had the courage-that is, in here last week, at the dispatch box, eye ball to eye ball with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). In the two appearances he deigned to give us last week, did the Prime Minister have the courage to stand up and make those allegations at the dispatch box where they should have been made if they were going to stand up at all? Of course he did not. He was not man enough to look the Leader of the Opposition eye ball to eye ball and make those allegations. He was not able to produce one scintilla or one piece of evidence, nor did he seek to table a piece of evidence. Both the Prime and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) have the ability, in accordance with the standing orders, to use parliamentary privilege to table papers, documents and evidence which might have backed up this spurious claim. The truth of the matter is, as we established last week and as we have established again this week, that there is no evidence, because there is no deal. There is absolutely no deal between the coalition and any particular media proprietor. There is no deal between the Leader of the Opposition  I want to say of this minister, as he prepares to reply, that he tried yet another trick in question time today. It was a very nasty sleight of hand. I thought better of him. I know he came into this House in the class of '84, in the distinguished company of you, Mr Speaker, the member for Hume(Mr Sharp), me and others. I actually thought better of him. He used a trick of the trade in a way which was totally misleading and incorrect. Let us look at the transcript of PM, which I have and he also has. The transcript states: LEE: I, along with a number of other people, are certainly aware of information which we believe links Mr Howard to the allegations which the Prime Minister has put forward Opposition members-Where is it?",70
198,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,"We still have not seen it. The transcript continues: JOURNO: Have you that information? LEE: I think it's all in the papers this morning. You don't have to go far to find out what that JOURNO: Is this information that has come from the Packer camp? LEE: That's dead right. That is the exact quote that the minister ducked and wimped out of when I asked my question earlier in question time. That is why you are paying the price. I have read from exact transcript, which is in my hand. When it comes to trust, I will put. this man, Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong, streets ahead of either the minister laws? or the Prime Minister. He has been around. He has a past and so does the Prime Minister. I would just like to draw your attention sitionbriefly to a bit of that past. In his book on contemporary Australian political history, Paul Kelly wrote some very interesting comments about media policy. Paul Kelly said: Keating, with Hawke's acquiescence hijacked media policy ... and laid the basis for Rupert Murdoch's takeover of the Herald and Weekly Times group. Kelly continued with a lengthy discussion of thing. media policy. He described the final outcome of Labor's policy as: . .. a complex media policy which could endorsed on intellectual grounds, supported by Labor PartyIn essence, it was a policy which favoured certain operators. He went on to contrast that with the view of the present Leader of the Opposition. He said: Howard had told Murdoch at the time that opposition would remain neutral and allow market to decide the result. In other words, back there then and here the Leader of the Opposition's hands are clean. There is no evidence. There is no deal. This minister should now apologise in absolute terms for the scurrilous allegation he made and been a party to with the Prime Minister. You might send a message to the Prime Minister: 'For God's sake, drop this subject in Germany before you destroy our export efforts in the CeBIT trade fair.' That will just remind him why he went to Germany in the first place. You should apologise here and now in the course of the next 10 minutes.",71

The Leader of the Opposition put out a press statement yesterday reminding us all of what he said in 1987. He seems to think that, because he had a position the in 1987 that cross-media ownership was against the public interest, that in some way the excuses his position in 1995.

205,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,The opportunity has been taken by two speakers on my left to put a be case. The Minister for Communications and the the Arts is now responding. He will be heard in silence.,71
206,Mr LEE,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,"The Leader of the Opposition's position in 1987 was that cross-media ownership was against the public interest. It is just as much against the public interest in 1995. the He says he supports greater diversity of the ownership, but the only way he wants to protect it is through a trade practices act. The now, Weekend Australian of 18 February reports Professor Allan Fels, the current Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission as saying that 'there would be no real trade practices hurdles  it clear that the policy position which the Leader of the Opposition advocates would result in no protection for diversity of ownership, no protection for diversity of opinion, plurality of opinion of the newspapers. That makes it clear that sole reliance by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on the Trade Practices Act  Nine and the Fairfax Group.",71
207,Mr REID,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,Where is the deal?,72
208,Mr LEE,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,"The member opposite says, 'Where is the deal?' What I say is: how does the Leader of the Opposition explain to fact that in 1987 he said he supported the of the Trade Practices Act, and today he says he relies on the Trade Practices Act, but in 1991 the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) circulated a petition that said: 'We the undersigned members of this parliament oppose the sale of the Fairfax Group to any individual or consortium that would result in greater concentration of ownership'? For some reason in 1991 the Connolly petition, which the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition signed, said that they were against Fairfax being owned by   they justify the fact that they now think they can rely on the Trade Practices Act for Mr Packer's acquisition. It all came out of the bag this morning when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition went on the AM program and was asked this question:  Fairfax and Channel 9? Costello-What we have always said is that we want strong antimonopolistic laws run by the Trade Practices Commission. We all know what that means. It is the secret  opposition says, 'We are the ones who always want strong anti-monopolistic laws,' but this is the man who watered down the Trade Practices Act in 1977. Mr Downer-Where is the present evidence? Don't go back to the past.",72

211,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,Order! The member for Mayo does not enjoy the same protection he once did.,72
212,Mr LEE,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,"This morning, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said the Liberals are the ones who want strong and anti-monopolistic laws. But he is the person who, under the Fraser government, moved to weaken the us the merger provision-section 50-from domiuse nance to a substantial lessening of competition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was the shadow Attorney-General who opposed Michael Duffy's attempts to tighten the Trade Practices Act. It is clear that, if the Leader of the Opposition had his way and we relied solely on the Trade Practices Act, Mr Packer could purchase Fairfax the next day. Is it any wonder that we have some concerns about what the opposition's view might be on this? Let us look at what Mr Howard said yesterday. The transcript of the interview states: is Howard: I think it's desirable to have as much diversity as possible. Journalist: And would it be a lack of diversity to have ownership of a newspaper and a television station in one market? Howard: It would depend on the size of the market and how he defined it. Allan Fels says there is nothing we could do  he owns televisions in the same market. Mr Howard yesterday was slipping and sliding. He was asked the same question five times and refused to say whether he thought it was  for that matter, to own newspapers and television stations in the same market. Mr Costello, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, was asked the same five questions today. He was asked on five occasions whether it  or otherwiseMr Costello-Five occasions!",72
213,Mr LEE,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,"You go back and read the transcript. On five occasions you dodged the question, 'Is it undesirable for one person to own a television station and a newspaper in the same market?' It has certainly been made very clear that if the opposition had its way, by relying solely on the Trade Practices Act,  mulate a greater concentration of media ownership. What this is really all about is the allegation by those opposite that in some way there vendetta against the Packer camp. That is allegation the shadow spokesman, Senator Alston, makes. They claim there is a vendetta  were favourable to John Howard. It is alleged that the government now has a vendetta  allegation is to ask: how come the governand  ber, three months before he went on A Curcode, rent Affair? It was this government that said, 'We will reject monopoly rights in the roll out of cable around the country.' Who was who was prepared to support the Packer decision? Surprise, surprise; it was Senator Alston and the opposition. The party representing free enterprise was saying that we should be giving greater consideration to franchises. because, in Senator clean? Alston's words, they have worked well in Britain and they have worked well in the United States. So your spokesman on communications said that at the very time we are introducing greaterÂ· competition in aviation and telecommunications, the Liberals-the party of free enterprise-says it wants new monopoly rights to clog up competition in society. At the same time, in November, it was  and Mr Murdoch when they asked for closed access--controlled or managed access-for use of the cable. This government believed that it was important to have open access on the cable. If we want to get investment into will do that. the content on cable and ensure that the best of our film makers and software providers are putting together the services that will be used on cable, we must have open access. It was agreed to. certainly clear that Senator Alston was saying that there should have been a longer period of exclusivity. At the same time, he was writing press releases for Mr Downer, saying there should have been a shorter period of exclusivity. But Alston is on the record as saying there should have been a longer period of exclusivity on cable. What the government makes clear is that we will stand by the cross-media ownership rules is a because we think it is important that we the protect diversity of ownership. What Mr Howard is saying is that his private views are the same as hisÂ· public views. What are his public views? His public views are that we should only rely on the Trade Practices Act. Allan Fels says that that means that Mr Packer or anyone else can own riewspapers television stations in the same market. you are really saying is, 'Here's the ladies and gentlemen, if you want to buy newspapers and television in the same market read our lips-we will only rely on it the Trade Practices Act.' That is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said on AM this morning. That is the secret code signal  to everyone else out there. Mr Lindsay-Why doesn't Howard come",72
214,Mr LEE,MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS,"As the member for Herbert said, why does John Howard not tell us what he  Leader of the Opposition not tell us whether  government would give consideration to relaxing or abolishing the cross-media ownership rules? What this side of the House has made clear is that we will stand by the crossthis media ownership rules because we think an important principle for mediaÂ· ownership in Australia is that we maintain as much diversity of ownership as possible. That will happen only if we stand by the cross-media ownership rules. That is why this side of the House",73

218,Mr CLEARY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, on 21 September 1994 the Leader of the National Party asked the following question of you: . . . I ask whether you are aware of an interruption by a member of this House to the proceedings when the Prime Minister of Ireland was speaking. For the benefit of the House, would you clarify your jurisdiction, which is jointly held with the President of the Senate, over the Great Hall of the parliament ... I was the person referred to in that question, although I was not named. I am quite happy to accept that I was-I spoke to the Prime Minister the day after. We have had a censure today of the member for Barker over a particularly sensitive issue. The question of the Leader of the National Party was based on the premise or the assumption that there was an impropriety in my action and that you may have had the ability to redress that impropriety. In the same vein, on the basis of what has happened today, I ask you to advise the House, if the member for Barker's impropriety is serious, and given that there was a censure motion against him I presume it is, and if that means that we have damaged the relationship between the federal parliament and the Aboriginal people--of course, you as the Speaker have under your jurisdiction the responsibility to uphold the dignity of the parliament; that is in the standing orderswhether what the member for Barker has done has damaged the dignity of the House and damaged the relations between this parliament and Aboriginal people and whether an apology to the Aboriginal people might be warranted.",75

NA LAND CORPORATION (ATSIC AMENDMENT) BILL 1994 Second reading Debate resumed.",76
224,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"As I indicated when I made an initial ecocontribution to this debate before further at the same business of the House proceeded, I am pleased to have an opportunity to be involved in the debate. I am disappointed, of course, that the circumstances of that opportunity are as they have evolved. Had it not been for the fact that the coalition, in conjunction with the two Greens in the Senate, sought to sabotage this legislation, this bill, which replaces the bill that we previously sent to the Senate, would not have been necessary. I was referring to the amount of time which had been given to debate. I also refer to the amendments that were proposed in that process. In the Senate, for example, 121 amendments were proposed to the legislation. At the end of the Senate's first consideration of the bill, it had agreed to 67 of them, and it had also agreed to one request for an amtlndm-Ilt. The government accepted 21 oftfi6se ';amendments and all of those changes are incorporated in this bill. But let me make it perfectly clear that those people who claim that the original bill therefore was flawed are themselves in error. The essence of that bill was coherent, properly constructed and correctly designed to ensure that it would achieve the objectives which the bill was pursuing. All of those things were elements of that first bill, and they remain elements of this bill. I have very serious doubts about the genuineness of the opposition in connection with its approach to this legislation. I said the initial bill, as is this bill, objectives which have been set. The primary objective is to ensure that land is made available to Aboriginal people who have been most dispossessed, that is, those Aboriginal people who under the Mabo legislation have not been able to establish a continuing association with land over which they could make a legitimate claim. Those Aboriginal people who have been most dispossessed are those people for whom this legislation is particularly designed, and is designed in such a way that after 10 years almost $1.3 billion will be in a fund, the income from which will generate forever into the future and provide continuing funds for the purchase of land for Aboriginal use by the Indigenous Land Corporation. The government's proposal in relation to that was and is that the Indigenous Land Corporation would only be able to make that land available then to corporations themselves. That is, that in the process of building up a stock of land available to Aboriginal people for Aboriginal purposes, it would in effect be locked into the use of those Aboriginal people as a result of it being owned by corporations. If those corporations in turn sought to dispose of that land, they would have to get the permission of the Indigenous Land Corporation-an entirely appropriate procedure. What the opposition wanted was to make provisions whereby the land from the Indigenous Land Corporation could be made available not only to corporations-which would lock it in, preferably for use by Aboriginal people into the future-but also to trusts and individuals. The interesting thing is that the opposition combined with that a provision that the trusts or the individuals could then in turn dispose of that land without any reference to the Indigenous Land Corporation and without its approval. If ever anyone wanted to attempt to sabotage the purpose of this legislation and to build into the arrangements a device which would bring the credibility of the arrangement into serious question, this is an example. I wonder about people who indicate that they have a concern for Aboriginal people and then continue to support and defend propositions is coherent in the of that kind. Another of the proposals from the opposition was that the Indigenous Land Corporation would be required to take into account in a completely unspecified way the educational, health and similar needs of indigenous communities when deciding where to acquire land. That would unnecessarily hamstring the Indigenous Land Corporation and would lay it open to complaint all the time that any of those particular elements had not been suffiit ciently taken into account. In fact it would shift the whole focus of this legislation and the Indigenous Land Corporation from the provision of land, which is fundamental and central to this legislation, to other matters of concern to Aboriginals--of genuine concern, but not necessarily part of this legislation. Another thing that the opposition was proposing was that, when decisions were being made on land acquisition, the Indigenous Land Corporation should give priority to those communities that are the most severely dispossessed. That surprised even Aboriginal people. This is like the question of whether someone can be severely pregnant or partially pregnant. Aboriginal people who are dispossessed are dispossessed per se. Those people who under the Mabo legislation are not able to get access to land as a result of their not being able to prove a continuing association with it-those people who historically have been most dispossessed-are the people whom this legislation was specifically designed for. But to write that into the legislation, to hamstring the Indigenous Land Corporation and to say that that corporation would have to assess relative degrees of dispossession, is absurd in the extreme. It would reduce the flexibility. As I have said, it would hamstring the Indigenous Land Corporation and lay it open to dispute, conflict, litigation and delay. For those reasons we chose not to accept those proposals by the opposition and in the process we have maintained the coherence of this legislation and ensured that it will do what the government and the Aboriginal community seek from it. I refer briefly to a comment in connection with this from Ms Lois o 'Donoghue, the Chairperson of ATSIC, in a media release 9 February this year: ""It is hard to understand how the Senate Select Committeethat is the committee to which was referred by the Senate and which then reported backin its majority report could conclude that there a clear level of Aboriginal support for the ments to the Bill based on the evidence presented to the committee by Aboriginal people,"" Miss O'Donoghue said. ""The majority report represents another example others knowing what is best for Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people supported the proposal by the government and supported the principles which the government sought to enact. Criticism was raised by the shadow minister, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who claimed that consultation by the government had been inadequate. She then suggested that the consultation process undertaken by the Senate select committee had been adequate. When making her contribution to the debate on the second reading she said that when the Senate select committee investigating the land fund bill went around Australia, it talked to, from her memory, 224 Aboriginal people. She said that those people had said, 'We were not consulted. ' Mr Deputy Speaker, 224 Aboriginal people were consulted by that committee out of, I think, 285,000 Aboriginal people in Australia. Certainly, the government did not and could not have consulted individually with 285,000 people, but to suggest that the process of consultation was more adequate and, in a sense, more complete as a result of consultations being conducted with 224 Aboriginal people out of a total Aboriginal population of 285,000 is absurd in the extreme. I want to make a further comment in connection with the debate we had on this land fund bill. In checking back through some of the Hansard records I notice that the shadow minister, the member for Hindmarsh, made some reference to criticisms I had made about her and about her capacity and compeon tence. She made the quite absurd and petty claim that my expressed attitude towards the level of competence that she brought to her job was in some unspecified and strange way a response to some type of criticism that she the legislation had made about me. I would like to advise the member for Hindmarsh that I have been criticised by was experts. I do not include her among them. I amendsubsequently identified what I think the comment probably was, and her comments about me are of no concern to me. I said that the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the of shadow minister, was incompetent. I said that because she is. I said as well that the shadow minister was treated as a joke by the Aboriginal community around Australia. The reason I said that was that she is. I said as well that she had used brave rhetoric when she was appointed as spokesperson for the opposition in connection with Aboriginal affairs. But when the former leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), pulled her into line and said that she would toe the line, she went to water immediately. I said that because she did, because they were the circumstances. I said that she had not consulted with Aboriginal people. I made that claim because it was true, and I made the claim because she had admitted to it. I said that she took advice from TV and not from Aboriginal people. I made that claim, not because of anything she said about me, but because she had admitted that she had listened to the television the previous night and had heard an Aboriginal person. speaking, and that was the level of Aboriginal advice that she had received. I also referred to the fact that she was the adviser to the former Leader of the Opposition when he made that ill-fated safari into Central Australia. She led him to the cliff and took him over it. I think the present Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), needs to be very careful because that is likely to happen to him also. She was, of course, wet-nursed by the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). That was repeated on Monday when questions which, correctly, should have been directed by the shadow minister were being directed by the shadow minister for the environment. She was a disaster for the former Leader of the Opposition; I think she is a disaster waiting happen for the present Leader of the Opposition. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is important for the Aboriginal community that this legislation be passed. If it fails to pass again that provides the government with a further trigger. The Leader of the Opposition has said that if the opposition is elected to government it will introduce the changes provided for in the amendments. (Time expired)",76
225,Mr TUCKEY,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"O'Connor) (6.24 p.m.)The previous speaker, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), in his speech made some remarks about consultation. Of course, the parliament or even the government sees consultation as dealing with a few people. The government's idea of consultation is to talk to Lois O'Donoghue and to that fellow Pearson, who says that he is the Cape York representative but lives in Sydney. The simple fact is that they consult very few people. The inquiry organised by the coalition advertised for persons all around Australia to make submissions. As has been stated, some 200 people turned up to state a view. Of course, there is a more subjective test and that might be a referendum of Aboriginal people on the simple issue of whether they would prefer, under these funding arrangements, to have the right to more individual land ownership. The member for Charlton can come and have a small bet with me on the outcome of that any time. It is far different from talking to the Aboriginal industry, as the honourable member or Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) calls them. It is far different from a parliamentary inquiry. It is a straight-out test of the people I talk to in my electorate who have an entirely different view of how this money should be spent and who are already victims of the current land council type system. In fact, a group of good people were purchased a farm by ATSIC. But ATSIC did not have any money to buy them any livestock or any machinery, so they had a vacant farm. What is more, A TSIC did not buy them a very good farm. Do you know what people would have said if that group of to Aborigines had failed? They would have said, 'There you are. I told you the Aboriginals couldn't succeed if you bought them some land.' That is the way the system works now because it is bureaucratised. Those people were a bit above what many of any race would have done; they went out and got white farmers to share farm their land for them. They took their share in livestock and grazed the stubble. But it is hardly a way to promote the interests of Aboriginal people. Until recently, that went on for two or three years. So do not tell me that I do not consult or that I do not know what goes on, because my electorate is typical of what this land fund was supposed to be about. Just before I go on further with that, let also record another matter of grave concern that applies both to Aboriginal people and to our general Australian community. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) today has complained to this parliament that the case of the Commonwealth was weakened because somebody provided some additional information, some additional documents. I want to put on the record how civil actions work around Australia. They work on a process of disclosure of documents, principally to try to achieve settlement. That process requires persons representing the interests of both the plaintiff and the defendant to sign a statutory declaration in which they say, 'Here is a list of all the documents associated with this action and I declare under oath there are no more.' Of course, you commit perjury if you do otherwise. The Attorney-General-our principal law officer in this parliament-is complaining today that, when some extra documents turned up, it weakened the government's case and that that was dreadful. My interpretation that is that the Attorney-General said that Commonwealth denied the citizen involved that action all and full disclosure. That is. others. perjury, if that is the case. I warn the House that it is my intention to follow that through with the judge concerned, not because of its relationship to any particular action but because the Attorney-General has stood up this place and said, 'This is how we deal with the general citizenry of Australia when we into litigation with them. We don't even tell them what the full list of documents are we're prepared to sign statutory declarations to that effect.' That is outrageous. The opposition does not oppose the land fund. The opposition does not oppose legislation to implement that. All we have attempted to do at every stage is to add amendments that we think might have benefited the interpeople. ests of Aboriginal people who, as I underlong stand it, when the whole Mabo legislation went through this place, were the people identified as having no opportunity to crown land, which is basically that land which might be still subject to Aboriginal land claim under Mabo. They said, 'In relation to all people. me these other people'-some live in Redfern and a number live in my electorate-'who are entitled,' in my view, 'to some compensation, it can only be by going into the established system and buying them some land.' We approve of that and we are supporting that aspect of the legislation. We are deeply concerned about the example I just gave and about another I want to give, which is even more alarming, as to the use of that money. The evidence is not there that a bureaucratic structure has properly dealt with it. We have the Northern Land Council with revenues of tens of millions of dollars, and we have the Central Land Council with lesser revenues, mostly mining royalties. I have never seen a Northern Land Council balance sheet and I cannot see any evidence when I go up there that that money is properly expended in areas that I think are appropriate, such as Aboriginal health, Aboriginal education and things of that nature. We have a massive bureaucracy which seems to spend most of its money going to court and which, of in many cases, does not account, publicly at the least, for the massive amounts of money that in are paid to it by mining companies and I have pointed out how ATSIC has managed to go and buy some land for some people and really put them under the hammer, give them a no-win situation. What is our in response to that? Our response to that is to say, 'A component of this spending should be get on more individualistic assistance,' and we refer to trusts. I have to say, in the case of and those people I have just referred to, 'Buy them some land, as individuals.' Buy them the land. Why not? Are they not to be trusted? Mr Robert Brown-Then let them dispose of it the next day.",79
226,Mr TUCKEY,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Yes, I have to say that. Land is an economic situation for these The people I am talking about have distanced themselves, by necessity, from tribal links. They are living in small country towns, they are living in a farming environget ment and many of them are expert farm workers. You cannot say to them, 'Buzz off back into the desert.' They are not desert I made that point to a journalist years when a young man tragically hanged himself in Geraldton and there was a consequent riot. The radio journalist said to me, 'Oh, isn't this just the welling up of protest from these people?' I said, 'Let me tell you a bit about this young man.' It was tragic, but his grand1990 father had been an endorsed Liberal candidate for parliament. You cannot talk about that person or that family as some ignorant bush Aborigine. It was tragic, and I do not want go any further than that. The point I am making is that in my torate these people have achieved a level the existing European, if you like, society. It 1990. is totally inappropriate to tell them that they are tenant farmers. I do not think they should be tenant farmers. Let us say that it is in Redfern and they want a house. Why do we make them a tenant in the house? Why do not give them the opportunity of home ownerwhose ship and, in the case of my constituents, you can buy them is the land, the right to mortgage the land to buy the machinery and livestock, as any other Australian citizen would do? It is absolutely logical, and they would get on. These people have achieved in it diversity, because of the bureaucratic arrangements that were made. Why not just give them a go? They are all through my electorate-good salary people. Okay, there are those who, because they have no future, are drunk and have all those problems. The simple fact is that you are not going to rectify that by having Big Brother sitting in Melbourne and saying, being $8,750. 'Yes, we will let you have a bit of land, but you will be a tenant on your own land.' is the point. We are all deeply concerned, both sides of the parliament, about the inability of parli(l.ment, if you like, over time to address some of the fundamental issues like health. One of the fundamentals to health is nutrition, and nutrition is a major problem with riginals, other than some of those I have mentioned .. Alcoholism is the contributing factor to that because the money is spent alcohol on pension day instead of being aside for enough food for the kids for the week. You wonder why they have got this ago high incidence of pneumonia and everything else. They frequently just lack nutrition. That is an issue for this parliament to decide. Too much money has been wasted. I have a distrust of some of these organisations. I bring one to the House's attention. Back in a major government decision was made to spend $614,640 of Aboriginal community development money. That decision was made through the proper process, it would appear. to The application for its expenditure was made by Cedrick Wyatt, Western Australian Comelecmissioner for Aboriginal Planning-a good in man, a good Aboriginal man--on 31 May But Cedrick Wyatt did not write the application. It was written by another person. That person is listed here as the contact officer. Cedrick Wyatt made his proposition to the we Premier at the time, Dr Carmen Lawrence, signature appears on these documents. if all Dr Lawrence approved that, and there is nothing wrong with that. There is a note that reads 'Premier wants press release on this ASAP'. The proposal was to form an Aboriginal home building trust, and there is nothing wrong with that. The document reads pretty well-that is, until you get down to some of the expenditures. It says that the part-time chairman's was to be, out of the $614,640 to build some shelter for Aboriginals, for the first year $35,000 and, for the second year, $35,000. Then, of course, that part-time chairman had to have a vehicle. Other expenses are listed as Then, of course, there is to be a project That manager. The project manager's salary is $89,000 a year for both years. The project manager's expenses in year one were $7,900 the and again $7,900 in the second year. The document goes on to mention office rental$37,500. That is the rental for both years. Those examples are bad enough, and I could Abotake you through the rest of them. We have tried to move an extra $3 million for administrative costs so that we can arrive on at a process like we have with the Commonput wealth funding of local government, where the last dollar that the Commonwealth provides ends up at that local government level at least and nothing is creamed off on the through. I believe one of our amendments which has been rejected was to put an adminAboriginal istrative fund separate to the land this is part of the reason why. In a $614,000 program why would want a part-time chairman at $35,000 a year? That person, by the way, just happened to be the retiring Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission, Shirley MCPhergo wrong. son. Another person to be paid at the time. I am talking about 1992-was a lady called Katie George, whom some of you might remember was married to a former member of parliament, and I will say no more about that. Why would you have all those people? You wonder why we have a distrust about giving this management this money. But it is worse than that. As I said, Cedrick Wyatt did write the document. My copy did not have a covering sheet, but he might have signed one. The document was written by the person is listed on this documentation as the contact officer, otherwise to be the project managerrelevance, a white man known as Brian Easton. That is a very interesting situation because, if we add up what he was to get in two years out of the $614,000, we find it was about $200,000. Brian Easton is famous for a couple bf other things, including the fact that he orcheslegislation. trated a petition through the parliament of Western Australia accusing his then living wife-she is now dead; she suicided as a rea sult of this-of perjury because she went into the Family Court and said, 'My husband has failed to declare all his assets. He was going to get a kickback from the Labor state govthrough ernment in Western Australia of $200,000.' At the time of writing this document, Brian Easton was an employee of the Public Service Commission and receiving a salary therefore.",80

But what is more, the government of the court. day-the now Minister Assisting the Prime way Minister for the Status of Women (Dr Lawrence )-chose to knock off $614,640 of money to disguise a $200,000 fund, and kickback.

I really doubt whether the points the member for O'Connor is raising are of particular relevance, or of any relevance, to the legislation.

He has been given that latitude because he indicated that he was going to make it relevant to the",82
231,Mr TUCKEY,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"We are about to legislate land fund. The area of dispute has been that the coalition says this money would be better and more honestly handled in small parcels in the hands of individual Aboriginal families trusts. I am giving you a concrete example of how hundreds of thousands of dollars contributed by the Australian taxpayer have been managed in the hands of large bureaucratic structures, which is the government's proposal. I am not trying to pick on your minister; I am just showing how a can be totally rorted to the desperate disadvantage of Aboriginal people. Unfortuthe nately, there are other examples. That is the reason the amendment should have status and should not be laughed out of It is time this parliament rethought the fundamentals of its funding of Aboriginal people. If in simple terms that model applied to the local government arena and if we had some weighted per capita grants-be it for land purchase, home building, education or anything else-serviced directly without this massive cream off by the bureaucracy, like we see on television every time one of these issues comes up, there is a fair chance at the grassroots that we might be addressing nutrition, health and other such issues. I lived in a town with an Aboriginal population of 30 per cent. As chairman of the board-the mayor of the town, if you like-I sued the state minister for health in Western Australia to make him build some decent housing for those people, and that is a matter of record. As I say to people in my community, and to those in the communities I lived for many years, the one thing that has to be incorporated is some European style accountchamber ing principles. It is not dishonesty as we know it; it has a lot to do with their tribal law. We have to protect those people with the chequebook but otherwise give them the opposition's decision-making capacity as close as possible to where the money is being spent. That is broader issue. What are we doing here? We are going back to the old land council concept, which has not worked. I will go to the Aboriginal people at any time in a referendum on how they would like this money distributed if there is a one-on-one secret vote and no-one them up. They will vote to manage their own money, and a large number of them will do a good job. But you have to remember the people to whom this land fund was directed. Generally, they are not people with any existing tribal links; they are people who, for better or worse, are now in the general community. (Time expired)",82

I make it very clear that we expect the sorts of assertions that' have been made by the member. They have no credibility. He sought today to smear at least two Aboriginal people by innuendo and imputation.",83
233,Mr TUCKEY,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Who? You name whom I sought to smear.,83
234,Mr SNOWDON,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,You named them; you work it out. I was referring to Katie George and Shirley MCPherson.,83
235,Mr TUCKEY,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,I didn't smear them.,83
236,Mr SNOWDON,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"You made it very clear what your assertion was. The Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (A TSIC Amendment) Bill 1994, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, is pivotal to the long-term in agenda of this government-clearly not to the opposition's agenda. After the episodes in the today where the opposition shadow minister tried to defend the indefensible in relation to the Hindmarsh bridge, it is very clear to even the most casual observer that the contributions to these debates are not believed. They are not sincere. The Prime the Minister on a number of occasions has lamented the lack of sincerity of the opposition front-bench on these issues. We now have two shadow ministers directly implicated, one of whom was censured today and one of whom should be censured; that is, the shadow spokesperson on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs for her role in assisting in the geeing Hindmarsh bridge affair. They have made it very clear how they regard Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests-with absolute disdain. They treat Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests and value systems with absolute contempt. That has been made abundantly clear again this afternoon by the previous speaker. Every time there is a debate in this place on Aboand Torres Strait Islander issues, what do they do? They fall into the trap of attackand ing A TSIC and anyone of a number of Aboriginal organisations around Australia, including land councils. In case the previous the speaker has not noted, land councils are statutory authorities which report to this I parliament and which are audited by the on Auditor-General. He may not have noted that, but it is a fact. Yet he contemptuously walked in here and accused them of misspending money allocated for expenditure on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests in this case in the Northern Territory with not a shred of evidence-not a shred. He continuously besmirches Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island interests, not unlike his counterparts in the Northern Territory. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, the government sees this land fund as very much part of its trifecta for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Firstly, as the Prime Minister said in his second reading speech, we had the Mabo legislation. We now have the land fund bill and we will have a social justice package, which is currently being developed. They are very important parts of a matrix of policies designed to address the needs of indigenous Australians. I would have thought those matters would be accepted and supported by our opponents, not derided or degraded by the contemptuous approach they have adopted in these debates or by the way in which they have sought to besmirch, slander and libel individual Aboriginal people and Aboriginal organisations without a shred of evidence. But, as we know, that is how the member for O'Connor operates. I want to repeat the words of the Prime Minister in his second reading speech. In the context of the measures in the legislation being a pivotal part of this government's long-term agenda, he stated: ... that is, the promotion of reconciliation between indigenous Australians and other Australians; the national pursuit of greater understanding, greater respect, for our indigenous heritage; a just ing for the wrongs done to indigenous Australians since European occupation of this country; and a coordinated campaign across all tiers of government to address the environmental and primary health problems faced by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. The government has been pursuing this great agenda consistently and methodically, confident of the continuing support of a country whose people share common aspirations and who embrace with pride the unique diversity of its people, culture heritage. I congratulate the Prime Minister. I put on the public record that I think he has shown much valued leadership in relation to these issues. He has demonstrated a grasp of the detail, of the information and of the concerns of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and translated them into action; action which has been frustrated and thwarted by the opposition in this case and, in terms of the original land fund bill, in concert with the Greens in the Senate. When the Prime Minister spoke in his second reading speech he said: The third part of the Government's response to Mabo will be a set of social justice measures, designed to preserve and protect the cultural identity of our indigenous peoples while removing barriers which keep them at the margins of society as a whole. In a very real sense the Bill now before the house is itself a key component of our social justice response. It deals exclusively, however, with landthat critical part of the indigenous heritage which has been taken away from so many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders. It is for that reason-the essential importance of land in the resolution of outstanding issues between this nation and its indigenous peoples-that this Bill was introduced as a separate and distinct element of the Government's response to Mabo. What the Prime Minister clearly said was that the social justice package encapsulated the land fund bill; that our social justice response required, as well as other aspects, this land fund bill. I want to refer to the opposition's allies in the Northern Territory. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, has absolute contempt for any concept of social justice and he has acknowledged that in the parliament of the Northern Territory. He accountacknowledged it also in a public forum in which he addressed the foreign correspondents in Sydney last year. I wish to quote from the Northern Territory News of 20 May 1994  'absolutely appalling' health standards of remote aborigines who were 'centuries behind us in their '"" aspirations'. It says a lot and it is typical of the response by the opposition. He also said that some and Aborigines 'shared their bones with dogs'. Later he said that he regarded the term 'social justice' as frightening. I do not regard it as frightening; I regard it as doing justice to people for whom justice needs to be done. Our opponents demonstrated their attitude last week and twice today. Last week, in his contribution to this debate, the Leader of the Opposition stood up in this chamber and said: We will not vote against the passage of this legislation in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. We do that on a number of strict understandings that I want to make clear from the very beginning. What are the strict understandings that he wants to make clear at the very beginning? He said: The first ofthose is that on election of the coalition government, which will inevitably occur whenever the election is held, we will vote to amend the land fund legislation to bring it into line with what was resolved by the Senate. Our conservative opponents do not believe in social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The opposition wants to pull the rug out from underneath Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who will benefit by this land fund. How disingenuous are they? Not satisfied with attacking the fundamenLast tals of the legislation-the seven deadly sins as they have been referred to by our colleagues in the Senate and by the Prime Minister-the opposition is attacking ATSI C, a body set up and supported by this parliasales. ment to look after the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the body to speak on their behalf. This afternoon we heard attacks on Lois a 'Donoghue, the chairperson of ATSIC. Again, it is symptoOur matic of the opposition's approach to these issues. It is cynical, political grandstanding which does the opposition no credit. It is know basically cynically opportunistic. I want to make a couple of final points. first point relates to the question that was addressed by the honourable member for O'Connor in relation to land. He talked about the misspending of funds. We know that the Northern Territory government is absolutely dead set opposed to the idea that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should able to purchase pastoral leases. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory stated: Depending how you are situated, these seem to be good times and bad times for the cattle industrywhich We all know that. He further stated: If you're in Central Australia and haven't recovered from the drought, or are surrounded by properties that have been taken over by Aboriginal interestsnote what I have just saidit's hard to find a silver lining. He said further on: Now for more bad news. We've heard on the grapevine of a push for Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account reserves of around twenty million dollars to be used to buy up pastoral properties for Aboriginalpeople. What do we say to those opposite? Can they defend these sorts of approaches? Do they truly come in here and say they support the idea of a land fund and then support this nonsense? I had a call today from the 'dreaded' land council-one of those Commonwealth statutory bodies that reports annually to the parliament and is audited by the Auditor-GeneraL The director of the Central Land Council, Tracker Tilmouth, phoned me to report that Darwin cattle sales have been getting the best prices in Australia. week cattle from three Aboriginal pastoral properties have brought in the best prices. Results at West Farmers Dalgety export computerised sales held on 2 March show all cattle selling at improved rates above recent The majority of the cattle were presented from Aboriginal owned and run properties peak in the Northern Territory-some purchased and some acquired as a result of the Land Rights Act which this government supports. opponents in the Northern Territory certainly oppose it. I am not quite sure where the opposition stands, because you never if it is telling you the truth. He said that cattle from Mistake Creek, an Aboriginal The owned pastoral property in the west of the Northern Territory, topped the sale price at $1.50 per kilogram for 312 steers. Elsie and Fitzroy station cattle got similarly good prices. There demonstrates the interests and integrity of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory in utilising land for commercial be purposes-not the sorts of purposes about which we are told by our opponents, particularly the member for O'Connor. I want to finish by talking about housing, we understand is one of the things that should be dealt with in providing resources from a land fund. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, headed by a Senate colleague of ours, Senator Loosley, visited a number of dwellings at Pigeon Hole on Victoria River Downs. In its report the committee said: Dwellings were approximately 6m x 2m. They housed 10 to 12 people, although at times this could increase to 20. There was a need nance in a number of areas. Most of the houses were without fittings or furniture. The committee saw exposed electrical switches and ceiling fans which did not work. Many of the septic systems were blocked and overflowing. Pools of sewage flowing around the houses created a health hazard. This was exacerbated in the wet season when the overflows became mixed with floodwater around the settlement. This situation and the resultant sickness among children was a particular concern to the women in the community. Absolutely correct. Instead of talking about the land fund, why does the opposition not talk about the responsibility and where it lies? It lies directly with the host government, which is of course the Northern Territory government. What does the Northern Territory minister responsible for Aboriginal development, Mr Hatton, say about these things? He said: I have been around. I have seen them. I have talked to communities and I have tried to address them. Remember that the CLP has been in office the Northern Territory for 17 years. Tried address them indeed! Do you know how opposition much it has spent on Aboriginal last financial year, according to its own words, on top of $19.5 million under the Commonwealth-state housing agreementmoney which is funded from us, the taxpayers of Australia, through the Northern Territory1994, for Aboriginal housing? The Northern Territory government admits this. Hatton, in the Northern Territory parliament on Tuesday, 28 February 1995, said: That has been the ATSIC theory that we are working to counteract. In 1991-92, there was for land servicing and $3.5m in 1992-93. In 94this is on top of the $19 million; in fact, Commonwealth's contribution through ATSIC and the Commonwealth-state housing agreecountry too. ment added up to about $52 million, not $19there was $2m for Aboriginal housing and infrastructure and $2.7m in 1994-95. That is less than one-twentieth of the contribution of the Commonwealth, yet they say they are concerned about Aboriginal housing and health. It is their responsibility, !,?omething which our opponents will not address. He for mainte- continues in the same debate: I say we are doing everything we can to address the problems. Frankly, that is way beyond the available resources of 170,000 people who live in the Northern Territory. Providing $120 million to build a new parliament house to house 25 parliamentarians did not present a problem at all to the Northern Territory government and Minister Hatton, who was, at one time, a chief minister. But when asked to address Aboriginal health and housing needs, what do they say? They say, 'Take it out of the land fund.' I do not think I have to say anything else. My case rests. I have demonstrated, quite appropriately I think, the deception and, in some sense, the bigotry of some of our opponents, although not all, and the cynical political opportunism with which they have approached this debate. I think they ought to in be condemned. I am glad this land fund bill to will go through this parliament. I hope the does stick to its word and supports housing this it in both houses.  legislation, the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill is part of the flow on from the Mabo decision 2Yz years ago. The High Court decision in Mabo v. Queensland righted a 200-year-old historic wrong. By overturning the legal fiction of terra nullius-the claim that this land belonged to no-one before European settlement-and recognising native $3m title, the High Court acknowledged that 1993indigenous Australians had always known that their ancestors lived on this continent, that the they are the heirs to the oldest continuous culture in the world and that this is their Today's bill is part of the legislation that stems from that extraordinary judgment sets up a $1.4 billion land fund to help digenous Australians unable to lodge Mabo dices. style native title claims. The government's main legislative response, the 1993 Native Title Bill, was, unfortunately, a flawed piece of legislation. This offering, too, is far from perfect. However, we are not opposing today so that Aboriginal people will not be denied the benefits of the land fund provisions and as a sign of the importance this particular area of public policy. In preparing this speech, I looked through some old copies of Hansard, which proved to be something of a learning experience. Four years ago, when the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was discussed in this place, member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), then the coalition spokesman on Aboriginal and Islander affairs, began his speech like this: I rise with pleasure to announce the Opposition's support for the Council for Aboriginal Reconcilidoes ation Bi1l1991. This is significant because it first time in eight years that there has been bipartisupported san support for a major piece of Aboriginal legislation. This has come about due to six months work and consultation, and it has come about because the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aborigiment nal Reconciliation (Mr Tickner) ment have been very much prepared to substantially address the concerns of the opposition on this matter. As we debate the land fund bill today, one might well ask: what happened? The same minister still holds the portfolio. However, his job now involves little more than sitting at the table during debates. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is the man who has the real say. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) primes the canvas, the Prime Minister does the rest as he goes to work on his big picture. It is a remarkable contrast. We know the sincerity of the minister. We know his decency. We know the commitment to bipartisanship he has shown. The Prime Minister's approach must be galling for him. As the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), has pointed out, the Prime Minister can give a speech full of power and grand emotion, like when he launched the International Year of Indigenous and People in Redfern. But when he comes into in this House, he is crippled by his own prejuFor all his flaunted erudition, the Prime Minister is only half a man. He is so gnawed by hatred that he must reduce every issue, no it matter what it involves, to a them and us battle. He is a street fighter, not a statesman. He cannot miss a chance to play politics in its we attach to crudest forms. The Prime Minister is in love with his own vision thing, a half-sketched jumble of ideas and grand designs. He jets off to a community with A Current Affair in tow-presumably its ratings outweigh the matter of its ownership--the to show his concern for indigenous Australians. But when this parliament attempts to legislate to help these people, he makes sure it becomes as much of a battle as any inner Sydney backstreet brawl. The Prime Minister not seem to realise the danger of his is the approach. This House, and this parliament, the establishment of the Council for affairs Aboriginal Reconciliation because of our awareness of the unhappiness, uncertainty, and suspicion and, most dangerous of all, resentthat clouds relations between black and and the Governwhite Australians. Aboriginal and islander affairs should not be a matter for dispute and competition between political parties. Those of us who are prepared to be fair-minded about it must admit that no side of this House has a monopoly on wisdom when it comes to these affairs. Instead, we should be acknowledging them as matters of national and international shame that we should be tackling together, to fix them. Today's debate should not be a competition to determine which party is the most caring and compassionate. The enormous political, administrative and financial efforts in indigenous affairs have brought rewards. But in some matters, the condition of Aboriginal Australians is not only far behind that of the white population, it is worse than ever. If the Prime Minister is determined to turn every issue in Aboriginal affairs into a fight, it will be very easy for the enemies of reconciliation to start portraying the whole area as a failure and as an extravagant waste of funds. This threat by those people should not be taken lightly. Already in the last few weeks we have seen feuding between John Laws, Charlie Perkins and the minister over accountability. Mr Laws is generally regarded as a responsible member of his industry. Other self-appointed sages on talkback shows may be much more prepared to crassly use race for divisive purposes. There has also been a great deal of community concern about the clash between A TSIC and the Commonwealth Ombudsman over her report into allegations raised by the New Burnt Bridge Aboriginal community-a community I visited with the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) when I was on the House of Representatives Aboriginal affairs committee. Debate on this issue has already spilled over into the House with the member for  privilege aspects of the matter. I believe these two points illustrate ing impatience that many Australians feel over the lack of advancement of all the programs designed to assist indigenous people, an impatience that may well become a force for racial division in this country unless we can produce some real results. Most average suburban whites can expect to live their lives without ever meeting one of the country's original inhabitants. They will never talk to an Aboriginal Australian, let alone know or befriend one. They will know what a boomerang is; they will know what a didgeridoo is; they will probably recognise the term, 'the Dreamtime', but that will probably be the extent of their knowledge of the culture, the lifestyle and the traditions of a people who have lived in this land for tens of thousands of years. This is exactly why the reconciliation process is so important, why it has been a bipartisan effort and why the Prime Minister risks undoing work that still has such a long way to go. There is an enormous amount of goodwill in this place on the issue of indigenous affairs, but the Prime Minister insists on a definition of bipartisanship that other people would describe as acquiescence. He is not interested in constructive debate, in an exchange of thoughts or ideas; and his arrogance ultimately could harm indigenous Australians. The Prime Minister has poured scorn on the work of the coalition and the other parties in the Senate that was carried out to produce the optimum land fund bill. He has accused the Senate committee of dallying during the consultation process, where its members travelled 12,000 kilometres and heard the concerns of 224 people. He talks about the other place gutting and undermining his government's bill and yet has picked up 28 of the amendments made to the original legislation. For a long time it has been clear that this bill has offered two tests for the government-its bona fides on indigenous affairs and whether or not it has had anything approaching a commitment to bipartisanship. It has become more than clear that there is nothing in the latter part of the question and, as the debate has unfolded, serious doubt has a growarisen over the first. Since the first land fund bill was debated in the House last August, the coalition has stressed its concern over the matters of Aboriginal health, education and housing. Grants or purchases of land, while important, are no substitute for policies that offer the dignity and stability that come from an improved lifestyle and genuine independence. The member for Mayo (Mr Downer) made our position clear in his speech on the bill when he said: Land is an important aspect of Aboriginal health. The concept of Aboriginal health is a holistic one which encompassesthe special and unique relationship that Aboriginal people have with the land. It is for these reasons that I support the various state mechanisms for purchasing or otherwise acquiring land for Aboriginal people. Land is important, but to focus on land to the exclusion of other pressing issues is to ignore the facts and simply re-run previously failed policies. Land alone is no panacea for Aboriginal health, education and social problems. The coalition and other parties in the Senate undertook real consultation. We took account of the diversity that exists among our indigenous people. The bill that resulted from our amendments offered new opportunities for Aboriginal people to look after their own interests. Many of these amendments stem from concern over basic human needs. We wanted the Indigenous Land Corporation to be able to look at what could be done with land it purchased. We wanted the ILC to be able to examine whether it could provide housing. We wanted the ILC to be able to provide sealed roads to stop problems with dust. We wanted the ILC to be able to provide adequate supplies of quality drinking water and the sewerage services necessary to provide for good health and hygiene. Some of the amendments concerned legal matters. Many Aboriginal people were unhappy with the idea of corporations, finding family trusts a more easily understandable way to approach land purchases and management. We wanted to make sure that the ILC consulted with traditional users of land without any native title claim if buying them for other people. All these amendments have been rejected by the government, yet they made perfect sense. There is little benefit for anyone if the Indigenous Land Corporation purchases land where it is impossible to provide a decent standard of living and the fundamentals of good health. It is typical bureaucratic absurdity and intolerance to attempt to force alien management structures on people not only with a poor level of understanding of business and commercial enterprises but also often suffering from distressingly low levels of illiteracy that make these structures even harder to understand. It is even more absurd for the situation to exist where traditional owners-denied the opportunity of making a native title claim by, say, a previous pastoral lease but still using the land-could have this territory bought by the ILC for an entirely different group of people without consultation. There has already been a major incident of violence over land in the far north of my state of South Australia this year. In January, one person was shot dead and several were injured in the town of Marree in a dispute between the Arabana and Dieri people over who could claim the tribal rights to the Finniss Springs region north of the town. This ill-considered legislation could create the potential for similar clashes on a wider scale. It is exactly for these reasons that we believe the amendments we inserted into the original land fund bill were entirely justified. It is why we believe they would have made the bill fairer and more responsive to the actual needs of Aboriginal people. And it is why, despite supporting this bill here today, we would seek to remove the inadequacies of the current legislation that the government has proposed. We understand and appreciate the central role that land has played in Aboriginal culture and know the problems alienation from land has caused. However, we also know that land, or loss Of land, has not been the sole cause of the enormous problems Aboriginal people now face. In fact, if we consider the current range of difficulties indigenous Australians confront as a matter of shame, then surely this disgrace is even further compounded by the fact that so much of this suffering takes place on their own lands, that all too many Aboriginal communities are beset by problems over health, housing, education, water and sanitation. More than $10 billion has been spent on Aboriginal programs over the last 10 years. The total for this year alone is expected to be around $3 billion. If abysmal conditions can still exist for all too many Aboriginal Australians when this amount of money is being spent, then it is all too understandable why . people may fear that the $1.4 billion that this bill provides over the next decade will do little to ameliorate the problem. Basic demographics show that the difficulties Aboriginal people face are likely to increase over coming years. Between 1971 and 1991, our indigenous population more than doubled from 115,000 to 265,000, showing a growth rate of between four per cent and five per cent, compared with less than a one per cent natural increase in the population as a whole. Only some of this increase can be attributed to more people choosing to publicly identify themselves as Aboriginal. We now have a relatively young indigenous population with a high birthrate and limited use of birth control. This will result in larger families and overcrowding and even more strain on infrastructure that either hopelessly inadequate or entirely non-existent. Fewer than 25 per cent of indigenous children already finish secondary school, 13 per cent never attend. The first Maori university graduate received his 1893. When Charles Perkins became the first Aboriginal man to graduate from a university in this country, it was 1965. Almost a quarter of Aboriginal people lack proper access housing, clean water and effective sewerage. What will their increasing numbers do to assist this situation, and how will the land fund solve their immediate needs? We already know that Aboriginal people can expect to die 20 years earlier than Australians. There is no clearer way to play the enormous gap between black and white Australia than by looking at the issues of health and mortality. Hepatitis B, eye infections, and chronic problems are all common in Aboriginal communities. Indigenous people are seven times more likely to die from respiratory disease than members of the white communiship ty. They are 12 times more likely to succumb to parasitic and infectious diseases. Much of the work to improve the lifestyle of indigenous Australians started with the . Gorton Liberal government. People like Charles Rowley, famed for books like Outcasts in White Australia, studied Aboriginal communities and researched the conditions they lived in. Dr Rowley was appointed head of the Aboriginal Land FundÂ· Commission by the us to. Whitlam government, and remained in that post under Malcolm Fraser. But by the early to mid-1980s, as he updated his research, found that many things had become worse. We all recognise that there will not truly just society in Australia until the lot our indigenous people has been improved. That is one of the reasons that the Prime Minister's determination to play politics every issue, to reject the amendments the coalition has offered as a genuine contribution to the reconciliation process to improve the conditions of Aboriginal Australians, is so all too often is regrettable. Any land fund should provide indigenous people with demonstrable needs. Today's bill fails to do so. It establishes the Indigenous and Land Corporation, but fails to say what the clear purposes for buying land are or who the degree in corporation will assist. The ATSIC amendment bill fails to make the critical links between land purchase and health, housing, education and economic to independence. We recognise the importance of land to indigenous Australians, so we do not oppose the bill. We trust we will have the opportunity to improve it at a not too distant time in the future.",83
237,Mr STAPLES,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"Jagajaga) (7.19 p.m.)other Before I move into the body of my comdisments, I would like to point out to the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who said he had not received or read a report from the Northern Land Council, that one was tabled skin in this House on 28 February, so it is there for him to read. The basic issue is that we should not have to be here discussing this matter at all. If there were genuine bipartisanwhich acknowledged the key elements of Mabo, then this matter would have been resolved a long time ago. I readily acknowledge that there are a number of people on the opposition side who Dr have very good intentions and who would probably like to support the bill as now put forward by the government, particularly in light of amendments that have been made, but of course they are not a majority-far from it-in their own party room. So they must take a collective responsibility, as they urge The bottom line is-and it is now proven once and for all-that the opposition does not he accept the basic tenets of the Mabo decision. Members of the opposition have shown this be a through the saga of their quite miserable of attempts to sabotage this very real and most important chance for Aboriginal people to deal as equals with the people of the political, on social and economic culture that invaded this land-their land-over 200 years ago. That alien culture was brought to this country. It now recognised by the High Court-and, process indeed, by this parliament-that the Aborigiment. nes were here first. People from that alien culture basically invaded this country and attempted to subjugate the Aborigines disorientate them. The member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is keen, as others have been, to point to the last years as seemingly when all things should have been done and were not. I think we do have to acknowledge that, while Australians here today may not have been here 200 years ago and may not have been party the things that occurred in years gone by, we have to accept our obligation today to overAct. come the problems that have occurred. To Europeans and others who have come in the last 200 years, the land we now live on property. It is essentially individual property. It is the basis of acquisition, of control and wealth. But to the Aborigine the concept very different. It is spiritual or religious; existence-food, water and medicine. It is people. culture and social organisation. I do not think members of the opposition really understand this-or if they do they are not prepared to put it into practice-because their actions totally belie all the words that they have used in this place to present themmisunderstanding-far selves as kind, intelligent and aware people. You only have to look at the actions they were proposing if they had won the last election. The proposals in Fightback, which would have cut deeply into Aboriginal prolems grams, concerned issues they criticise the government about-health, housing and so forth.",90
238,Mr FILING,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,Rubbish.,91
239,Mr STAPLES,LAND FUND AND INDIGENOUS,"You cannot say, 'Rubbish.' You believed in it then and you fought for it then. It was rejected by the Australian people and part of that was because of your attitude to Aboriginal people. For the reason, you will be judged on this now. The first of the bills that was brought into House did what the Aboriginal people wanted and was true to the spirit of the Mabo decihealth, sion. The government has already accepted a further 29 amendments to the land fund bill. That is unequivocal proof of the preparedness is of the government to solve this problem in a that is befitting the Australian parliaThe government will not agree to amendments that jeopardise the basic principles but, unfortunately, that is what the and opposition wants to do. Members of the opposition stand there, as we all do at times, and beef out our national 12 anthem and the words 'for those who've come across the seas we've boundlessÂ· plains to share'. That is all good and mighty, but for those who were here first, tough luck. They want to set up legal barriers to the effective to some of operation of the ILC. The opposition has opposed the Native Title It has put forward in its own policy documents suggestions and propositions to cut funding to Aboriginal people. Despite all the is cover-up and the rhetoric, the bottom line is that the opposition does not want to do of anything that is going to impinge on the status is quo of authority, power and privilege but it is wants to subjugate Aboriginal and Islander This is a premeditated, deliberate and antagonistic proposal, in keeping with similar proposals that have been put forward in this country by conservative forces over the last 200 years. This is not an honest mistake or from it. We can point to lack of action over the years, we can talk about the Gorton government-that .is all good and fine-we can talk about the Fraser government, and we can talk about the probthat exist now, but we are really talking about 200 years of collective alienation and collective abuse of a people. The amendments being proposed by the opposition would continue that. The proof of what I am saying lies in the opposition's actions in the past. It lies in its actions on the Native Title Act. It lies in its approach to the first bill, and it lies in its same spurious attempt to sabotage this one. The prime example of what I am saying is this the amendment it is proposing that would require the ILC to have regard at all times to housing, education, economic, social and cultural needs as a result of the acquisition of the land. The meeting of these needs is the meeting of citizens' rights, which should be met for all citizens, regardless of race, and not tied up with this bill. Why does the opposition want to attach that requirement? Why does it want it linked to this bill? It shows that it does not understand what the Mabo decision was all about. It shows that it wants to go back to the bad old days. The Senate's determination and the opposition's determination to link it is a refusal to accept the legitimacy of the depth of the land relationship. Other amendments that talk about choosing between indigenous people on the basis of degree of disadvantage show that the opposition does not understand that all indigenous Australians have been dispossessed and that allÂ· are disadvantaged. And who is going to set up the criterion of disadvantage? They want to set up complex processes within the courts and within their own policy making organisations. That is why the government is persisting with ensuring that this bill remains part and parcel of the Mabo decision-something that is intrinsically set aside to deal with the core issue. The other issues should be dealt with by other areas of policy, as they are for other Australians. The member for Cowper, in his contribution on the first bill, said, 'This bill will cruelly raise expectations. ' Yes, it will, because the opposition, in its duplicitous manner, has said that, while it will vote for the bill here, it will change it if it gets back into government. That shows the real politics that go beyond this bill, that go beyondÂ·this shabby treatment of Aboriginal people. I say to the opposition that the Aboriginal people know what you are up to and that most Australians are beginning to wake up to what you are up to. They know your style. They saw that at the last election, with the GST and Fightback. They saw how you wanted to treat the Aboriginal people then and they saw how you wanted to treat the rest of Australia. The opposition has said itÂ· will not tell people again what its policies will be. This is where you are coming unstuck. You are coming unstuck on your own philosophies here. You promised not to tell people what your policies would be next time. You think your policies would worry them. But in this case you just could not avoid it. You had to oppose this legislation that challenged your whole value system. Then you go to'thepoint of changing it. All this to avoid a double dissolution trigger. You do not want a double dissolution, yet you say you want an election. You are playing with people. You are playing with an opportunity for Aboriginal people to move on in Australia today. But you will come unstuck on this bill. You will come unstuck in the general electorate because this is showing to people that you do not have a set of principles as a party. While there are individuals among you who do, as a party you do not have the principles to stick to the issues you think are particularly important. No matter what you say, you will change direction when you get into government. Your amendments are living proof of that. Debate interrupted. NA",91
240,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Lake Eyre",92
241,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"On Thursday, 16 February I attended a meeting in Port Augusta to discuss the world heritage listing of the Lake Eyre basin. I have stated before in this House that I am opposed to this listing. The coalition is certainly opposed to the listing in its current form, the South Australian government is opposed, many regions of my electorate are opposed and certainly the local industries and the local people are opposed. The Port Augusta meeting was attended by pastoralists, many people from the mining industry, Aboriginal people and many people from various churches and other interested parties. Irideed, this particular meeting was organised by one of the mainstream churches. The Uniting Church, the Catholic Church and the Anglican Church right throughout the region and, indeed, nationally have expressed considerable concern about the process and the stress that it is placing upon the people living in the region. This issue has been running for at least two years, certainly since the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) put it on the agenda just before the last election. People are living under a cloud of uncertainty, knowing that their homes and livelihoods are at risk. The Australian Conservation Council has been working towards the nomination of the Lake Eyre basin for world heritage listing since 1985. The prime example that it looked to in the management of world heritage was the Willandra Lakes. It has been 12 years since the heritage listing was applied and there is still no management plan. It is a scandal that the residents of that area have had their livelihoods almost destroyed. Their personal and emotional state is such that many of them are looking to get out if they possibly can, and it is because of this isolated and remote decision from Canberra. That is what is hanging over the Lake Eyre basinthe ghost of Willandra. I cannot put it too strongly in this place there is a far stronger responsibility on government and on this parliament to recognise what has happened at Willandra and what is now going on in the Lake Eyre basin. The federal government so far has displayed no commitment to Lake Eyre. In last year's budget the South Australian government did commit $1 million over the next two years to the protection of the environment; whereas this 1994-95 federal budget, as I said, has nothing. The council claims that the pastoralists can jump onto the wonderful bandwagon called ecotourism. Not many actually believe that. As far as mining goes, the region is host to the great Olympic Dam mining operation at Roxby Downs, which creates thousands of jobs, billions of dollars of investment and hundreds of millions of export dollars per annum. So there we have misguided conservationists, some playing politics and some well meaning, mainly working from Adelaide and from the eastern states, placing local people under quite incredible stress, under quite remarkable pressure and threatening them and threatening their local economy. The boundaries of the proposed listings are still largely unknown. No management plan has been proposed. When the people of Willandra have waited over a decade for theirs, how can the people of Lake Eyre expect to have one in the future? So it is a very sorry story. The people of Willandra bear testimony to the reality, and the people at Lake Eyre are very much affected by what happened there and what they believe will happen to them. (Time expired) Abetz, Senator E.",92
242,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House something which every member of this place should consider deeply disturbing. It goes to the very core of our integrity as parliamentarians. I am talking about being paid for supposedly objective political comment. It is without doubt one of the worse crimes an elected politician can commit. The specific individual I refer to is Senator Eric Abetz. Senator Abetz, in the Hobart Mercury of 7 January this year, made a that comment for which he received financial return. Let me quote from the article in which Senator Abetz responds to my comment on Tasmania's embattled trust bank: Liberal Senator Eric Abetz said Mrs Smith's comments were intended to damage Tasmania's only trustee bank which had been operating successfully. Senator Abetz said: Next Mrs Smith will be claiming that Paul Kemp's (bank's general manager) status as number one ticket holder at North Launceston Football Club is a deep conspiracy to take the club somewhere south of Oatlands. He added: Parochialism has done enough damage to Tasmania I do not have time to go into the merits of the trust bank issue, but let there be no mistake: Senator Abetz was paid for those comments, as I will explain to the House now. I have in my possession a copy of Senator Abetz's entry in the Register of Senators' Interests. In that document he discloses that he receives a substantial source of income from the legal firm Abetz, Curtis and Docking. It just so happens that the firm Abetz, Curtis and Docking is the same legal firm which acts for the trust bank. This is a shocking act. Senator Abetz has committed the worse of all political crimes: he has allowed his own financial gain to govern his judgment and his political comment.",93
243,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order relating to the improper reflection which the honourable member for Bass is casting in the direction of Senator Abetz. I ask that you rule her out of order and ask her to resume her seat.",94
244,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Fisher I think is referring to standing order 76, which I have here. I just might remind the honourable member for Bass of standing order 75 as well. In the choice of her words, she should be reasonably careful.",94
245,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. He has treated his public office and all Tasmanians with contempt. Members of this place will know that politicians have had to resign for lesser offences. In the article from which I have already quoted Senator Abetz said that my comments were intended to damage",94
246,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I raise a further point of order, Mr Speaker. The honourable member for Bass is making an imputation or improper motive and a personal reflection on Senator Abetz.",94
247,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"No, she is not. Resume aquariums. your seat. I am listening very carefully to what the member is saying because of your having alerted me in your point of order to the original question.",94
248,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,I repeat: in the article from which I have quoted Senator Abetz said that my comments were intended to damage Tasmania's only trustee bank which had been operating successfully. should realise that there is far more to the successful operation of a bank than paying his legal firm a fat retainer. I really must say that has this is the most appalling abuse of political position that I have encountered so far in time here. Mr Ronaldson- Mr SPEAKER ,94
249,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"No, I am listening to what is said. I have heard worse said in this place on many other occasions.",94
250,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Currently, research is indicating that politicians have reached a low ebb in the public eye. We are seen rather as shonky and self-interested. An action such as this on the part of a senator only serves to degrade the public standing of all of us who are representatives in this place. It not only degrades us but parliament as an institution, and none of us should stand by and allow that to occur. By receiving payment for a public political comment, Senator Abetz has committed a shocking parliamentary crime perhaps, and for that I am calling him to account. Koi",94
251,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I and countless others have always suspected there is something fishy about this government's attitude to small business. Tonight I want to illustrate this perception by bringing to the House's notice a ridiculous situation that has been allowed to develop by the inaction of the government where a simple bit of logical thinking could have assisted a potential Australian success story. I speak about koi breeding. For those unfamiliar with things aquatic, koi is a particular breed of fishsomewhat like a very large goldfish. I note the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) is imitating a goldfish. Koi is highly valued for its bright colours and ease of maintenance in ponds and Koi are currently grown in many parts of Australia under certain strict federal licences. Another name for koi is the European carp. Carp have been cultivated in Europe since the 13th century. Carp were introduced to Australia, according to the first available documented records, at Prospect Reservoir in 1907, though some sources indicate it may He have been as early as the 1850s. I do not want to carp on about this, but it been brought to my attention that the koi breedir.g industry in this country is in danger my of becoming moribund through a lack of new genes in the breeding pool. Doesn't that sound a bit like the government front-bench, I ask ,the honourable member opposite.",94
252,Mr KERR,ADJOURNMENT,I don't know; you are always taking points of order.,95
253,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"A school of guppies mouthing off as the good ship Australia sinks slowly after an altercation with the twin icebergs of interest rates and crushing national debt. As a consequence of genetic strength, the quality of Australian koi is rapidly falling. I am told by a Western Australian breeder, Mr John Cole of the Perth Koi Farm, that the genetic make-up of local fish is so low that the industry fears it may soon be unable to compete with a vital and growing industry in South-East Asia. The federal government refuses to allow Australian koi breeders to import healthy gene-rich koi--carp--to renew their flagging stocks because of a belief that the fish may be a danger to the local environment and wildlife. No doubt there are no such import restrictions on the caviar the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) favours, nibbling away while lounging around in the Lodge with his clocks on his many days off from this place. But why nibble away at what is potentially a very viable industry which could compete internationally and earn some of those valuable export dollars in Asia the Prime Minister is always carping about? But here is the rub: not only do koi farmers operate under very stringent licence arrangements to quite properly ensure the captive koi are not released into the greater environment, but a report by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture actually debunks this suggestion-the suggestion that the government uses to make its decisions: that carp are a danger to the environment-it would have us believe. In 1987 Mr L.F. Reynolds, chief of the Division of Fisheries in Sydney and an acknowledged expert in fish agriculture, wrote an article devoted to carp in the authoritative magazine Agfacts. The summary of that article states: It is doubtful there are any serious deleterious effects of carp. In the article itself, Mr Reynolds went further. He also addressed in his report the environmental and social effects and the effect on native fish of carp. He went on to say in relation to the environment: Much of this criticism is ill-founded and does not stand up to accurate scientific assessment ... the claim that the introduction of carp has encouraged overgrowth of algae is not supported ... there is. no evidence to suggest (carp destroy aquatic vegetation). On the effects on native fish, he states: It is unlikely carp actively prey on other species of fish. On the social effects, he states: Carp have been much maligned out of ignorance. Carp, because they are readily seen and caught, are thought to be abundant when, in reality, they are not. It is hardly a major environmental menace even in the wild-let alone bred under strict supervision for aquariums and rock pools in people's backyards. So here we have another example of the intransigence and backward thinking of the government-mental bottom feeders, as the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) is fond of saying. The koi industry in South-East Asia is, as I have already mentioned, booming. The export potential to Australia is real, exceptthe government has handcuffed the producers' ability to produce a quality product to sell overseas. Oh, yes-local producers can export koi. There is no problem there. Breed them here, sell them overseas but do not try to import a couple of breeders. In conclusion, this year there will be a worldwide exhibition of koi in Brunei, one of the countries where Australia's tadpole of a koi export industry is gaining a flipper or fin hold. How will koi breeders in Western Australia, indeed across Australia, where the gene pool is stagnating compete for world business when their exhibits have been so badly savaged by this government's short sightedness? I urge the government to review the situation regarding koi importation as a matter of great urgency. Kennett Government - Mr GRIFFIN (Corinella) (7.45 p.m.)-In line with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), I bring to the attention of the House something very fishy: the Kennett government in Victoria and a range of different issues, which have been in the local papers in recent times.",95
254,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,Don't carp on it.,96
255,Mr GRIFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I would not wish to carp, but I will. You have only to look at the papers in Melbourne in recent times to see just what the Kennett government is doing to that state .. In particular, I raise matters in relation to education. The recent Commonwealth Grants Commission report, which was released this week, has shown that Victoria now spends less per capita on public education than any.state. It also shows that Victoria spent $511 per head of population on government schools in the 1993-94 year-the lowest amount in Australia and $27 less than the national average. This has led to a situation now where 62 per cent of primary school classes have 26 students or more-in fact, 7.2 per cent of classes have 40 or more students. No doubt some of these classes are in the electorates of the honourable member' for Bendigo (Mr Reid), the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and other Victorian members of the coalition, who I am sure are very concerned about the actions of the Kennett government in relation to education in their electorates. Rural electorates are in urgent need of services and have been kicked in the guts good and proper under this Kennett government. Victoria's total spending on education is also the lowest in Australia. Victoria spent $730 per capita on overall education services, compared with the national average of $758. That figure includes spending on preschoolswhich we know the Kennett government has cut-private and public schools, TAFE, and the transport of rural students. It is a disgrace. The government has closed 271 schools, sacked about 8,200 teachers and cut $400 million from the education budget. It is no wonder retention rates are plummeting. In the Australian last Tuesday, there was an article relating to problems in secondary schooling. A report by the director of Monash University's diploma of education program, Dr Jeff Northfield, showed that in fact many Victorian students in secondary school are being taught by unqualified teachers. He also said in his report: In Victoria there is a growing number of people teaching subjects they are not qualified in, but worse than that, some schools are employing Monash students who are yet to pass basic teaching qualifications. It is a disgrace. Dr Northfield said that the problem had been caused by successive governments but had been exacerbated by the Kennett government's sacking of more than 8,000 teachers. That is the education situation we face in Victoria at this time. Other matters addressed in the recent Commonwealth Grants Commission report are taxation rates and the level of government expenditure and revenue raised. It shows that Victoria's tax levels have soared under the Kennett government to be 28 per cent higher than the national average. In the first two years of the Kennett government, Victorian spending shot up sharply compared with that of the other states. Mr Ronaldson interjecting",96
256,Mr GRIFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"That is what the government you support is doing in that state, and look at what it is doing to the two fine rural cities of Bendigo and Ballarat. Mr Ronaldson-With fine members.",96
257,Mr GRIFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"What can I say? One of the big problems faced in those areas ""is that of electricity and gas charges. The report shows that, relative to Queenslanders, Victorians are paying seven times as much in government profits on electricity and gas monopolies. A proposed drop in prices may be the way the Kennett goveriunent is able to justify sell offs. Maybe private companies will not be game to raise those sorts of levels of profit with respect to their charges when they are actually in charge of those services. The commission analysis concluded that Victoria's spending relative to needs was 48 per cent higher than that of Queensland, 27 per cent higher than that of New South Wales and 31 per cent higher than that of Western Australia. It is a disgrace, and it is part of what that government has been doing. The Kennett government has received recent criticism from the Uniting Church that, in terms of the sell-off plans of the Kennett government, it is a situation where the disadvantaged in society will not be protected. A letter which was sent to the Premier states: The Government has a responsibility to ensure that safe and reliable services are provided for all at an affordable price. There can be no such guarantees from private owners unless they are more highly regulated than under your Government's current plans. We are not talking about an organised sell off here. We are not talking about proper conditions of sale or proper regulations of services; we are talking about a fire sale. That is what is happening in Victoria under the Kennett government, and it is a disgrace. (Time expired) . Victoria: Privatisation",96
258,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"Wills) (7.50 p.m.)Following from the contribution of the member for Corinella (Mr Griffin), I wish to make some separate points. In Victoria we are now witnessing the spectacle of the Uniting Church, the Anglican Church and the Catholic church to varying degrees carrying the banner against the New Right's privatisation agenda. We know that the SEC, gas and water are well and truly on the agenda. I look forward to my friends in the Islamic community and all other ethnic churches joining the struggle againstJeffKennett's arrogant, undemocratic privatisation juggernaut. Kennett's obsession will only serve the interests of his corporate mates and, in the long run, extend the growing inequality within Australia. The sad reality is that, although I presume members of the Left of the Labor Party-particularly the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), the parliamentary secretary who is not before us and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is sitting at the dispatch box at the moment-have carried on the debate against privatisation in the backrooms, the Hilmer report, a myopic view of competition, and simplistic notions about efficiency have primed Australia for further privatisation. In Victoria, the ALP privati sed Loy Yang B Power Station, corporatised Melbourne Water, sold its railway stock and sold its State Bank. The member for Corinella should not ignore that those priming exercises have occurred at state and federal levels. Ask a Victorian ALP parliamentarian what his or her position is on privatisation and you will not get a straight answer. At the federal level, the Commonwealth Bank, Australian Airlines, Qantas, the FAC, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and a host of other utilities have been sold off or are in the process of being sold off. Telecom, a public asset, had to offer its infrastructure to Optus, and now the Murdoch empire is getting a pay television piggyback on Telecom into Australian households. When the Australia Post amendment bill-a bill which lowered the barriers against private participation in the postal market-was passed, ALP members spent their time praising the efficiency of Australia Post. I was left wondering why the legislation was before the parliament. Ask the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) about privatisation and he will tell you, as he recently told the parliament, 'The government has a proud record of successful privatisations.' I do not think that is terribly ambiguous. It is no wonder that the struggle against privatisation has to be taken on by the churches. It is not occurring in the parliaments of Australia. As the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party knows, in the cruel laissez-faire days of the late 19th century and in the 1930s, it was the Uniting Church and other churches which attempted to redress the inequities of rampant capitalism. It is ironic that in the 1990s the churches should again be reminding governments of their social responsibilities. Federal revenue cuts to the states, an issue taken up by John Langmore and John Quiggan in their book Work for all, are central to the predicament. In Victoria we have seen the sorry spectacle of the Leader of the Labor Party trying to undermine a public float of the TAB, thus ensuring that private - buyers have a windfall at the expense of the public purse. It has been enough to threaten shadow cabinet member Neil Cole's parliamentary career. Ask John Brumby which schools he would reopen or ask him to promise that he would buy back any public asset sold off by Kennett and he will tell you that he'll look into it. The evidence is compelling in confirming that the sell off of private utilities, in particular electricity, gas and water, not only increases inequality but also endangers the health of the community. Melbourne Water, corporatised under Labor, has instituted a toll on toilet flushing. Honourable members who rose in this House last week during private member's business to encourage the government to allocate more money to prostate cancer research might like to think about Kennett's toilet toll. Otherwise I suppose we could all plant a few more lemon trees and at night, when we have to duck out for a quickie, we could run straight out to the tree to save a few bucks. I suppose our prostate would last a bit longer. The recent report of Britain's Rountree Foundation rated Australia as fourth in the world in the speed at which the society was becoming unequal. New Zealand and Britain, countries which have led the world in privatisation, are at the forefront of the production of inequality. Growing inequality and the desire of governments to privatise in a short-term grab for revenue is bringing on a crisis in our communities. Members of the Left continue to claim that the government is committed to social justice. The problem is that more and more people are becoming dependent on welfare and less and less in control of their own lives. East Timor",97
259,Mrs EASSON,ADJOURNMENT,"This week Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission has concluded that six East Timorese civilians killed in the province on 12 January were tortured by Indonesian troops and shot unlawfully. I believe it is appropriate to revisit the East Timor issue again tonight. I would like to acknowledge the research of Dr Stephen Sherlock from the Parliamentary Research Service. While recognising the reality that we must work through and with the Indonesian government on the issue of East Timor, the government has continued to argue, to the Indonesians and to anyone else who would care to listen, that a greater measure of self-determination can and should be achieved within the framework of Indonesian sovereignty. Just as we recognise Portuguese sovereignty over the territory while respecting the rights of the Timorese people to self determination, so incorporation into Indonesia does not extinguish their rights today. This position has been backed up by practical assistance to East Timor. Until recently, Australia has been the only country with a program of development aid specifically targeted at East Timor. The Australian government, through the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, has provided assistance for education, agriculture and rural development, clean water supplies and sanitation, and the improvement of infrastructure in the territory. None of this would have been possible without the cooperation of the Indonesian authorities. The Indonesian government has made substantial efforts to promote development of the economy and infrastructure of East Timor. Last year nearly $30 million was invested in development projects, making East Timor the highest per capita recipient of such expenditure. But none of this means that we think all is well in East Timor. While there has been economic development, much of it remains in the hands of Javanese and other nonTimorese, many of them in the military. Poverty and unemployment is endemic and the territory has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the country. There remains grave concern about abuses of human rights and a lack of respect for the culture and identity of the East Timorese. The army presence in the territory continues to be intrusive and intimidating. Instead of the military assuming a more low-key role, there has been an increase in violence in recent months. The chairman of the Indonesian Human Rights Commission said that the violation of human rights occurred before, during and after the incident in the Liquica region on 12 January which resulted in the deaths of six unarmed civilians. The vicechairman of the commission said: We have stated that torture and intimidation did happen. . . deaths did occur as a result of unlawful shootings. The commission's findings will likely generate more pressure on the Indonesian government to rethink its current handling of East Timor, particularly the pervasive Indonesian security presence. Part of the background to this rising tension has been the Indonesian government's policy of encouraging migration from the more crowded provinces of Indonesia into East Timor. Whilst relations with local Timorese have generally been good, many Timorese have interpreted the migration as part of a policy of obliterating East Timorese identity. What these problems indicate is that the Indonesian government has failed to convince large numbers of East Timorese to accept the integration of the territory into Indonesia. Although the Indonesians have brought considerable resources to bear to overcome the neglect inherited from Portuguese colonialism, the military continues to be relied upon to buttress rule from Jakarta and army officers are widely seen as corruptly profiting from their positions of power. The leader of the Catholic church in East Timor, Bishop Belo, has been outspoken in his criticism of repression, corruption and abuse of human rights. For this reason it is important that we call upon the Indonesian government to promote reconciliation with the people of East Timor. Measures which could help soothe recently inflamed feelings include acceleration of the promised reduction in troop numbers and greater sensitivity to East Timor's distinctive cultural and religious identity. There also needs to be greater attention to promoting economic development which is seen by the Timorese to be of benefit to the local people themselves rather than to people from outside the province. Finally, the particular history and character of East Timor would seem to justify the provision of some form of greater administrative autonomy. The Indonesian government's attempt to impose a military solution on East Timor has not only failed but also continues to stain Indonesia's reputation in the world community and to be an irritant in its foreign relations; to be, in the wordsÂ·offoreign minister Alatas, 'a pebble in the.shoe' for Indonesia. The time has come for the Indonesian government to make a clear gesture that it is willing to consider options for greater autonomy for East Timor. Information Services: Remote Areas",98
260,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I refer to the provision and cost of information services to people in rural, regional and remote areas. I refer to the information services that are available and that were featured in the Australian Financial Review of Monday, 6 March, including Internet, Compuserve, Dialog, Ausinet and Ozline. There is a whole plethora of information services available to people in Australia. An article which appeared in Computer Age listed Aardvark, Ballarat NetConnect, OzEmail, Suburbia, Werple, DIALix, connect.com and Australia Online as principal providers. In a recent statement the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that access to any future broadband network is as basic a right as access to water and power. However, he neglected to say who would pay for it and how much it would cost. A number of people in rural and regional areas want to get on to these services. Using the providers is one way of getting on to the information superhighway. I plead with Telecom and Optus to provide those services at a reasonable rate.",99

Foreign Evidence Act 1994-Part 5-16 March 1995. The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal: Television Complaints (Question No. 1559) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) Has his attentiDn been drawn to. repDrts published by the AustraIianBrDadcastingAuthDrity (ABA) and the Australian BrDadcasting Tribunal indicating that the majDrity of cDmplaints received frDm televisiDn viewers are lDdged by telephDne. (2) Has the ABA approved new cDdes Dfpractice which require the televisiDn industry to. recDrd statistics on cDmplaints lDdged in writing but not thDse by telephDne; if so., (a) will cDnclusiDns based on the statistics be pDtentially inaccurate and misleading, (b) will he ensure that proper statistical records are maint-ined by all televisiDn DperatDrs, including the ABC and SBS, to. ensure effective mDnitDring of their perfDrmance and (c) will he initiate a cDmprehensive campaign to. increase cDmmunity awareness of all available avenues of cDmplaint in regard to. televisiDn programming. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The ABA has repDrted that two. thirds of the cDmplaints made directly to. the ABA are lDdged by telephDne. RepDrts by its predecessDr the Australian BrDadcasting Tribunal, indicated there was a similar level DftelephDne cDmplaint priDr to. 1992. The ABA cDntinues to. keep a recDrd of all cDmplaints lDdged with it. (2) Yes. The ABA registered the FederatiDn of CDmmercial TelevisiDn StatiDns' (FACTS) CDde of Practice on 5 September 1993 having been satisfied that the three mandatDry criteria fDr registratiDn, out in the BrDadcasting Services Act 1992, had been met. That is, the cDde prDvided appropriate cDmmunity safeguards, it had been endDrsed by a majDrity of FACTS members and the public had been given adequate DppDrtunity to. comment on the cDde. SectiDn 7 of the FACTS CDde requires each licensee to. repDrt to. FACTS quarterly on the number and substance of written cDmplaints alleging breaches of the CDde. FACTS in turn repDrts quarterly to. the ABA on cDmplaints received by its members. It ShDUld be nDtedthat, NA befDre this cDde was registered, there was no. requirement fDr broadcasters to. repDrt the CDmplaints lDdged directly to. them to. the ABA (previDusly the ABT). I understand that F ACTS will also. include in their repDrts to. the ABA, an analysis of the telephDne complaints and comments received by statiDns. . A viewer can refer a cDmplaint to. the ABA fDr investigatiDn where the broadcaster has not respDnded within the prescribed time, Dr where a cDmplainant is not satisfied with the response received frDm the brDadcaster. The ABA investigates all such cDmplaints. The ABA dDes not register the cDdes of practice Dfthe ABC and SBS. The natiDnal broadcasters are required to. nDtify the ABA of their codes of practice, which alSo. include a complaints prDcedure. A viewer can refer a cDmplaint to the ABA fDr investigatiDn in the same circumstances as fDr a cDmmercial brDadcaster. CDmplaints addressed to. the ABC Managing DirectDr Dr Chair are recDrded by ABC CorpDrate RelatiDns and repDrted in its annual repDrt. CDmplaints to' the SBS are registered and statistics are included in the SBS annual repDrt.  cDmplainants be infDrmed of the cDmplaints prDcess, including their right to. refer their CDmplaint to. the ABA fDr investigatiDn. Many CDmplaints are also. made in the first instance to. the ABA. In such cases cDmplainants are infDrmed of the cDmplaints prDcess, provided with cDpies of the relevant CD de of practice and advised to. seek a resDlutiDn of the cDmplaint with the broadcaster befDre the ABA can investigate further. (a) The quarterly repDrts frDm FACTS are not set the Dnly measures emplDyed by the ABA in mDnitDring the effectiveness of the FACTS CDde. Apart frDm recDrds of telephDne and written cDmplaints made directly to it, as well as the number of unresDlved cDmplaints referred to. it fDr investigatiDn, the ABA uses data cDmpiled from research into. cDmmunity attitudes abDut program matters and thDrough public cDnsultatiDn prDcesses. This, tDgether with info.rmatiDn frDm the ABC and SBS annual repDrts, gives an accurate measure of co.mmunity attitudes and CDncerns abDut co.mmercial and natio.nal televisiDn. The ABA regularly repDrts o.n televisiDn and radio. cDmplaints in its ""Update"" magazine and complaints reports are also made public via press release and media comment. (b) I have indicated above that proper statistical records are maintained by all television operators. (c) Procedures already in place, ensure community awareness of all available avenues of complaint  Code requires commercial broadcasters to provide regular on-air information about the code and the complaints procedure. The ABA monitors compliance with this requirement. The ABC promotes community awareness of complaint avenues through a series of television promotions and has distributed widely a pamphlet explaining procedures for lodging a complaint. Avenues for complaints about SBS are publicised through promotions broadcast on SBS Television and SBS Radio. The ABA has published a free complaints pamphlet, advising viewers how to complain about the content of television programs, for distribution to the public and community groups. It also has a 1800 (free call) number in the Telecom White Pages throughout Australia, together with an afterhours answering facility, and a telephone typewriter number to assist hearing impaired people. Civil Aviation Authority: Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation (Question No. 1725)",99
262,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 10 November 1994: (1) Are flying operations managers and inspectors employed by the Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation (DASR) Division of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) required to keep their flight crew licences current to be able to undertake their duties; if so, what are the requirements for keeping their licences current. (2) What was the experience of each flying operations manager and inspector in (a) aircraft class, (b) aircraft type and (c) operations for which the officer is now individually and directly responsible for maintaining safety surveillance programs before the officer was employed by the CAA or its predecessors. (3) Do any DASR flying operations managers and inspectors who receive flying training or line flying experience from the same or a subsidiary aviation company or organisation in respect of which they are also individually and directly responsible for undertaking safety surveillance; if so, in each case, since May 1991 (a) how many (i) nonconformance notices, (ii) risk observation reports, (iii) operational complaint forms or (iv) the preceding equivalent CAA documents, were issued against the aviation company by the officer and (b) how many (i) nonconformance notices, (ii) risk observation reports, (iii) aircraft survey reports,(iv) major defect reports, (v) aircraft safety incident reports or (vi) the preceding equivalent CAA documents were issued against the same company by other technical disciplines in the same area. (4) Was the Safety Regulation and Standards (SR&S) Division the forerunner of the DASR Division. (5) Was a review of staffing resources conducted in May 1991; if so, immediately before the review, what was the (a) total number of staff employed in the SR&S Division, (b) total number of central office staff of the SR&S Division in Canberra and (c) the percentage of total SR&S Division staff represented by the central office staff. (6) What is (a) the total number of central office DASR Division staffand (b) the percentageoftotal DASR Division staff they represent. (7) How many DASR Division staff are not employed in the central office. (8) Have 57 new DASR Division positions been approved; if so, (a) what was the (i) number and (ii) percentage reduction in the staff establishment between the period immediately before the May 1991 review and the period immediately before the approval of the new positions and (b) how many of the new positions have been allocated to the central office in Canberra and each of the regional and district offices in the remainder of Australia. (9) Does the allocation of staff resources in the DASR Division indicate a central office hegemony which exacerbates reduced standards of aviation safety.",102
263,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Civil Aviation Authority has provided the following advice: (1) All DASR flying operations managers and inspectors are required to keep their flight crew licences current except for three flying operations managers (MFOs) based in Canberra. (2) The CAA does not have information readily at hand to identify the experience of each flying operations manager and inspector within the scope of this question. All Flying Operations Inspectors who are required to conduct surveillance or regulatory service activities on a particular aircraft type in use by airline(s) are endorsed on that type. In non-airline areas, inspectors may not be endorsed on all aircraft types for which they are responsible. (3) Yes. All line flying arrangements with air operators are formalised under a legal contract. Regional and District Managers are charged with ensuring that there is no conflict of interest in respect of Flying Operations Inspectors (FOI) undertaking line flying under these contracts. Surveillance of all operators is conducted in accordance with standardised procedures contained in the surveillance manual (ASSP manual). Provision is made in this manual for surveillance of an operator to be reduced where an FOI is conducting line flying with that operator. The basis for this arrangement is that the FOI, even when line flying, has an obligation as an officer of the Authority to report on observations made in relation to the operator's level of compliance with standards. Comprehensive guidance material is provided in the ASSP manual. (a)&(b) The CAA does not have information readily at hand to identify every non-conformance and safety report issued by DASR inspectors within the scope of questions (a) and (b). (4) Yes. (5)(a) 736.
