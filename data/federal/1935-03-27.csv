0,NA,Unknown,"Internationale, of which. Mr J. M. Harcourt is president in Melbourne and Miss Katherine Susannah Prichard is president in Sydney. The vice-president of the Writers' Internationale is Miss Jean Devanny who, like Mr Harcourt, had an indecent book, The Butcher's Shop, prohibited. At a meeting of the Writers' League in Sydney on the 8th March, Mr. Harcourt took the chair and executive officers and a strong committee were appointed. Though it may have other objectives, this organization undoubtedly has Communist affiliation, and I bring in the names of those concerned only because it is essential that many who believe that Communist approaches are made mainly among the unemployed and Dy militant tactics adopted in the trade unions, should know that intellectuals, particularly agnostics and free-thinkers, are not forgotten and are catered for by constant reiteration that their cultural development is in some way being cramped. [Leave to continue given'.] I find it difficult to decide exactly where the parties in opposition stand on this matter. I appreciate the fact that militant tactics are adopted in some unions. But even so, would honourable members opposite allow the entry into Australia of anything that might emanate from Communist sources? Is any line of demarcation drawn by them? Would they, for example, countenance doctrines such as those that are espoused in Kropotkvn's H evolutionary Pamphlets' . 1",40
1,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,They were written twenty years before the communist movement came into existence.,40
2,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"A typical extract from these pamphlets readsThe first duty of the revolution will be to m;ike a bonfire of all existing laws as it of all titles to property. The Labour party supported the proclamation prohibiting the entry into Australia of all forms of literature suggesting the overthrow of government by revolutionary means, the abolition of all forms of law, and incitement to assassination, yet during its occupancy of the Treasury bench it allowed all kinds of literature to freely come in. I have been through the files. They show that, in the Senate, 'Senator Rae sought to ascertain when the entry of certain literature would be permitted. He said "" For several days I have asked a question regarding the removal of the embargo upon certain literature, and have been promised that something would be done."" On the very next day, the then Attorney-General drafted a new proclamation which placed complete power in the hands of the Minister, and from that day the proclamation prohibiting the entry of certain literature became a dead letter. Although the people of Australia believed that the Government of the day stood for the exclusion of literature of that type, I have not been able to find the record of the prohibition of a single publication.",40
3,Mr SCUXMN,Unknown,That is not so.,40
4,Mr WHITE,Unknown,I should like to be informed of what was kept out. Mr ScuLLrw - The indecent book that you mentioned a little while ago was banned by my Government.,40
5,Mr WHITE,Unknown,I agree that the Government led by the right honourable gentleman did take a proper stand in connection with indecent literature. I was referring to seditious literature.,40
6,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,It would have to be pretty seditious before I would prohibit it.,40
7,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"I appreciate the honourable member's point of view, and said so when he was Attorney-General. It may be contended that the good sense of our citizens may be trusted to discard what is either harmful or dangerous. But even if that be true, it is beside the point. Laws are made to be carried out, and are framed for the good of society in the aggregate. I have no doubt that the majority of the people of Australia are proof against subversive propaganda. There are, however, minds that are will capable of being influenced by specious approaches, with results that are injurious, not only to themselves, but also to the State; and it is both the right and the duty of the Government to protect them. The depths to which Communist propaganda would sink-and this applies also to books printed in England, where much of the Communist propaganda is produced-is shown in what purports to be a children's book, wherein religion, the law, the Empire, and every tradition revered in England are held up to ridicule and reproach. The production of books is so great that much of what is published does not come' under official notice. But there is a censorship in Great Britain. I could enumerate a long list of books that have been banned there. I have here a book containing matter that is intended to be assimilated by children or by childish minds. It contains an alphabet from which I shall make some quotations. According to this alphabet-"" E stands for Empire, built upon blood"", opposite which is a pictorial representation of a man being hanged. The next iB "" F is for Fascists, a murderous brood"", opposite that letter is a pile of skulls surmounted by a Union Jack, with a British officer with drawn sword standing alongside. It says that "" H is the holocaust, we'll fight to end "", "" J is for Jail, where good rebels are held "", "" K stands for Kremlin, where our Stalin lives "". "" E revolution, we're going to win ""-flag s being shown bearing the captions "" A 'Soviet Britain "" and ""Workers unite""-and "" Y is for you, who will know how to fight""-a number of children being shown shouting "" Soviets for Britain "". Does any honourable member defend such a book as that? If the Labour party will not denounce the Communists, we shall do so, and also see that the law is enforced. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Martens) evidently misunderstood me when I said that he might speak on behalf of the Italians in the north. I made no reflection upon those people, but merely referred to the Communist propaganda in North Queensland, concerning which Italians had approached me when I was in the Herbert electorate recently. I am sorry that the honourable member is not in the chamber to hear this explanation. I suggest that he should support a policy which aims at the exclusion from Australia of certain literature printed in foreign languages, some of which is intended for Italians in North Queensland and some for Yugoslavs in Western Australia, but all of it definitely revolutionary and seditious. I have mentioned that nobody is forgotten in the Communist approach. There is special literature for Italians, for black races, and for Yugoslavs who are members of the Cultural and Educational Club in Perth- a body which, I believe, has Communist leanings. It has written to me stating that it supports the protest which has been made against the banning of any ' literature. Such action, it says, lowers Australia's prestige in the eyes of the world, and interferes with Australia's intellectual advancement. Have we not read similar expressions of opinion in the press ever since the first meeting of the Book Abolition League in November last ? This is a subject of which we want to hear the end, from whatever source it emanates, so that the people will no longer be hoodwinked. The Labour Government, led by the present Leader of the Opposition, banned 147 indecent books out of a total of 294 that had been banned up to the end of 1931. At that time a censorship board was not inexistence, the banning or otherwise of any work being the prerogative of the Minister for Trade and Customs. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) knows what a difficult task it was.",40
8,Mr FORDE,Unknown,He did his work well.,41
9,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"I admit that he did in regard to the indecent books. But although, under a proclamation, certain literature was definitely prohibited from coming into Australia, that power was not exercised, because of action that had been taken by the Attorney-General of the day.",41
10,Mr FORDE,Unknown,That is not true.,41
11,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,41
12,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Some honourable members of the Opposition have challenged my statement that the proclamation issued during the regime of the Scullin Government was a dead letter. I am compelled therefore to refer to the official files to prove it. On the 13th December, 1929, Senator Bae made the following statement:For several days I have had a question on the notice-paper relating to the removal of the embargo upon the importation of certain literature, and which has not yet been officially answered. I thought it would be of interest to some honourable senators to know that the Prime Minister personally assured me that the embargo is to be removed, and that the people of Australia will now be free to read what they wish. On the 16th December, a few days later, the then Attorney-General, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), wrote as follows to the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) :. I am forwarding herewith, as requested, draft proclamation under the Customs Act 1901-1925, relating to the importation of certain literature. The d r a f t provides that the Minister for Trade and CustomB may give his consent to the importation of any such literature, and it w i ll also be noted that the existing proclamation of lfith June, 1921, has been amended in certain other directions. I now quote the proclamation, which reads as follows:Whereas by the Customs Act 1901-1925, it is enacted that all goods the importation of which may be prohibited by proclamation are prohibited imports . . . And whereas it is desirable to revoke the said proclamation and make other provision in lieu thereof: Now therefore I , John Lawrence, Baron Stonehaven, the Governor General aforesaid, acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council, do hereby revoke the said proclamation and do hereby prohibit, except with the consent of the Minister of State for Trade and Customs, the importation into the Commonwealth of Australia of any literature wherein is advocated :(a) the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of any State; (6) the overthrow by force or violence of all forms of law; (e) the assassination of public officials; or (</) the unlawful destruction of property. This proclamation may be cited as Customs Proclamation No. 181 - (T. & C. 2 9 B / 2 8 8 0 . ) Given under my hand and the seal of the Commonwealth at Canberra, this seventeenth day of December, One thousand nine hundred And twenty-nine, and in the twentieth year ef His Majesty's reign. By His Excellency's Command, for Minister of State for Trade and Customs. That was published a day after the letter of the Attorney-General. Then a question was put to the Minister regarding his intention in connection with future admissions, and he replied, by telegram, to the following effect:(a) Permit all literature printed in foreign languages. (6) Permit all literature printed in Great Britain and freely circulated therein. (c) Permit all literature printed in the English-speaking dominions. (d) Literature printed in English in United States, other foreign countries and other dominions to be examined and submitted to me for decision. The next thing I find is that Kropothin's Revolutionary Pamphlets and other Mr White. . , revolutionary books were brought under the notice of the Minister of the department, and his minute on the matter was "" No action."" In addition, I find that scores of publications previously banned as seditious were thus automatically admitted during the dangerous regime of the Lang Government in New South Wales. I wish tc make it quite clear that publications alleged to be indecent, blasphemous and obscene are dealt with by the board, but literature alleged to be seditious is dealt with by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Trade and Customs. I have a long list before me of books banned by previous administrations but admitted by the Scullin Administration. I think I heard the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) say previously, by interjection, that he would not prohibit the entry of seditious books. Yet books of that description are prohibited entry, but for very good reasons. As an example of the kind of statement that is objected to, T quote the following excerpt from Towards the World October:Under the banners of the proletarian revolution the Red class front is being spread and organized for the fight, against the dictatorship of capital, for the dictatorship^ of the proletariat. Mighty mass demonstrations, strikes, mutinies among the soldiers in imperialist armies, revolutionary street fighting-all signalize the growing revolutionary will to fight. In a number of countries, in Germany, Poland and England the wave of revolution is already assuming the character of a stormy mass movement . . The signs betoken a storm I The F. M . FOBDB working class of the capitalist world understands these signs, and is arming for an intensified struggle of the revolutionary masses, relying on the experiences of the victorious October revolution, towards the victorious world October. The honourable member for Cook (Mr. Garden) said that he could not buy a copy, of The Class Struggle in Britain, by Ralph Fox. I have a copy of that publication before me, and it is definitely revolutionary. It is banned, yet it was obtained from the Rawson Book Shop, 169 Exhibition-street, Melbourne, the proprietor of which is the treasurer of the Book Censorship Abolition League. I have here the receipt.",41
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Minister's time has expired.,42
14,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"Bourke) [8.5] - - I should like to have spoken earlier in this debate so that I could have accepted the challenge which the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) threw down when he invited honourable members to attack the censorship on principle and as a whole. I disagree with the censorship upon principle, as a whole. I do not think that any self-respecting country can endure a system under which the right of the people to read whatever they like can be taken away from them by men sitting behind closed doors and without examination in public. I believe that canons of judgment change from time to time. Our ideas of what is sedition change; so do our ideas of what is blasphemy and our ideas of what is obscenity. If any honourable member doubts this I invite him to refer to Sir James Stephen's A Digest of the Criminal Law, in which he will find set out under separate headings, first, the old view of the old law, supported by authority, and next the modern conception of the law. The modern conception has been made possible only by the fact that courts of law, particularly courts sitting with juries, have refused to convict men who under the old view of the law would be guilty. An illustration of the change of opinion is found in the fact that at the end of the eighteenth century Thomas Paine was prosecuted for publishing a seditious libel. Had he not fieri to Prance be would have been convicted. To-day the memory of Thomas Paine is revered and his work-The Rights of Man-is freely read and has inspired thousands. We have also an entirely different standard today for determining what is blasphemy. Men who today discuss, decorously and seriously, theological and doctrinal principles would have paid a very severe penalty had they ao discussed them not so many years ago. The standard of obscenity has changed also. A person may today go to almost any bookstall and buy .Flaubert's masterpiece, Madame Bovary, but in the fifties Flaubert was prosecuted in France for having written it- a prosecution which was so protracted that it was, in effect, persecution. Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass was a book banned by the Post Office of the United States of America. It could not be carried through the mail. A similar ban has been placed upon many other notable books in various countries. Havelock Ellis's great work Studies in the Psyclwlogy of Sex was ""once a banned book, but every one who has read it knows what a valuable and usef u l work it is, and how the study of such a book may make life easier and simpler for the rising generation. The fact that standards have changed cannot be doubted. In the circumstances in which we now find ourselves, Ministers and bureaucrats, sitting behind closed doors, should not be allowed to decide what publications are seditious, blasphemous and obscene. Such questions should be determined by courts, preferably courts with juries. No one in England can say today what constitutes sedition. We are able to do so in Australia because the Commonwealth statute has followed the Queensland code in adopting the modern view. But we have been well reminded by a former English Chief Justice. Lord Coleridge, that in the eighteenth century people were sent to gaol, and even transported for having argued dispassionately as to the merits of hereditary monarchy. As to obscenity, I shall give an illustration from our own times to show how views differ. Some honourable members will remember that a man named Chidley was prosecuted and convicted in Sydney for an obscene publication. He appealed to the F u l l Court, the majority of which upheld the conviction; but 'tinminority judge, that learned Chief Justice Sir Will i a m Cullen, held that d u d ley's book was not obscene. Chidley attempted to appeal to the H i gh Court, and actually obtained special leave to do so. The majority of the High Court later rescinded the' special leave to appeal. They held that a conviction should not be appealed from unless the decision in volved a grave miscarriage of justice. They did not hold that the conviction was right : they merely held that it - was not unreasonable. The dissenting judge was the Chief Justice who thought that the appeal should have been heard. This difference of opinion shows that each man makes his own definition of obscenity. What is clean to one man is unclean to another. What to one man is a socially useful discussion of matters of public importance is to another man merely filth. In this connection I quote the following expression of opinion by an American, who has spent most of his life fighting the Federal Post Office on this matter. Theodore Schroeder saysObscenity is not a quality inherent in a book but solely and exclusively a contribution of the reading mind, and hence cannot be defined in terms of the qualities of a book. That may be regarded as a rather extreme statement, but it is a fact that obscenity depends largely upon the mind of the person who reads a book, his training, and the repressions he has been under. I suppose many honourable members will recollect the time when Nathaniel Hawthorne's book The Scarlet Letter was regarded as obscene and unfit for young men and women to read. I recollect an amusing story of Rhoda Broughton, who lived for a very long time. She said that when she was young her books were thought to be almost as dangerous as the books of Zola, but the third generation considered her work as uninteresting and inoffensive as the works of Charlotte Tonge. said, "" ""When I was young I was Zola, and now that I am older, I am Yonge"". The fact is, of course, that there should be the greatest freedom of discussion of these subjects. dom of discussion is always hindered and repression set up by men sitting behind closed doors who give no account of their doings to the public. If the circulation of any book is to be prohibited, it should be done only after a public investigation of its merits by a judge, sitting preferably with a jury, examining the matter and taking evidence upon it. It should not be done by a Minister or any official. Mr LANE:-How many courts would be needed to decide whether books should be read or not read?",43
15,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"My honourable friend is surely aware that a very large number of books classed as obscene, blasphemous and seditious, and appearing on the Minister's index expwrgatorius, are sold every day. At bookstalls in Melbourne and in other cities many books can be purchased which are more obscene and allegedly have a greater tendency to corrupt than many of the banned books. I know this because I have read some of the banned books and a great many others. Those who want to find obscene literature can find it anywhere. I remember Sir William Windeyer referring to one of Mrs Besant's books in 1889, and saying that if people want to read obscene matter, they can find it in Lempriere's Dictionary or even in the Bible. The honourable member for Barton (Mr. Lane), if he were ever young, would know that this is so. The banning of books should always be a matter for investigation. I am not attacking the Minister or his administration of the law. It was provided in 1902 that blasphemous, indecent and obscene books should not be imported, and regulations have been made to deal with allegedly seditious books. It is the Minister's duty, no doubt, to carry out the law to the best of his ability, but the responsibility for the condition of the law rests upon Parliament, and Parliament should no longer be satisfied with the law as it is.",44
16,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,How would the honourable member carry out his proposal in She view of the fact that thousands of books come into Australia every year? Would he set up special courts?,44
17,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, very few proceedings are taken in FreeEngland or anywhere else today on subjects relating to osbscenity and blasphemy. What happens is that as soon as a book is placed on the index expwrgatorius, or it is suspected that it has been placed there people become very keen to read it. If the Minister desired to do anything he could co-operate with the State authorities and recommend that the book in question be the subject of police action and subsequent public trial.",44
18,Mr WHITE,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that that would be practicable in six States?,44
19,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"As an alternative, I suggest that the Minister himself might provide for a public investigation of the merits of the book. [Leave to continue given.] If the Minister's officers report that a book is likely to come within one of the prohibited categories there is nothing to prevent him from intimating, not only to the importer, but also to the publisher, that they will have an opportunity to demonstrate at a public judicial inquiry that it is not of an undesirable character. If that were done it would remove a great many objections.",44
20,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,And would the honourable member allow a ful l report of. the evidence at such proceedings to be published in the press?,45
21,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"I would. I remind the honourable member that we used to allow ful l reports of evidence in divorce cases to be published in the press. Those reports were more injurious to the young than the prohibited books. The great evil of the present procedure is that the vital part of it takes place behind closed doors. No one really wants to import books which, in fact, are wholly devoted to the objects condemned by the regulations or by the Crimes Act. But, on the other hand, men should be free to read what has been said in criticism of the prevailing ideas of social organizationeven though such criticism may lead its students to believe that our social organization should be fundamentally changed. The Minister should not have the right to determine that any book falls within the prohibited categories, and that, therefore, its introduction into Australia will be forbidden. For instance, an English magazine, the Labour Monthly, which was on the Library table in our State parliament was at the same time on the Minister's index. Who prohibited it I do not know. It was stopped at the customs, and came to our house by post. For some years, I had read it regularly, and, while it was prohibited, I read it intermittently. I could not see how it could be brought within section 14 a of the Crimes Act, or within these regulations. It is true that some man might think the magazine could be brought within the seotion of these regulations, just as at the beginning of federation Reynolds' Newspaper was prohibited as a seditious publication, but whether it comes within the section should be the subject of judicial determination after a public investigation.",45
22,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Does the honourable member know of any book which he back thinks should be banned?,45
23,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"I do not. I am accepting the position that the law this country prohibits the circulation of certain books and writings. But it is desirable, I think, that there should be as much freedom as possible. I do not know of any book that ought to be banned, or of any modern novel that is more obscene than books which today have an unquestioned place upon the shelves of public libraries and are accessible to all people.",45
24,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.20] - by leave- ^ On the question of secrecy to which the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) has just referred, I point out that, so far as ordinary literature is concerned, there is an appeal to a censorship board. That right has operated since 1933. So far as seditious and revolutionary publications are concerned, there is a right of appeal to any court within four months of the date on which any such literature is detained by the Customs Department, and this appeal applies also to any that is deemed to be indecent, blasphemous or obscene. In all cases, the importer concerned may notify the department that he proposes to have the matter tested in a court of law, and if he can prove then that the publication in question is not seditious, revolutionary, indecent, blasphemous, or obscene, the book is admitted and the importer may proceed with its distribution in the ordinary way. I , and, I am sure, any honourable member who happened to be the Minister in office when the application was made, would facilitate access to the court in such cases. This procedure, I contend, is much simpler than that suggested by the honourable member for Bourke in that it does not necessitate action in six different States. The point of entry at the customs is considered to be the best place of stoppage. I submit that the present system is much simpler than that suggested by the honourable member. It has also been constantly asserted that books are confiscated and burned when prohibited by the department. That is not so. Any books that are banned arc returned to the importer who is free to send them to their source, and receive credit for them. Mr BLACKBURN.*-The act provides of that they are forfeited to the Crown. .' Mr WHITE - Some of them are, but the course generally taken is similar to that adopted with regard to other goods which may be inadvertently imported. Where it is known definitely that such books are being brought in surreptitiously then they come within the ordinary category of smuggled goods, and are forfeited t.n the Crown. I propose now to quote statistics which will be of much interest to honourable members. This debate is important to all of us. Honourable mem- hers want to understand fully the reason for the agitation that has sprung up. The position has been largely misunderstood, and very often misrepresented. course to be followed in respect of seditious and revolutionary literature is laid down by statute, and the Government would practically be guilty of treachery to the people if it did not carry out the statute law. Since federation, only some 400 books, including the pamphlets, newspapers and typewritten statements to which I have already referred, have been prohibited, or an average of one a month. Since 1921, even including seditious and revolutionary literature the average of prohibitions during the most intensive period of censorship has been only about six or seven publications per. month. Having regard to these facts honourable members will agree that the number is comparatively small. Students desirous of reading sociological or political works can secure them. In many cases cheap paper editions are prohibited, but the pviblie may have aceess to such works in our public libraries. Honourable members will agree that tlii-5 is an unusual agitation, and it is well that it should be discussed. The debate has thrown a good deal of light on the whole subject, and particularly on the manner in which the art is administered If any change is desirable it can be properly discussed in Parliament. ready to confer with any honourable member who thinks he can suggest an improvement of the present system, but 1 do not think that anything brought out. in today's debate, shows that the net i« not jusi and fair, or not properly administered. Hr. MCCALL (Martin) [8.25] - I have, listened with a great deal of interest to this discussion, and would not have risen at this late hour, but that I desire to refer to one or two statements made by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn). Before proceeding to do so, however, I wish to congratulate the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Holloway) on the manner in which he presented his case. In this respect, [ believe, he has earned the commendation of members on both sides of the House. First of all, the honourable member for Bourke stated that much that in times gone by was considered to be heterodox was orthodox today. In that view, I am sure, honourable members will entirely The concur. Much that was looked upon in days gone by as seditious has the approbation of most sections of the community at the present time. Those responsible for the censorship of books are sensible of the changing public point of view on various questions, and are not, as the honourable member for Bourke seemed to suggest, of an archaic type of mind. I put it to the House that they take into consideration contemporary opinion, and the change in public thought as time goes on, and consequently, allowing for that outlook, permit such books to outer as they consider to be in the interests of the people as a whole. 1 rose particularly to comment on statements made by the honourable member for Bourke because he is the only speaker from the other side who has dealt particularly with obscene writings. I hold st.roTig views on that phase of ths question. While I have what may be regarded as lenient views on writings dealing with economic and political problems, I hold definitely that it is not very difficult, so far as pornographic writings are concerned, for a normal, well-balanced mind to judge what literature may prove harmful to the community. The honorI am able member for Bourke. has suggested that this question should be left to the decision of various tribunals. I think that such a course is unnecessary. It is well known that a certain degenerate section among the distributors of literature exploit the public, their sole purpose being to profit at the exponse of those whose state of mind is'not on a par with that of members of this House. There are at all times in our midst people who are decidedly influenced by licentious writings, and to allow any one to prey on the minds of such people is not in the interest of the public. On this matter I cannot do better than read the following quotation from the Bulletin, of the 6th .March:'Pornography in art means the concentration of the mind on one aspect of Hie for its saku, and the exclusion of all other aspects. This concentration finds its extreme expression in the sexual pervert and sometimes ends the lunatic asylum, a prison or the gallows. 1 agree with that view and consequently 1 hold that the Government should stand "" porter at the door of thought"" we desire to resist the evil effects circulation of pornographic literature. Therefore, I do not agree with the view expressed by the honourable member for Bourke. I consider the Government''; policy in this respect has been justified, and that it can be supported by most those who have the well-being of the people at heart. In regard to literature on political and economic problems it might be advanagitation; tageous if the censorship could be divorced as far as possible from party politics. There is good cause for comquestion plaint when members of certain parties consider that the authority of censorship is influenced by the representations of party to which that authority at some particular time is confined, and there for"" that that authority is prone to view certain works from a biased standadopted point. It is impossible to eradicate a possibility under the present system. However, if any thing could be done rectify the position in this respect would be in the public interest to change this form of government control. wrong. The present system is by no means but this debate has given honourable memorganizations, bers an opportunity to elicit from the Minister a great deal of information viously unknown to them. During the objects early stages of the debate quite a numwrong. ber of speakers did not appear to underhe stand fully the policy of the Government, but the Minister's speech considerably clarified the situation.",45
25,Mr BAKER,Unknown,"Griffith) [8.29] - I join with other honourable members in proor testing against the present method of tills censorship of publications. The dissatisfaction that has existed for some time was brought to a head very recently by resolutions carried at the Australian Science Congress, and the Summer School of the Australian Institute of Political Science, as well as by the formation of various leagues in Melbourne and own in Brisbane for the purpose of protesting against this particular form of in censorship. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) concentrated upon two points. The first was an endeavour to deal with the prohibition of indecent and obscene literature, and the second if an endeavour to prove a connection of the between communism and the organizations protesting against the present system of preventing the entry of literature into this country. Taking the latter point first the position is that the censorship leagues which have been formed comof prise many men distinguished in science and literature, whose names are household words in this country.",47

Clause 2Section seventeen of the principal act is amended by omitting paragraph (f a ) . Section proposed to be amended17. No person shall receive an old-age pension unless[fa) he has not, within the period of five years preceding the date of his pension claim, transferred, otherivise than bona fide for value, property of any kind exceeding in value in the aggregate the sum of One hundred pounds: Provided that if the claimant satisfies the Commissioner that any such transfer of property, though not made for value, was a 22 reasonable gift vn the circumstances existing at the time, the 34 claimant shall not, by reason of that transfer, be ineligible for the 8 grant of a pension;",49

While I do not hold a brief for bad characters, I claim that once a has been sentenced by a court for an offence, and has served that sentence, shotild not be further punished by the Pensions Department. An old man may have a few drinks, not necessarily Ids pension money, but at the invitation of a friend, and, having the misfortune to become drunk, he is picked up by the police, and is subsequently convicted. Such a man may lose his pension for months or twelve months, and, in one case drunkenness. of which I know, the pension was lost two years. That is the worse form punishment that could be inflicted him; it is sentencing him to starvation because he is unable to work owing age and infirmity.",50
45,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"Corio-Actin g Treasurer) [8.53] - The honourable member moved an amendment, the effect of which is that the possession of good character shall no longer be a qualification for old-age pension. I* n as been held in this House, and not least strongly by members of the Opposition, that a pension is a reward for good citizenship. If the honourable member's amendment were carried, a pension might be payable to any person, whether or not he had been a good citizen. This parasuch graph, as is the case with all other visions of the act, is administered with a good deal of sympathy by the Cominto missioner and Deputy Commissioners. I can best illustrate this by quoting one example. In 192S, a man was charged with the murder of his wife in peculiarly disgusting circumstances. Owing to evidence being largely circumstantial, the man was not convicted of murder, but of manslaughter. He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, but, after serving a part of that time, he released on licence. He had had a good .character while in gaol, and wh^n he pension. came out, being qualified by age, he applied for the old-age pension. J - I Commissioner learned from the prison authorities that his conduct in gaol had words been excellent, but, being somewhat in doubt about the matter, he discussed it of secwith me, and it was decided that the a man's application for a pension should It was held that he had redeemed his character, and that he was person qualified to receive a pension.",50
46,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,How long after he was he released did he receive his pension?,50
47,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"I do not know exactly, but it could not have been very long. with He served about five years. There are other cases, however, in which the Commissioner cannot be lenient. I refer particularly to cases of confirmed drunkards, men who are being six repeatedly convicted on charges of In one case that was for brought under my notice a pensioner was of convicted of drunkenness and lost his upon pension. After a sufficient time had elapsed he applied for his pension again, to and it was restored. He was again, convicted, and lost his pension. Again he applied for it, and while the matter was still under consideration he was convicted has no fewer than three times for drunkenness. In such circumstances, it would be a waste of public money to continue an paying him a pension, because it would frequently be spent on drink.",50
48,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,That could be got over by paying the money to a warrantee.,50
49,Mr CASEY,Unknown,That can be done only with the consent of the pensioner.,50
50,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"The act provides for an arrangement, and the department proinsists upon it in certain cases.",50
51,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"I do not want to get a detailed argument on a side issue. This provision in the act is necessary; indeed, the act would be gravely defective without it. It is administered with sympathy, and I think that all decent the people are fairly treated under it.",50
52,Mr RIORDAN,Unknown,"Kennedy) [8.58] - I should like to know in what State the man mentioned by the Acting Treasurer was (Mr Casey) was sentenced for manslaughter, and subsequently received a I am fairly certain that it could not have been Queensland. The The Acting Treasurer said that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) wanted to make pensions payable to persons of bad character, and he added that it was never intended that that should be done. I do not think it was the contention of the honourable member that pensions should be paid to murderers. The point is that the man had paid the penalty for his crime by, serving a term in prison, and should not thereafter be pui'sued. Reference has been made to the payment of pensions to persons convicted of drunkenness. I have in mind the case of a man at Hughenden, Queensland, concerning whom the local Church of England clergyman wrote to the Commissioner of Pensions. That man was penalized for practically twelve months because a policeman found him drunk. He was an old bush worker, who had met a number of his mates, who paid for some drinks for him. Unfortunately, after he emerged from the hotel, he met a young policeman, who was looking for promotion. I know of other policemen, not so keen on gaining promotion by such means, who take pensioners to their homes if they find that they have indulged too freely in spirituous liquors. That is a more humane way to treat such persons. Many men who have been bush workers all their lives have little enjoyment in their declining years other than an occasional drink with their friends. ""With liquor at present prices, they are not likely to drink themselves to death on a pension of 17s. 6d. per week.. It is claimed, on behalf of offending pensioners, that it is difficult to get the Pensions Department to take a lenient view of their offences. The department contends that the taxpayers' money should not be granted to men who will squander it. In the cases that I have presented to the department the men ooncorned have not squandered their pensions. A pensioner living at Camooweal has to pay 5s. 6d., - or practically one-third of his week's pension, for a bottle of beer. Similar prices prevail at Burketown, and through the Gulf country generally. Pensioners in those areas are not able to buy large quantities of liquor with their pensions.. The administration should not penalize a man if he is found intoxicated once, but should give him a chance. I hope that the Minister will see that a more lenient view is taken in these cases. I have in mind the case of an old man at Herberton, who is not on friendly terms with the local policeman. Every time he indulges too freely in drink the policeman arrests him. I believe that I was partly responsible for his last lapse, by giving him a couple of drinks, which resulted in the loss of his pension, which has not yet been restored to him. Honourable members may say to me. "" Shame on you for inducing him to drink,"" but I say, "" Shame on the Minister and his officers for depriving the old man of his pension.""",50
53,Mr LANE,Unknown,"Barton) [9.4] - I have a good deal of sympathy with the case presented by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). The pension legislation passed by this Parliament has been administered in a way to which I strongly object. A pensioner who is found guilty of a misdemeanour loses his pension, and has to accept the dole and obtain food relief in order to live. In some cases the administration has shown leniency to offenders. I cite the case of an old man who was deprived of his pension for a month; but, after he had been to the Salvation Army penitentform and the captain had testified to his change of heart, the pension was restored. Unfortunately, such cases are not so general as they might be. I have interested myself in another pensioner who has been convicted on five occasions. Representations have been made to me by worthy citizens that this pensioner is practically crippled in his legs, and has occasionally to sit on the kerbstone, although he may not be drunk. His pension has, however, been stopped on the ground of drunkenness. The magistrate who convicted him recommended that the administration should pay his pension to some one who would use it on his behalf. As a result of investigations which I instituted through a member of the State Parliament, after I was refused the information, I ascertained that the same policeman had always arrested this man. On one occasion he arrested the old man when within 50 yards of his home. The local baker who witnessed the arrest said that the old man, who was driving a sulky, did not constitute a danger either to himself or any one else, because his horse would have taken him home. The same constable not long before bad arrested for drunkenness a man who sat on the kerbstone because be was ill , as was proved by the fact that he died of haemorrhage later in the cell. Although a man sitting on the kerbstone can do little or no harm, there are officious stables who seem to take a delight in arresting him, whereas had they an atom of human kindness in their nature, they would take the unfortunate man by the arm and lead him home. The administration takes a lot of convincing of the reasonableness of requests by members of Parliament that pensions should be restored to persons who have been found guilty of misdemeanours. No one likes to see an old man the worse for liquor, but it takes very little to throw a man of 65 or 70 years of age off his balance. Honourable members who interest themselves in these cases are probably quite as good judges of the . men concerned as is a magistrate who reads their records on paper. There is need for a change of attitude on the part of the administration, for, as things are, members of Parliament have practically to become investigating officers for the department in order that pensioners may be treated justly.",51
54,Mr GARDEN,Unknown,".Cook) [9.10] - I support the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). I have in mind the case of a man who was convicted of an offence, and while in prison became paralysed right down one side. After some time in prison he was released, and subsequently he applied for a pension. The Pensions Department refused his application on the ground that he had been convicted of an offence. I got in touch with the Controller of Prisons, Mr. Hinchley, who appealed to the Pensions Department to grant the man a pension. The Prisoners' Aid Association also made similar representations. This man cannot obtain the dole; he cannot work because of his infirmity; he cannot get food. What is be to do? If it is contended that he was guilty of an offence, the reply is that he has paid the penalty for his crime. I hope that the Minister will consider such cases.",52
55,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [9.12] - I have a good deal of sympathy with the principle involved in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). I "" see no reason for providing in a statute, as a condition precedent to the granting of a pension, that a man must be of good character to entitle him to receive it. I hope that con- no one will assume from that statement that I am necessarily advocating that men of bad character should be paid pensions out of the revenues of the Commonwealth ; but I point out that it is quite a novel procedure to provide that a man, whose right to a pension is otherwise sustained, must prove to the satisfaction of the commissioner that he is of good character. This Parliament should not set itself up as a censor of the people's morals. There are abundant laws in this country to ensure that the conduct of its citizens conforms to certain standards, and there is ample provision within the law for punishing those who depart from those standards. Those laws are not invoked with hesitation against the poor in the community; certainly they are not invoked with discrimination in their favour. There is no just principle upon which we may employ this vague term "" good character "". It is not necessary to prove good character to become a member of Parliament. Indeed, it may be difficult of fulfilment in the case of some of us. The possession of good character is not stipulated as a condition for membership of the Public Service, and in fact is not usually specifically set out anywhere. Good character is assumed until something is proven against a man to establish that he is of bad character or unworthy to receive a benefit to which he is otherwise entitled. It is a very vague phrase. There are other clauses relating to convictions for drunkenness and repeated convictions for other offences, to which I can make only the most casual reference. I maintain that in every one of those cases the pensioner, having suffered the penalty which the law imposes upon him, should not be further punished. What is meant by good character? Why appoint a tribunal which, behind closed doors, may decide that one man is of good character and another is not of sufficiently good character to receive a pension? We should not be concerned with these moral considerations, except in so far as moral offences constitute a breach of the law. One commissioner may have exceedingly strong views on intemperance; another may take the saner view that intemperance is very often, if not always, a ""disease in respect of which the patient should be pitied rather than condemned. We are too often told that the pension is an act of charity, and that we, as a benevolent institution, bestow the money upon people who, having no right to it , yet receive it as the result of .the taxpayers' generosity. The qualifications of a pensioner are set out in the law, comprising his length of residence, capacity to maintain himself, the extent of his property, and a variety of other things which make it not too easy for any old person to get the pension. Apart from that, the man or woman is, like any other citizen, amenable to the strict laws of the land. We should not allow this vague phrase regarding goodness or badness of character, which may moan anything-on e thing to some persons and quite another to others - to be adopted as a qualification, especially as the decision must depend upon ' the varying views of different persons upon moral questions. Those persons will form their opinions in secret, and without being called upon to j u s t if y their decisions.",52
56,Mr CLARE,Unknown,"Darling ) [ 9 . 1 9 ] - I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . James). During my short term in Parliament a number of cases of pensions being refused on the ground of bad character have come before me. In two instances I have known the persons concerned for some time and consider that they are justly entitled to the pension. An y person who loses his pension under this clause cannot work, and must find himself facing starvation. One man who was convicted of theft many years ago has been refused a pension because of that conviction. Another case which came before me last week is that of an old woman who was refused a pension on the ground of bad character. Both these are cases of real hardship. As regards the proposal to omit section 17 / a, I should like to bring certain cases under the notice of the Minister and to receive an assurance from him regarding them. One is that of a man at Dubbo. He applied for the pension, and was turned down on the ground that he had had a certain amount of money and had spent it in a way which the law did not allow. I wish to be assured that that man's case will be dealt with, and his pension granted, under section 17 for 17 g. Section 17 of the principal act provides thatNo person shall receive an old-age pension unless(/) he has not directly or indirectly deprived himself of property or income in order to qualify for or obtain a pension; and (//) he has not at any time within six months been refused a pension certificate except for the reason that he was disqualified on account of his ago or for reasons which are not in existence at the time of the further application. This man should be able to get his pension under those provisions. The facts are that nearly five years ago he received from the estate of his late mother the sum of £446 ISs. 4d. He admits that he received and spent the money. He says that he notified the Deputy Registrar of the fact and that he has been penalized for being truth f u l and honest in the matter. He addsAt the time. I received the money I had a son and daughter who were out of employment and owing to their ages they could not obtain Government food relief, and in addition I was compelled to assist my married son, his wife and two children, and by doing this I have to suffer now. I am now and have been for the past four years without a shilling to call my own and have existed on Government food relief. I am a total cripple and have to depend on neighbours once a fortnight to carry me to their cart and drive mo to the police station to receive my dole allowance. This is a case of absolute hardship. 1 made a strong appeal to the Deputy Registrar to grant this man a pension. He has been an honest and honourable citizen and spent the money left to him on the upkeep of his f a m i l y who were in need at the time. I received the following reply from the departmentWith reference to your further representations in this case, I have to say that the whole of the circumstances have been carefully considered, but I am sorry it is not possible to avoid the provision of section 17/a of the act with regard to money or property transferred otherwise than bona fide and for value. claimant dispossessed himself of £1,000 to assist his relatives who were in need. . . . Under all the circumstances, therefore, I am sorry that the pension claim cannot be further considered until a period of five years has elapsed since he disposed of his money. I desire an assurance from the Minister that this man will be favourably dealt with under paragraphs / and g of section 17, seeing that section 17/a is no longer to be allowed to apply. It is only just that a man who has spent his money in this way should be treated with leniency. He has not dispossessed himself of it for the specific purpose of getting the pension and has not spent it in an unjustifiable way. There is another case which I wish to bring before the Minister. I should like to know whether it comes under paragraph c of section 17, which the honourable member for Hunter wishes to delete. The reply I received in this case, which is that of a man whose pension was stopped last November, was as follows:With reference to your personal inquiries concerning the rate of pension due to the above-named, T. have to say that in November last it was brought under notice that the pensioner was away from Dubbo, and it was inferred that he was teaching dancing, acrobatics, &c. That is a rather humourous reply to receive in relation to an old-age pensioner. I think this case must come under the bad character clause, the department perhaps thinking that no person of good character could be associated with the teaching of dancing or acrobatics. The departmental letter further saysHis pension was therefore suspended. Subsequently on your representations the case was re-heard and a pension granted to commence from the 1.4th February. After further representations I managed to have the pension restored right back to November. The point I wish to make is that in many cases the act.is not administered in a sympathetic manner. men who have the task of administering it find themselves tied by regulations which are unfair in their application. Paragraph c of section 17 should certainly be repealed, so that any person who is suffering under it at the present time may receive justice from the department. Mr Clark.",53
57,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [9.25] This section of the act very often brings The about serious hardship, owing to the severity with which it has to be administered. In one case the man was convicted on circumstantial evidence in a court in Adelaide, and served his sentence. He proved a most exemplary prisoner, and came out with the best of records. He sought the restoration of his pension, but the department says that no further consideration can be given until June next. He is an invalid, and finds it increasingly difficult to secure the necessities that he requires. He has come to me several times in a state of desperation. Is not such a man likely to be driven to do things that he should not do? An y man who tries to rehabilitate himself should be encouraged, instead of being further penalized by being deprived <-<* his pension. I realise that this section deals with claimants rather than those persons who have their pensions suspended, but it is closely related to that section dealing with undeserving .cases. People should not be deprived of the pension on account of acts of intemperance. It cannot be said that such people are of bad character or undeserving. Many of them are most deserving by reason of the services they have given to their country, yet if a man or woman is convicted of drunkenness on two occasions the pension is suspended for six months.",54
58,Mr CLAKK,Unknown,Sometime s for only one occasion.,54
59,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"My experience has been that the pension has been suspended after two convictions. This is unfair, because the offender is not only fined £1 or £2 by the police court for the second offence, but is also deprived by the department of £22 10s. representing six months' pension money. That is not fair . I ask the department to remember that if an aged or invalid person is regarded as unable to exercise proper custody of his pension The. money, the Deputy Commissioner may issue a warrant entitling another person to receive the money on the pensioner's behalf. I therefore support the amendmnt. Mr R0SEVEAB, (Dalley) [9.31] I also support the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). It is unfortunate, from the Government point of view, that the Minister, instead of combating the argument advanced by the honourable member for Hunter, sought to cloud the issue by insinuating that the real intention of the amendment is to make the pension payable to criminals. To support his contention, the Minister cited the case of a man who had been convicted of manslaughter. I take the strongest exception to the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in any State being set up virtually as a censor of morals, with power to - superimpose additional penalties on persons who have already been convicted and - dealt with in accordance with the law. A number of such cases have been brought under my notice by persons who may be regarded as disinterested, in that they are not relatives of the individuals concerned. In. a country town, a conviction for inebriety was recorded against the - oldest resident. He was almost a total .abstainer, but during the Christmas season, he was given drinks by a number of well-wishers, and, for his first offence, pension was stopped. I venture to say that it would have remained unpaid up to the present time had it not been for sentations made to the department through me at the request of business men in the town. The magistrate who tried the case merely sentenced him to be imprisoned until the rising of the court, but the department, by stopping his pension, fined him at the rate of £45 a year!",54
60,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I suggest that the points being debated by members of the Opposition are dealt with substantially under section 51 of the act, and not under the provision now before the committee.  I cannot uphold the point of order. The section proposed to be amended deals with the question of good character, therefore I cannot prevent references to - drunkenness.",55
61,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"To give an idea how far the department is prepared to go in matters of this kind, I shall cite another case-that of a man who was victim of his own lack of knowledge of the dole regulations in New South Wales. In the early stages of food relief in that State, the invalid's pension was regarded as income; but subsequently it was not so treated. For the purpose of food relief, a man, who has three or four children, is ignored as a unit in the family. He neither receives food relief, nor is his income taken into account in calculating the income of the family, although previously an invalid pensioner's money was regarded as permissible income of a recipient of the dole. The invalid's pension, in this case, and the small sum earned by his wife and children, totalled a few shillings a week more than the permissible amount of income, and because of that fact he was summoned before the court. He was not fined the difference between the permissible and actual income, but was called upon to repay the value of the whole of the food relief which he had received over the period. This amounted to a penalty of £20, although there was no previous conviction of any kind against him.",55
62,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Regardin g the his ruling I recently gave, I remind honourable members that, under section 51, reference is made to convictions for repre- drunkenness, and I think that any lengthy reference to that aspect of the matter would be irrelevant.",55
63,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"I am not dealing with the case of a man charged with drunkenness. This person had no previous convictions against him, but, through ignorance of the dole regulations, he fell foul of the law. This incident occurred over two years ago, and the department, superimposed a further penalty upon him by stopping his invalid pension. He has now suffered the loss of his pension for over two years to the total amount of £90.",55
64,Mr CASEY,Unknown,Why did not the honour and able member invoke section 51?,55
65,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"I am invoking the aid of the department at the present time; but why should that be necessary to enable a pensioner to receive simple justice? If a person offends against the a laws of a State he is fined a specific amount, or if he is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, a definite period is mentioned; but when the Pensions Department imposes its penalties, as provided under the act, no specified time is stated.",55
66,Mr CASEY,Unknown,Sectio n 51 deals with the whole matter.,56
67,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"I have actual proof of what I am saying, and that is a good deal more substantial than mere theory. This man's pension was stopped for an indefinite period over two years ago, and, so far as he is aware, no maximum period for which the pension shall be withheld has been fixed. Can the Minister justify such action?",56
68,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"-The action which the honourable member describes is in direct contravention of section 51, so why does he not invoke its aid?",56
69,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"I venture to say that when this case is settled the Minister valid pensions. will not be prepared to see that the back money is paid to this pensioner, if it can be proved that it has been taken from him contrary to section 51. These decisions are never reviewed without outside pressure. I do not know one invalid or old-age pensioner-and there are hundreds of fhem in my electorate-wh o has had his pension stopped, and has had it subsequently renewed without outside pressure, yet the Minister persists in saypractices. ing that the act lays down the period for which persons may be disqualified for the receipt of the pension. If these unfortunate individuals have nobody to make representations on their behalf, the department gives them a life sentence. Once an invalid pensioner is struck off the pension list he is practically left to starve. The dole regulations in New South Wales, which are presumably simi-lar to those in operation in other States, classify an invalid pensioner, not as unemployed, but as unemployable. If the department sees an elderly and sickly unemployed person seeking the dole, it advises him to apply for the pension; but once he becomes an invalid pensioner and is marked down as permanently incapacitated for work, he is no longer regarded as unemployed. He is classed as unemployable and not entitled to the dole. If he commits some paltry offence, the departmental censor of morals, in the shape of the State Registrar, decides that the penalty usually applied to other citizens is not sufficient for the invalid pensioner. When a man who is not a pensioner is arrested for drunkenness and is fined f l , society is satisfied. If , however, he happens to be an invalid pensioner and commits a similar offence, in the view of the censor of morals something further should be done. Why should differentiation be shown in the treatment of these two classes of individuals? The federal department stops the pension, and the State department refuses to recognize the invalid pensioner as unemployed. Of course, he is not prepared to starve, and he can hardly be blamed if he takes part in criminal adventures in order to feed himself. So the treatment of invalid pensioners under this precious section",56

71,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"Le t it apply to old-age pensions, and the position is the same so far as food relief is concerned. I have outlined the treatment which is given to these old people under the pretext that the department is trying to secure a moral community, and refuses to pay pensions to persons of bad character. The stopping of their pensions, however, is conducive to criminal",56
72,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"The case cited by the honourable member is inconsistent with that mentioned by the Minister of a man who, after having served five years' imprisonment for manslaughter, was granted a pension.",56
73,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"That is so. Although that man committed manslaughter, his pension was restored, probably as the result of certain representations. But take the case cited by the honourable member for Cook (Mr. Garden), that of a man who, while an inmate of a gaol, became paralysed right down the right side. Even the Controller of Prisons in New South Wales made representations on his behalf, yet his pension was not restored. There is also the case of the man who, through lack of knowledge of the dole regulations, fell foul of the law, was penalized to an amount of £20, and in addition has had his pension stopped for two years, which represents a further penalty of £90.",56
74,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member has exhausted his time.,57
75,Mr MAHONEY,Unknown,"Denison) [9.46] I consider that this section of the act is applied improperly to persons who may have offended against the law in their early years. I have had to fight cases of that kind, involving both women and men. It is a scandal and a disgrace to refuse a pension to a woman of 60 years of age because of some misdemeanour in early life. We should not set ourselves up as judges of the morals of the people. If every person had imprinted on his or her face a record of sins committed, not many would be granted a pension. Those who adjudicate in such matters may have committed greater sins against society than the pensioners upon whom judgment is passed. A conviction for drunkenness should not be regarded as justification for the withdrawal of a pension. By such action the Commonwealth shirks its obligation and throws on the States the responsibility of keeping those who are deprived of the pension, because it is a crime to allow any individual to starve. If the application of this principle were widened I might be disqualified in the future from drawing an old-age pension because of my membership of the Labour party. The administration in Tasmania is fairly liberal, but there have been cases in which it has been necessary to appeal to the Minister. Seldom is a man locked up in that State on the charge of drunkenness. The police are actuated by humanitarian instincts, and when a pensioner is found to be suffering from the effects of alcohol he is either sent home in a cab or placed in a quiet spot where he may recover. The police force of New South Wales might well act a little more sympathetically in such cases. I hope that the amendment will be carried.",57
76,Mr LAZZARIWI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [9.51] I agree with much of what has been said in support of the amendment. The proposal of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) is directed largely to cases in which distinct hardship has been caused. I wish to give one or two instances of the application of the law which have come to my knowledge within the last few months. They relate to inmates of benevolent homes. A remarkable case occurred only the other day. The medical evidence, and that of practically everyone concerned was in favor of the pensioner, who is universally regarded as of excellent character. Unfortunately, however, he sometimes loses control of his limbs and falls down in the street. On the day in question he had not had a drink. When returning to the homo with a. bottle of wine in his hip pocket for a sick inmate he met an acquaintance. While talking to this man he collapsed and fell. The bottle broke, and his clothes became saturated with its contents. The impression that I have received from conversations with the inmates of this home is that the superintendent comes down on them with a sledge hammer and immediately reports them to the department with a view to having their pensions discontinued. These old people receive only 5s. a week out of the pension, the remaining 12s. 6d. going to the home. Some of them are almost on their last legs, and one glass of beer or other alcoholic liquor practically makes them intoxicated. But the small quantity that they imbibe does them no harm. The invariable reply of the department, when a case is brought to its notice, is that the man is of "" vicious habits"". Some of those who pass judgment drink as much in a week, without showing any effects, as these old people do in a month. I say nothing against their having a drink; it does them no harm. The point that I make is that, from the inception of pensions legislation, the pension has been regarded as a right, and not as a charity. The attitude adopted by the department, however, is, "" If you are a good boy you will get it, but if you dare to overstep what we regard as the border line between decency and viciousness, or if you happen to have a glass of beer, it will be withheld from you."" The position appears to have become aggravated within the last year or two. Since my recent return to this Parliament I have dealt with more cases of the discontinuance of pensions than I handled in my previous membership of twelve years. I do not know whether the Minister is sheltering behind the Deputy Commissioner. It would be interesting to know whether the officials have been given the quiet word to tighten up and save expenditure wherever possible, in order that budgets may be balanced. It seems to me that some influence is behind this filching of the pennies from the old people. If they can afford to have a glass of beer, it is little recompense enough in their old age for having pioneered this country and helped to build up the huge incomes of persons who are financially able to enjoy champagne suppers and. the like. The Government adopts a miserableattitude when it says that they may not have a glass of beer if they are able to afford it out of the few shillings that they get. If any honourable member met in the streets one of these old men who wanted a glass of beer he would buy it for him. Why not see that that spirit actuates the Pensions Department? I hope that the present practice will be discontinued, and that the taking of a glass of beer will not be made an excuse for the withholding of a pension. I trust that the Minister will advise the department to be a little more lenient, and that, if instructions to economize have been given, they will be withdrawn, so that these old people will not be further persecuted. The withholding of a pension in the case that I have mentioned is an absolute shame. The doctor who attended this man gave evidence in regard to his bodily infirmity, and every one in the institution who knows him gave him a good character. The department insinuates that he was lying, and that he had purchased the bottle of wine for his own consumption. I trust that, as an act of simple justice, the pension of this old man will be restored to him. and that the other cases referred to will be given favourable consideration.",57
77,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"Fremantle) flO.O] My experience is that pensions have not been discontinued because of the inclusion in the act of the provision which the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) seeks to remove. However, I do not propose to discuss the discontinuance of pensions. I point out that sub-section c of section 17 is used to deprive applicants of their claim for pensions because of a conviction for a misdemeanour committed, in some cases, many years prior to the date of the application for a pension. I remind the committee-and the Minister for Health (Mr Hughes) will, no doubt, recall the occasion-of the case of a man whose personal record in Australia was beyond all question, but whose political associations had landed him into difficulty which resulted in his conviction for a misdemeanour. His application for a pension was refused because of the provision of the act insisting that an applicant for a pension should be of good character. I would agree with this provision if , in broad outline, the general conduct of the applicant were taken into consideration, but the act is very definite. Tinder it no person convicted of a serious misdemeanour, no matter how long ago, is able to say that he has always been of good character. There are classes of offences in Australia punishable by severe sentences which are not of the usual type of criminal offences, but are related to offences political in character. Convictions under the Crimes Act may be regarded as criminal offences, but there are a large number of provisions in the Crimes Act which would convict persons of utterances in a time of stress which were their honest expression of opinion in respect of matters of supreme importance to the individual liberty of citizens. I think this clause is very dangerous in that it does prevent a certain class of applicant from receiving an old-age pension because of offences which, whatever their character, have long been expiated and fully atoned for and, therefore, should not be held against them. I point out to the Acting Treasurer (Mr Casey) that this provision applies only to applicants for old age pensions, and not to applicants for invalid pensions.",58
78,Mr ROSBVEAK,Unknown,It is applied to applicants for invalid pensions also.,58
79,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"There is no authority in the statute which prescribes that an applicant for an invalid pension shall be examined in regard to his character. The provisions in respect of the discontinuance of pensions are set out in another section of the act. I submit to the Acting Treasurer that the retention of this clause is not necessary. Furthermore, I suggest to the honourable gentlemen that, in determining what he considers to be the obligations of decent citizenship, he should place the applicant for an old-age pension, so far as his moral character is concerned, on the same plane as the invalid pensioner. I say that more emphatically because it appears that, increasingly, the State is conjuring up as offences what really amount to the exercise by a citizen of his right of public expression. It could quite easily happen that, under the Arbitration Act, members of trade unions could be convicted and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for participating in strikes. I submit to the Minister for Health that certain statutes of the Commonwealth are not comparable with the ordinary police offences acts or the criminal codes of the States. They are entirely distinctive, because they do not involve ordinary considerations of criminal conduct. The right honourable gentleman will remember that a very distinguished Australian was refused an old-age pension for a long time because of the existence of this provision in the statute-book, and that it was only by subterfuge that a Commonwealth Treasurer was able to circumvent it and provide him with a pension.",58

81,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"Dalley) [10.13] - I wish the Acting Treasurer (Mr Casey) to give me an assurance that the repeal of section 17 f a will not adversely affect pensioners. Paragraph f a of the section providesNo person shall receive an old-age pension unless(fa) he has not, within the period of five years preceding the date of his pension claim, transferred, otherwise than bona fide for value, property of any kind exceeding in value, in the aggregate the sum of One hundred pounds.

If this provision is repealed, the section will provide24 No person shall receive an old-age pension 36 unless. . 12 (/) he has not, directly or indirectly, deprived himself of property or income in order ATE6. to qualify for or obtain a pension. That provision is indefinite. I wish to know the exact intention of the Government in removing paragraph f a from the act. Since the amendments of 1932 were inserted in our pensions law, the Pensions Department has frequently acted upon rulings which may have been in strict conformity with the letter of the law, but were certainly not in conformity J. H - with the intention of the Government as stated by the. responsible Minister when the proposed amendments were being considered by Parliament. If the definite period and amount are excised from the act, we may find the Commissioner of Pensions deciding that a person shall not receive a pension if he has within, say, ten years deprived himself of property, of a value of even considerably less than £100. For this reason, I ask that a specific statement be made on the point by the Minister in charge of the bill.",59
82,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Hunter) [10.16] - I move That the words ""and paragraph (fb) added to the clause. Paragraph fb provides that no person cently shall receive an old-age pension unlessHis relatives, namely, husband, wife, mother or children, do not, either severally collectively, adequately maintain him. I intend, at a later stage, to move a similar amendment to clause 3, which deals with section 22 of the act, and relates to invalid pensions. This discushaving sion, therefore, can cover both old-age and invalid pensions, and the vote may be taken as a test vote covering the two maintained. cases. Severe hardship has been inflicted upon some people because it has been ruled by the Pensions Department that certain relatives are adequately mainapprove taining the claimant for the pension. have in mind the case of a father with an invalid son 28 years of age, and three other children, two daughters and a whose ages are twenty years, eighteen years, and fourteen years, respecin tively. The invalid son applied for a pension, but his claim was reweek. jected on the ground that his father was receiving £5 a week, and was, therefore, able to support him. I interyears, viewed members of this family at Greta yesterday, and learned that the father's income is now only £4 5s. a week. Surely it would not be contended that that adequate to meet the needs of the six members of the family, including the invalid son. Section 52M of the Pensions Act has been inoperative since last June, under that provision which is repealed by a later clause in this bill, liberal allowance was made to penemployed sioners' relatives who were required make contributions towards the cost the pension. In the case of a married couple the income allowed was £312 per annum-£ 6 a week-wit h a further exemption of £50 for each child, and an additional allowance for the education of children as well as for interest payable upon a mortgage and for contributions made towards the maintenance of unemployed relatives. The allowable income for a single man was £208 per annum, equivalent to £4 a week. In the case to which I have just referred the father has an income of only £4 5s. a week-onl y 5s. a week more than the allowance provided for a single man under section 52M. I , "" be therefore, hope that the Minister will accept my amendment. As the result of the inquisitorial questionnaire sent reto relatives of claimants for invalid pensions, the department was informed of. father, the income of the father, and rejected or the claim on the ground that the invalid son was being adequately maintained by his father, when, as a matter of fact, he was not living in his father's house, but in Lang-street, K u r r i Kurri. His claim been rejected on this ground, the lad returned to live with his father, and I submit that he is not being adequately If the Minister will not agree to the repeal of paragraph f b , surely he will of the continuance of the allowI ance provided for under section 52M. I make this appeal because the case which I have just cited is typical of many others son, that have come under my notice. In one, an invalid son, aged 28 years, living Paxton, has had his claim rejected because his father's income is £5 10s. a Another case is that of a man 73 years of age living at Weston. Having been thrifty during his working he accumulated a little money which he invested in property, from which he is now collecting a small amount by way of rent. Because he has is this' source of income the department has rejected the claim of his son, aged 44 years, for a' pension, on the ground that he is being adequately maintained. In still another case, the father of a claimant for a pension at Aberdare gets 17s. a day, but the pit in which he is works, on an average, only to. threedays a week. Yet the department of considers that his income is adequate for the maintenance of his invalid son. There is ample evidence that great hardship is undoubtedly being inflicted upon these people. I received a letter, dated the 18th March, 1935, from the Pensions Department regarding a claim for an invalid pension, informing me that the claim had been rejected on the ground that the father was employed at the Pelton colliery; was earning at the rate of £290 a year; that he owned the home in which the family resided, and in addition to his wife, had only the claimant to maintain, there being no children under the age of sixteen years. From inquiries which I have made. I learn that although there are no children under the age of sixteen years, two of the sons are unemployed, and, consequently, have to be maintained by the father. In view of the cases which I have mentioned, showing that the act operates so harshly in many instances, I hope that the Minister will accept my amendment.",60
83,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [10.28] Paragraph fb of section 17, which the honourable member for Hunter (Mr I James) desires to have repealed, deals with applications for old-age pensions. It enacts that no person shall receive old-age pension unless his relatives, namely, husband, wife, father, mother or children, do not adequately maintain him. This is part of the special legislathe tion passed in 1932, and is unnecessary for the satisfactory administration of pensions law. Any contribution by the wife is already provided for in another part of the act, and, therefore, any earn27 ings by the wife or husband are actually taken into account in determining the right to a pension. Contributions by sons and daughters towards the assistance parents are also provided for in another part of the act. It is apparent that section of the act was originally inserted, and is now being maintained with the object of proving a detriment to parents with children in a fairly good position in life applying for pensions. A father I know is earnestly desirous of a pension, but he has a son who is a doctor, and in view of the present provisions of the act which would advise the son of his appliparents. cation he will not apply for one. He not desire that his son should be so advised, but he feels that because of his own citizenship he is surely entitled to a pension ; that his own position in life should be considered apart from that of his son. As the act now stands it imposes upon many fathers and mothers a condition requiring them to disclose to their sons or daughters a circumstance which they do not desire to so disclose, as they may feel it humiliates their children. As the act elsewhere provides for taking into account all the income of a parent there is no need for this section, and seeing that it was originally inserted as part of the emergency legislation, and actually used as a detriment to prospective applicants for pensions, it should not now be allowed to remain to continue to work against this section of the people, and possibly deprive them of a right. [Quorum formed.']",61
84,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [10.33] - On two or three occasions I have endeavoured to elicit from the Minister something definite on a particular point which is working to the detriment of some of the people whom I represent. asked the Minister a question in connection with a person, no longer a child but an adult, who wanted an invalid an pension-whethe r that adult has still to be brought under that section of the act under which an invalid pension is refused if the parent adequately maintains invalid. I always thought that that provision applied to juniors and not to the adult invalids. Such a position means that if a father or mother refuses to maintain an invalid son who may be, say, years of age, the son could apply to the department and get a pension; but so long as his parents do not let him starve, then he is not entitled to the pension. In my of opinion, the act was not meant to be interpreted in that way. Will the Ministhis ter inform me whether the sub-section applies to an adult invalid who is adequately maintained by his parents, or only to child invalids, so long as these are dependent on their parents? If the act is to be interpreted in the way I have described, a man or woman who happens to be stricken with paralysis can no longer feel independent of his or her It would also mean that an does invalid child living with his or her parents and maintained iby the parents would not be entitled to a pension. There would be no need for a pension in a case of that kind, but when the child becomes an adult and still remains an invalid, perhaps at the age of 30, and does not desire to be a burden on his or her parents, can that invalid get a pension? I know that he or she could get a pension if the applicant and parents could just so order things that I could approach the Commissioner and prove that the invalid was not being adequately maintained by the parents. Consequently, under such circumstances, the parents have to enter into a conspiracy in order that their invalid adult child may receive a pension. . Mr MAKIN- - If the invalid were to leave the home of the parents he or she could secure the pension, but otherwise it would be impossible.",61
85,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"If the Minister is not too sure about the interpretation of this clause, will he make inquiries about it so that in such cases as I have described honourable members can secure a ruling one way or another ? I am notasking for this explanation simply out of curiosity; I have been worried with special cases. For instance, I know of the case of an invalid man, 35 years of age, who is smarting because he is still dependent on his mother and father. The father who is an engineer by profession, and can keep his son, does not complain, but the son complains about his dependence. The parents have said to me that they do not begrudge keeping their son, but that the latter continually inquires about the position, feeling that, being a man, his parents should no longer be forced to keep him. I understand that invalid parents are entitled to a pension irrespective of whether or not their children can afford to keep them. Therefore, I contend that the law should cut both ways. Again I ask the Minister to look into this matter, and to make sure of the position.",62

In future, the deprivation of property, whatever the intent, will not be a bar to an applicant receiving a pension. If the commissioner so decides the value of the property so divested may be held against the amount of the pension granted.",62

93,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"In those circumstances the Commissioner would not hold the transfer against the pensioner. The Comsioner has certain discretionary powers, but we can rely upon such powers being exercised sympathetically. The Commisthe sioner considers the circumstances of case, and if there has been proper conthe sideration for the transfer, that is taken into account. In his discretion any perty so transferred is held against pensioner. As the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) has intimated, that the vote on section 17 f b will guide him as to whether or not he will move an amendment on section 22 h, I may speak briefly upon the two points raised.

122,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"Corio-Assistant Treasis urer) [10.55] - There is one feature of liberalization of any legislation, and by that is that it can be always further liberalized. In this bill the 'Government is going a long way to remove two important provisions of the act, and thereby give a substantial measure of relief. did There must be certain provisions to protect the revenue against definite abuse. After eighteen months contact with him it is my definite opinion that the Commissioner generally administers the act sympathetically, though honourable members sometimes say that that is not so. I ask honourable members not to press these amendments because the Government* after having given them careful consideration, cannot see its way to accept them.",64
123,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"Dalley) [10.56] The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) said that these provisions were in the act to protect the revenue against abuse, and the honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom) seems to think that their purpose is to prevent the children of wealthy parents from obtaining invalid pensions. As a matter of fact, it is not necessary for the parents to be wealthy for the department to refuse a pension. I have one case in mind which I have repeatedly brought before the department, and which I intend to persevere with until I get a ruling. It concerns a couple and their invalid daughter, an imbecile who is 30 years of age. The father's income consists of his superannuation pension of £14S a year. The department, when assessing the pension payable to the daughter, divides the father's income into three parts, and allots a third to each member of the family, so that the daughter is presumed to be receiving a third of £148. She is then given a pension sufficient to bring her assumed income up to £78 10s. a year. Actually she is receiving only a half pension. Under the Financial Emergency Act the permissible income of a pensioner couple is fixed at £156 a"" year, which is £8 more than the income received by the father in the case I have quoted. The department was supplied by me with all the information relevant to the case, including the fact that the father, during the last twelve months, has had three major opei-ations. and was .preparing to undergo a fourth, while the mother had beeti' for a considerable time an inmate of a hospital. Those fact* were known to the Commissioner, because I made it my business to acquaint Mm with tbem. But even then: he would not alterhis decision ; he stuck to his precious formula, under which be divided the father's income into three parts. He agreed, however, that if I could produce the bills for medical attention to the parents and the daughter, and evidence that money had been paid for assistance in the home, he would reconsider the case. I produced that evidence, and the Commissioner at last decided to grant the full pension. I maintain that he should have done so in the first instance. If this case is typical of others, then every invalid pensioner ii-: New South Wales, whose circuni jiances are similar, has been deprived :tf his pension. The act is not being n^iministered for the purpose of protecting the revenue against abuse, or of preventing wealthy people from allowing their children to become pensioners; it is being administered in defiance of the financial emergency legislation, which gives the permissible income of the parents, from all sources, as £3 a week. I maintain that anything less than that amount should not be taken into account. When the irtcome of a husband and wife falls below £3 a week the Pensions Department should not compel them to maintain an invalid child, either wholly or partly, particularly when that child is over 21 years of age. I am not telling the committee' a fairy story. The Minister has all the information in regard to thesf cases. From the Commissioner himself I ascertained the method adopted by the department. I asked whether these things were done by regulation, and he replied, "" No; it is just the department's' method."" There is nothing in the act to justify that action; no regulation sanctions it. It is merely a formula decided upon by the pensions officials themselves, in defiance of the Pensions Act and of the financial emergency legislation. I am confident that, not one honourable member would' support the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) if he thought that he Was doing something which would result in wealthy parents allowing their children to draw the pension. If the experience of the honourable member for 1 Hunter has been the same as mine-and ' the particulars included irt the Commissioner's letter are now in the hands of the Acting Treasurer-ther e is justification for tfie amendment which has been moved, and all honourable members ouglu to support this attempt to bring about sr. improvement of the position. The Minister said that the action taken by the department was actuated by a desire to prevent abuses. I challenge him to find as many persons who have abused the pensions law as we can find persons who have been deprived of their right to . pension by the operation of the scheme or regulation which is being enforced by the Pensions Department. There is protection for the department againsr the applicant for a pension whose parents can keep him ; but there is no protection for other applicants. It is not a. matter of people abusing their privileges, but rather, is one of pensioners being robbed by the department.",65
124,Mr LANE,Unknown,"Barton) [ 1 1 . 5 ] - I do not see the necessity for section 17 f b for the reason that there is nothing to stop a parent from getting the pension, if he leaves his son's home. I have come across scores of cases in which parents could not get the pension while residing with their children, but there was nothing to prevent them from getting it if they lived in their own homes. know of a man who received £200 a year from his wealthy daughter in India, and, in addition, was paid £1 a week by the Pensions Department for years. vision was made to prevent such things from being done. The law was amended, not because the children would not support their parents, but because the parents claimed the pension, although they were supported by their children. Section 22 raises an entirely different matter. I have in mind a case of a girl 31 years of age suffering fro m Parkinagainst son's disease, whose parents have income of only £4 5s. a week. Two other children are out of work. I appealed to the Commissioner three times on their behalf, but without success. Like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway), I cannot understand why the department regards as children invalids 21 years of age and over. know of one case in which a parent whose income is £4 5s. a week is getting half a pension. payment for an invalid child, whereas another parent, with the same income, rofused a pension for a. child over - 21 years of age. I confess that the interpretation of these provisions by the department has always been puzzling to me. I have not encountered the same difficulty in connection with old-age pensions. Should difficulty arise in the case of old-age pensioners, it is sufficient that they get into their own home for them to receive a pension. If they are not receiving sustenance from their children, nothing can prevent them from getting a pension; but the position is different in the case of invalids. In a motor accident some time ago a son 25 years of age became dependent on his parents, whose income was £4 5s. a week. It is unfair for the department to say that son was adequately supported by his parents. Being over 21 years of age, he should have been treated as an invalid for whom his parents were not responsible. According to our laws, a parent has no jurisdiction over a child after it has attained the age of 21 years. Why is it that a person over 21 years of age is regarded by the department as being adequately maintained by his parents, when that is not so? I was pleased to hear the case menI tioned by the honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom), and shall approach the department in the matter from the other angle of Pro- adequate maintenance in the home. I sometimes think the administration makes a differentiation between certain members of the House, because, apparently, some can get things done and others cannot.",66
125,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Hunter) [11.11] - I regret that the Minister has not accepted the amendment, the arguments which have been very weak. an The Government has decided to repeal another section of the act, thus exempting people in affluent circumstances from, the obligation to contribute towards the pensions of their relatives, although a liberal allowance up to £312 a year was already made. In a letter which I have here, dated the 18th of this month, it is I shown that the father's income is only £290 a year, yet his invalid son is refused The honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom) is said that there was no compulsion, but no parent w'ill order his child out of his house and refuse to keep him simply because he is not granted an invalid pension. Yet one infers that that is intended to 'be done. This boy at Greta is in such a state of health that he absolutely can only crawl about the floor. He is intelligent and well read, and said to me, "" I am only an encumbrance on my parents. When my pension was refused me, my parents' income was £5 a week, and they have three other children-tw o sisters and a brother-to keep. The only property they had was the home in which they lived. They had a 5-acre piece of ground which they cultivated, but they could not afford to pay the rates of £1 Is. lOd. a year on it. They did not get a sufficient return from the citj'us fruit they grew on it to pay the rates."" I pleaded with the lad not to regard himself as an encumbrance, because his parents loved him, and his attitude would only cause them further unhappiness.' At one time, to test the assertion that if he were living somewhere else he could get the invalid pension, the boy went to a relative in Lang-street, Kurri Kurri, yet his pension was refused him there, because the father's income was considered adequate maintenance. Those are the facts, no matter how much the Commissioner may deny them. The father's income is now only £4 5s. a week. Under section 52M, £6 a week was allowed for a married couple and £50 for each child, and a liberal education allowance was made as well. That section is being repealed, yet the Government refuses to repeal section 17 fb and section 22 7?. The Government must have a motive, which is, I think, that very few people are affected by sections l l f b and 22/t, whereas thousands are affected by section 52M. Very few votes are involved in the one ease, whereas thousands of children roceived those iniquitous questionnaires under section 52M. It is a scandalous shame that the Government, should refuse to do justice to a few poor people who have invalid children. The Government is callous and brutal in its administration, if it allows injustices these to be inflicted without granting a remedy.  Order!",66
126,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Is the honourable member advocating these cases because votes are attached to them?,67
127,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"I absolutely believe that the Government is agreeing to the repeal of section 52M because it affects so many votes. The department stated in the other case thai the father had a wife and no children under sixteen, apart from the claimant, to maintain, yet I am informed by the Mayor of Cessnock, Mr Johnny Brown, who brought this case under my notice, that there are two other sons unemployed, who are not allowed to work for the dole because the father's income is above the limit fixed in the State of New South Wales. They, and the invalid child, and the husband and wife, have all to be maintained out of the £290 a year. There are so few cases of this kind that nobody makes a fuss about them, but a big hueand-cry was raised about the questionnaire sent out to relatives under section 52M. Threats were made by some who were in affluent circumstances, including members of Parliament in New South Wales, absolutely challenging the Government to take them to court and compel them to pay, but the Government was not game to accept the challenge. I do not wish to give the impression that those people were not willing to contribute to their parents' support; they did that voluntarily, but they strongly objected to being forced to do it. Many of us would take up the same attitude. The Minister in his second reading speech said he was taking away the compulsory character of the act by repealing section 52M, yet he is actually imposing compiilsion under sections 17 fb and 22 h. Therefore, if a father were callous enough to say to his invalid son- "" Get out of my home"", the department would give him a pension; but it forces an injustice upon the parent by reason of the love which he has for his son. Seeing that a disability like of a larger number of pensioners is being removed, I appeal once again to the Minister to do justice to the smaller section in whose interests I am now pleading. The cost would not be more than £2,000 a year throughout the Commonwealth.",67

130,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"Bourke) [11.37] I move That the following be added to the clause:** and (6) by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section:(3.) For the purposes of an invalid pension, a person who is afflicted with a permanent injury or invalidity shall be regarded as permanently incapacitated, if, by reason of the nature of his injury or invalidity lie cannot reasonably be expected to maintain himself by his own labour,"". Clearly the intention of the act was,'that a man who by reason of permanent in j u r y or disability was prevented from earning his own livin g should receive an invalid pension. But it has not been administered in that way. It appears to me that the administration gives the go-by to the words "" for work which occur in one of the earlier sections, and says, "" If , as a matter of fact, this person could do work if he could get it , he shall not be entitled to the invalid pension."" shall give two illustrations that have come within my personal knowledge of the way in which the section is applied. The first is the case of a man in a very advanced stage of consumption. He was told that he could work, that he was not totally and permanently incapacitated, and that he must apply for sustenance. The sustenance authorities rejected his claim, and said that his was a case for the benevolent societies. It is to these NOES. societies that a man is sent who is considered unfit to work for sustenance. He again applied for the invalid pension. I drew the attention of the department to the position that had been taken up by the sustenance authorities. The department said that it would take up the matter with them. It did so, with the result that the local foreman of the sustenance department suggestc-3 that, in order to save furthertrouble, he would place the man on his pay roll. The foreman says that he is incapable of doing any class of work. He attends the job every day, but merely potters about, and for this he PAIRS. draws sustenance. I think it was clearly the intention of the legislature that in such a case the man should have been granted an invalid pension. The difficulty is that the departmental doctor examines the man and says "" I cannot certify that you are permanently and totally incapacitated, if you are able to undertake some class of work. A fte r all you have two hands and two legs."" Another case is that of an epileptic woman who was refused _an invalid pension because the doctor certified that she was not totally and permanently incapacitated. I suppose that if she were l i v in g ' in her own home, she would be able to do housework. But the woman could not get employment because no employer would know when these fits might come upon her. This woman has made repeated efforts to secure employment, but has been unable to do so. These persons, by reason of their invalidity, cannot reasonably be expected to maintain themselves by their own labour. My desire is to make the actexpress clearly the intention of the legislature^ The amendment leaves to the Commissioner the decision of the matter. He I takes into account all relevant circumstances, and if he decides that the applicant cannot be reasonably expected to maintain himself by his own labour as a result of his infirmity, he will grant the applicant an invalid pension. Mr SCTJI/LIN - Would it not be wise to include the word "" to t all y "" ?",69
131,Mr BLACKBURN,Unknown,"The word "" to t all y "" does not appear in the act. The act uses the phrase, "" permanently incapacitated for work"". The word "" totally "" is introduced by regulation. may be said that the intention of the legislature was that, as a condition cedent to the grantiug of a pension, person should be permanently and as totally incapacitated. I am concerned putting into'effect the real intention parliament. I think that formerly before the need for economy was imment, and I movepressed upon the Pensions Department the section was interpreted in this way, but with the pressing need for economy persons who, in the opinion of the departmental doctors, were capable of doing any work at all were excluded from eligibility for an invalid pension. I propose this amendment in the belief that it will give a new orientation to this part of the act. It is fair and reasonable and will give effect to the real intention of parliament.",69

135,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"West Sydney) [12.1 a.m.] - I move That the following words be added to the clause:"" and any moneys received by virtue of any of such repealed sections shall be returned to the persons from whom such moneys were received."" 1 JOHN The acceptance of this amendment will make the provisions of the h ill retro.. 24 spective as from the date when these .. 33 sections were incorporated in the act. They were inserted in October, 1932, but 9 did not become operative u n t i l the 1st January, 1933. The amendment has AYES. been circulated sufficiently long for the Government to have given consideration to it . If it is canried, !the Government will have no claim whatever on pensioners' property. The amount of money in volved is insignificant compared with the measure of injustice that has been in flicted upon those who, perhaps, were without any means of making refunds, but ,voluntarily agreed to accept the Tellers : demands of the Pensions Department. In isolated cases, persons upon whom NOES. demands were made were forced to raise the amount involved by way of mortgage on properties which had been left to them. As members of the Country party, and particularly their' leader, who is now Acting Prime Minister, were strongly opposed to the incorporation in the act of the provisions relating to the claims on the property of pensioners, we on this side can very well expect them now to support this amendment, the effect of which will be to make retrospective the repeal provisions of this bill. The amendment is entirely in accord with the spirit and intention of the Government in introducing this bill. One of the arguPAIRS. ments advanced by the Minister responsible'for the inclusion in the act of these provisions was that their effect would be to discourage applicants who, in other circumstances, might lodge claims for pensions. Because of the sentimental value attaching to the old home, many persons 1935. in every respect eligible for the pension resolved to suffer inconvenience and hardship rather than do anything to jeopardise their equity in the home. The Government has realized that the pro visions then inserted in the act did not achieve their purpose, and were of no real value. Consequently, it has decided to repeal them. I , therefore, submit that is is not asking too much to make the repeal provisions retrospective.",71
136,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"Corio-Actin g Treasurer) [12.5 a.m.] - The amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) leads one first of all to consider the refunds that would have to be made under section 52 o, which provides for the recovery of pension payments after the 31st December, 1932, from pensioners who own property exceeding £400 in value. In some cases, claims made under this section related to winners of lottery prizes, or those who had received fairly considerable sums of money under wills. ' I am sure that honourable members would not suggest that the Government should not persist in its claims in respect of such cases. The principal section under discussion is, I think 52 E. I am glad to note a change of heart on the part of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley). Previously he suggested that the enactment of this section would involve considerable hardship. Now he claims that no cases of hardship were involved. I think the simplest plan for me is to state the amounts that were due to the Government in respect of pensioners' property, and the amounts actually collected. An amount of £140,000 was claimable on the estates of pensioners, but only £42,000 was actually collected by the Government, £50,000 being in course of collection. The whole of the balance was either waived or arrangements were made for deferred or time payments.",71
137,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"What is the justification for retaining £42,000 when claims in respect of others are waived?",72
138,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"The ' facts disclosed amply justify the attitude of the Government, which has been extremely liberal in its interpretation of the provisions relating to claims on pensioners' property. It collected money only in cases where the estates of pensioners could very well afford to pay without inflicting ship upon relatives. In no case has the Government sold up any property of deceased pensioners. In more than 60 per cent, of the cases the Government has not insisted on its claims, OT it has allowed payments to be deferred in some way which will, in effect, result in the money not now being paid.",72
139,Mr JENNINGS,Unknown,"Is it not a fact that, in some cases, pensioners had property valued at £5,000?",72
140,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"Some estates were of considerable value. The number of claims made upon estates of deceased pensioners was 5,153, the number of claims waived or postponed was 1,785, and the number of claims paid wholly or in part was 2,040.",72
141,Mr GANDES,Unknown,How much money was paid?,72
142,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"I have already stated that the amount received by the Government was £42,090 out of a total of £140,000 claimable, so that when this bill is passed the Government will have waived its olaim in respect of almost £100,000. In no case, in which the Government has insisted on its claim, has there been any suggestion of hardship. In those circumstances the Government regrets it is unable to make the repeal retrospective.",72
143,Mr GANDER,Unknown,"Reid) [12.11 a.m.] The Minister said that there has never been any hardship inflicted on pensioners iii this matter and that the Government made a claim only in cases where people could afford to pay back the money. I have had a case of the death of an oldaged pensioner who had been insured for between £50 and £60, out of which, after funeral expenses amounting to £25 or £30, and other expenses, had been paid, his daughter, who was an invalid pensioner, had left only £9 10s., for which amount the Minister sent her a bill. Had that girl not had a good representative in this Parliament the Government would have taken that money.",72
144,Mr LANE,Unknown,The honourable member's case is not the only one of that kind.,72
145,Mr GANDER,Unknown,The honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) apparently has had cases of a similar character. Under this amendment we want the hard- Minister to return the money in cases where people who have experienced hardship make an application to the Government for the return of what has been paid by them. In that request we will not include people who have won lotteries.,72
146,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"Corio-Actin g Treasurer) [12.13 a.m.] - I ask honourable members not to be affected too much by the case brought forward by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Gander). I - would remind him, and I am sure he will admit it , that the case he refers to was one reported in the Labor Daily, the report being accompanied admirable inset photograph of the honourable member. In the Government did not make a demand as the honourable member claims. It merely presented a statement setting out the amount that was due to the Government and asking whether hardship was to be pleaded. Hardship was pleaded on the part of the person concerned, and, consequently, the Government made no claim on that estate.",72
147,Mr GANDER,Unknown,"Supposin g the g i r l had paid the amount claimed, what would have happened then?",73
148,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"I repeat that the Government did not send this g i r l a bill, but merely a statement setting out what was due, accompanied by the query I have mentioned.

Nor do I intend to divide the committee on it, because, judging by the last vote, it would be useless to do so.",73
150,Mr BAKER,Unknown,"Griffith) [12.22 a.m.] I wish to deal briefly with a point raised from time to time with reference to the money received in the for m of contributions by relatives. The reason given by the Government for the repeal of this provision has been stated to be that the cost of administration was unwarranted. I submit that that is incorrect. I contend that after having brought this legislation into operation the Government did not dare to enforce it. Honourable members on this side of the chamber opposed it from the outset, and consequently were not keen on its being brought into effect. We are pleased that that was not done; but it is only fair to state what has actually happened, and in order to do so I propose to quote from the Auditor General's report of this year which bears out the point I have endeavoured to make on several different occasions during the past months in regard to relatives' contributions. The Auditor-General statesThe legislation, which came into force on the 13th October, 1932, contemplated both voluntary and compulsory contributions. There appears to have been delay in giving effect to Parliament's intention as regards these contributions. Littl e had been done when, in September. 19.33. the Commissioner of Pensions directed that investigations were to be confined to pensions granted since the 13th October, 1932. However, in March, 1934, the commissioner authorized a complete investigation, and this was in progress when, in June, 1934, Cabinet decided to suspend the operation of the section. It has been stated in the press that the Government's effort to induce relatives of pensioners to contribute towards cost of ]>ens.ions were ineffectual, but when the operation of the section was suspended, preliminary investigations were far from complete and little, if anything, had been done to enforce compulsory contributions . . . Notwithstanding the delays in investigation, contributions amounting to £2,345 were received during the year, and whan investigation ceased the approximate annual income from contributions was £6.433. A statement appeared in the press some months ago to the effect that only £6 had been collected; but the position was that be withdrawn. this amount was collected only from persons who had been granted pensions prior to the 13th October, 1932.",73
151,Mr CASEY,Unknown,Is the honourable member sure that he understands the position?,74
152,Mr BAKER,Unknown,Six pounds were colarguments lected from certain persons in receipt of clause. pensions prior to the 13th October,74
153,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"The honourable member ment, and I moveknows what it means. Mr BAKER,- I do.",74
154,Mr CASEY,Unknown,Then the honourable member is trying to mislead the committee.,74
155,Mr BAKER,Unknown,"The Minister is trying to do that. On several occasions he allowed a definite misstatement of facts to be published in the press throughout Australia. I asked questions from time to time, and it was only at the third attempt that I was able to obtain information to prove that I was right and that the Minister was wrong. The Auditor General points out that when investigations ceased the approximate annual income from contributions was £6,433. T am not suggesting that we wish this legislation to be enforced, but that after passing it the Government did not dare to enforce it, and caused false and untrue statements to be published in the press throughout Australia.",74
156,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"Corio-Actin g Treasurer) [12.25 a.m.] - I am not disposed to enter into the usual controversy with the honourable member for Griffith (Mr. Baker), who has on two different occasions made the same accusations which I have answered in each instance. The amount which I previously stated was for a definite period, and was absolutely correct. I gave the honourable member the facts on more than one occasion. I , therefore, propose to ignore completely his juvenile remarks and to confine any further references I have to make to the amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley).",74

161,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) a.m.] - I desire to give the Acting Treasurer (Mr Casey) a final opportunity to move the closure, inasmuch as I have not had an opportunity to discuss this bill at any stage. In principle, the bill is one with which the party of which I am a member naturally agrees, inasmuch' as its persistent agitation has resulted in this belated measure being brought before the House- a measure designed to remove a number of injustices heartlessly imposed by this Government upon the poorest people in the community. But it is a matter of great regret to me that the bill has been forced through in a manner which has prevented me from expressing the views which I strongly hold regarding the restitution of moneys to those persons who have already made payments to the Government, and by reason of their prompt payment are now penalized, whereas those who resisted the law are relieved from any further obligation. I make my protest on this third reading against the conditions which made it necessary, and against members having been denied an opportunity to discuss it with a view to making it what it ought to be- a measure to make full restitution for the wrong which this Government has done to invalid and old-age pensioners. W it h that protest, I leave the matter, and I do not thank the Minister for having at this late hour taken the final opportunity to prevent members on this side from expressing their views. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read at h i r d time. NOES. ADJOURNMENT. KING'S JUBILEE MEDAL.

The market for citrus f r u it s in India was investigated by the Department of Commerce during 1932, when the possibilities were brought to the notice of Australian exporters. There is n limited market available in India added for oranges, lemons, and grape f r u it . Australian exporters have uot participated in the trade to any extent, owing to intensive competition in these markets, supplies being ob£ tained from South Africa, Rhodesia, Palestine, Spain, United States of America, and Japan. 157,078 The absence of direct shipping facilities be178,991 tween Australian ports and ports on the Bay of Bengal also hindered exporters in their CUSTOMS TARIFF . efforts to participate. 2.
