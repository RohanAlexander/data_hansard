6,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"On Wednesday last the honourable member for Wentworth. moved for a return showing the publications which have received payment from the GoTRUST. vernment for services in connection with the advertisement of Australia. I asked if I be in order in submitting an amendment requiring that the return should also show the arrangements made with, and the on the payments made to Mr John Plummer by The of the right honourable member for East Sydney I shall give notice to move tomorrow for a return giving the information desired by the honourable member for Corio. As notice of a motion has not been given by the right honourable member, as promised, I desire to know whether I am now precluded - from submitting the amendment which I wished to move on that occasion ? .Mr SPEAKER - The honourable member will recollect that, under our Standing Orders, notice is required of any motion. But if he will look at the business-paper he will observe that the motion proposed by the honourable member for Wentworth. is set down for today. When that is called on it will be competent for the honourable member to'move the addition of the words that he desires. Until' it is called on, the honourable member cannot move an amendment.",14
7,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Then I give notice of my intention to move to amend the motion of"" the honourable member for Wentworth by striking out the words "" received payment from the"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" and the persons who received.payment from."" . Mr KELLY - As a personal explanation, I wish to say that the right honourable member for East Sydney is desirous that I should amend the motion to which the honourable member for Corio has referred, with - a view to meeting the honourable member. It is perfectly immaterial to me whether he moves an amendment upon my motion, or whether it is amended on my own motion.",14
8,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"The leader of the 'Opposition promised, on Thursday last, tc move in the direction - indicated; but he evidently forgot to do so.",15
9,Mr KELLY,Unknown,He did forget. It is not always easy to remember these details. I am perfectly willing that my proposal should be amended in the direction desired - by the honourable member for Corio; but I assure him that action in - that direction would have been taken without any interference upon his part.,15
10,Mr REID,Unknown,"Without trenching on questions which have been put upon the business-paper by the honourable member for Maranoa, I wish to ask the Treasurer, as representing the Prime Minister, whether, In considering the very excellent object in view-that of sending information by cablegram to the Mother Country regarding Australian affairs-h e will take into consideration a larger scheme than that of - supplying any one newspaper with Australian news? I refer to a scheme which would provide \for the transmission of cablegrams which would be open to the whole of the British press. said, I do not desire to trench in any way upon the questions which appear on the notice-paper; I simply ask whether the Government will take that point into consideration in dealing with the matter ?",15
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has been considering this question. I am not in a position to say how far it has advanced.' But I will communicate to my honourable colleague the question which bas been asked by the right honourable member, and. I have no doubt that tomorrow a - reply will be furnished. As far as I am .aware, however, the whole matter is still - under consideration.",15
12,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"L s s t week the Treasurer was good enough to say that he deplored the lobbying in connection with the Tariff going on within the precincts of the House, and I , therefore, ask him whether he is aware of any results following a circular, dated 31st October, 1907, sent out by the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, which has evidently reduced lobbying to a fine art. The circular readsMembers are again reminded of the necessity of placing before as many protectionist members of the Federal Parliament as possible, all the information and reasons why the duties proposed should be maintained or amended in any way. When their respective items are under consideration of the House, members are particularly urged to be alert. The secretary and Tariff Committee of the Chamber are in daily attendance at Parliament House to carry out the desires of the manufacturers",15
13,Mr WATSON,Unknown,So are the agents of the importers.,15
14,Mr REID,Unknown,"Yes ; but while we have heard so much about them, we have heard nothing of the lobbying to which the honourable member for Wentworth is directing attention. - Mr KELLY - The circular continuesand representatives of each industry should be present when their items are being considered, and it is especially necessary that the secretary should be kept well posted up as to the requirements of the members.",15
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have not seen the circular which the honourable member has just read, but I conceive that there is no harm in issuing such a circular, and, indeed, look upon it as a proper course to take. I know nothing of the lobbying referred to, and hope that the honourable member did not receive the circular today from As I have the secretary to a free-trade organization.",15
16,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I did not. SIZE OE GRAIN BAGS.,15
17,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Is it the intention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to postpone the proclamation in respect to the size of grain bags?,15
18,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,No .,15
19,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs, without notice, the following questions1. Whether an arrangement has been entered into between the Minister and the Premiers of the several States, whereby cornsacks will be uniform'in size, and limited to contain an estimated weight not exceeding 200 lbs. ? LOBBYIN G. 2. Whether the Minister has, in view of such an arrangement being confirmed, decided to withdraw the proclamation previously intended to come into operation on the 15th inst. ? 3. Will the Minister, in determining upon'any action in this connection, provide, that if arrangements as suggested be made, they will include sugar sacks equally with those intended the issue of for other purposes?",15
20,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member, this morning, was good enough to tell me privately of his intention to ask these questions, to which the answers are1. Whilst there appeared to be unanimity of sympathy and opinion as to the restriction of cornsacks in the direction indicated, no definite arrangement was arrived at. I have no doubt, however, that the States will take action in aid of the object we have in view. 2. There is no intention to withdraw the proclamation, which will become operative on Friday, 15th inst. 3. I believe any action of .the States direction of enforcing special railway rates on bags containing over 200 lbs. will necessarily include sugar sacks.",16
21,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Treasurer a question, without notice,, whether in view of the very protracted character of the debates upon the Senate's requests upon the Tariff, he proposes to take such steps as will bring those debates to a speedy termination; or whether he will permit them to continue during the whole of the remainder of the session ?",16
22,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am not, nor is the Government, desirous of continuing the debates upon the Tariff.",16
23,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"What about the "" stonewall "" last week? ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The continuation of the debates is due to another section of the House.",16
24,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"That was not the case last week. Sir WILLIAML YN E - As far as I am personally concerned, I wish the Tariff were out of hand. But I cannot prevent those honourable members who desire to debate the question from doing so. debates will go on in the ordinary way, and it will depend upon honourable members themselves as to how long the proceedings upon the Tariff continue.",16
25,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I also should like to ask the Treasurer whether he can give the House any information as to what steps the Government intend to take with the object of bringing the debates upon the Tariff to a conclusion? Will the Government say whether they intend definitely to fix a day next week when the Senate's requests shall be finally disposed of ?,16
26,Mr REID,Unknown,"This week. M i . MCDONALD - Will the Government determine that the House shall, if necessary, sit on Saturday, or an any given day, right on until the consideration of the Senate's requests is concluded?",16
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Kennedy is,. in consequence of his duties as Chairman of Committees, confined to the chair for a very long time, as I also am through being in charge of the Tariff. No doubt, the work has become very irksome to him. I hope that we shall be able to finish our work on the Tariff by next Tuesday or Wednesday, and, if it De possible, that will be done. Honourable in ""the members opposite, judging by their outcries, are extremely anxious about this matter, but they are not going to disturb me in the slightest degree. I shall carry the TARIFF. 1 Tariff through in the ordinary way.",16
28,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Following up the Minister's answer to the last question, I desire to ask him whether he does not think that he has made a misstatement of fact in alleging that honourable members on this side of the Chamber have delayed the Tariff. Is it not a fact within the Treasurer's own knowledge that several honourable members on this side of the House have refrained from speaking, in order to expedite the passageof the Tariff, whilst honourable members on his own side have continued speaking for the purpose of prolonging the debates?",16
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"^-In reply to the honourable.member, I have to state that it is scarcely right to say that any honourable members on this side of the House have endeavoured to prolong the debates. That statement is not correct, so far as I know. I do not say that the whole of the debating has come from the members of the Opposition. What I do say is that a large proportion of it has come from that The quarter-fro m the Opposition corner. As far as the Government are concerned, we shall proceed as expeditiously as is reasonably possible to complete the Tariff, and I hope that we shall be able to do so by Tuesday or Wednesday next.",16
30,Mr REID,Unknown,"W it h reference to the fact that the duties have been collected from the public for the last eight or nine months, and in view of the promise of the Government that the system which has been described as "" the new protection "" shall be applied to the new Tariff, I wish to ask the Treasurer whether the measure which is to carry that good policy into operation has yet been prepared, and, if so, whether it is the intention of the Government to submit the Bill to Parliament so that it may be passed into law without delay?",16
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I recognise, and have always recognised-and I have referred to the fact several times-that the new protection policy is a part of our Tariff proposals j and I venture to think that if I had not given promises to that effect the Tariff would not have been dealt with as expeditiously or as fairly as has been the case. With reference to another part of the right honourable member's question, I have to say that, as he is aware, there is a certain case which is now sub judice-bein g under the consideration of the High Court - and the Government are unable to complete the Bill referred to until judgment in that case is delivered. The Prime Minister said the other night, however, that the Government are quite ready to complete their Bill.",17
32,Mr REID,Unknown,"Is the Bill ready, subject to any alteration that may be necessary?",17
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The not be completed until the judgment of the High Court is given.,17
34,Mr REID,Unknown,"But is it ready, subject to any alteration? Have the Government got the Bill drafted?",17
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I say that the Government cannot complete the Bill until the decision is given.,17
36,Mr REID,Unknown,I recognise that.,17
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"But the Prime Minister has given his promise, and, as far as I know, the Bill is completed as far as is possible.",17
38,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I understand that another place has adjourned until the 20th inst. with a view to then resuming its deliberations iri connection with the Tariff. I should like to ask the Treasurer whether he will endeavour to expedite the business of this House so as to enable the Senate to proceed with the consideration of the Tariff when it re-assembles, and to allow honourable members here to return to their homes on Saturday next, and to remain there until the other Chamber has completed its work?",17
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not like to definitely promise that honourable members will be able to return to their homes on Saturday and to remain there until the "" Senate has completed its consideration of the Tariff, because, in this matter, honourable members who reside at a great distance from Melbourne, have to be considered. But the Government are endeavouring to get the consideration of the Tariff completed so that it may be ready for the Senate when that Chamber re-assembles.",17
40,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I do not think that the Government are doing that. The Treasurer himself postpones one item after another.,17
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The honourable member is scarcely right in making that statement. When I wish to have an item postponed for a definite purpose, surely I am at liberty to move in that direction ! Further, the postponement of an item ""does not delay the consideration of the Tariff.",17
42,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I understood the Treasurer to say that the honourable member for West Sydney was at fault when he said,17
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I did not say anything of the kind.,17
44,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Then I will ask the Treasurer straight out whether it is not a fact that of his own volition a number of items in the Tariff were postponed ? Bill'can- Sir WILLIAM LYNE - So far only two items have been postponed, one because f I desired an opportunity to reconsider it, and another because the Opposition wished it to be postponed. There may have been a third item in respect of which a similar course was taken, but I am not sure.",17
45,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"As the Treasurer has expressed a desire to consult the convenience of honourable members who reside in other States, will be extend a little consideration to those who are so far removed from their homes that they can return there only after Parliament has been prorogued- I refer to the representatives of Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania? Will he consider the possibility of so expediting business as to allow them to leave Melbourne by the end of the month ?",17
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Honourable members should know, and, I believe, do know, that the Government desire to dispose of the remaining business as soon as possible. But I must draw attention to this fact, that yesterday we did not sit for a very good reason, ancl one as to which I am sure no honourable member would offer any objection. Had it not been for the very unforeseen and sad event which prompted that adjournment, the House would have sat yesterday, and would probably have disposed of a great deal of business. I hope to be able to return the Tariff to the Senate on Tuesday next, or, at the . latest, on Wednesday. PAPUA: VACANCIES IN PUBLIC SERVICE.",17
47,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"- 1 desire to ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact .that there are vacancies in the Civil Service of Papua, and, if so, what steps the Government are taking to fill them ?",18
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The matter is under the consideration of the Public Service Commissioner. I do not know whether he has made any report up to the present time. The question is ih the hands of the Prime Minister. NA GUNS FROM BELGIUM.,18
49,Mr HENRY WILLIS,IMPORTATIO N OF INFERIOR,"I wish the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, whether he is prepared to communicate to the House the substance of the report which he has received from his ofncials relating to the importation of inferior guns from Belgium.",18
50,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,IMPORTATIO N OF INFERIOR,"In replya to the honourable member, I wish to say that no definite report has yet been received. We are making inquiries into the matter, and we find that the task is a very difficult one, because no assistance"" has been received from those who have complained. But we have asked them to help us in every way that they can, and it is our earnest desire to affairs? prevent, if possible, the importation of inferior guns. Immediatelv I obtain definite information upon the matter, I shall glad to advise the honourable member. OPPOSITION CORNER.  surer whether he is aware that the Opposition "" push "" are intriguing with honourable members sitting ' behind the Governexactly ment",18
51,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTATIO N OF INFERIOR,"I must ask the honorwork able member not to describe in that way honourable members sitting in the Opposition corner.  Treasurer whether he is aware that the position corner party-the anti-socialistic party, or the Constitutional party-ar triguing to oust the Government from office, and to instal the right honourable member for Swan as the head of a new Ministry, with the honourable member for Kooyong the filling the position of Treasurer?",18
52,Mr LIDDELL,IMPORTATIO N OF INFERIOR,"I desire to ask you, sir, whether the word "" intriguing "" is a proper one to use in that relation?",18
53,Mr HUME COOK,IMPORTATIO N OF INFERIOR,The honourable member thinks that they are doing it openly.,18
54,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTATIO N OF INFERIOR,"If any honourable member, who conceives that the term can> be applied to him, objects to its use, I shall ask the honourable member fbr Maranoa towithdraw it.  term to apply to the action of members of the Opposition corner.",18
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,IMPORTATIO N OF INFERIOR,"In answer to the honourable member's question, I may say that I have heard certain rumours, but I have no personal knowledge of their accuracy. Honourable members of the Opposition corner have not yet approached me to ask in reference to the matter. NA DEPARTMENT - EXTENSION WORKS.",18
56,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he is aware that large number of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic extensions in New South Wales, which have been approved, are "" held up ""' because the money voted for these purposeshas been exhausted, and that in consequence great public inconvenience is being; suffered. If so, what steps does he propose to take to remedy this condition of",18
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I am very anxious to get the Additional Estimatesbe passed. The honourable member knows perfectly well that a great deal more money has been required for these extension works than was provided upon the Estimates-Tn,18
58,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Twic e as much.,18
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I cannot state how much; but it must be remembered that all the Treasurer has toon, until the Additional Estimates are passed, is the Treasurer's Advance, ancl that Advance cannot meet every demand until it is recouped by amounts upon the Additional Estimates. I am exceedingly anxious Op-- to have those Estimates passed.. They are, no doubt, very large, and the works toe in which the honourable member refers, and' many other works, have to be carried out; but, as I say, the Treasurer's Advance cannot meet all such demands. That is reason for the delay, a.nd the sooner the Additional Estimates are passedthe sooner the money will be available. J have gone to considerable length-indeed , I have goneas far as I possibly can, financially - in> allowing tenders to be called .for works for which the money has not yet been - voted, so that no delay shall take ""the Estimates are passed.

DUTY ON PRINTING PAPER.",18
60,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, ufon notice I. Was the following instruction issued to his officers on the 12th September :"" Printing Paper, coloured, for covers of weekly publications and similar productions, registered for transmission through the post, may be deemed * News,' and dealt with under item 3520 under security "" ? 2. Is it a fact that the effect of this instructo tion was that the publications described could get their cover papers in free if British, or 10 per cent, if Foreign, instead of paying 15 per - cent, or 20 per cent, under the Tariff? 3. Is it a fact that, without the above instruction, the said cover papers would have been - dutiable under the Tariff at 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, according as they were of .British or Foreign origin? - 4. Is it a fact that the importers were permitted tb get their said goods free owing to the Minister ""deeming"" them to properly belong to the following item of the Tariff :"" 352D. Printing, in Rolls or Folios known as Newspaper, to be used exclusively for Newspapers undeT Departmental by-laws, in sizes not less than 20 x 25 inches or its equivalent."" ? 5. Did the Minister, when the paper duties were passing the House, take the House into his confidence as to the ""instructions""-vid e also Notice Paper, date 6th May, 1908-whic h he had issued to his Department to "" deem"" otherwise dutiable articles free? 6. Have the effects of the Minister's "" instructions"" ever been made public? 7. Could the papers in connection with these matters be laid upon the table of the House? 8. In the Minister's answer of the 6th instant, he said that the Sydney Bulletin was specially mentioned in that "" instruction,"" which had the effect of allowing in free that journal's otherwise dutiable super-calendered paper, because-to use the Minister's words"" the question first came up in regard to that particular paper."" Could the Minister say who first approached the Government in the interests of that paper? 9. Did the Minister point out to the Sydney Bulletin that super-calendered paper was, or could be, made locally under a duty, and that consequently so strongly Protectionist a paper could well afford to set an example by buying its raw material from Australian manufacturers?",19
61,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to' the honourable member's quesplace after tions are as follow :1. Yes. 2. No. PAPERS. 3. No. 4. The view taken was that the paper in question was printing paper, and consequently there was no option but to deliver free. 5. There was no question of taking the House into confidence in this instance more than in ' the thousands of other cases which have arisen from time to time. As a rule, when a question as to rate of duty is submitted, the Comptroller General decides the matter at once. Anv person not concurring in such decision can at once appeal to the Minister, and if not satisfied with the latter's ruling,- has a short and easy way of applying to the Court for final review. rj. Yes. 7. No objection to furnish them for perusal of the honourable member. 8. The question was submitted to the Minister in the first instance by the Comptroller-General, who informs me that he received a telegram from the State Collector of New South Wales on the subject generally of the rate of duty be charged on such papers. Nothing is known of the reasons why the Collector applied to the Comptroller-General on the point, beyond the fact that the instance under remark was one only of many hundreds of similar cases. 9. The Minister had nothing to do with the Bulletin in the matter, and beyond approving of a recommendation made to him by the Comptroller-General, was not otherwise interested therein. The same question arose on the same date (4th September) in regard to other magazines in other States, and similar instructions were given in such instances. It may be explained that the only reason why the authority of the Minister was specially asked in this instance was, because, as originally introduced, the exemption was to be made under Ministerial by-law, otherwise the decision would have been given as a matter of course without, reference to the Minister. MANURE COMBINE.",19
62,Mr MCDOUGALL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"the Minister . of T r a d e and Customs, upon notice I. Whether it is not true that the manufacturers and importers of manures have formed a business combine with a view to stifle competition and raise prices to the farmers ancl gardeners ? 2. Is he aware that since such combine has come into existence the price of superphosphates has been increased by 7s. a ton, and that the said superphosphates contain 2 per cent, less water soluble phosphoric acid than formerly, and are consequently 16s. a ton dearer to purchasers than last season; also, that the combine has raiseB the interest on promissory notes due by 1 per cent. ? 3. Does he know fhat the combine has refused absolutely to sell manures to farmers' unions and associalions at a lower rate than it sells to the individual buyer, thus reversing the business tactics of the manure companies when selling in open competition with each other? 4. Is he aware that the firms constituting the combine advertise on the lines of a single business concern; and also, that when an agent of the combine violates the selling terms of the ring by undercutting a rival agent in price, the said agent will be dismissed without a certificate of character? . 5. Has it come to his knowledge that even while certain local manufacturers were touting for a duty on artificial manures they had already entered into combination with the importers? 6. As a manure combine is prejudicial to the best interests of the farmers and gardeners of the Commonwealth, will he use whatever constitutional means he may have to put a stop to its unfair trading? 7. Will he undertake to extend the scope of his inquiry byond the city offices and agents of the companies concerned in the combine, and when such inquiry .shall be complete, will he print the detailed result for the information of the public ?",19
63,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In reply to the honourable member's questions, I have to state that inquiries were made some time ago, but the information obtained was not sufficient to establish the existence of a combine. Now that an amending Act has been passed, further investigations wil l be made. AUSTRALIAN UNIFORMS : NA TOURNAMENT.",20

81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,But what do the officers of the Department ask the Minister to do about the duties? Is the honourable gentleman going to tax these articles as proposed by the Senate to the extent of 35 per cent. ?,22

98,Mr LIDDELL,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Hunter) [3.43] - I do not see why the. duties on these barometers (Parramatta) and thermometers should be raised from 5 per cent, and free to 25 and 20 per cent. What is the reason for this sudden change of face on lthe Treasurer's part? I should like to hear an explanation before I record a vote. These are necessary articles which cannot be made here.",23
99,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,We are told that they are all made in Queensland.,23
100,Mr LIDDELL,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Glas s thermometers are used very extensively in hospitals. They are very expensive articles. Not only is their initial cost heavy, but they are constantly broken, and have to be replaced. The supply of thermometers is a heavy item of expenditure to nurses, medical men, and hospitals. I am satisfied that we shall do a great injustice if we make dearer these absolutely necessary articles. Every one knows that when a mani is sick his temperature has to be taken frequently.",23
101,Mr MATHEWS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Does not able member think that they can afford to pay a duty out of the profit of 500 per cent., which is obtained on these articles?",24
102,Mr LIDDELL,ENGLISH MILITARY,"That is the way in which the protectionist is continually talking. Does not the honourable member know that the price of the articles has .been so arranged as to leave the lowest margin of profit? I should like to know the reason why the duties on these articles, which were fixed here after very careful - consideration, is proposed to be considerably increased at the request of another place.",24
103,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Swan) [3.45]- I think that the Senate's requested amendment should not be made. ought to encourage the use of these necessary instruments all over the country. A barometer is necessary nearly everywhere, especially in tropical districts, to give warning of storms, and the thermometer is in daily use by every one. I do not suppose that one could find a household without a thermometer. Why the Treasurer wants to impose an extra duty I do not know. I am sure that thermometers are not made here.",24
104,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Yes , they are.",24
105,Sir JOHNFORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I very much doubt the statement that good, reliable, and tested instruments are made in this country.",24
106,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,They are made in Svdney and Brisbane.,24
107,Sir JOHNFORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,How many?,24
108,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Any number of them.,24
109,Sir JOHNFORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I should like ito see some of them. I think that the request of the Senate is altogether adverse rto the progress of the country, and I shall vote against it .",24
110,Mr JOHNSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Lang) [3.47]-- I think that I understand why the Treasurer, in common with other strong protectionists, is anxious to remove these articles from an item under which they bear a low duty, so that they will f all under another item which carries a high duty. I think that the explanation is that the protectionist microbe which gets into the blood of some protectionist, and sets up a fever, is considered worthy of special development. been suggested by some honourable members that this industry is carried on, not in Collingwood, as we are usually told, but in Svdney and Brisbane - Whether it is carried on in those places or not, I consider that those who are obliged to have recourse the honor- to the use of these instruments in hospitals, sick rooms, and elsewhere should be able to procure them at the lowest possible price. So far as I can see, the only effect of raising the duty will be to increase their cost to the users. I shall certainly oppose the motion.",24
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.48] - When this item was under consideration previously there was a long debate, and it was very clearly proved that this glassware was made in Queensland, especially in Brisbane.",24
112,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,"How many articles do they make-tw o and a half in a year, I suppose? We Colonel FOXTON - Oh , no.",24
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,I have not yet seen one.,24
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I have made inquiries, and there is no doubt that in Queensland they have an industry. It is struggling at the present time; but it is producing very good articles indeed, and can produce pretty well all that are required.",24
115,Mr LIDDELL,ENGLISH MILITARY,"What is the struggle of the industry compared with that of many, persons for life?",24
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"L am quite satisfied that the industry is being carried on, and is turning out articles, which are well made and give great satisfaction. That is the reason why I have submitted the motion.",24
117,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,"This is some little tin-pot .industry in Brisbane. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [3.50] I do not understand why the right honourable member for Swan takes such strong exception to the proposed duty. The industry is not a tin-pot one, and what he has said shows that he knows nothing about it.",24
118,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,How many high class thermometers are made in Brisbane in a year?,24
119,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Ver y many. I have seen many scores of such thermometers in the factory there.,24
120,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,"And the beautiful It has pocket thermometers, are they made there, too?",24
121,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Yes .,24
122,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,Why should all who use these scientific instruments be required to pay high duties on them merely because a few are made in Brisbane?,24
123,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,I thought that the right honourable gentleman was a protec- - even tionist.,25
124,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,I am tionist j but I have not run mad about protection.,25
125,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Le t me read a letter which I have received from Messrs. J, and W. Wilson Ltd., the firm which manufactures these instruments in BrisbaneWhen this item was being debated in the House of Representatives previous to going to the Senate, it was insinuated that Clinical Thermometers could not be made in the Commonwealth. At the time. I was under the impression that they were being made, but having no specific information on the subject, did not feel justified in contradicting the statement that they could not be made. Since then, I have seen clinical thermometers made in Australia. The letter continuesNow the same may be said againIt has been saidand I wish to impress upon you that as good (minute or hal f-minute). Clinicals as are made in any part of the world are made by Mr J. B.. Arrigfii, Redfern, Sydney. The writers are referring to a rival firm.",25
126,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"But if the duty is imposcJ, they, as well as their rival, will benefit.",25
127,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Quite so. They sayWe will also make them when we find there is a demand for such articles, but at present the imported article is too cheap for a large trade to be done in them.",25
128,Mr JOHNSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,""" Too cheap !"" Then they wish to make them dearer?",25
129,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I can understand those who hold free-trade principles laughing at the idea; but my contention is that, since we have given protection to every other industry, this should be similarly treated.",25
130,Mr WILSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,There is protection in regard to all other glass making. Why worry about this? ',25
131,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Why not protect the whole industry? The writers go on to sayand, besides, the Medical professions are prejudiced .against Australian-made Clinicals",25
132,Mr LIDDELL,ENGLISH MILITARY,The honourable member has no proof of that.,25
133,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY," if offered al the same price as the imported article, they will not condescend to try them, and invariably demand Hick's English-made a protecClinicals",25
134,Mr WILSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Because they are the best in the world.,25
135,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY," or some other foreign makers who have a reputation for Clinicals, and the most effective way to dispel this prejudice against local-made instruments is to make the imported article more expensive, then the other can be offered at an advantageous price, and as soon as it becomes profitable to manufacture these or any other articles in Australia there will be no scarcity of competent hands to make them. During the debate, another member wished to know what standard we used, was it the Berlin, Paris, or London. Our standard instruments are all certified at the Kew Observatory, England, and each one is accompanied with a certificate of absolute accuracy, and all the instruments made by us correspond exactly with those standards, and standard temperatures, or standard weights, or measurements are the same whether in France, England, Germany, Australia, or any other _part of the world.",25
136,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Are these instruments sent to England to be tested?,25
137,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"No . But the standard instruments with"" which they are compared have been tested at Kew, London. The letter continues-We wish to impress upon you that we make Thermometers and Barometers of whatever design the exigencies of the case demands; we have made Thermometers up to 30 feet in length for silos and deep oil and brewing vats, besides they are also made in Sydney and Melbourne. Then follow a number of testimonials as to the excellence of the firm's manufactures, with which I shall not trouble the Committee.",25
138,Mr LIDDELL,ENGLISH MILITARY,Is the honourable member prepared to give a certificate to the clinical thermometers which he says are manufactured in Australia?,25
139,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Seeing that everything which the persons engaged in this industry have to buy is taxed to protect other industries, their business also should be protected.",25
140,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,What about the wire-netting industry?,25
141,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,I have nothing to do with that at the present time. Honourable members who are of the medical profession show that they have a prejudice against the Australian-made article.,25
142,Mr LIDDELL,ENGLISH MILITARY,Not at all ; but we take an interest in the welfare of 'the people.,25
143,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"-Have, the medical .members of the Committee tried Austrabut, lian-made clinical thermometers?",26

151,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Clinica l therand mometers have not yet been made at Brisclinical bane.,26

157,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,They were being made there MV. DUGALD THOMSON - Eve n the Tariff of 1902 imposed no duty on clinical thermometers.,26
158,Mr LIDDELL,ENGLISH MILITARY,"At any rate, the Brisfirm does not seem to be yet in the position to make these - instruments. Very a patient's life hangs by a hair, everything then depends on the regular and accurate recording of his temperature. If the Treasurer. visited one of our hospitals, he could be shown miles of charts a recording temperatures, which, in some are taken, - not from hour to hour, found for but every fifteen minutes.",26
159,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,Does the honourable world member mean to say that we cannot make into these little instruments here?,26

161,Mr LIDDELL,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I am sure that the Treasurer has great sympathy for the sick the suffering, and I hope that since thermometers, like cotton wool, which has been made free, are used chiefly for the suffering and the poor, he will agree to except them from the request. and Any honourable member who professes to represent his fellow-workers should refuse to vote for a higher duty on clinical ther",26
162,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,The honourable member has just been told that they can be,26
163,Mr LIDDELL,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The localmanufacapturer in a letter which has been read on this subject, clearly indicates that if they subject to a higher duty, they will be everymore expensive. He complains that he cannot at present make them because the imported instruments are sold at a very .low rate. It is well for the sake of sufferI That the f ollowinf; modification be made :After ""Telescopes"" insert ""and Clinical Thermometers.""",26
164,Mr JOHNSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Lang) [4.8] - In support of the modification proposed by the honourable member for Hunter, I would remind the Committee that, in the letter quoted by the honourable member for Brisbane, it is claimed that the industry to which the request relates is already established in Brisbane and Sydney, and it also exists, I understand, in Melbourne. Freetraders are invariably told by protectionists that the object of a protective tariff is to encourage the starting of industries and to help them over their infantile stages, and that once fairly started they do not need protection. Since this industry has been started, and .has apparently flourished and developed under free-trade conditions, the argument for protection in this case falls to the ground. Then we have the further naive admission by the manufacturers in Brisbane-a n admission that we do not often obtain from our protectionist friends - that they desire an increased duty to enable them to charge a higher price, because they cannot compete against the low prices charged for the superior imported article. Here we have another protectionist' fallacy exposed. Our protectionist friends opposite never fail to assure us that protection cheapens prices. These manufacturers point out that what they object to is cheapness-the y object to the public being able to obtain these instruments at a low price. We are asked to impose a duty which will be practically prohibitive in its operation in order that local manufacturers may sell an inferior article at a higher price."" We are here to see that the public are not robbed or unduly fleeced for the gain of any firm or individual, and we should be wanting in our duty if we accepted the request. I support the proposed modification. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [4.11] - No great objection can be. taken to the proposed modification, but I shall expect honourable members to support the motion subject to that modification. Proposed modification agreed to.",26
165,Mr JOHNS ON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Lang) [4.12] - Are we now asked to agree to the Senate's request to strike out certain words?,27
166,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,Yes. ',27
167,Mr JOHNSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Then I shall certainly oppose the motion.,27
168,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"If the motion is lost, the modification will also go.",27
169,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Wentworth) [4.1.3] - If honourable members wish to vote against barometers being dutiable at more than 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, they should resist the motion.",27
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,But a compromise was agreed upon.,27
171,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The Minister certainly said that he would expect honourable members to help, him in carrying the motion if he agreed to the proposed modification, but, in reply, I did not hear anything that could be interpreted as being in the nature of a compromise. I think that honourable members are free to vote against the requested amendment. The honourable member for Brisbane said what was very much to the point, and whilst I do not know that. a case has been made out for taxing barometers, I consider that we have taken the sting out of the requested amendment by the modification providing for the insertion of the words "" and clinical thermometers."" Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [4.15] I suggested to the Treasurer that he should accept the proposed modification as the controversy ranged chiefly round the question of whether or not clinical thermometers should be subjected to a higher duty. Before that modification was agreed to a number of honourable members who had listened to the previous debate left the chamber, and they will probably return under the impression that clinical thermometers are still affected by the request. I hope that it will be made clear that the Treasurer has gracefully given way in respect of those instruments, and that the motion now relates really to a request in respect of other instruments which were not even mentioned during the debate.",27
172,Mr LIDDELL,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Hunter) [4.18] - When I moved a' modification of this request, I felt sure that the Treasurer would accept it. He was good enough to do so, and although he said that he would expect honourable members to agree to the request as modified, it was impossible for me to make any binding agreement with him. I made no agreement with the Treasurer, and I do not think he expected me to do so.",27
173,Mr JOHNS ON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Lang) _ [4.19] - I would point out that by rejecting the request, as a whole, we shall retain clinical thermometers in ""this item, under which they are dutiable at 5 per. cent., as against the proposal that they should be dutiable at 25 per cent. On the other hand, j f we agree to the request,_ as modified, we shall make all other thermometers, as well as barometers, dutiable at 25 per cent. I am not .prepared to do that, and shall vote against the motion.",27
174,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Wentworth) [4.20] - Apart from clinical thermometers, the articles included in this item to which I attach much importance' are barometers. To levy a heavy tax upon these instruments, which are used by small coastal vessels, would subject that class of shipping to an increased disability. In this connection, we must recollect that these vessels have to compete with ships which get their barometers free of duty. Seeing that lives at sea might be imperilled as the result of vessels not being equipped with barometers, surely we might place these articles upon the free list. Of course, oversea shipping companies do not care whether we impose an additional £ 3 upon their barometers or not.

The duty proposed by the Senate varies from about 12^ ,per cent, on the higher grade goods to 30 per cent, on the lower grade.",33
234,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,That imposes the higher duty on the lower grade article. That can scarcely be right.,33

237,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ENGLISH MILITARY,Fawkner) [5.35] I agree with the Treasurer that the question raised by the Senate's request is a somewhat difficult one to decide. It should be remembered that the item covers a raw material required by bootmakers. The question is whether we should admit high class kid worn by the people of the upper classes at a lower rate of duty .than inferior kid. There is a conflict of opinion.,33
238,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I am well aware of that. the requested Mr FAIRBAIRN - My suggestion is that we should make the item read "" 2d. per square foot, or ad valorem 2o per cent., whichever rate returns the higher duty.""

The boot manufacturers and tanners of New South Wales are agreed that a duty of 20 per cent, is a reasonable compromise, the former recognising that the tanners must receive protection. If a rate of 2d. per square foot were agreed to, it would be equivalent to a duty of i 2 i per cent, ad valorem on the best leather, and would come to as much as 33^ I am not an per cent, ad valorem on inferior leather, which is sometimes sold for as little as 6d. per square foot.",33
240,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,It is down to Sd.,33
241,Mr WATSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,That makes the ad valorem rate still higher. The disparity in duty would be so great that it would be a mistake to make the amendment suggested by the Senate.,34

245,Mr WATSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,He certainly produces the best glace kid.,34
246,Mr TUDOR,ENGLISH MILITARY,No ; others produce a much better article. 1^ understand that the deputation agreed that it would be a fair compromise between the tanners and the boot manufacturers to fix the duty at2d. per square foot.,34
247,Mr WATSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,That was agreed to only by the Melbourne men.,34

256,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ENGLISH MILITARY,Robertson) [5.50] - The Minister has given 'no reason why white sheep and white lamb leather should bear a duty of 20 per cent. There is no difficulty in making such leather. It is made here in very large quantities.,34
257,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"That is the reason for imposing a duty - Mr HENRY WILLIS - Ver y little labour is attached to the manufacture of white leather. It is merely a question of passing the skins through a solution of sul-. phuric acid and salt and rubbing a little oil upon them. The imported white leather is of excellent quality, and sets a standard to local manufacturers. If the - duty were taken off, it would do a lot of good to the trade; a much better article would be produced locally because a high standard would have to be maintained. If , however, we levy a duty of 15 or 20"" per cent., the tendency will be to stop the importation of white leather, and the trade must use whatever is locally produced. It will encourage that slovenliness which has prevailed in the - past. Certainly it is not necessary for the maintenance of the industry. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say in favour , of imposing a duty of 20 per cent, on this article, which is used more largely by the masses than by the upper classes. It is the cheapest and most inferior kind of leather.",34
258,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The honourable member knows the reason for imposing the duty - He told us that the leather was made here in large quantities. We want to protect the local manufacturers. After all, it is a small matter.",34
259,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I think that the Treasurer should address at least a few words to the Committee on this question. He is seeking to impose a duty of 20 per cent, on the manufacture of an article which is very easily and inexpensively produced. But he has given no reason why it should be levied. Evidently honourable members are satisfied, but I , as a member of the Committee, should like to know why I am asked to vote for a duty of 20 per cent.",35
260,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"To help a very good industry. * Motion agreed to. Requested amendment; not made, but modification made.

261,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,East Sydney)'[5.54] - Thi is a monstrous proposal. Surely protecduty tion can be carried out in a straightforduty of 6d. per lb. ward way by imposing duties which are considered adequate for the purpose.,35
262,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,The Senate carried this request by seventeen votes to nine.,35
263,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,I do not feel overwhelmed b> the statement of that fact.,35
264,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,It shows the strong feeling there.,35
265,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I think that the nine senaand tors have more sense than the seventeen, if tion. I am bound to express an opinion on the subject. Surely it is beneath the national protectionist policy of Australia to put tax of 6d. per lb. on price lists and trade catalogues! What an extraordinary way that is of trying to carry out a national policy-to prevent useful information from coming into the country !",35
266,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,That has already been agreed to.,35
267,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I am very sorry thathaving an opportunity of doing so- I have to disagree with it . The seventeen senators were so anxious to "" go one better"" that they have requested a duty of 6d. per lb., or 35 per cent, ad valorem. That, in my opinion, is going too far. I do not suppose that we can do anything more than object to the requested amendment. I do not know which is the cheaper rate, but it seems to be a monstrous thing to put a duty of 6d. per lb. on these articles.",35
268,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"North Sydney) [5.56] - Surely a duty of 6d. oer lb. is quite sufficient protection to give ir» respect of these articles ! Such advertisements, when contained in a magazine, are dealt with in paragraph D of this item ad356, but, of course, it would be out of I do not know the effect of the alteration requested by the Senate in paragraph A of ; the item, but surely the Minister can decline their request for a duty of 35 per cent. I think that it applies to only the higher Photoclass of advertisements, and will increase ad the cost of them^yery much. Great care has been taken in other items to insure that all legitimate printing shall be done here^ and therefore there is no necessity to put on this percentage in addition to, or ir» conjunction with, a duty of 6d. per lb. on price lists and trade catalogues. There are certain things which, owing to their very nature, must be imported. A duty of 6d. per lb. ought to be enough to prevent the importation of anything which can s be printed locally. _ I cannot' vote for a of 35 per cent, in addition to the",35
269,Mr CROUCH,ENGLISH MILITARY,"It is not in addition, but an alternative.",35

271,Sir JOHN QUICK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Bendigo) [5 58] I think that in making this request, the a Senate was guided by the knowledge that there is a very great distinction between the values of a number of the articles included in this paragraph. Some of them are very cheap, in fact, as cheap as dirt, - whilst others are of the most valuable character. Some of the advertisements are framed, and some are unframed. A duty - of 6d. per lb. will , it is believed, operate unequally on the rubbish as compared with the highly valuable articles, and the materials included in the paragraph. The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a' differentiation based upon the consideration as to whether the advertisements were framed or unframed. We suggested a duty of 25 per cent, on the former and a duty of 6d. per lb. on the latter. I think that a duty of 35 per cent, is excessive. I shall be prepared to support an alternative duty of 25 per cent. That would, I consider, operate with greater equality than would an all-round duty of 6d. per lb. It is most unfair that the cheap stuff should bear the same rate of duty as the highly-finished and very valuable articles included in the paragraph. I shall vote against the proposal to fix the duty at 35 per cent., but I would suggest that, as a modification, a duty of 25 per cent., as recommended by the A section of the Tariff Commission, might be accepted.",35
272,Mr COON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Batman) [ 6 . 0 ] - I hope that the Government will stick to their proposal, because a duty of 35. per cent, means effective protection.",36
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,Mak e it cent. !,36
274,Mr COON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Yes , I would, because some of the printing for New South Wales is carried out in Japan.",36
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,Where is the proof of that?,36
276,Mr COON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"-In another place, Senator Vardon exhibited catalogues and bills which had' been imported from Japan, where the wages of a journeyman printer average 8s. or 9s. per week. We are told now that a duty of 25 per cent: will be sufficient.",36
277,Mr ATKINSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"In the case of these bills, what percentage would a duty of 6d. per lb. represent?",36
278,Mr COON,ENGLISH MILITARY,The honourable member knows that a duty of 6d. per lb. would not stop the importation of the rubbish which is coming in. It will not enable Australian labour at £ 3 per week to compete with - Japanese labour at 8s. or 9s. a week. We should see that importation of such articles is prohibited. They are brought from a country where ships are loaded by women with children strapped to their backs. Is that what honourable members want to see introduced here? That is the sort of competition we - have to contend with.,36
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,Is that what protection does there?,36
280,Mr COON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"A duty of 25 per cent, is not sufficient protection. In Australia we have plenty of printers to do all the printing work which is required to be done. W i ll honourable members on the other side assert that we cannot do our own printing, or that the catalogues which are distributed by various firms cannot be printed here? We find that honorablegentlemen who were prepared to vote protection are now prepared to vote free-trade.",36
281,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Is a duty of 6d. per lb. free-trade? - ,36
282,Mr COON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"As regards this item, it is practically free-trade. It is hardly any protection. I ask honourable members who belong to the new Constitutional Party and believe in effective protection to vote for a duty of 35 per cent., as recommended by the Government.",36
283,Mr CROUCH,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Corio) [ 6 . 4 ] - I think that it was an oversight not to insert the words "" or the value "" after the words "" the weight"" in the phrase ""including the weight of the frame."" I wonder how the honourable member for Bendigo can think that a duty of 35 per cent, .is exces50 per sive, when he knows the quantity of printed matter which is constantly imported fro m Germany. At the bottom of the majority of lithographed advertisements he will find some such words as "" Made in Bavaria."" It seems to me that it is not a right state of things that printing for Australia should be done in Germany.",36
284,Mr MCDOUGALL,ENGLISH MILITARY,Some Victorian postcards are printed in Germany.,36
285,Mr CROUCH,ENGLISH MILITARY,"That is so. Coloured supplements published by newspapers are often printed in Germany. The Australasian, for instance, has published a coloured supplement printed in Bavaria. Such printed matter ought to be taxed. It is unreasonable that advertisements in the English language intended for use in this country should be printed in foreign lands.",36
286,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,The honourable member need not be afraid so far as newspaper imports are concerned. The Minister will deem them to be what they are not.,36
287,Mr CROUCH,ENGLISH MILITARY,"To use a well-known phrase, the honourable member seems to have a ""bee in his bonnet"" in regard to certain imported paper used by the Sydney Bulletin. It is unfortunate that he cannot accept the replies by the Minister of Trade and Customs to his questions on the subject. Advertisements are printed in foreign countries for use in Australia because the wages of printers in those countries are less than they are here.",36
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,Notwithstandin their highly protective duties?,37
289,Mr CROUCH,ENGLISH MILITARY,"In the absence' of protective policy, the wages in those counprinting tries would be much less. A lot is done abroad on the score of cheapness, and I think it only reasonable that those vvho pay high wages should be protected.",37
290,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Would honourable member make this item free so far as imports from the United States concerned ?,37
291,Mr CROUCH,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I should be prepared Corio to agree to a very strong reciprocal Tariff with the United States of America, and would make these duties so high that, whilst we entered into reciprocal Tariff agreements with countries where fair wages conditions prevailed, our own workmen would still be adequately protected. Honourable members who are not in favour effective duties are placing obstacles in the reasonable. way of reciprocal agreements with other countries. I hope that the honourable memqualities ber for Bendigo will see his way even to agree to this request.",37

These duties in many cases will be equal to 50 per cent., and, superimposed on those on manufactures in connection with which the printed matter is used, they g savour of protection run mad. When we raise these objections, we are told that a some business men in Australia have their done in Japan-that at some time of work or other during his long business career Anthony Hordern made an importation of printed matter from that country. I do not hesitate to say that he was wrong in the doing so, but are we going on the strength of a case like that to penalize the people of are all countries where the workers are not - - sweated? If the honourable member for is satisfied with the logic of his statement, he must be prepared to allow printed I matter to come in free from countries where the labour conditions are satisfactory. It is absurd that we should superimpose these duties on others upon imports in connection with which this printed matter is used.",37
295,Mr SALMON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Lannecoorie) [6.10] - I of think that the Senate's proposal is very It goes without saying that under an item covering a wide range of there should be some difference now between the duties imposed on high and low-grade manufactures.,37
296,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Quite so, and honorpreable members of the Opposition argued the other way when the request in respect of unleather was under consideration.",37
297,Mr SALMON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Exactly . Honourable It is promembers must agree that lithographic printcouning covers a wide range of qualities.,37
298,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"As in the case of leather. Modify the request by proposing a a duty of 20 per cent., and we will agree",37
299,Mr SALMON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I hope that the Gowill not accept such a proposition, and I am sure that some honourable t is members of the Opposition would not.",37
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,Then there is no between this request and that relating to the duties on leather.,37
301,Mr SALMON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The fact that the printed matter covered by this item, in some cases, is of very high value, would make it unreasonable to impose an all-round duty of 6d. per lb. I think we are all agreed that we should have an alternative ad Confectionery valorem duty.",37
302,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,We are not.,37
303,Mr SALMON,ENGLISH MILITARY,I am astonished fhat any honourable member should urge that imported material of low quality the same duty should be imposed as is levied on of very high quality.,38
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,Unde r this proand posal a duty of 6d. per lb. will have paid on printed matter of the poorest quality.,38
305,Mr SALMON,ENGLISH MILITARY,I hope so. I think we lower impost. are agreed that there should be an alternative ad valorem duty.,38
306,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"No . . Mr SALMON - Do I understand that honourable members of the Opposition wish to disagree with the request that an valorem, as well as a fixed, duty should be imposed?",38
307,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Yes .,38
308,Mr SALMON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I am sorry to hear that. On some of the higher-priced lines the duty collected will .be as much 2S. 6d. per lb. , and I think that they should be so taxed. A great deal has been said in regard to cheap printing obtained from Japan, and I propose to read the evidence of an Australian master who visited that country. He states that when in Yokohama he inspected a Japanese printery, managed by a cute American, found that it was turning out lithographic work in a style which would not be dismember creditable to any Australian printing office. He states that in the matter of value would compete with anything turned out by an Australian printer.",38
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"And those were managed by a cute Yankee- a good protectionist, wbo l e ft his country to find cheap labour.",38
310,Mr SALMON,ENGLISH MILITARY,I am glad to say that he could not find it in his own country. The Australian master printer to whom I have referred states that he discovered that wages paid in the trade in Yokohama were about one-sixth of those received by men doing similar work in Melbourne or Sydney. He gives specific instances in which men were paid 9s. per week. Surely we do not desire to expose our own workers to such competition?,38
311,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,But wages are paid in other countries for a lot of this work.,38
312,Mr SALMON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I have given the evidence of a master printer who vis ted printing works in Japan, and who testifies that the work is well done. That is not surprising, since it is well known that the Japanese are the most expert copyists in on the world. In respect of wages alone, we should have to impose a duty of something thatlike 600 per cent, in order to make good the difference between those paid in Japan Australia. We are asked to agree to to be a duty of 35 per cent., and I am sorry that the honourable member for Bendigo should have oommitted himself to a much",38
313,Sir JOHN FORREST,ENGLISH MILITARY,He stands by the duty which he recommended as Chairman of the Tariff Commission.,38
314,Mr SALMON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I do not know whether some of the evidence"" now available was ad given before the Commission, but in the light of specific information in respect to this important matter, I think that he may perhaps consider that a_duty of 35 per cent, is by no means too high.",38
315,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Robertson) [6.19] - I am rather surprised that the as honourable member for Laanecoorie, who, outside the House, is very _ reasonable,should be prepared to support this request. If some honourable members had their way the policy of protection would be carried printer to the point of prohibition.",38
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The honourable member for"" Laanecoorie has said that a and 600 per cent, duty ought to be imposed.",38
317,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The honourable for Batman has also urged the im- ' position of high duties to keep out matter it printed abroad. I can quite understand protectionists arguing in that way, seeing that they are willing fo grant manufacturers works the benefit of duties of 100 per cent - as they did the manufacturers of furniture. This Committee has extended an inordinate measure of protection to all classes of manufacturers.",38
318,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,The duties imposed can scarcely be called protection vet.,38
319,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The Treasurer desires to impose prohibitive duties. I maintain that it would be a good thing for the public if we could make commodities cheaper than they are. In respect of many articles, our manufacturers already enjoy effective protection by reason of the oversea freight charges. higher Sir JOHN FORREST - Why "" stone-wall "" the Tariff?",38
320,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I wish to say a word 6tr two because I was rather sur: prised to find the right honourable member for Swan anxious to support a 15 per cent, duty upon a certain article when he might have secured its admission free. I really do not know whether he is a protectionist 01 a free-trader. But this circumstance serves only to evidence the state of demoralization which the Committee has reached.",38
321,Mr SPENCE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Darling) [6.23] - In .spite of the attempt of the honourable member for Parramatta to discount the importance of the ""printed in Japan"" idea, I maintain that there is a good deal of truth in the assertion which has been made When I examined the Christmas calendar issued by Mr Hordern-whic h was printed in Japan- I did not fail to observe that it contained no imprint. That fact in it self is very significant. The calendar in question is a very fine production. It reproduces the Australian waratah and other native flowers, and altogether it is a work which reflects credit upon the printing establishment responsible for it. I have been informed that the contract for the production of this calendar was obtained by a clever American, who let the work out in Japan, where it could be done cheaply. If my information is correct, it evidences a new development of considerable interest to us, because, when the contract was let, it was doubtless assumed that the successful tenderer would have the work done in America, which is recognised as a high wage country, This is a case in which I shall vote for the imposition of a higher duty. I do not think that it matters what rate we impose on this item. The artistic work to which I have alluded can be successful lv undertaken in Australia, and there is very widespread competition for it. - Mr SAMPSON - It can be undertaken in every city in the Commonwealth.",39
322,Mr SPENCE,ENGLISH MILITARY,Consequentl y there is no reason to apprehend that the effect of levying a high duty will be to enhance the prices.,39
323,Unknown,ENGLISH MILITARY,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m.,39
324,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Hume-Trea surer) [7.45] - I hope the Committee will not agree to strike out the duty of 35 per cent. In many cases there is a vast differ - ence between a fixed duty of 6d. and an elastic ad valorem duty. As honourable members know, a fixed duty of 6d. may bear very heavily on one class of goods and very lightly on another. The suggested amendment was supported by the Government in the Senate, and was agreed to by seventeen votes l n that the Senate felt very strongly on the point. I do not attach mucli importance to a vote'of the kind, but when we find such a large majority, I think it is as well to agree to the request.",39
325,Mr TUDOR,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Yarra) [7.48] - I trust that the requested amendment will be made. All these advertisements must be to adver- tise goods sold in Australia, and, in this connection, the argument used so frequently by honourable members opposite as to the "" poor farmer "" or the "" poor miner "" cannot apply. I am not sure whether decorative tin plates come under this item, but, in any case, I think they should. If Australian manufacturers send Home for show cards and any sort of advertising matter, or for decorated tins in which to place their Australian goods, they ought to pay duty, because, in some of these lines, it would pay the foreign, manufacturers to keep their machinery going at a loss, in order to supply us at a cheap rate. I feel confident that honourable members opposite cannot "" put up a fight "" on this item as they have on others, because no other industry can. possibly be penalized if this requested amendment be made. - Question-That the requested amendment, making the duty on item .356, paragraph A (Manufactures of Paper, & c ) , 6d. per Ib. or ad val. 35 per cent., be madeput.

327,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,"East Sydney) [8.0] - Of course, I cannot verify statements which have been made in regard to this matter, but I suppose that every honourable member has received a circular from the proprietors of the chief directories published in Australia.",40
328,Mr CROUCH,ENGLISH MILITARY,What is the date of the circular to which the right honourable member refers?,40
329,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The 10th September, 1907 ; but I have received a letter from the manager of the same concern, dated 6th May-onl y a few days ago. It does seem to me to be an extraordinary thing, but it is stated here definitely that these directories have to be published very rapidly, and that the proprietors have tried over and over again to get tenders for the work to be done in Australia, without success.",40
330,Mr WATSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,The master printers deny that.,40
331,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,Do they?,40
332,Mr CROUCH,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I put a question to Minister of Trade and Customs during the PAIRS. previous debate, and he said that he had inquired into statements to a similar effect, and found that they were incorrect, and that Australian printers were prepared to undertake the work.",40
333,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I think it is rather a strange thing that these statements should be made so confidently. It is stated in this circular, amongst other things, that they did manage to have the New South Wales work done in New South Wales, but at the end of the contract the printers declined to renew at any price, and the firm had again to transfer the work outside the Comc ) , monwealth. At any rate, 4d. per lb. is a very fair duty. I want to point out, however, that the duty of 4d. was agreed to in this Chamber after some debate, and Time the duty of 6d. was only carried in the by the votes of two Ministers. That is what I am told.",40
334,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,No ; it was carried by sixteen to twelve.,40
335,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,"If the two Ministers had gone over to the other side there would have been a tie, and the duty would have remained at 4 d . ; so that my statement is substantially correct. It is rather hard that the Government should agree to a rate of duty in this Chamber, and that two members of the sameMinistry should vote the other way to upset the arrangement in the Senate. Ministers may very well say, when the Senate carries a certain duty against them, that they cannot help it . But if an arrangement, made by Ministers in this Chamber is upset by the votes of Ministers in the other branch of the Legislature, it is rather hard. The proprietors of these directories employ a very large' amount of labour. Of course, I cannot vouch for the statement, but they say that they spend : ^10,000 a year in Australia upon their work.",40
336,Mr MATHEWS,ENGLISH MILITARY,They will spend more when they get all their work done in Australia.,40
337,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,"It is an Australian industry. There is no doubt about that. J am not objecting to its being handicapped, so far as that is done in accordance with the . protectionist policy, but even under that policy some regard might be had to an Australian industry which does employ labour. Is not a duty of 4d. per lb. enough? Surely anything that the Treathe surer will accept as a compromise ought to be considered enough.",40
338,Mr MATHEWS,ENGLISH MILITARY,The Opposition have not always followed out the principle of adhering to compromises.,41
339,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,"That only shows the evil of a bad example. We are only human, and when Ministers err we also may occasionally err by deserting the straight path. But. in this instance the compromise is a fair one. I am not going to prolong the debate, but I think that these people, taking their own statements, have claims which ought to be considered.",41
340,Mr WATSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"South Sydney) [8.5] I am sure that difficulties in regard to the printing in Australia of Wise's directories do not arise to anything like the extent that has been alleged. There is no difficulty, from a printer's stand-point, in producing those directories here, any more than' there is in producing the directories issued by John Sands, and Company in Sydney, and Sands and MCDougall in Melbourne. I think that ' Sands and MCDougall's Directory is published in as short a time as are Wise's directories.",41
341,Mr THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"But Sands MCDougall's and John Sands are also big printing firms, and produce their own directories.",41
342,Mr WATSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"There are other large printing firms in Sydney and ""Melbourne, which are quite capable of producing these volumes. The fact of the matter is that in the past the proprietors of Wise's directories have'found-it profitable to have their work done in the Old Country, where compositors wages are as low as 28s. or 30s. per week, and proportionate amounts are paid for machining work. Under the free-trade regime it paid these people to have their printing done abroad, by means of which they made a considerable saving on their typographical and other work in connection with the production of their volumes. In this country the wages of compositors run from 52s. to 60s. per week.",41
343,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,Directorie s were free under the old Tariff.,41
344,Mr WATSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"That is the reason why Wise's people preferred to import the printed volumes. I am satisfied that within the time that it takes to send the copy from Australia to England and to bring the books back from England to Australia, the volumes could be printed and bound in Australia. At least three months must be consumed in the two voyages, and within that time. I am certain that any' of the large printing establishments in Australia could produce the volumes. [394]",41
345,Mr JOHNSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Does not the honourable member think that a duty of 4d. per lb., would be sufficient?",41
346,Mr WATSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I have not made a. calculation as to what that duty would amount to per volume j but the statement that these directories cannot be printed in Australia is, to the best of my belief, - without foundation.  this subject was before the Committee on the last occasion, the Treasurer agreed to accept a duty of 4d. per lb. by way of compromise. It is idle to compare the work contained in one of Sands and MCDougall's directories with the work contained in one of Wise's directories, inasmuch as the number of names in the iatter volumes is far greater. In one of Sands and MCDougall's directories there are 36,000 names, whereas in one of Wise's directories, which can be compared with Sands ancl MCDougall's, there are 116,000 names. Take a few towns. Wise's Directory of Bendigo contains 6,500 names, and whereas Sands and MCDougall's contains 1,500. In the case of Geelong, Wise's Directory contains 5,750 names, as against 800 names-in Sands and MCDougall's. A similar comparison might be made with regard to other towns.",41
347,Mr WATSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,It is aU a question of cost.  spends more in wages in Australia than Sands and MCDougall do.,41
348,Mr WATSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I do not think so.  Wise's have tried to get their printing done in Australia, and have failed. It is not so much a question of the printing as of the' time within which the work is done. They hacl one of their directories printed once in New South Wales, and the firm of printers with which they contracted refused to renew the contract. The duty of 4d. per lb. on this printed matter is avery substantial one. When the Tariff was last before us the Treasurer voluntarily agreed to the duty of 4d. I think that the Government ought to be satisfied with that.",41
349,Mr JOHNSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Lang) [ 8 . 9 ] - If any honourable member will take the trouble to look at one of these volumes, he will be able to form an opinion as to the weight of it. The directory which I hold in my hand weighs about 8 lbs., or a little over, and the duty' of 6d. would amount to about 4s. per volume. I am referring to the directory for New South' Wales.",41
350,Mr TUDOR,ENGLISH MILITARY,That is the largest State.,42
351,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The honourable forgive New South Wales for that, I hope !",42
352,Mr JOHNSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The people of New South Wales will have to pay that extra price for theircopies of these directories. Everv person who is compelled to buy one of these volumes will be mulcted in a alty of at least 4s. Surely that is an rageous impost. A duty of 4d. per will make the price. 2s. 8d. higher. That ought to be sufficient. If it is not sufficient directories. protection for the local printers, I like to know how much they would like. As the duty of 4d. was agreed to by the Treasurer on the last occasion, some stantial and weighty reason ought to given for the reversal of our decision. submit that no reasons have been given an increase of the duty.",42
353,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Wentworth) [8.15] - I was much struck with the remarks of the honourable member for Grey, who has used facts and figures to prove' that this directory is peculiarly worthy of Government support, and not of Government hindrance. I have since been turning over in my mind what cause there could possibly have been for the Minister to ask us to impose ditional duty. I have come to the conclusion that he can have no other object than benefit certain rich and important firms Australia, competing with this directory, such as Sands and MCDougall, in Melabout bourne, and other firms producing direccourse, tories in other parts of the Commonwealth. If the Minister has any other his extraordinary action I hope he will explain them to the Committee, so that we may be able to appreciate, them at their proper weight.",42
354,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,I hope the Minister stand by his own arrangement.,42
355,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The 4d. duty was untime. doubtedly the Minister's own arrangement. He will always keep any promise or rangement he makes, unless it is convenient for him to get out of it. This seems to does. ba a case in wlvch, for some reason, it is convenient for him to get out of his pact. Unless he has some valid trround offer to the Committee, we are forced the conclusion that he must be seeking benefit and advantage certain Australian competitors of this great firm. I hope Committee will atecept the facts and where their printing is done. figures adduced by the honourable member for Grev. Until contrary information forthcoming, every honourable must stand by the compact that the Minmember will ister himself made.",42
356,Mr TUDOR,ENGLISH MILITARY,"[8.17] - On e of the principal objects of the introduction of the Tariff was the removal of anomalies. We have already agreed to a duty of 6d. per lb. without any preference on the item advertisements, show cards, catalogues, & c , penon which we divided a few minutes ago, outand honourable members on the Opposition lb. side are now trying to create an anomaly by imposing a preferential duty of 4d. on The honourable member for should Wentworth stated that the New South Wales directory weighed about 8 lbs., and that, therefore, the duty on it would be sub4s - Why, if he wanted to be fair, be did he not take the case of an average, I and not the biggest State? The Tasmanian for Directory would be only about one-ninth or one-tenth of the size of that for New South Wales. The duty on it would, therefore, be only 6d.",42
357,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The rate is 6d. per lb., and therefore it is the same duty per in. formation given.",42
358,Mr TUDOR,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I admit that, but why did not the honourable member state that in the case of some of the States the duty the adwould be less than is. per volume? As Tasmania has only about one-tenth of the to population of New South Wales, her direc- ' in tory could have only one-tenth of the number of names, and therefore would be only one-tenth of the size, barring, of the advertisements, which we have already decided shall be charged 6d. per reasons for lb., if by themselves.",42
359,Mr JOHNSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,Is Tasmania so rich that she can afford to pav this heavy duty ?,42
360,Mr TUDOR,ENGLISH MILITARY,"This duty will n'ot affect the poor farmer. He does not have the will directory in his home, so that honourable members opposite cannot raise that cry this",42
361,Mr LIVINGSTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,I think the farmers ardo have directories in their homes. They want them quite as much as anybody else,42
362,Mr TUDOR,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I am surprised to hear comit. If the "" poor farmer "" has a directory to he cannot be very poor. I have taken the to trouble to look through these directories to to ascertain where they are printed. They are printed, I believe, by the Kelly's the Directories Company, who do not state I have no doubt that with their usual anxietv to get is a cheap article they go outside of London. member According to the imprint on the book, they have, in addition to their office in High Holborn, a place at Kingston-on-Thames. From a list which I hold in my hand of wages in the printing trade in England, Kingston-on-Thames is omitted. I see that some of the wages for compositors are as low as 23s. per week. At Exeter, compositors work 52J hours per week for 23s. per week. I do not suppose there are three towns in Australia bigger than Exeter. Are we tb allow directories which are not printed under union conditions to be brought into Australia? We do not know . the conditions of labour in the place where this directory is produced. If the printing is done in Victoria or in New South Wales, or some of the otlier States, Wages Board conditions will apply.. At any rate, we intend to apply the new protection, and we can catch any printer who evades Wages Board conditions, employs an 'undue proportion of boy labour, or attempts to cut down wages.",42
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,The honourable member will applv the new protection when he gets it .,43
364,Mr TUDOR,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I have no doubt we shall have the honourable member's assistance. I believe there is a big majority in this House for the new protection. The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 6d. per lb., and many - honourable members sitting in the Opposition corner have stated that they are prepared to vote for the recommendations of that section. They will, therefore, have to vote for a duty of 6d. per lb. on this item. I trust that they will do so, because then we shall be able to regulate the conditions under which these directories are printed.",43
365,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"North Sydney) [8.23] - I should not have spoken on this question, but for the remarks of the honourable member for Yarra. They areI - do not say intentionally-ver y misleading. The honourable member said that as there was a duty of 6d. per lb. on advertising matter, there ought to be a similar duty on directories. But the bulk of the contents of a directory is not adverupon tising matter at all, ""and other printed books, even if written by an Australianother author and printed in London, are adket. mitted free. In this case exception is being taken to a particular work, and an attempt tunity of shutting it out. is being made to put it on a different footreason ing from that of all other printed books. In those circumstances, we ought to have very strong reasons before we agree to the proposal now before . us. The honourable [394]- 2 Customs [13 MAY , 1908.] Tariff Bill. 11079 member for Yarra's contention as to the wages paid in England might, from his point of view, be correct if there was no duty at all. But a duty of 4d., amounting to a considerable sum per volume, and multiplied by the very large number of volumes that have to be issued to pay for the cost of collection and of producing the work, represents so large a sum that, as the setting up has only to be done once, and the printing is all done by machinery, it would probably cover the whole cost of labour, even if the book were printed here. In those circumstances, seeing that the Government previously accepted a duty of 4d., and that an exception is .proposed to be made of this particular work, although it is a printed book, while, if there could be competition from foreign countries, that competition will be provented by a duty of 6d. per lb., we shall surely be doing quite sufficient if we fix a duty of 4d. against Great Britain. I hope the Committee will support the duty that was imposed when the item left this House.",43
366,Mr STORRER,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Bass) [8.25] - I hope that the Committee will endorse the action of the Senate. While other books are free, as the honourable member for North Sydney said, this particular work is composed very largely of advertisements which run right through it. The Tasmania 11 directory is sold at one guinea. Its weight is under 3 lbs., so that a duty of 6d. per lb. is only 7^ per cent, on the price of the book. That is one of the lowest duties we have passed. We shall, therefore, be perfectly justified in charging 6d. per lb. on the article, which can well be produced in Australia. If the proprietors cannot sell it for a guinea in Tasmania in the future, there. are plenty of people who will be quite willing to pay the extra is. 6d. out of their own pockets, so long as the printing is done in Australia.",43
367,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Wentworth) [8.27] - It is proposed to put a special disability, not one class of goods, but upon one par;ticular firm which competes with certain firms in the Australian directory marWe are asked to penalize one firm only, and to give its competitors an opporI can see no for this action on the part of the Minister, other than a desire to benefit certain Australian firms at the expense of that one. If those firms refuse to do the printing for this firm, it will be shut absolutely out of the Australian market. I wish honourable members to consider that fact before they vote for the higher duty now proposed.",43
368,Mr HEDGES,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Fremantle) [8.29] The question before the Committee should oe settled as we settled it before, with a preference of 2d. per lb. to Great Britain. The honourable member for Yarra argued the wrong way. He stated that the British workman is very poorly paid, but in voting for the same duty against Great Britain as against other countries, the honourable member will be offering the work on the same terms to the foreign workman, who is more poorly paid than the Britisher is.",44
369,Mr MATHEWS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"We are'willing tp make the general Tariff rate is. Mr HEDGES.'-We cannot do that now. If the honourable member is consist- Forrest, Sir John ent, and wants the highest-paid workmen in the world to do the work, he should vote for a preference to Great Britain, and not give the foreigner the same chalice as the Britisher. No one will contend that British workmen are not paid higher wages than are paid to workmen on the Continent. In this case, the suggestion of the. honourable member for Yarra is that we should ' offer a premium to people in Australia who require this work done to have it done . by the poorly-paid foreign workmen.",44
370,Mr COON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Batman) [8.31] - The honourable member for Fremantle has said that the honourable member for Yarra is pleading that this work should be done by foreign workmen, but, as a matter of fact, the honourable member for Yarra is pleading that ""it should be done by Australian workmen. 'There is no need to send this work abroad, - as it can be carried out here under reasonable conditions. There is no force in the suggestion of the honourable member for Fremantle that the honourable member for Yarra advocates that this printing should be done by foreign labour.",44

But We know that in a Tariff like this, unless we say specifically that a thing is to be free, it is almost sure to be treated later on as dutiable, under some item within which we did not intend it to - come. It is extraordinary, since the Minister has told us that he means printed matter n.e.i. to be free, that he should refuse to allow the word "" f r e e "" to be added to the item.",47

On asking a departmental officer for an explanation, he told me that the effect of adding the word "" f r e e "" would be to complicate the passing of entries. The wording suggested by the Senate legalizes the charging of duty up to the 9th December last, and makes it clear that from that date magazines must be ad- . mitted free.

Unless we wish to create confusion, we should provide, as we have done in every other case, that after - the date named the item shall be free. It is useless for the Minister or the officers of the Department to assert that the addition of the words I suggest would give rise to difficulty in the preparation of statistics, for they certainly would not prevent the printed matter referred to in the item from falling under item 371.",47
418,Mr WH IRVINE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Flinders) [9.14]- It is admitted by the Government whatever - form of words be adopted, this item will be free as from 10th December last. The Honorary - Minister states, ever, that the addition of words providing that as from that date it shall be frees would give rise to inconvenience, since should thus have two items, both being free, in respect of the one class of goods. The Government proposal will 'not obviate that result, since the adoption of the Senate's request would not have the effect including this item with item 371.",48
419,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,But it would.,48
420,Mr WH IRVINE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I think that I can show that, according to ordinary prinpreciate ciples of construction, it would not have that effect. Item 371 refers to all printed matter "" n . e . i . "" The letters ""n.e.i."" mean all printed matter not subject to any ' duty, but all printed matter not included any other item in the Customs Act. Item 356 will appear in the Customs Act in present form, and the mere fact that it free as from 10th December last will bring magazines, for instance, within item 37i",48
421,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,-It will leave under it all magazines less than one-fifth of consist of advertisements.,48
422,Mr WH IRVINE,ENGLISH MILITARY,The Minister gave away the whole point of his argument by referring to that very distincmember tion. The item with which we are now dealing covers only magazines the adverthe tisements in which comprise more than fifth of the printed matter within the covers.,48
423,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,The rest must go somewhere. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Q u it e so; and they go under item 371.,48
424,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Hear , hear.",48
425,Mr WH IRVINE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The honorary Minister agrees with me. I must remind him, however, that item 371 is confined, and always will be confined, as it stands, to magazines less than one-fifth of the printed matter of which consists of advertisements.",48
426,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,How can the honourable member say that when there is no limitation in item 37.1 ?,48
427,Mr WH IRVINE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The limitation is to be found in the letters "" n.e.i."" I therefore suggest that the Government is fighting for a shadow.",48
428,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Hume-Trea surer) [9.17]--No doubt the arguments that used by the honourable member come as readily to him as do others used by him in another place; but, to my mind, they carry howno weight. If the'honourable member's argument in regard to magazines is sound, it must be equally good in respect of we the "" printed matter n.e.i. (except newspapers registered for transmission through the post)"" covered by the item now under consideration.",48
429,Mr WH IRVINE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The answer is that of newspapers registered for transmission through the post, being an exception to item 356, at all times are necessarily included under item 371.",48
430,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I fail *o' apthe distinction which the honourable member would draw between the two items. Item 356 ancl item 371 are both free. This do not is not a matter on which I feel very strongly, but the officers of the Department in have carefully thought it out, and they consider that their proposal will prevent its trouble, not only to the Department, but is to importers, by obviating the necessity for not two sets of registrations. That being so, unless it can be shown that our object wil l nor, be carried out in this way, I think that it would not be fair to act contrary to which the desire of the Department. There is no danger whatever to be apprehended.",48
431,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Oh , yes.",48
432,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The honourable is very imaginative in regard to this matter. It would be very unwise of Committee to insert this amendment, onewhich is a double-barrelled one, aiid one which-would produce complications instead of leaving the position as plain to the i m porters and to the Department as it is at the present time.

Mr. JOSEPH ' COOK - Then I shall auote from the Hansard report- I shall speak from memory. Upon the occasion in question, the Treasurer pleaded that he inwanted to re-arrange the item of wood screws so as to make the administration honourable of the Department easy. What was the result? Under the first arrangement made these screws were dutiable under the general Tariff at 5 per cent., and were admitted free under the Tariff for the United But, notwithstanding a long debate which took place upon the itema debate similar to that which is taking place now-w e found that wood screws were subjected to a duty for fourteen days.

I did so, and I took the responsiI bility of my action, notwithstanding that it might not be in strict accordance with the law. I felt that I had made a promise to Committee which I was bound to respect. I shall advise my colleague-the the Minister of Trade and Customs-that not under the exceptional circumstances, and for in order to give effect to the promise the which I gave in this Chamber, the duty. collected upon the item during the fourteen days to which reference has beenmade, should be remitted.

I hope honourable members will support me in regard to the item now 'before the Committee, not for my sake, but ' in order to make the administration of the Tariff as simple as possible.",50
475,Mr WILS ON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Corangamite) [9.33] The last few words of the Treasurer show that he is getting into a better temper. ' inWithout wishing to be offensive in any way, may point out that the Treasurer may hot always be occupying his present position and, in time to come, the Act may be in my terpreted in the wav to which exception has teen taken. The easiest solution of the difficulty would be to accept the simple ,proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney. The explanations offered by the-. . Treasurer, and by the Honorary Minister^, only show more clearly the necessity for .an'explicit declaration in the Tariff. All - magazines which contain more than one-fifth of printed advertising matter may come under paragraph A of item 356, unless it is made perfectly clear that they - shall be duty free. Some years after the death of the Minister, or those who have the administration of the Act at present, the Minister and officers in power may take the view that the Lone Hand, which is so favoured by the present Government, is the only publication that should be read in Australia, and may place all sorts of difficulties in the wav of magazine importers.",50
476,Mr MALONEY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Melbourne) [9.36] - I hope the Treasurer willnot accept the proposal made by the Opposition. It would appear that the most unbelieving people on earth occupy the front Opposition benches and some seats in the Opposition corner. We haye heard one honourable member saying he would be glad to sign a certificate of death of the Minister, or something to that effect; and the honourable member for Parramatta reminds me very much of the baby in Pears' soap advertisement, who is made to declare that he "" will never be happy until he gets it . """,51
477,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,Will the honourable member kindly explain that joke?,51
478,Mr MALONEY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The baby in the advertisement will "" never be happy until he gets it , "" and so it is with the honourable member for Parramatta until he gets in his point against the Minister; but there is a difference, because the honourable member for Parramatta is never satisfied, seeing that five minutes later we find him again belabouring his political opponents. I am astonished that the - honourable member will not accept the assurance of the Treasurer, seeing that if it were not carried out the Hansard report of the discussion to-night could always be quoted. However, I can say of the honourable member for Parramatta, as he jocosely said a little while ago of some one else. "" . It ' s not what he says, but it's the nasty way he says it . "" I hope that the Minister will not mind when the deputy leader of the Opposition gets up and tries to tear him to pieces. It . is merely a joke on the honourable member's part. He does not mean it . The Senate, in its wisdom, has seen fit to make a suggestion which will make the meaning of Parliament plain. Surely we should accept that suggestion.",51
479,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Wentworth) [9.4.1] - I should not have risen except for the slur which my honourable friend the honourable member for Melbourne has cast upon the Minister. The honourable member seems to have taken some remarks made by the honourable member for Parramaita as reflecting upon the Treasurer's integrity. I do not know whether the honourable member has personal reasons for taking a lower view of the honourable gentleman's integrity than I have. But I do not think that the honourable member for Parramatta had any fear or expressed any fear that the Minister would break his word. Two interpretations might be placed upon the remarks of the deputy leader of the ""Opposition. The first was that the Minister could not be trusted to carry out his promise. The honourable member did not mean that. The second was that the Minister didnot understand the Tariff, and consequently might' be placed in a false position. The honourable .member for Parramatta did not mean that the Treasurer would break a promise that he had given, but that he did not understand the Tariff sufficiently to be able to carry out his promise faithfully . If the honourable member for Melbourne doubts whether the Minister would give effect to a promise made by him, I regret that he should entertain such a view.",51
480,Sir JOHN QUICK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Bendigo) [9.44]-It is to be regretted that so much time should be taken up in regard to the matter. If we cannot trust the Minister on a mere question of phraseology, the intention of which is to give effect to the intentions of Parliament, we have arrived at an extraordinary state of things. I believe that the suggestion for an amendment that has been made originated with the heads of the Department. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - It did.",51
481,Sir JOHN QUICK,ENGLISH MILITARY,The suggestion was probably submitted to the Senate at the instigation of the Department purely for the purpose of having the Tariff passed in a more perfect form. I do not agree with those honourable members who think that there is some deep underlying design.,51
482,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,No one suggested that.,51
483,Sir JOHN QUICK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I believe that on and after 9th December, 1907, printed matter, including magazines, is under the Tariff absolutely free of duty. It is inevitable, on the face of the Tariff, that such should be the case. On and after that date there is no duty in existence, either in substance or in form; and, as pointed out by the Treasurer, the only other part of the Tariff under - which magazines could possibly be affected is item 371, which deals with books n.e.i., prospectuses, and other printed matter. Automatically, with the exhaustion of this special paragraph relating to magazines, such printed matter will f all within the n.e.i. provision of paragraph 371. We ought to accept the Treasurer's assurance that magazines will be free. There is BO power under the Tariff to impose a duty upon them on and after the 10th December, 1907.",51
484,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,The power is in the Customs Act.,52
485,Sir JOHN QUICK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"-There is no power in the Customs Act to impose such a duty. We ought, to accept the Minister's assurance relative to what is merely a question of"" drafting. We might spend our time much more profitably than by discussing such a point.",52

487,The CHAIRMAN,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I must ask ""the honourable member not to enter into a discussion of the matter to which he refers.",52
488,Mr KNOX,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The honourable member said that there has been a good deal of ""cussedness"" in this debate. But surely it was the Minister himself who introduced that element. Had he made the statement - that there was a departmental difficulty which led to the alteration of wording now under consideration, time might have been saved.",52
489,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,I did say so.,52
490,Mr KNOX,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I felt that the' Minister was taking up an obstructive position, for which there was no justification. I understand that the officers of the Department, under the guidance of their chief, suggested the alteration in order that there might be no misconception or misconstruction.

This paragraph is not amended in the same way as the one with which we have just dealt. There is an error in connection with it, and that is why I want to send it back for another place to deal with, it. They have left the word "" free "" in the United Kingdom column. I want all these matters to be in unison. That is the only reason I have for disagreeing with the amendment. I move That the requested amendment be not made.",53
497,Mr WILKS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Dalley) [9.58] - I understand that the Minister disagrees with the amendment on account of its structural formation only. Apparently he wishes to leave the paragraph free. Sir WILLIAM LYNE,-That is intended.",53
498,Mr WILKS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"As'the schedule left this Chamber the paragraph was free. I voted for making it free, but I take this opportunity to refresh the memory of the Com. mittee with regard to questions asked lately about certain newspapers getting their paper free. When the item was before the Committee previously, printing paper, as generally used by newspapers throughout Australia, was made free, but apparently, another class of paper used by other newspapers was left dutiable. newspapers made an application to the Customs Department, and an interpretation was given of the Tariff making that class of paper also free. I do not blame the newspaper or newspapers for taking that action. If the daily press can get its printing paper free, why should not the weekly press do so ? But, as so many protectionist papers, both daily and weekly, members of Parliament of speaking not with their tongues in their cheek, I wish to ad point out that they also write their and .editorials with their tongues in the cheek. While they advocate protection for the cent.; whole of the masses upon everything that .they use and consume, these protectionist per organs themselves never put up a cry for a. 1907."" . duty on the paper that they use.",53
499,Mr CROUCH,ENGLISH MILITARY,They put up the umbrella.,53
500,Mr WILKS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I have not found a singleprotectionist, even the honourable member for Corio, putting in a word on behalf of the printing mills of Australia, or urging that the newspapers should use Australian made paper.",53
501,Mr CROUCH,ENGLISH MILITARY,Every time a duty on paper has been brought forward I have voted for it.,53
502,Mr WILKS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Then I trust that the honourable member will rise to disagree with the Minister's motion, and fight to make this paper dutiable. I rose speciallv to direct attention to the fact that the proprietors of newspapers in which honourable members are referred to as speaking with their tongues in their cheeks might very well be referred to in the same way. The honourable member for Wentworth has been very active during the last few days in directing attention to a glaring case of the kind, snowing that the proprietors of such an ultra-protectionist .newspaper as the Sydney Bulletin have been to the Minister to ask hirn to get the Customs officials to interpret the Tariff in such a way as to enable them to get the printing paper they require admitted free of duty. I do not blame them for desiring to be put on the same footing as the Melbourne Age, the-' Sydney Morning Herald, the War Cry, Truth, Tocsin, and other newspapers that could be mentioned. There is no reason why they should not all be in it, but it does seem, strange that ithose interested in the newspaper referred to, who claim to be so ultra-Australian as to be' justified in ridiculing the Britisher, should at the same time claim to be allowed to have British printing paper admitted free Those other of duty. ' It is just as well that the public should be informed that the proprietors of this newspaper, that is so strongly antiBritish in its policy, should desire to use. not Australian printing paper, and pay a little more for it, but British printing paper, and have it placed on the free list. So we find in connection with every applicaever tion of the protectionist principle that are prepared to make a good bargain if for some comment. they can, even at the sacrifice of that ciple. I shall vote for the free admisand sion of this paper, because I think that the interests of persons connected with the country press should be considered as well as those of the proprietors of the daily newspapers published in the cities. The writers for the Bulletin clo not spare public men in their criticisms. They are consistent in charging others with inconsistency, and I now charge them with being inconafter sistent protectionists.",53

505,Mr JOHNSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The usual protecsuggested ? tionist answer to such a question is that if we cannot make it in Australia now then we ought to do so. When honourable memis hers on this side oppose an attempt to make dutiable some article which cannot be made here, they are met by protectionists with the crv that it ought to be made here, that a duty should be imposed to encourage its manufacture here. Why is not some protectionist voice raised on behalf of the Australian paper-manuf aoturing industry ? item Everv protectionist newspaper clamours for the exclusion of British goods, intended, and against the use of anything that is not Australian, desires that this printing paper should be admitted free. They are freedepartmental reason. traders in regard to the material which they use in their own industry, and tectionists in regard to everything else. weeklv newspaper referred to by the honorder orable member for Dalley has rent the heavens with its raucous cries for protection, and in advocacy of having and using everything made in Australia; partment vet it insists upon having the imported printing paper required for its production admitted duty free. I should like to know where is the consistency of honourable memTariff, bers or of newspapers that advocate certain principles only so long as it is the other fellow who has to pay? As soon as the policv touches their own pockets, they are free-traders every time. Did it not involve a sacrifice of principle, it would be poetic iustice if free-traders were to round in this case and insist upon the imthis position of the highest duties upon this item. I must vote for its being free lie consistent in my fiscal principles, whatkind? protectionists may be, but their action men in connection with this item certainly calls It fills me with dispringust when I find protectionist members newspapers howling for the assertion of a. principle, which, when it touches their own pockets, they are prepared to deny.

509,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,The last stateproment is made for my information. The The requested amendment is proposed only in to make the wording of the item acvery cord with the practice of the trade.,54
510,Mr JOHNSO N,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Lang) [10.8] - It would seem that the officers of the Deare such rabid protectionists that they wish to take the business of Parliament out of the hands of honourable members. Apparently they desire to frame the and to say what the fiscal policy of the country shall be. They even go so far as to instruct the Minister in connection with the wording of these items. They clo not endeavour to interpret the desire of Parliament, but to enforce upon only Parliament their"" own views as to what turn ought to be done. It is quite time that sort of thing should be resisted. What right have the officers of the Customs Deto partment to assume an attitude of that",54
511,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,They do not asbeen sume any such attitude. I give the statetained ment I have quoted as mine.,55
512,Mr JOHNSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"It is their duty,, possible, to give effect to what Parliament desires, and not to force their own views upon Parliament. It is very improper tp enbeen courage them in this kind of thing, and their action ought to be resented..",55
513,Sir JOHN QUICK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Bendigo) [10.9] The alteration of the wording of this item is suggested in order to make the item read in harmony with item 357. Item 357 twice includes "" stationery packets,"" and they are made dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent. If the officers of the Department have gested the alteration of the wording of amendment they are justified in doing so in order to make the Tariff clear. have already adopted the words packets "" in item 357, and the words of exclusion "" and not in stationery packets suggested by the Senate as an amendment of this item are intended to remove any ambiguity, and to prevent a claim being made that cut writing paper made up stationery packets should be introduced at 15 per cent, under item 356 instead 30 and 25 per cent, under item 357.

Sir WILLIAM. LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [10.12] - I have a note to accept request, but, as honourable members know, on several occasions. great objection offered to the principle which is conin the proposed new paragraph, and I do not want to create a long debate. If if - the Committee are not prepared to adopt the principle in respect of any item-and I cannot understand the objection which has raised to its adoption, because it gives an intimation to those who invest their money that duties will be levied under stringent conditions",55
514,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,We have decided against the adoption of the principle,55
515,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,"- I think that the Minister might view very favourably the rejection of sugthe request to omit cardboard and pastethe board from paragraph M , as that would give him duties of 20 and 15 per cent, inWe stead of 5 per cent, and free if brought "" stationery under paragraph N.",55
516,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"In view of "" what took place"" in connection with other items, I do not want to Create a debate on the principle in connection with this item : but I should like to take a division in order into ascertain what the Committee desire.",55
517,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,We ought to deterof at mine the rates of duty first.,55
518,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,No objection has been offered by the Senate to the rates attached to paragraph M.,55
519,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,"It has requested the omission of the words ""cardboard."" and ""pasteboard.""",55

521,Mr TUDOR,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Yarra) [10.15] - On u (United previous occasion we tried to secure the omission of cardboard and pasteboard Pastefrom this paragraph. It was one of - the few occasions on .which I have disagreed to be with the Minister, but the Ministry won' subbv a vote. The Senate has requested the transfer of the words to paragraph N, so Cardthat the duties on cardboard and"" pasteboard be 5 per cent, and free. I do not in the think that any person has brought forward such any proof that the articles are being made of a here at the present time, or are likely to be made here in the near future. The Senate such was willing to meet the difficulty by requestval. ing the insertion of a paragraph providing Kingfor duties of 20 and 15 per cent, to be levied by proclamation at the instance of Parliament. Hitherto the Committee has dethis clined-to accede to a request of that kind. With that I find no fault; but if a divihas sion is called for, I shall certainly vote to .transfer cardboard and pasteboard from paragraph M to paragraph N . I feel satistied that if there had been any attempt to manufacture the articles here the Senate would not have sent down this request concerning the issue of ,a proclamation. shall not vote to impose a duty which will only be a revenue one if there is no intention to establish an industry. I do not be-' lieve that there is any such intention, and, therefore, I think that the Minister would, be wise tq agree to the transfer I have suggested.",55
522,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Kume-Trea surer) [10.17] - I a m is some doubt as to whether cardboard and pasteboard are made here. Under those circumstances, and in order to avoid a long debate and to get on with the Tariff, I propose to ask the Committee not to agree to the Senate's request in that regard. Motion, by leave, withdrawn. Motion (by Sir ' WILLIAM LYNE) agreed toThat the requested amendment in paragraph M he made.",56
523,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.18] - In view of what has taken place on previous requests of this kindalthough what I am saving now will not prevent me from dealing with one case, and trying to get the Committee to agree to the principle- I feel, that unless I give way in this instance there will be a long debate. I move That the requested amendment inserting new paragraph MM be not made.",56
524,Mr WILKS,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Dalley) [10.19] - I am - very pleased that the Treasurer has asked - the Committee to disagree with the Senate on this occasion, in consequence of someit "".thing which has taken place here, but intimated that probably, on another item, he would ask us to consent to the imposihaving tion of duties by proclamation. that he was alluding to the timber duties. I believe that I have touched the spot, sir. of such cases. Now that I am on it; I wish to point out that the Treasurer is proposing to surrender on a small item, and to make a fight one more important. It has been proposed in connection with four or five items that duties should come into operation on lamation. But we refused, on the honorspecific, able gentleman's own motion, to sanction this in regard to locks, and, later, voted against it in.regard to lubricants, the cussion on both occasions showing that honin orable members were opposed to the arI rangement. If the Treasurer wishes to obtain a contrary decision from the Committee in regard to timber, there will be a fight about it .",56
525,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Hume-Trea [ surer) [10.22] - I felt bound to refer to the matter, so that I might be free to have the question fought out in regard to some other item, should I feel so disposed. I did not wish to be bound to oppose a provision of this kind on every occasion, merely because I took exception to it under certain circumstances. I have reserved my right to deal as I think fit in regard to informed that there similar proposals elsewhere. Motion agreed to Requested amendment not made.

"" Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) pro. posedThat the requested amendment be made. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [1.0.28] I take this opportunity to draw attention to the request of a constituent to whom seems to me redress should be given. The he case is similar to one referred to by the .honourable member fox Parramatta, dutiesbeen levied contrary to the intenI suppose tion of Parliament.",56
526,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,There is a number,56
527,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"In a letter which I have received he puts the case briefly, staton ing that where an a i valorem duty has been levied on the contents of a bottle, duty is also charged on the bottle itself, but procthat where the duty on the contents is no charge has been made on the bottle. The intention of Parliament has now been put beyond doubt by the making disof an amendment .renuested by the Senate regard to the duty on bottles: But what wish to draw attention to is the fact that certain persons have been compelled to pay duty coritrary to the intention of Parliament, and, as a matter of bare justice, should have it refunded.",56
528,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.30] - The refunding of the duty is a difficult matter to arrarfge for. In regard to screws the difficulty was not very great, because the importations involved were small, and the original importer is probably known. Trouble invariably arises in attempting to make refunds of duty in respect of imports that have been distributed.",57
529,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"But ' the position is different where goods remain in the ""Hands of the original importers.",57
530,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"In such cases I shall have no objection to a refund, but I have to' test the feeling of the Committee as to refunds being made in such circumstances. The question! was tested when the first Federal Tariff was under consideration, and whilst I have always been in favour of a refund where the goods are held by the original importers-wher e the goods can be traced-the decision of the House on that occasion was that no refund should be made.",57
531,Colonel FOXTON,ENGLISH MILITARY,That was where a duty had been altered.,57
532,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"All I can saxis that the practice of making refunds has not been adopted, but that I intend to try to induce the Collector of Customs to make refunds in respect of the duty paid on screws, which existed for only fourteen days. I shall take the trouble to ascertain what was the intention so far as this item is concerned, and whilst I cannot make any promise, I assure the honourable member for Brisbane that I regard the matter favourably, and shall see what can be done.",57
533,Mr ARCHER,ENGLISH MILITARY,Capricornia) [10.32] - I wish to ask' the Treasurer whether there is any special reason why the limitation of 1 cwt. should be imposed. Many newspaper proprietors - import their ink in smaller quantities.,57
534,Mr HUME COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,-The limitation was recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff' Commission.,57
535,Mr ARCHER,ENGLISH MILITARY,"It will operate in favour of those who import large quantities. Why make this differentiation between large and small newspaper proprietoisr""",57
536,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I am informed that, as a rule, this class of ink is imported in packages containing not less than 1 cwt.",57
537,Mr ARCHER,ENGLISH MILITARY,Then there is no reason to insert the limitation. I do. not think that we ought to differentiate between the two classes of importers.,57
538,Mr CARR,ENGLISH MILITARY,"(Macquarie) [10.35] - This is a very necessary differentiation. If it were not made, all inks would come, under item 358, and be dutiable at a much higher rate. News ink is sold at from 3d. to 6d. per lb. It is a cheap ink, and ' if it were not specialized in this item it would be dutiable at the higher rate imposed in respect of jobbing ink's of much better quality.",57
539,Mr ARCHER,ENGLISH MILITARY,I specially asked why the limitation as to packages of 1 cwt. should be imposed.,57
540,Mr CARR,ENGLISH MILITARY,"It should be imposed because news printing ink is not imported in smaller quantities. I have been engaged in the printing industry for some years, and have no hesitation in saying that no printer would think of buying less than 1 cwt. of news ink. Without this limitation, there would be a danger of the better classes of ink, which are always put up in smaller packages, evading the. higher duty imposed to protect the local manufacturers.",57
541,Mr REID,ENGLISH MILITARY,Highe r duties have to be paid in respect of job printing inks:,57
542,Mr CARR,ENGLISH MILITARY,"If they are imported; but there is no need to import them, since we have many local manufacturers of printers' inks. Whilst news printing ink is sold at 6d. per lb., as much as ios. per lb. is charged for the best job printing inks. It is difficult even for an expert to differentiate between good and inferior ink, unless he has an opportunity to test them on a machine, That being so, unless we insert this limitation we shall not be able to effectively regulate the duties. Local competition is sufficient to keep the prices fairlv even, and I hope that the request will be agreed to.",57
543,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Wentworth) [10.38] -^ From the remarks made by - the honourable member for_ Macquarie, it is clear in the first place that news printing ink imported for the use of the great' dailies is usually priced at 6d. per lb.",57
544,Mr TUDOR,ENGLISH MILITARY,At about 3d. or 4d. per lb.,57
545,Mr CARR,ENGLISH MILITARY,The price runs as low as 3d. or 4d.,57
546,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Then 6d. per lb. is a. liberal estimate - If we accept this reque.it, we shall allow the big daily newspaper proprietors, who' never import package's containing less than i cwt., an advantage of more than ioo per cent, over owners of small newspapers.",57
547,Mr CARR,ENGLISH MILITARY,Eve n small newspaper proprietors do not import news printing ink in packages of less than i cwt.,58
548,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"It seems to me that this limitation should not be imposed. newspaper proprietors who desire to import ink in smaller quantities will - if the Treasurer's proposal be carried-hav e to pay more than ioo per cent, upon it , while the great metropolitan organs will get their ink at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent.",58
549,Mr ARCHER,ENGLISH MILITARY,"And the Bulletin, of course.",58
550,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Yes . We must not leave the Bulletin out of consideration , when we are dealing with the present Government.",58
551,Mr CARR,ENGLISH MILITARY,Loca l manufacturers will supply the smaller newspapers with ink.,58
552,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The small man is to be supplied with the local article, while the big newspaper proprietors are to be encouraged to import their inks ?",58
553,Mr CARR,ENGLISH MILITARY,There is absolutely no reason in the honourable member's statement.,58
554,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,The Government ought not to press this proposal. - It is clear Mr..CARR - Clea r as ink.,58
555,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"When the honourable member brings his colossal intellect to bear upon me all at once, it strikes me dumb. On what ground does the Treasurer propose . to confer this enormous advantage upon the great daily newspapers of Australia? During the' past few weeks, we have learned what tremendous advantages have been granted by Ministerial ukasebehind the back of Parliament-to certain daily and weekly newspapers. Here is a proposal to favour those journals, for which they ask the authority of Parliament. While I commend them for their straightforwardness upon this occasion, I hope that the Committee will oppose the proposal of the. Treasurer, even though the honourable member for Macquarie says that he knows all about all the newspapers of Australia.",58
556,Mr CARR,ENGLISH MILITARY,I did not say that.,58
557,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I was uncler the impression that the honourable member stated that he knew all about them, and that, therefore, we ought to pardon him for speaking as the one authority upon this subject.",58
558,Mr CARR,ENGLISH MILITARY,That was a misconception on the part of the honourable member.,58
559,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"I confess that I find considerable difficulty in understanding all that passes through the honourable member's mind. In that, however, I do'not think that I stand alone. I hope that the Treasurer will be able to adduce some reason for his action. ' It will not be palatable for the small newspapers of Australia to learn that he proposes to penalize them to Those the extent of more than 100 per cent, upon their inks whilst he allows the Age, Argus, Sydney Morning Herald, and the Bulletin to obtain their inks at 25 per cent.",58
560,Mr SPENCE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Darling) [10.45] - The honourable member for Wentworth entertains the extraordinary idea, that country newspaper proprietors desire to import their inks. Why they should wish to do so-seein g that they can obtain the bestquality of ink locally- I do not know.",58
561,Mr KELLY,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Will the Worker importits, ink in less quantities than 1 cwt. ?",58
562,Mr SPENCE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"The Worker is an Australian journal which supports Australian industry. It patronizes Australian ink, which is equal to any ink that, can be obtained in the world. The big daily newspapers can also purchase their supplies clink locally if they wish to do. so. This is a protectionist Parliament, ancl, as such, does not specially study thp interests cf the importers. The manufacturers of ink who have' supplied the local market very largely",58
563,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Excep t in the matter of percussive rock drills. _ Mr SPENCE - As this is a protectionist Parliament, we desire to grant protection all round. The object of inserting in this item a condition as to quantity is to differentiate between newspaper ink and ink which is used for job printing. I . think that the alteration in the wording of the item requested by the Senate constitutes an improvement, ancl one which will render the administration of the Customs Department easier.",58
564,Mr SAMPSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Wimmera) [10.47] - I clo not think - any danger need be apprehended as to the small newspapers if we accede to the request of the Senate. There was such a danger uncler the Tariff in its original form, but that was overcome at the instance of the honourable member for Capricornia. The object of the Senate in requesting an amendment of the item is to prevent the more expensive ink being imported under the lower duty. As a matter of fact, nearly all the news ink imported is imported in quantities over 1 cwt. It is made up in the Commonwealth into smaller parcels.",58
565,Mr TUDOR,ENGLISH MILITARY,Does the honourable member think that the request of the Senate constitutes an improvement ?,59
566,Mr SAMPSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Yes . I rose merely to explain that under the old Tariff there was a danger, but that under the new Tariff,- with the suggested amendments of the Senate, the matter is made clear, and jobbing inks of the more expensive kind are prevented from coming in under the lower duty imposed on news inks. Motion agreed - to. Requested amendment made.",59
567,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ENGLISH MILITARY,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.50] - I do not desire to suggest an adjournment, though I am tired; but we have now arrived at a stage when two or three-items which have been postponed ought to be taken into consideration and dealt with, one in relation to the other. If we go any further to-night, I shall not be able, I am afraid, to deal with those items, as they should be dealt with, in one day.",59
568,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ENGLISH MILITARY,"North Svdney) [10.51] - I see that in the items which follow, in relation to pencils, pens, and so forth, the duties run 5 per cent, and free, 25 per cent, and 30 per cent.,, and so forth, and I suggest that there seems no reason for these slight differences in the higher and lower grades, which can only make the administration more diffi-' cult. It would be much more simple if one or other duty were adopted. - Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.52 p.m.",59
