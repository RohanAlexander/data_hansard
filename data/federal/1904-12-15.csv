1,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"It is stated in this morning's Argus that the Peninsular and Oriental Company contemplate dropping their Australian mail contracts, and that the Orient Company's vessels are in future not to make Largs Bay a place of call. Seeing that the misapplication of the White Australia policy in connection' with the administration of the Postal Department will involve an exceptional burden on South Australia, because, instead of being a day in advance, that State will be, if this arrangement is carried into effect, a day behind Melbourne in communications with England, while the expense to which she has gone in providing an outer harbour at Largs Bay will be useless, will the Government consider the advisability of either repealing the section of the Post and Telegraph Act, which is responsible for this extra expense, or providing that all the States shall share equally the additional cost of applying it?",12
2,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Thef t is a good deal of correspondence in the Department from Mr Anderson, of the OrientCompany, in reference to the White Australia provision in the Post and Telegraph Act.",12
3,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,The White Ocean provision.,12
4,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Yes . Mr. Anderson states that that provision has not caused the company to increase the price named in its tenders, because if lascars were employed on their boats, although their wages would be smaller than those of white men, twice as many men would have to be employed, and twice as much accommodation would have to be allotted to them.",12
5,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Did he say anything about their reliability?,12
6,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I believe that he did, though I do not think that he dwelt at length on that subject. The Government, having taken the whole matter into consideration, are of opinion that they would not be justified in paying the large sum asked by the Orient Company for the performance of the service. Since 1888 the two companies named have been receiving ^72,000 a year, and we are now asked to pay j£i 50,000 a year, although the export trade of Australia in perishable produce and general goods has increased 10.30 largely.",12
7,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Is it a fact that English letters could be delivered inMelbourne more quickly if the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient companies, instead of landing .their mails at Largs Bay, to be forwarded by train from Adelaide, brought them here direct?",12
8,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The honourable member is thinking only of the convenience of Melbourne.,12
9,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I am thinking of the convenience of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. I admit that such an arrangement would delay the delivery of English mails in Adelaide.",12
10,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I shall be only too glad to make what arrangements I can to enable the vessels to continue to call at Largs Bay. In answer to the honourable member's question. I do not think there would be much difference.,12
11,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"In view of the fact that the Post and Telegraph Act does not touch the substance of the White Australia principle, and is being used merely as a pretext for forcing unfair charges on the Commonwealth, will the Postmaster General see that, by repealing the provision, that pretext is removed?",13
12,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,The matter is one for the Government to determine; but I do not think that any action of that kind will be taken at the present time. PUBLIC SERVANTS' INCREMENT S. meeting,13
13,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"The Prime Minister stated the other night that authority had been given for the payment of increments accruing to public servants in receipt of less than £ 1 6 0 per annum. Is the Postmaster-General aware that a considerable number of officers in the general division in his Department have not yet been paid their increments? Will he endeavour to expedite the payments, so that they may receive their money before the end of the present month ?",13
14,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The matter was brought under my notice during the consideration of the Estimates, and I gave instructions that expedition should^ be used in the payment of these increments. understand that a large number of officers in New South Wales have been paid, and I hope that those who have not yet received their increments will obtain them before the end of the year. The Department will do all it can to expedite the matter.",13
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I would point out to the Postmaster-General that the complaint which I have repeatedly made concerning the non-payment of officers in the rlerical division has not yet been rectified, although the amounts should have been paid six months ago. Will the Postmaster General promise- I know that, if he does, we can rely upon the promise being f u l filled-that the matter shall be rectified?",13
16,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I cannot make any definite promise, because certain inquiries have to be made. The Public Service Act requires certificates from the Public Service Commissioner in these cases. I know, however, that that officer is as anxious as are honourable members that the men shall be paid before the end of the year. I shall send another reminder to him, and will do all I can to expedite the payments. APPOINTMENT OF OFFICERS .",13
17,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"In view v-f the fact that the Postmaster-General's Department has just appointed a detective to the Sydney Post Office from outside the service, and that in several other instances officers of the lower ranks have been debarred from promotion by similar appointments, does he propose to take the same course when permanently filling the position of Deputy Postmaster-General and other higher offices?",13
18,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"For some considerable time the Postal Department has employed a detective, with a view to some of the difficulties which present themselves in connection with the management of our various offices; but men will not be appointed from outside the service unless there are no suitable .officers available within the service.",13
19,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"Can the Postmaster General inform the House when the position of Deputy Postmaster-General at Sydney, and various inspectorships which are now occupied by temporary officers, will be permanently filled?",13
20,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"If the honourable member would give, notice of his question, there would be ample time for me to frame a reply before our next meeting; I but in view of the courteous way in which he asks these questions, I have no hesitation in replying that the question of filling permanently the position of Deputy Postmaster-General in Sydney will be dealt with by the Public Service Commissioner as soon as possible. It was decided by the Attorney-General that it is a matter for Parliament, and not for the Public Service Commissioner, to fix the salaries of the Deputy Postmasters-General, and, therefore, this matter has been deferred until Parliament could deal with the Estimates. Now that the ApDropriation Bill has been passed, there will be no further delav. BOTTLING OF BULK SPIRITS.",13
21,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if the Government have taken into consideration the suggestion which"" I made some time ago, that all imported bulk spirits should be bottled in bond, and the fact certified to on their labels, so as to protect the revenue, and prevent cheap and adulterated spirits from being sold as imported case whisky.",13
22,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"My honourable friend mentioned the matter to ' me, but I have not yet had an opportunity to deal with it; ENGLISHMAIL CONTRACT.",13
23,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I desire to ask the master-General a question with reference the oversea mail contract. The must be aware that grave anxiety prevails House before the session closed. throughout mercantile circles upon this question, and I would ask him to give us an assurance that he will keep the public advised as to the steps he is taking to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion. matter is one of very serious consequence to the whole community?",14
24,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I think that my honourable friend agrees with the view which the Government take as to the sive amount of the subsidy asked for by Orient Steamship Company. He has alwas ready communicated with the Department officially to that effect, and therefore oughly realizes the difficult position in we are placed. This matter has receiving the attention of the Government for some considerable time.past, and I have already convened a conference of the puty Postmasters-General, which will meet today with a view to looking into the quesAttorney - General, the honourable tion, and seeing how Ave can best overlearned come the difficulty that has arisen through no fault of our own, but owing to the large amount asked for by the only tenderer for the mail service.",14
25,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I would ask the Prime Minister Avhether, in view of the attempt now being made by the and Oriental and Orient Steam NavigaThat tion Companies to coerce the Comsiderable monwealth into the payment of heavy mall subsidies, he will consider the advisability of appointing a Roval Commission, quite outside of Parliament, to inquire as to advisabilitv of the CommonAvealth Governwas ment acquiring a fleet of steamers for purpose of carrying on their own mail vices ?",14
26,Mr REID,Unknown,"I shall refer the matter my honourable colleague, the Postmastercrease General. FOREI GN TENDERERS : EXEMPTION FROM DUTY .",14
27,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"As long ago as 8th NoA'emiber last, I asked the PostmasterWhilst General :Is he yet in a position to inform this whether it is correct, as stated by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Robinson), that cessful tenderers not resident in Australia have not to pay Customs duties on goods used in carrying out their contracts, while duty is paid goods used in a like manner by Australian cessful tenderers for Commonwealth contracts? I have repeated this question again and Postagain, and upon the last occasion the to Postmaster-General said that he Would Minister lay the papers on the table of the We have now reached the last day of the session, and as the matter is of some importance, and special attention has been directed to it by the Auditor-General, I think The that honourable members should be furnished with information regarding it to-dav.",14
28,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I had practically prepared a reply to lay upon the table today, but it has not yet come to exceshand. I may inform the honourable memthe ber that ns long ago as 1902 a question raised whether duty should be paid upon goods imported by contractors for use thorby the Commonwealth Department. Under which the Customs Tariff Act goods imported by been and for the use of the Government of the Commonwealth are exempted from duty, and the question Avhether this provision apDeplied to goods imported by contractors to the Government Avas referred to the then and member for Ballarat. He expressed the opinion that it did not apply to the very cases of goods imported by contractors; but it appears that the right honourable member for Adelaide, when occupying the position of Minister of Customs, arranged that under the special circumstances the Peninsular duty should, not be paid by the contractors. practice was adhered to for some contime. Then the question arose in connection with supplies imported for the Postal Department, and in January last instructions were issued that the duty should the be charged to the contractors. The matter re-opened, I think, in August last by the the Customs Department, and it was reserferred to the late Prime Minister, who wrote a minute stating that in A'iew of the to fact that the payment of duties Would in the cost of the goods to the Department, the duty should not be charged, but should be debited to the Department.",14
29,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I refused to alter the existing practice.,14
30,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Exactly. I realized that the addition of the duty would increase the expense to the DeHouse partment, I was anxious to follow a strictly legal course, and I referred the whole matsucter for the opinion of the present Attorney General, Avho confirmed the view taken by on the the honourable and learned member for Balsuclarat, that it would be illegal to allow goods imported by contractors to the Government to escape the payment of duty. The Government accepted that decision, and they intend to insist upon the law being carried out. NA DEPARTMENT.",14
31,Mr WATSON,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,"I desire to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether he can inform the House as to the arrangements that are contemplated in connection with the Electoral Department. I understand that it was agreed some time ago that the Chief Electoral Officer should retire at the end of this year, and I should like to know if that arrangement is to be carried out, and, generally, whether anv alteration is to be made?",15
32,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,"It has been pressed upon me that the reorganization of .the Department is highly necessary, and that an opportunity in that direction will be afforded by the contemplated retirement of the Chief Electoral Officer, not at the end of this year, because I find that the agreement under which he occupies the position practically gives him a tenure to the end of May next, but at the expiry of that period. In the meantime, my attention will be directed to the reorganization of the Department, and the adoption of the best system of conducting it in the future. BANKIN G AND INSURANC E LAWS .",15
33,Mr BRUCE SMITH,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether the attention of the Government has yet been directed to the very important question of the assimilation of the laws relating to banking and insurance in the various States. Soon after the establishment of the Commonwealth it was pointed out by persons interested in insurance business, that the communitv were labouring under great disabilities in connection with the assignment of policies, because of the great differences existing between the liaws affecting insurance in the various States. I understand that something was done by the last Government towards collecting data, with a view to assimilating the measures now in existence, upon banking and insurance. should like to know whether the Prime Minister intends, during the recess, to collect material from the best .authorities, with a view to effecting that assimilation.",15
34,Mr REID,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,"The Treasurer has had these imoortant matters-certainl y that of the banking laws-unde r his consideration for some time past. I quite agree with the honourable and learned imember that it is of the greatest importance that we should, as soon as possible, assimilate the laws in operation in the different States by means of Commonwealth legislation. I think that it is a matter of very practical importance. I confess that lately I had overlooked it, and I am glad that the honourable anfl learned member has again brought it under the attention of the Government.",15
35,Mr BRUCE SMITH,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,"Will the Minister, during recess, take steps to collect the necessary material ?",15
36,Mr REID,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,Certainly .,15
37,Mr BRUCE SMITH,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,"Following up my first question, I desire to ask whether, in view of the very great importance and far-reaching consequences of legislation upon those two important branches of commerce, insurance and banking, the Prime Minister will consider the advisability of appointing a Royal Commission, consisting of persons quite outside Parliament, and interested directly in the businesses referred to, to take evidence upon the subject with a view to affording a guide in the drafting of the necessary measures.",15
38,Mr REID,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,I really feel that we must endeavour to adopt some other means of dealing with the matter.,15
39,Mr BRUCE SMITH,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,I do not know how the Government will otherwise beable to obtain the necessary information.,15
40,Mr REID,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,I think it is highly probable that the great institutions interested in these matters will be only too ready to afford us the fullest information.,15
41,Mr BRUCE SMITH,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,It will be necessary to consult the general public too.,15
42,Mr REID,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,"I shall meet the wishes of the honourable and learned member in every way I can, but I think we shall have to put a stop to the appointment of Royal Commissions. A very expensive Commission-the Tariff Commission-wil l shortly begin its work.",15
43,Mr BRUCE SMITH,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,It would not be necessary to pay the members of the Commission referred to.,15
44,Mr REID,REORGANIZATION OF ELECTOR AL,"Somehow , these. CommisI sions cost money, and I am afraid I cannot hold out any hope that a Royal Commission will be appointed to consider the matters referred to. NA ACT : PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS.",15
45,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In view of the prospect of our entering upon a long recess, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will cause to be sent to members the reports furnished by the officers administering the Immigration Restriction Act, with reference to the number of coloured aliens admitted into the Commonwealth either as residents or merely as tourists? understand that the returns required under the Act will be laid upon the table when Parliament meets, but as they are really due in January next, I would ask that they should be forwarded to honourable members as soon as possible after they are received by the Department. '",15
46,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I shall certainly be glad to comply with the request. I think that might take advantage of this opportunity to ask honourable members informally for an expression of opinion upon the subject of the publication of papers. able members know, there is a Parliamentary tradition that documents that are to be laid upon the table shall not be published until they have been placed before Parliament.",16
47,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,They always are.,16
48,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I think that the Government will pursue a course which will meet with the approval of honourable members if , during the recess, they make public any reports of special interest and importance which, in the ordinary course, would be laid upon the table before publication. I may add that, even during the recess, Ministers will answer questions without notice, if honourable members will address communications to them upon matters in which they are interested, just as faithfull y as they were on the gridiron every day. PRIVATE MEMBERS ' BUSINESS.",16
49,Mr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In view of the number of important motions-man y of which have been very fully discussed-whic h are still on the business paper, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he could appoint some hour this afternoon, say 2 o'clock, at which divisions could be taken, without discussion, upon some of the more important matters.",16
50,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"During the rest of the morning I shall take the matter into consideration. There are one or two short notices upon the paper, one having refermean? ence to the Japanese, and the other standing in the name of the honourable member for Darwin, which might possibly be taken. 'have every sympathy with the honourable member. TEMPORA RY STANDINGORDERS : LAPSED BILLS.",16
51,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I move- r That, until permanent Standing Orders be adopted, the following be temporary Standing I Orders of this House :214A. If , in any session the proceedings on any Bill shall have been interrupted by the prorogation of Parliament, the House may, in the next succeeding session, by resolution, order such proceedings to be resumed at the stage to which the Bill had been advanced in the previous session, provided a periodical election for the House has not taken place between such two sessions. 214B. Any such Bill may be sent to the Senate I as if it had been produced and passed by the House in the second session. I may explain that a similar standing order is in force in some of the State ParAs honorliaments, and also in the Senate. Obviously it is a very useful one. Its object is to prevent, the necessity for honourable members doing a second time .the whole of the work in connection with the preliminary stages of any Bill.",16
52,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I have heard this matter discussed in other Parliaments, and I have come to the conclusion that the adoption of such a standing order is not desirable. Of course, the proviso contained in the motion in regard to the intervention of a general election is intended to safeguard the representative character of Parliament. Hut, unfortunately, it is possible that circumstances may arise during a recess which would alter the personnel of the Legislature, and it if is easy to conceive that the new Parliament would have its hands tied in regard to a Bil l which might have been carried in the preceding session by a majority of only one or two votes, and despite the fact that the consensus of opinion upon it may be entirely changed. That, I claim, would affect the representative character of the Legislature. Moreover, the motion assumes that honourable members never become wiser, and that even after a long recess they entertain the belief that no improvement can be suggested in any measure with which they have previously dealt.",16
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,No .,16
54,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then what does it Surely the advantages to be gained from it are not such as to justify the adoption of a standing order of this character, I especially upon the last day of the session.",16
55,Mr BRUCE SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"A similar standing order has been in operation in New South Wales for many years, and no objection has ever been taken to it.",16
56,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I should be sorry to discount in any way a rule which prevails in the New South Wales Parliament, but I should be equally reluctant to accept that body as a legislative model. Other Parliaments, in the absence of a provision of this kind, have transacted their business quite as successfully as have the Legislatures of New South Wales and Victoria. If no change had occurred in the personnel of Parliament during a recess I should not entertain such a strong objection to the motion, even though I do not think that it can be commended to favourable consideration from a democratic stand-point.",17
57,Mr SOLMON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I would point out to the honourable member for Wide Bay that a similar standing order has been in force in the Victorian Parliament for some years, and that it has been found to work admirably. I do not think that any great weight attaches to his argument regarding a possible alteration in the personnel of the House between sessions, because, under the circumstances suggested by the honourable member, it would be impossible to carry the necessary resolution to give effect to the standing order.",17
58,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What is the objection to giving effect to it after a general election ?,17
59,Mr SALMON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The proposed standing order is intended for the convenience of Parliament. One of its advantages would be that it would afford private members a better opportunity of getting any business in which they may be specially interested dealt with.,17
60,Mr MCLEAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In the Victorian Parlialearned ment a very important measure, the Tramways Act, was passed, as the result of the operation of a similar standing order.",17
61,Mr SALMON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Yes. The honourable and learned member for Parkes has assured us that for some years this standing order has worked successfully in New South Wales. Consequently I appeal to those who desire that private members shall be afforded an opportunity to carry to a conclusibn useful legislation to agree to this motion. Mjr. MALONEY (Melbourne) - I intend to support the proposal of the Prime Minister. In the Victorian Legislature this standing order has tended to diminish the "" slaughter of the innocents"" at the close of each session. The honourable member for Wide Bay has asked why it should not apply after a general election? My reply is because a new Parliament would then have been constituted. I claim that after a Bil l has been advanced to a certain stage, it is the acme of absurdity to suggest that we should perform the whole of our work again. No public company which conducted its business upon similar lines could successfully carry on operations. Some of the most democratic measures have been placed upon the Victorian Statutebook as the result of the operation of this standing order. To a certain extent it has had the effect of removing the infamy against which the Labour Party in this State were always declaiming, namely, the loss of time occasioned in discussing measures which were ruthlessly slaughtered at the close of the session. I shall always vote to minimize that slaughter as much as possible.",17
62,Mr ROBINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, I think' that a standing order of this kind is of such importance that it is scarcely fair to ask honourable members to agree to it upon the final day of the session.,17
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The same course has been followed in every other session.,17
64,Mr ROBINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If that be so, there is no reason why that fact should be regarded as a precedent. In my opinion Australia suffers from too much hasty legislation. It is in the highest degree desirable that the speed with which our laws are enacted should be lessened and not accelerated. I scarcely think that the analogy which was drawn by the honourable member for Laanecoorie was a very good one.",17
65,Mr SALMON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Does the honourable and member know of a single instance in which this standing order has worked badly ?,17
66,Mr ROBINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I think that most"" legislation is bad. Its effect usually is to provide more work for the legal profession, and I do not regard that result as altogether a desirable one. In this House private members' business is practically i minus quantity. In my judgment we have already devoted far too much time to the consideration of that class of business during the current session, and the adoption of the standing order proposed would probably lead to measures which 1 ought to be submitted to the Government being introduced by private members. Our Standing Orders seem to require very considerable revision, if only with a view to prevent the exhaustive debate which' has, taken place during the past three or four months. But whilst I am prepared to assist in any general revision of the Standing Orders I am not willing to for their amendment upon the last day the session.",17
67,Mr MCLEAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The object of this proexisting posal is to curtail debate-to prevent the duplication of discussion.,18
68,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Ver y frequently its sion at the adoption does not lead to that result.,18
69,Mr ROBINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I would remind the Minister that very frequently it does not produce the desired result. Under this proposal, those who were opposed to any particular Bill would naturally take care to ventilate their views as fully upon the motime. tion necessary to bring the standing order into operation as they would upon the measure itself. Speaking from memory, motion. under the Standing Orders of the should Victorian Parliament, it is impossible, by resolution, to advance a Bill bewhich yond the second-reading stage. means that a Bill considered in Committee the recess. during the previous session, must be taken through Committee once more, and I think to the wall. it is a more sensible provision than the one which we are now asked to accept. regard this motion with some apprehension. It proposes an important departure from the present practice, and I do not think that contentious matters of this kind should question at issue. be introduced in the closing hours of the session. I am reminded that it is just a year ago today since we were all woning dering what our fate would be at the I think that we ought to refer the whole of the Standing Orders to the Standing re-assemble. Orders Committee, so that we may obtain a thoroughly up-to-date set, which, while preventing tedious repetition, would give honourable members every opportunity for free and open debate. At present I am opposed to the proposed Standing Orders.",18
70,Mr THOMAS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I do not that I am opposed to the principle which ws are asked to affirm, but I certainly object to the passing of the motion at this stage. A matter of such importance should not be dealt with until we are called upon to consider the Standing Orders as a whole. The one great objection which I have, para ticularly at the present moment, to passing of this motion, is that a number of honourable members discussed measures during the session, with the led Ere that under the present Standing Orders they would lapse with the prorogaivernment tion of Parliament, and that we should commence their ""consideration de novo next session. I believe that the debate which took place on one particular measure vote was limited to a material extent beof cause of that fact. We are nowasked to pass a motiorj which would vary the practice, and which practically says that that measure, as well as two or three others, shall be taken up next sesstage at which they were dropped. If ithe question be deferred until we are asked to deal with the Standing Orders next session, it is cjuite possible that I shall support the principle involved, but I think that it would be unwise and unjust to deal with the matter at the present",18
71,Mr FRAZ ER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I entirely agree with the principle embodied in the It is very desirable that we have such Standing Orders so that a tedious repetition of debates on bills have been considered this session, That should not take place when we resume after It is inevitable that with the closing of the session, same Bills must go We have had a rather unsatisfactory experience in dealing with cerI tain matters under the provisional Standing Orders, for in several cases debates have been prolonged obviously with the object of preventing any decision upon the The members of this or of any other Parliament should be prepared to accept the responsibility of voton any question submitted to. them. We polls. all hope that there will be no change in the personnel of the House when we Our views on questions which have been discussed during the present session are not likely to undergo any material change during the recess, so that when Ave return we should be prepared to give a vote on measures that are taken up under these proposed Standing Orders, know without debating them a second time. I think that the provision that proceedings in respect of any Bills which have been - interrupted by the prorogation of Parliament shall be resumed at the stage to which , they were advanced in the previous session ; only upon resolution of the House, will be sufficient safeguard. If we find that we the cannot reasonably stand by the opinions that we have expressed on a previous occacertain ' sion, we shall be able to A'ote against the knowi motion. Although holding these views, I must confess that, in my opinion, the Goshould have made an effort to - pass some 'of the measures on the notice' paper. The state of the business-paper today ought to force upon any reasonable Government the desirability of dealing with some of the measures that have been partly considered before we prorogue. We were assured a few days ago that certain Bills would be passed before the prorogation, and that every opportunity would be given to honourable members to deal with certain motions. It seems to me that the Appropriation Bill has been pushed through almost under false pretences. As soon as it had been passed by another place, we received an intimation that the Government intended to bring the session to a close, irrespective of any consideration for measures that had been partly dealt with. This motion will compel some of those who are opposed to it to come into the open. If the proposed new Standing Orders be agreed to, they will be compelled to express their opinions, as soon as the next session opens, on measures that have been partly considered ; they will not be able to evade the responsibility of giving an open vote on measures which might otherwise be among the slaughtered innocents.",18
72,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Would these Standing Orders apply to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill ?,19
73,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Unfortunately , I believe that measure is not likely to be passed this session. But take the case of the Papua (British New Guinea) Bill . Certain amendments have been made by the Senate, and it is 'obvious that if we are not prepared to at once agree to them, we shall not be able to place that measure on the Statute-book during the present session. Some honourable members have been seeking to evade the responsibility of casting a vote on other matters of considerable importance, such as the preferential trade proposals and the Manufactures Encouragement Bill.",19
74,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We have had a division on the Manufactures Encouragement Bill.,19
75,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,There is also a notice of motion standing on the business-paper in the name of the Prime Minister with reference to a proposal that the Commonwealth shall contribute to the Queen Victoria Memorial Fund. It was stated in the public press that it was considered necessary that an expression of opinion on the part of the Parliament should be obtained in respect of that proposal.,19
76,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I would remind the honourable member that the motion relates, not to resolutions, but to Bills, so that the matter which he is now discussing is beyond the scope of the debate.",19
77,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is so, sir, but such a resolution, if passed, would have been followed by a Bill. 1I have only to say in conclusion that if these Standing Orders be adopted, they will assist us to finally dispose of various measures, and will compel honourable members to take the responsibility of voting on all questions submitted to the House. I hail the motion with satisfaction, and shall certainly vote for it.",19
78,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The honourable member is in error in thinking that the proposed Standing Orders would facilitate the business of the House to any material extent. For some three years it has been the desire of honourable members that permanent Standing Orders should be adopted, but, although the Standing Orders Committee went to considerable trouble in framing a draft set, no Government has yet seen fit to take the responsibility of moving their adoption. The provisional Standing Orders under which the business of the House is conducted are undoubtedly most unsatisfactory, but it would be most unwise for us to deal with the matter in this way. The Prime Minister should endeavour to pass the whole of the draft Standing Orders, including the two covered by this motion, as soon as we re-assemble. While I have no strong objection to these two Standing Orders, I would point out that they are not altogether what they seem. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie appears to think that they would do away with the repetition of second-reading speeches upon measures to which they applied, and would thus conserve the time of the House. That would not be the case.",19
79,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is only the honourable member's opinion.,19
80,Mr MCDONTALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It is a question, not of opinion, but of fact. If the honourable member turns to the different State Hansards, h? will find that my assertion is correct. A second reading debate often takes place on the motion that the proceedings on a Bill be resumed at^the stage, to which it was advanced in the previous session. I might refer to many cases in which such a motion has been debated at greater length than was the original motion for the second reading of the Bill to which it related.",19
81,Mr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That has not been the experience of the Victorian Parliament.,19
82,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I cannot speak of the experience of the Legislature of this State, but I have.correctly stated the position, so far as the South Australian Parliament is concerned. Mr KING O'MALLEY - NO .  Australia, the matter was dealt with by Act of Parliament.",20
83,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is so. attempt was made to deal with it in the same way in the Queensland Parliament, but without success. It would constitute an important change in the procedure of the House, and I think that we should not deal hastily with the question. vernment should take up the Standing Orders at the earliest possible date, and give the House an opportunity to deal with them. If we rush these Standing Orders through the House, it is quite possible that we may lay up a store of trouble for ourselves. I say, without fear of contradiction, that if a motion be submitted next session to restore the Manufactures Encouragement Bill to the notice-paper at the stage at which it at present stands, the debate upon it will be equally as long as that which has taken place on the motion for the second reading. Nearly one-third of the members of this House, at the beginning of this session, were new members, and they are never thoroughly acquainted with the forms of procedure, and the methods of obtaining information.",20
84,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The proposed new Standing Orders would not apply after a general election.,20
85,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is so; but there are frequently new members. these Standing Orders will not necessarily save time, because there might be practically a second reading debate on the motion to restore business to the notice paper. The proposed new Standing Orders, however, will deprive this House of the control which it would otherwise have over the business of Parliament. If they are passed, we can do nothing more in regard to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survev Bill until it is returned to us by the Senate. I do not wish to occupy time unduly now, because there is an important motion on the business-paper, which I understand honourable members desire to discuss; but ! think that it would be better to deal with this subject when considering permanent Standing Orders. not right to consider it at this stage of the session.",20
86,Mr KING OMALLEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I consider the motion a wise and proper one,, and I am heartily in favour of it. The honourable member for Kennedy says that there might be practically second-reading speeches on the motion to restore business to the notice-paper, but you, Mr Speaker, An will remember that when, in the South Australian House, I had the Testamentary Disposition of Property Bill re-instated, although there had been a tremendous debate in the previous session, it wenr through without opposition. An ounce of The Go- practice is worth 1,000 pounds of theory. The honourable and learned member for Wannon described the proposal as an innovation. . I admit that it is, but innovations are the foundations of human progress.",20
87,Mr ROBINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I have heard that before. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Exactly , but not from the honourable member for Wannon. I think that the Prime Minister is right in trying to prevent the repetition of second-reading speeches, when measures are brought forward again in a new session. Are honourable members so impressed with their intellectual importance and mental concentration, that they think it necessary to make second-reading speeches whenever a Bill is brought forward? I think it would be better, when a Bill has been debated in one session and comes up in the next, to run it through without talk.",20
88,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"-That would be very rough on the honourable member for Gwvdir. Besides, Mr KING O'MALLEY - There is no question about that; but the House has a right to muzzle both the honourable member for Gwydir and the Honourable member for Lang when they interfere with the progress of business. The honourable member for Wide Bay said that members might change their opinions between session and session. No doubt there may be changes during the next six months. After suffering twelve or fifteen months of starvation, some honourable members may die from the effect of relaxation during the recess. I was nevertheless astounded at the remarks of the honourable member for Wide Bay. Had my eyes been shut, I would have thought that I was listening to a real conservative, instead of It is to a democrat.",20
89,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member has been muzzled during the greater part of this session. Mr KING O'MALLEY - No ; I have been a free-lance. I have had nothing to fight for. If my friends had stayed on the Treasury benches,_ I would have fought for them.",21
90,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member must discuss the question. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I hope that the motion will be carried"". favour of applying the proposed new Standing Orders to motions as well as to Bills, because I should like to get my old-age pension motion through.",21
91,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then why not move an amendment to include motions. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I will do so. I move That after the word "" Bill , "" line 5, the ""or motion"" be inserted.  forward of this motion is further evidence of the demoralized state of this Parliament. To mv mind, it is a motion to further political log-rolling. Proposed new temporary standing order No. 214B, which readsAny such Bill may be sent to the Senate as if it had been introduced and passed by the House in the second session, has, in my opinion, been moved in order to confer a favour on a supporter of the Ministry. I take it that if a Bill were dealt with next session, and an attempt were made to resuscitate it in. the third session, that attempt would fail, because the proposed Standing Orders would not apply. The Government appear to be too weak to resist the pressure put upon them by their supporters. In South Australia Bills were revived under the provisions of an Act of Parliament.",21
92,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The practice now proposed is not followed in the House of Commons.  their practice is, but in South Australia measures which have passed their second reading in one session can be revived in the next under the provisions of the Lapsed Bill Continuance Act, if , in the meantime, there has been no general election. ^ In my opinion, this measure has been introduced to please the honourable' member for Eden-Monaro, and to let him advance the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. This political log-rolling should not be allowed. I would point out that if the motion is agreed to, it will be impossible to prevent a very full discussion on the motion for resuscitation. I shall vote against the proposals of the Prime Minister, and divide the House upon them as a protest against the political log-rolling which has been practised this session.",21
93,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I ask the honourable member for I am in Darwin not to press his amendment, because it is entirely useless. It might be thought that if a motion were debated very fully one session and restored to the business-paper at the beginning of the next session, the speeches previously made would not be repeated. I would point out, however, that the restoration has to be effected by resolution, and that any honourable memwords ber could say all that he desired upon the motion to restore the business to the notice paper. Therefore, nothing would be gained by including motions in t)he Standing Orders. With Bills the position is very different. For instance, if a Bill were advanced to its third reading, and prorogation took place, it could be restored to the business-paper by resolution at the stage at which it was dropped in the previous session. Therefore, only one stage would have to be gone through, in order to bring the Bill back to the position in which it was previously left. This would result in a considerable saving of public time. One honourable member has referred to the motionbeing intended specially to meet the case of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, but he is in error. A similar standing order is in force in all the State Parliaments.",21
94,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Onl y in three of them. Mr RoBrNSON - The House of Commons do not follow the practice proposed.,21
95,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not know that the House of Commons presents a perfect model to us, so far as the saving of time is concerned. A similar standing order is in operation in three States Parliaments, and also in the Senate, and I think that from the point of view of saving the public time it is a most desirable one. It has never worked any harm.",21
96,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It has not done much good.,21
97,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In Victoria it was first proposed to initiate the practice now contemplated by means of the Lapsed Bills Continuation Bill. That measure passed the Legislative Assembly, but was lost in the Legislative Council, and the Assembly then adopted a standing, order similar in terms to that now under discussion. Whatever view honourable members may take of this matter, I would ask them to deal with it promptly for the reason that the next matter on the notice-paper is the Papua Bill, and as there are a number of amendments to be considered it is urgently necessary that at least a couple of hours should be available for the reprinting of the Bill before it is presented for the Royal assent",21
98,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is it necessary to reprint it?,22
99,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We must have a clean thereof : copy of some kind to present for the Royal £LSS6nt*,22
100,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, I support the proposal because I think that it is business like in character. In 1893 the Victorian Parliamentary Procedure Commission recommended among other things that a standing order similar to that now before us should be adopted. I suggest that the order might be made to apply to Bills that are received by this House from the Senate.,22
101,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,There is some doubt as to whether we could do that.,22
102,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"There may be a difficulty. I quite agree with the remarks of the Minister with regard to the inclusion of motions within the proposed Standing Orders. There may be other difficulties in addition to those which have been pointed out. For instance, it might be impossible for the honourable member in charge of a motion to again speak upon it, and furnish honourable members with much desired information. That would, in many cases, prove detrimental. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPUA (BRITISH NEW GUINEA) In Committee (Consideration of Senate's amendments): Clause 21No intoxicants or opium shall be allowed imported into, or manufactured or sold, or wise disposed of in the Territory except as hereinafter mentionedNo intoxicants or opium shall be imported into or manufactured in the Territory except by written permission of a person duly authorized by the Lieutenant Governor, and under regulations and ditions to be prescribed by the Lieutenant Governor, including a provision that such importation or manufacture shall be for medicinal purposes only, and no intoxicants or opium shall be sold or otherwise disposed of in the Territory except for medicinal purposes, and on the order of a medical practitioner or person duly authorized by the Lieutenant-Governor. The penalty for contravention of this section is forfeiture of any goods illegally imported, manufactured, or sold, and a fine of not less than ^5 or more than £100. Every ordinance passed before the commencement of this Act providing for or permitting the importation, manufacture, sale, or disposal of intoxicants or opium in New Guinea is hereby repealed. Senate's Amendment - Leave out clause 21, and insert the following new clause in lieu "" Intoxicants may be purchased, imported into, manufactured and sold in the Territory only by the Lieutenant-Governor or by officers duly appointed in that behalf, and under regulations and conditions to be prescribed by the Lieutenant Governor, relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture, and sale thereof. "" No person other than as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph shall import into, manufacture, or sell in the Territory any intoxicants. "" Penalty : ,£100. "" Intoxicants for the purposes of this section shall mean any wine, spirits, ale, beer, porter, cider, perry, or other spirituous or fermented liquor of an intoxicating nature."" Mr MCCAY' (Corinella-Minister of Defence) - The clause, as it now stands, was inserted at the instance of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports when .'he Bill was previously before us, and was agreed to by a substantial majority. The clause absolutely forbids the importation or manufacture of intoxicants or opium, except by the Lieutenant-Governor, or persons duly authorized by him, and further provides that no intoxicants shall be supplied within the Territory, except upon the ord it of a medical practitioner, or some other person duly authorized. The Senate propose to omit that clause, and insert in lieu thereof a provision which is a substantial repetiBILL. tion of that now contained in the Bill, with' the important exception that once the importation or manufacture of intoxicants is permitted, all restriction upon the disposal of the liquor, so far as white residents are to be concerned, will be removed. That is to say, other- it will be no longer necessary to sell the liquor solely for medicinal purposes. The difficulty is this: It is very desirable that we should have a Constitutio.i for Papua. At present, legislation in regard to the Possession is at a standstill. Its affairs are con- in the transition stage. The administration can be carried on, but legislation is blocked. The alternatives before the Committee are, first, to insist upon the original clause, and to run the risk of losing the Bill , and, secondly, to suggest that the manufacture and sale of intoxicants shall be governed n-t by regulations, but by ordinance passed by the Executive Council in the Possession. If the traffic be regulated by ordinance, that provision, in conjunction, -.with (the clause which provides that ordinances relating to the sale of liquor to the natives shall be reserved for the assent of the Governor General, will give the Executive Government of the Commonwealth full control of the The third alternative is for .the two Houses to abandon their respective positions, and to entirely omit from this Constitution any provision regarding the sale of intoxicants. As honourable members are aware, I entertain very strong views upon this matter. But, despite those strong convictions, I cannot fail to recognise the urgent necessity of granting a Constitution to New Guinea, in order that the development of the Possession may proceed. I trust that we shall arrive at some conclusion which will enable us to pass the Bill this session.",22
103,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I must very strongly endorse the appeal which has been made by my honourable colleague in regard' to this matter. If honourable members will glance at the preamble to the measure, I think they will understand the situation. This Parliament has already adopted two resolutions, affirming its readiness to take over the administration of New Guinea. until this measure becomes law, it as impossible to do that. At present the government is carried on under Royal Letters Patent by an Admiriistrator, representing not the Commonwealth, but the British Government. Thus, in a roundabout way, we are really exercising authority through the King's representative, who is in no way responsible to us. I repeat, we have passed two resolutions affirming our willingness to take over and govern the Territory. sequence of those resolutions-as is recited in the preamble-the King, by Letters Patent, has provided that as soon as this Parliament enacts laws for the government of the Possession, a proclamation will be issued, under which its control will pass to the Commonwealth. We simply cannot allow the matter .to remain in the present position. If honourable members cannot see their way to accept any compromise concerning the control of the liquor traffic, they might at least allow us ,to obtain a measure which will bring the authority of the Commonwealth into force in regard to the Possession. The question as to the restrictions which should surround .the sale of intoxicants could be dealt with in a measure separate from this Bill . The ordinances now in operation in the Territory strictly prohibit the supply of intoxicants to the aborigines. Heavy penalties are provided for any offence in this direction, and I am assured that the law is being well administered. I would seriously appeal to honmatter. orable members to allow the Bill to pass, so that we may take over the government of the Possession. I need scarcely point out that the moment its administration passes to the authority of the Commonwealth, the whole of its government, and even its legislation, will be under the control of this Parliament.",23
104,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is the Prime Minister aware of the reason which has prompted the Senate to emit clauses 22 and 23 from the Bill?,23
105,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am not. I .thoroughly respect the strong opinions which are entertained by honourable members with regard to the liquor traffic as it affects the natives of New Guinea. I do not ask them to sacrifice their principles to a greater extent than is fair, by way of compromise. If , however, they find it impossible to make any compromise, I appeal to them to eliminate the controversial element from the measure, in order that we may become responBut sible for the government of the Territory.",23
106,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Does the Prime Minister intend to submit a motion?,23
107,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We are merely discussing the matter at present, anb"" I apprehend that it is not necessary to submit a motion at this stage.",23
108,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I can assure the Prime Minister that it is necessary to do so. Possibly, he may be disposed to move "" Tha.t the amendments of the Senate be In con- now considered seriatim.""",23
109,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I thought it was unnecessary to move any such motion, inasmuch 1 as the House has resolved itself into Committee for the purpose of considering those amendments.",23
110,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The course which I suggest is necessary under our Standing Orders.,23
111,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then, I move That the amendments be considered seriatim.",23

So far as I am able to ascertain, the whole tion in regard to this question. development of New Guinea-eve n the terests of the natives themselves-wil seriously affected by the absence of legislawithout any further delay. tion of this character. The officials have nothing to guide them in the discharge of their public functions, in default declaration from this Parliament as to are its intentions concerning the Territory. The land which .already belongs to the Crown, and which in some instances has been purchased from the natives, cannot be utilized in any reasonable way until this Bill has been placed upon the Statute-book. In view of that fact, and also of the cumstance that no party considerations are amendment. involved in the measure, I trust that honnot orable members will see fit to forego at least some portion of their convictions, as to bring about the desired result. sonally, I cannot see that those who consentatives of the first Parliament. stitute a majority of the Committee, and who have taken up a very decided attitude regarding the sale of intoxicants in the on one side or the other. Possession, have anything to lose by dissolution agreeing to the Senate's amendment. take it that their primary object is to guard the interests of the natives, surely, it cannot be urged that the position of the latter will be any worse than at present, if the supply of intoxicants placed in the hands of a Government official. In. my! judgment, the reverse will the case. I would further point out if, as the result of insistence views, the Bill be lost or withdrawn, the control of the liquor traffic will continue in the hands of private individuals, at all events until legislation dealing with that matter has been enacted. I think that honwould orable members ought to be content to effect a compromise in the direction of placing the control of the traffic in the hands of the Commonwealth, or to entirely drop the provision which is in dispute. Personally, I am at a loss to understand why the Senate proposes to eliminate clauses 22 and 23. It is true that there is a saving provision in each of those clauses, which would be superfluous in the light of the amendment which has been made by the other Chamber. I trust, ever, that honourable members will recognise the urgent necessity which exists f o ing some measure conferring a Constitution upon New Guinea.",24
113,Mr LEE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I have carefully listened to the remarks both of the Prime Minister and of the leader of the OpposiThey inhave strongly urged that a constitution l be should be granted to British New Guinea The obstacle there in the way of that being done appears to be a difference of opinion between the of a Senate and this Chamber. I fail to see what why the members of the Committee should give way any more than should the members of another place. An important question of principle is involved, and upon matters of principle we cannot compromise. I do not think that any satisfactory argument has been advanced in support of the cirview that we should agree to the Senate's Honourable members should forget that the principle of prohibition in relation to British New Guinea has been so affirmed, not only by the present House of PerRepresentatives, but by the House of RepreI f the Ministry are anxious to secure the passing of the Bill they must take a decided stand If a double takes place as the result of our I opposition to the amendment of the Senate, safethe supporters of the new clause will be and, quite prepared to face the music.",24
114,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Does the honourable it is member recommend that there should be be a dissolution to settle the question?,24
115,Mr LEE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I should be quite prepared be to go before the country upon this question. that The supporters of the principle intend to upon our own stand by their guns.,24
116,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The result will be that they will leave things as they are.,24
117,Mr LEE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The present ordinance is an excellent one, and if strictly administered, be far better than the proposal which either we are now asked to accept.",24
118,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is an argument against the honourable member's own case. What about the remainder of the Bill ?,24
119,Mr LEE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"All that I said was that the present ordinance is better than ths system which the Senate propose. I believe, however, that prohibition would be the best of all, and the House would stultify itself if it gave way on the point. As a matter of fact the principle embodied in the howamendment made by another place was fully discussed in this Chamber on an r passamendment submitted by the honourable member for Herbert, and was rejected by a majority of eight or ten votes. I am opposed' to the State playing the role of p.ublican. We know that the system has been tried in Western Australia by the opening of a State hotel at Gwalia, and that the people of that State were led to believe that it would be attended by excellent results. A member of the Western Australian Parliament recently submitted a motion in the State Legislature, asking for information in regard to the State hotel at Gwalia, and I take the following statement from the West Australian, of 24th November, 1904, showing the particulars which were subsequently submitted to Parliament: The following is the complete statement of accounts that was recently laid on the table of the Legislative Council, in compliance with a motion by Dr Hackett :GWAL IA STATE HOTEL - £4'9 6 Re Notice of Motion by Dr Hackett : I have the honour to forward herewith the information asked for, with the exception of that in paragraph r.

Note - No allowance has been made in building, furniture, & c , or unexpired portion of hotel licence. I read a statement a few months ago to the effect that the Premier of Western Australia had said that the system had proved a great success. These figures to my mind show that it has not. The West Australian points out thatThe total cost of building and furnishing, together with a few extras, was ,£6,748 9s. gd., and the hotel is indebted to the Colonial Treasurer for that amount. In any discussion upon the financial outlook the matter of depreciation has to be kept in sight. It has been calculated that a year's depreciation would fairly represent, as regards £1,103 worth of furniture, £ 2 2 0; as regards £276 worth of glass, crockery, linen, & c , £ 9 2 ; and as regards the hotel building-in view of its dependence on the uncertain returns from a mining district- a sum of £320. The three amounts, £220, £92, and £320, make a total for depreciation of £632. It is not claimed that the latter figure represents the position with absolute accuracy, but the basis of computation in each case must be regarded as fair and reasonable. It becomes apparent, therefore, that the paper profit of £588 is entirely swallowed up by the amount representing annual depreciation, and that instead of a gain for the year under notice there has been a loss totalling something like £44. It has to be borne in mind, moreover, that a merchant would expect a return of 6 or 8 per cent, on his outlay after all expenses-including allowance for depreciation-ha s been met. It appears, then, that the expenditure of Government money on this project has not been a commercially profitable venture; that instead of there being any tangible gain, there has been a loss on the first year that must equal at least £1,241 6 3 £ 4 0 0 or £ 5 0 0 .",25

131,Mr LEE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am opposed to State control in this respect. If strong drink is to be sold, and the people are to be demoralized by it, the State certainly ought not to have anything to do with the traffic. We ought to stand by the principle which two successive Houses of Representatives have ratified. I can understand the anxiety of the Prime Minister that the Bill should be passed, and I think it augurs well that the first Constitution which we as a Parliament have had a hand in framing contains a provision for prohibition. I gave way to the Minister of Defence on the canteen question, in order that he might secure the speedy passing of the amending Defence Bill , but on this question I do not intend to give up anything. We must stand to our guns, and keep the prohibition flag flying. I disagree with the amendment, and hope that the clause will be carried as passed by us on a previous occasion.",26
132,Mr MCCOLL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The honourable member for Cowper stated several times that two Parliaments have passed this prohibition clause. That is not correct. It 'has been passed by only"" a section of the Parliament. If two Parliaments had passed it , it would have become law. I supported the prohibition of liquor in New Guinea when it was first proposed in this Chamber, and ever since, and pledged myself at the last election to support it . But I am now faced with this difficulty: The Commonwealth has taken control of the Territory, but until a Constitution is enacted, and things are brought into proper working order, that control cannot be complete, and the administration of affairs is not as satisfactory as it should be. The honourable member for Herbert has very pertinently inquired, "" Why not pass the rest of the Bill ?"" The question we have to ask ourselves is, Are we justified, since we cannot at present enforce the particular principle of which we are in favour, in keeping affairs in New Guinea - in a state of chaos from year to year? The Senate, as at present constituted, is no more likely to go back on its vote than we are. These are very serious considerations, whatever may be our views on the liquor traffic. It seems to me that if we wish to fulfil our responsibilities to the people of the Territory our wisest course is, in the meantime, to pass the Bill without the prohibition. If we reject it because the Senate will not comply with our request for prohibition, we shall gain nothing, while we shall lose nothing if we let the Bill pass without prohibition, and deal with this question again next session. No doubt the Government will give time for its consideration then, and if we can get the members of the Senate to change their minds on the subject, as I hope we shall, our object will have been attained, without in the meanwhile keeping the administration of affairs in New Guinea in a state of chaos. After the statements made by the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition, who, having been in charge of the Department of External Affairs, must be better acquainted with the facts relating to this Possession than is any other honourable member, it seems to me best to pass the Bill as amended by the Senate, leaving the liquor question to stand over until next session. I will support a compromise to that effect.",27
133,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The honourable member for Echuca, as an old Parliamentarian, must know that ' the arguments used by the Government in regard to this Bill are used by every Government which wishesi to get rid of difficulties. What is done is to bring the Bill forward at a late period of the session, and then to say to those who are supporting some particular principle, "" Y o u have the alternative of sticking to your principle, or risking the loss of a very important and necessary measure."" If this Bill is as important as it is said to be, and as I believe it to be, why was it not introduced earlier in the session, so that it could be properly discussed ?",27
134,Mr MCCOLL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The Government of which the honourable member was a Minister had an opportunity to have it dealt with.,27
135,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I did my best to have it brought forward. It is now nearly three years since we passed the resolution in favour of taking over New Guinea. Do honourable members say that the Territory will suffer if we defer for a little longer the enactment of a Constitution for it?,27
136,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We admit our incapacity to govern if we cannot pass a Bill of this kind to deal with the Territory.,27
137,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The measure should have been introduced by Ministers at the proper time. Seeing that this is the first Constitution that we have been asked to pass, it would have been more statesmanlike to have had a special session for its consideration, than to ask honourable members to go back on their principles in regard to it. because of the urgency of passing it before this session closes. I have no objection to the State control of the liquor traffic. In my opinion, that is better than private control. I have, however, given certain pledges to my constituents in regard to this matter, and if I must decide whether the Bill shall pass, or whether I shall stand foy my principles, I will choose the latter alternative. I would rather resign my seat, and contest the election again, in order that those who are the fountain of power may give their verdict on this question, than break my pledges.",27
138,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What about the people in New Guinea?,28
139,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It is unfortunate that they have to be legislated for by a Parister in passing the Bill. liament which they have not elected. But have we any more right to pass any other provision relating to .them than we have to pass the provision prohibiting the introducto be sacrificed. tion of intoxicants into the Territory ?,28
140,Mr BAMFORD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is the most drastic provision in .the Bill .,28
141,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It has not been opposed with the virulence and unanimity that characterized the opposition to the clause dealing with the alienation of land. I have great sympathy with those who differ from me, but there has been too much sneering on this subject. Although the Women's Christian Temperance Union may take an interest in the question, it must not be gotten that the members of that anion are citizens of the Commonwealth, and have sincere regard' for both our responsibilities and the interests of New Guinea. At the same time, their influence, powerful, is not so strong as the Constitution vested interests of the liquor trade. I do complain because those who are interested in the trade wish to safeguard their intedeprive rests. They are carrying on an industry which is sanctioned by the laws of the monwealth, and they have a right to pronot tect themselves in every lawful way. But viously took up. in replv to the statement of the honourable member for Echuca, that the Prime Minister will allow us to decide this question next'session, I warn honourable members if it is not effectively dealt with in the Bill, it will bea long time before we have another opportunity to discuss and settle it. I feel bound to stand by my old tion, even if the Bill must be sacrificed consequence. After all, it is only laving for another session the enactment of this Constitution, which, though of great importance, should be a measure which will stand for years. It has been said that times of emergency a nuarter of an hour mav be as valuable as four or five years on other occasions. But this is not tional crisis which requires us to suddenly change our opinions to save the national ready given. honour or position. We are dealing merely with a machinery Bill whose enactment may be deferred without any great disturbthose ance of the interests of either the Comi monwealth or New Guinea.",28
142,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I do not feel the Bill. disposed to retreat from the attitude which I assumed in regard to this question when the measure was last before us, although I have every desire to assist the Prime MinI am faced with this position, that I must either break an absolute and definite pledge given to my constituents, or, perhaps, allow the Bill The alternative is not a very pleasing one. While I wish to see the Bill pass, I am desirous of keeping faith with my constituents, and I feel that I cannot give way on a matter of principle. This question to me, whatever it may has be to other honourable members, is vital. I fail to see that any good would come from adopting the suggestion of the Prime Minister, that we should let the Bill pass without this provision, discussing the matter again next session. We are now concerned in framing a Constitution for Brifortish New Guinea, under which the people will govern themselves, and if we passed a the Bill without the provision inserted by this House, we should, when the subject comes up for consideration at a future though date, be met with the objection, "" The already passed by this Parlianot ment allows the importation of liquor into New Guinea, and it would be unfair to the people of the Territory of the rights which they are enjoying."" Having Compromised to vote for prohibition, I must recede from the position which I pre",28
143,Mr REI D,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member's pledge did not amount to a refusal to asthat sent to any form of government unless effect was given to this provision in the present session. Why not pass the Bill as it stands, and renew the fight on the liquor posiquestion next session? Nothing will be in gained by those who are in favour of prodehibiting the introduction of liquor into British New Guinea if the passing of the Bill .is postponed for another six months, while without the Bill chaos in the administration in of the affairs of that country must continue.",28
144,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"There is a great deal of force in that contention, but as I have a napromised definitely to vote for prohibition, I must repeat the vote which I have al",28
145,Mr LONSDALE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"New England) My views on this question are as strong as of any member of the House, and f it were possible to prevent the use of intoxicating liquor anywhere, I would do so. I voted for the prohibition clause in I believe that prohibition may be made effective in civilized communities; but whether it could be applied to the circumstances of Papua is an open question. I voted for prohibition without any great enthusiasm, because I recognised that much of the testimony that was brought to bear on the subject showed that it was very difficult to control the liquor traffic in the Possession. I am a prohibitionist, but I do not consider that I shall violate my principles by adopting the course I now intend to follow. I do not believe in State control, but the conditions in Papua are of an exceptional character, and we are called upon to do our best for the people there, and particularly for the natives. We are told that the present ordinance works very well. I cannot quite agree with that statement, because it appears to me that an immense quantity of liquor is^consumed there. At the same time, if the liquor traffic be controlled by ordinance, we shall be able to hold the Government directly responsible for any abuses that may arise,, and it will be open to us at any time to introduce such modifications as may be suggested by experience. The question for us to consider is whether we shall risk the loss of the Bill-whic h contains a number of admirable provisions-by insisting upon absolute prohibition. Personally, I am prepared to compromise, and to concede the wishes of the Senate.",28
146,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I think that it is incumbent upon us to do all we can to prevent the natives of New Guinea from obtaining intoxicants, and this end can be achieved only by exercising the very strictest control over the traffic.",29
147,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The present law works very well.,29
148,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I shall vote as I did on a former occasion. It would be a calamity if machinery were not provided for properly controlling the liquor traffic in New Guinea.,29
149,Mr BROWN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I am a strong advocate of the prohibition of the drink traffic; but I must admit that the weight of the evidence tends to show that it is almost impossible to effectively prohibit the sale of liquor in British New Guinea. Failing prohibition, we should aim at insuring the most effective control. I believe that the Bill provides for exercising a more complete supervision over the traffic than that which at present exists, and doubtless it would largely eliminate the element of private gain. The conditions under which Papua is administered cannot be as satisfactory as we could wish, or we should not be invited to pass this measure. We are dealing not only with the drink traffic, but with the civil control of affairs in the Possession. In other words, we are giving Papua a constitution under which the Government is to be administered. I gather that the proposed constitution fairly meets the conditions, although I should have preferred to see provision for an elective Council. We are asked by the prohibitionists to sacrifice the whole of the other interests that, are affected by the Bill, in order to pass a clause which will be fully satisfactory to them; but that would be pushing matters to extremes. Whilst we are strongly in favour of prohibition, the Senate favours a system of State control, and I think that under the circumstances we should proceed along the line of least resistance. There will be nothing to prevent our passing the Bill in the form desired by the Senate, and afterwards introducing an> amending Bill to deal specially with the drink traffic. We have embodied in this measure the most important principle of the nationalization of .the lands of the Possession, and that in itself is worth enacting, apart from every other consideration that may be involved in the measure. I am quite prepared to meet the Senate in this matter. Motion, by leave, withdrawn.",29
150,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I think I can now make a proposal which will meet the views of most honourable members. The first proposal to come before the Committee under the Senate's amendment will he .that clause 21 be left out. The omission of the clause would simply throw us back upon the existing stringent prohibitory law against the supol-of liquor to the natives, which provides for inflicting heavy penalties, including imprisonment. If we start the legislative machine provided for in the Bill, it will be necessary under clause 43 to reserve for the assent of the Governor General any laws which may be passed by the Legislative Council relating to the supply of intoxicants to the natives. Under these circumstances, the Governor General's advisers will become directly responsible to Parliament if they allow the present salutary laws to be altered. If honourable members agree to omit the present prohibitory clause, I snail not ask them to accept the clause proposed by the Senate to be inserted in lieu of it.",29
151,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Will that be acceptable to the Senate?,30
152,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I shall have to risk that. I shall expect them to view the matter in the same light that we do. I feel that I ought not to ask the House to consent to carry out the views of the Senate, which are directly in conflict with those of a majority of honourable members. I propose that we should omit the present clause, and disagree with the Senate's proposal to substitute another, and that we shall consequentially also omit other clauses. I therefore move That the amendment leaving cut clause agreed to.",30
153,Mr MCDONA LD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," Unles s a more satisfactory statement is forthcoming from the Prime Minister upon this question, I am not prepared to allow the Bill to pass. To my mind the Government are adopting a most unfair and undignified attitude. By a large majority this Committee decided to insert in the Bill a clause relating to the sale of intoxicants in Guinea. What position does the Prime Minister now take up in regard vision? He does not say, "" The Government refuse to agree with the Senate's amendment,"" but he proposes to accept that portion of it which eliminates the hibition upon the sale of intoxicants which quate. we inserted. He adds that he is prepared to allow the blank thus created to remain in the Bill, so that the matter may be to further consideration. That means the right honourable gentleman would gain his end by defeating not only prohibition, but also the State control of the liquor traffic.",30
154,Mr MCCOLL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is not a fair of putting the matter.,30
155,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is absolutely the position which the Prime Minister taken up. It is idle to suggest subject could be brought forward by a private member next session. F'rime Minister is prepared to make question of the prohibition of the sale intoxicants in British New Guinea the subBill. ject of a Government measure next session it will not be dealt with.,30
156,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I thought that the honourable member was so very much in earnest about' the Government of British New Guinea.,30
157,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,So I am.,30
158,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Then why not grant a stitution to the Possession?,30
159,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I wish to make Constitution as perfect as possible.,30
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Le t us come to a vote upon the matter.,30
161,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not think that that suggestion is altogether, a fair one. Honourable members will recollect that, a little while ago, there was a majority of thirteen in favour of imposing a prohibition upon the sale of intoxicants in British New Guinea.",30
162,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Some honourable members have gone over to the other side since then.,30
163,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I can understand 21 be the position of those who say, "" There is no possibility of this Bill being passed into law, whilst it contains a provision in reference to prohibition, but there is a prospect of passing it if we subject the liquor traffic to State control.""",30
164,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We have State control of the traffic under present ordinances.,30
165,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Onl y to a very limited extent. Drink is being supplied to the natives New of the Territory in a wholesale fashion.,30
166,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The missionaries deny to that prothat statement.,30
167,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The missionaries admit that they are in favour of State control of the traffic; but they acknowledge prothat the present system of control is inadeUnder the circumstances, the proper course for us to adopt is either to accept or reject the Senate's amendment. It open has been urged that New Guinea must be that granted a Constitution. I think that two years or more have elapsed since this Bill was originally introduced, but it is only now that an urgent appeal is made to grant !the 'Possession a Constitution. Seeing that it has waited two years for a Constiway tution, surely it can wait another six months. The Prime Minister would then be in a position to take up this Bill durhas ing the first week of next session, and to that this deal with it thoroughly.",30
168,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I think that some misapthe prehension exists in regard to the exact of position of affairs in connection with this I speak as one who supported, and who strongly believes, in prohibition. But the fact is that in New Guinea things are just now in a state of transition. The Possession has not yet fully passed to our control. The result is that we are only able to carry on its administration under Conexisting ordinances. It is true that this Bill was introduced two years ago, but that every month which has since elapsed has renderedit more necessary that the existing state of affairs in the Possession should be ended. By 35 votes to 22 the Committee approved of a proposal to prohibit the sale of intoxicants there. The Senate by a majority of 21. to 13, inclusive of pairs, declined to accept that proposal. The position is that if the Bill contains no provision in reference to the sale of intoxicating liquors in New Guinea, the ordinances relating to that traffic, which are at present in force, will continue in operation. Those ordinances are very stringent",30
169,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,They may be altered at once.,31
170,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Not without the consent of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth. Clause 43 provides thatThe Lieutenant-Governor shall not assent to any ordinance of any of the following unless the ordinance contains a clause suspending its operation until the signification vernor-General's pleasure thereon :(g) any ordinance relating to the supply arms, ammunition, explosive, intoxicants, or opium to the natives. There can be no alteration of the existing law without the consent of the Executive.",31
171,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"But without the intervenpointed tion of this Parliament, it can be altered at once.",31
172,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable learned member seems to forget that the Executive should be left with some little responsibility, otherwise it His views upon the responsibility of the Executive have undergone a very marked change during the past five years.",31
173,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Certainl y not.,31
174,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I recollect the time when the honourable and learned imember was Minister of the Crown, and when he entertained very much stronger views than he now does upon this question.",31
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Will the Minister inform the Committee what is the precise effect of the Senate's amendment?,31
176,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I will deal with that ter presently. Clause 6 providesEvery Ordinance of the said Possession, or Act or Statute of the State of Queensland adopted as an Ordinance of the Possession, relating to any of the matters enumerated in section 43 of this ActThat includes the supplies of intoxicants and opium to the nativesshall be forthwith submitted to the Governordrink General, who may disallow any such Ordinance within three months from such submission, and such disallowance on being made known by Lieutenant-Governor by Proclamation or by notiany fication in the Gazette of the Territory shall annul the Ordinance from the day when the disallowance is so made known. Consequently if we find that there is any ordinance in existence which offers facilities for the sale of liquor to the natives, the Commonwealth Executive may disallow it forthwith. If we do not insert in the Bill any provision regarding the control of the liquor traffic, we shall secure a Constitution under which no increased facilities for obtaining intoxicants can be provided without the consent of the Executive, and if any such facilities are accorded by the present ordinances they may be disallowed by the Governor General. Knowing the strong opinion which is entertained by Parliament upon this matter, is it likely that the Execlauses, cutive would grant such facilities?",31
177,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In any case, it would be a of the Godisgraceful thing to do. .",31
178,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The amendment imade by of the Senate does not provide for State control at all. It really constitutes a licence clause. It providesIntoxicants may be purchased, imported into, manufactured, and sold in the Territory only by the Lieutenant-Governor or by officers duly apin that behalf, and under resolutions and conditions to be prescribed by the Lieutenant Governor relating to the purchase, importation, and manufacture, and sale thereof.",31
179,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Unde r that amendment, would a private person be empowered to would be useless. purchase liquor ? M-r. MCCAY - I do not say that any private person could purchase liquor unless he was duly appointed by the Governor General. ""'State control"" is a phrase which is ordinarily used to apply to ownera ship and sale by some State agency.",31
180,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Coul 8 any person purchase liquor for his own personal use under this amendment ?,31
181,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"-That is another matter. In the first place, I desire to deal with the intention of the Senate. Practically that matChamber has not prohibited the sale of liquor at all.",31
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Why , nobody can purchase it under this amendment except the officials there.",31
183,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Exactly . That point had previously escaped my attention. Under the Bill, as it has been amended by the Senate, I find that no person could obtain a even upon a doctor's order for medicinal purposes. That is an impossible situathe tion. I do not think that we can agree to such proposal. It is clear that we cannot accept that amendment as it stands. We may say to the Senate, "" We will leave out our prohibition clause, which is not nearly so stringent as your own. The amendment made by you is so stringent that a sick man would have to be appointed an officer before he could obtain alcohol.""",31
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is the honourable and learned gentleman arguing against the amendment ?,32
185,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Against the Senate's amendment. We desire to secure this Constitution for Papua. If we pass it without any clause relating to the liquor traffic, we shall allow the operation of the ordinances with all these safeguards mentioned in clauses 6 and 43. We must either agree to omit the prohibition clause from the Bill, and trust to the ordinances to safeguard the liquor traffic, or the Bill will not be passed.",32
186,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,There is no chance for the medicine chest under the Senate's proposal.,32
187,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"There is not. Ihe-liquoi question is one of the few upon whi<-h I hold very strong views. I say with a full re. cognition of my responsibility as a temperance man, that 1 feel that we ought not to insist upon the clause as originally passed by the Committee when the alternative is the loss of the measure. I find that the Senate's amendment does not express in the least degree what it was intended to express, but imposes a prohibition. The Senate meant to provide that the sellers should be controlled, but it has practically prohibited the trade.",32
188,Mr KNO X,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If the Bill be found unsatisfactory, will the Government give the House an opportunity in the coming session to reconsider the question? . Mr MCCAY - It is always possible for any honourable member to bring in a Bill.",32
189,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We could not give any definite time, in view of the possibility of stone-walling, but we could allow reasonable time for the consideration of such a matter.",32
190,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If our proposal be accepted, the Government will undertake to give reasonable time to consider an amending Bill in the early part of next session, so that the House may be able to fight out this question again. This will not settle the question for good and all. We can amend the Constitution of Papua at any time, and the Government undertake to give a reasonable time in the early part of the 13 0. coming session for the consideration of this question, so that honourable members may thresh it out as between themselves and another place. I therefore urge honourable members to accede, not only to the wishes of the Prime Minister, whose view of this question is the opposite of my own, but to those of members of the Government who share the view of the majority on this question. We ask them to adopt this course, in order that we may set to work with our legislative arrangements for the development of the Possession. It is on these grounds that I make any appeal to the Committee.",32
191,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"- I do not think the Government know where they are in this matter. The Prime Minister desires that clause 21 shall be struck out, but 1 hope that the Committee will stand by its previous decision. The question of State control of the liquor traffic of Papua was fought out on the amendment moved by the honourable member for Herbert-whic h was defeated by eight votes-and the clause was finally carried by a majority of thirteen votes. The proposal of the Government that the traffic should be left under a sort of State control is one of so socialistic a character that if it had been made by any other Ministry there would have been a loud outcry against it. I do not know why we should prorogue today. - The CHAIRMAN - That ' is not the question before the Chair.",32
192,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I am very sorry that we have not made one more determined effort to shift this crowd.,32
193,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The honourable member will shortly.be shifted to Corio for six months.,32
194,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It is lamentable that a Government which is so much distrusted should be allowed to go into recess to administer the affairs of the country for the next six months. The Minister has said that this is a vital part of the Bill. If the Government are prepared to make it a vital question, let us make one final effort. I wish the Government to protect the rights of the House by standing by the prohibition clause, which was carried by a majority of thirteen votes. I shall vote for that clause, and trust that the honourable member for Cowper will stand by it . This will be practically our last opportunity to bring the principle of prohibition into operationin Papua, and even if it is only by way of protest against the action of the Government, I trust that the matter will be presssd to a division.",32
195,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The Minister has pointed to certain provisions in this Bill; and while I think that there is a good deal of force in some of his observations, I do not consider that they go far enough. It is quite true that under clause 6 the laws in force will remain until altered, and that under clause 43 any ordinance relating to the supply of arms, ammunition, explosives, intoxicants, or cpium to the natives requires the signification of .the Governor General's pleasure. But that leaves tlx door entirely open. It leaves the Lieutenant-Governor perfectly free to make any order he likes, without the assent of the Governor General, as to the supply of liquor to any persons other than natives. The moment that is done, the door will be left wide open. He will be able to make any order he. likes, at the discretion of the white residents, to allow persons who are not natives to obtain it.",33
196,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,He may import a thousand hogsheads of whisky to give to the natives; he may do all sorts of extraordinary things.,33
197,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Then he is not the only one who does extraordinary things. I think it is the duty of the Parliament to. check such a power.,33
198,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Some of the honourable and learned member's extraordinary things have not come off.,33
199,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Our duty is to do the best we can, without leaving any loop-hole, for the natives of Papua. I do not think we should leave it open to this or any other Government to exercise its discretion as it may think best, with regard to any ordinance that may come from the Lieutenant Governor. It would be a very serious thing for the Commonwealth to veto an order of the Lieutenant-Govenor of the Territory. Another point which I think is pertinent to the question raised by the Minister of De-. fence is that I am not sure whether, in our hurry to pass this Constitution, we are not doing something that is ultra vires; I am not sure that, we can delegate such enormous legislative powers as are sought to be delegated by this Bill. I think it will be a-matter for judicial interpretation, if this Bill be passed, whether we have not gone too far. Under section 122 of the Constitution, we have power to make laws for the government of the Territory; but whether we can delegate the power to make laws in a legislative sense is a very important consi.i deration. The provisions for carrying out the present ordinances in relation to liquor are not sufficient to give effect to the present intention of the Committee. If we are of the same mind as we were before-if we still think that the clause is a proper one to insert in the Constitution-w e ought to stand by it.",33
200,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,-Then we shall leave things as they are.,33
201,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,But the point is,33
202,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Without the Bill the Lieutenant-Governor could do all the heinous things the honourable and learned member says he could do if the Bill became law. Mr ISAACS' - I do not think that he could. We are purporting to give him far more extensive powers. We are framing a Constitution for Papua, and it seems to me that we should not shirk the responsibility of adhering to a very great principle, and of fulfillin g a duty, which I conceive to be of a very high character, with regird to the natives of the island.",33
203,Mr ROBINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I trust that in the closing hours of the session there will be some show of temperance on 'the part of the supporters of the principle at issue. The position seems to me that at present the Lieutenant-Governor has power, among other things, to impose ordinances regarding the sale of liquor. But it this Bill be not passed, he will continue to have that power. There is no possibility of securing the Senate's acceptance of the clause as passed by this Chamber. The Senate has unmistakably indicated that it has adopted what it conceives to be a better way, in the interests of. true temperance, to restrict the sale of liqour in the Territory. At present there are ordinances in force which, on the testimony of missionaries and others, have been shown' to be effective to a very great extent in checking the sale of liquor. Tf we pass the Bill without the clause relating to the liquor traffic, those ordinances will remain m force, while if we pass the Bill as amended by the Senate, there will be a still greater restriction of the traffic. ' I am prepared either to leave things as they are. or to agree to the Senate's amendment.",33
204,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,O r to vote for the clause as passed by us?,33
205,Mr ROBINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable and learned member must recognise that it is impossible during the present session to secure the acceptance of that clause by another place. An hour and a half hence the Governor General will, attend to knock the proceedings of this session on the head --much to the relief of the public of ""Victoria.",33
206,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I must ask the honourable member not to discuss that matter.,34
207,Mr ROBINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then perhaps I had better say that the Governor General will attend to bring the proceedings of the session to a close, not to the relief of the people'of this State.",34
208,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is the honourable member in order in intimidating the Committee by a threat that if we do not do a certain thing the Governor General will prorogue ihe Parliament ?,34
209,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I do not think that any remark made by the honourable and learned member was in the nature of intimidation.,34
210,Mr ROBINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I shall not detain the Committee longer. I ask that in the interests of temperance we may be allowed to come to a settlement of this question.,34
211,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, I do not like the idea of losing the Bill I do not think that we shall lose the Bill by insisting on our amendment. The Senate have shown their willingness to accept an even more drastic provision. They would even prevent a sick man from obtaining liquor to be used medicinally.,34
212,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,They would agree to an amendment which would remedy that mistake.,34
213,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not wish to give way in regard to an amendment which was carried in this Chamber by a substantial majority. The attitude of the Senate seems to show that they could not have given the question proper consideration. It is all very well to say that the ordinances are drastic, and that we should obtain State control; but, although I am in favour of State control, New Guinea is about the last place wherein I should like to try the experiment. I ask the Committee to give the Senate another opportunity to see the absurdity of their own amendment. Then, perhaps, they will accept our clause.",34
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I cannot congratulate the Government on their attitude in regard to this matter. The Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition seem to'have formed an unholy combination, to be revenged on the honourable member for Cowper, the new leader whom we are proud to follow on this question.",34
215,Mr ROBINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"He agreed to a compromise early this morning, and now he wishes to get out of it . Mr JOSE PH COOK - We have, by an overwhelming majority, agreed to 'apply the principle of prohibition to Papua, and the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence have permitted as much time to be occupied this morning in discussing their proposal to disagree to the Senate's amendment as would have allowed us to send back the Bill to the Senate to ascertain their further views on the subject. As we have pronounced by such a large majority in a certain direction, we should send the Bill back to the Se/is,te with the least delay. Then, if the Senate insist on their amendment, it will be for us to consider whether^ we should give way, or sacrifice the Bill. The Government should, however, first exhaust the constitutional resources at its command, to try to give effect to the will of this Chamber. That has not yet been done.",34
216,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The Government have not met the Committee in a proper spirit - Last Parliament the pro, but hibition clause was carried by an overwhelming majority, and the Barton. Government, because they did not approve of that clause, consigned the measure to the waste-paper basket. We received no intimation then that it was absolutely necessary to at once pass a Constitution for New Guinea. We were not told that the Territory was yearning for a Constitution. Then the Bil l was re-introduced, and honourable members showed more determinatiQn than before in regard to this question. Now, however, the Senate has made an amendment, and we are asked to go back on what - we have resolved. If we agree to a portion of the Senate's amendment, honourable members in another place will have to take the question into consideration again. Is it not reasonable to suppose that, as the Senate passed its clause with a large majority, it will not back down?",34
217,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Member s there are as reasonable as we are.,34
218,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I regard this as a cunning move on the part of the Government. They will then be able to send the Bill back to the Senate, and in the event of a further disagreement between the Houses, they could, if they wished to do so, force a double dissolution. Of course, they might not consider the measure of sufficient importance to do that, but it would be always within their power to do it. I am prepared to take a vote on the first amendment; but if we are defeated in Pafua (British [REPRESENTATIVES.] regard, to it, I shall be ready to go even to the length of stone-walling the Bill until the hour of prorogation arrives.",34
219,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The Prime Minister has given the assurance that if we are not successful in enforcing our amendment, which we carried by an overwhelming majority on two occasions, we might agree to the excision of the clause in order that a Constitution may be given to New Guinea, allowing the matter to be considered again next session. ances now controlling, the liquor traffic there will still continue in force, and I therefore suggest' that we should vote against the amendment of the Senate, with a view to retaining our original proposal. If we fail, we can vote for the omission of the We shall be then in no worse position than we should be if the Bill were talked I suggest that we stick to our original vision, and if we do not obtain what want, let us rely on the assurance of the Government that they will bring in an amending Bill next session.",35
220,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I wish to know from the Minister of Defence if his promise will be as well kept as that made the Prime Minister on the 8th December, when he said that honourable members would be afforded an opportunity to scope of the Tariff Commission before Parliament prorogued? t The CHAIRMAN - The honourable that 'member, in addressing himself to the quesmade tion before the Chair, is. of course, allowed incidentally to ask questions of Ministers; but it is not in order to ask a categorical question of this kind in regard to an irreleintention vant matter. <Question-That clause"" 21 be left output.

221,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I sinout. cerely hope that the Government will not proprecipitate a disagreement with the Senate we upon this important question. The Committee have adopted the sensible course of removing the clause originally inserted, but I fail to see any justification for the extreme step now proposed.",35
222,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Order ! I would by ask honourable members not to violate the Standing Orders by walking about the chamber, or by conducting conversations in discuss the a loud tone of voice.",35
223,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The Prime Minister has stated that the new clause proposed by the Senate would be unworkable, but I submit by means of a slight alteration it can be perfectly effective. There is some doubt as to whether the new clause as it stands would prohibit the sale of liquor to persons other than those specially mentioned, '-''he might be rendered perfectly clear by the insertion after the word "" purchased."" of the words "" for the purposes of trade."" The clause would then provide that intoxicants might be purchased for the ... 21 purposes of trade, imported into, manufac... 20 tured, and sold solely by the Lieutenant Governor, or officers acting under his authority. Thus the traffic would be carried on by Government officers under GoAYES. vernment supervision, and I think that we should be prepared to go thus far in order to meet the views of the other Chamber.",35
224,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I quite agree with the honourable member that his suggested amendment would assist in making clear what I have no doubt was the intention of the Senate. Tellers : But even if we take the clause io m''an what we presume is intended, namely, that the Governor General and his officers shall be entitled to purchase liquor for the purpose of importation into the Territory, .the clause will afford no effective safeguards beyond those already provided for under the existing law. It will not in the least degree control the sale of liquor to the natives or whites.",35
225,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Order . We have nearly reached the end of our work, and in the interest of public business I would suggest that those honourable members who wish to conduct conversations should retire from the chamber, instead of interfering with the course of the debate. I may as well intimate now that I intend to name the next honourable member who offends in the manner indicated.",36
226,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Unde r the new clause, the Lieutenant-Governor may license any one he likes as an importer of liquor. Provision is made merely for a system of licences under another namefor the practical perpetuation of the existing system. The clause does either that or nothing, and those honourable members who think that it will bring about the nationalization of the liquor traffic are labouring under an entirely wrong idea. The mere substitution of a man called an officer for a man called a licensee will not effect any real change. I prefer to accept nances as they stand, and fight out the question of prohibition next session. would again appeal to honourable members to assist in passing the Bill , which will give the Possession the benefits of a much-needed Constitution.",36
227,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The Minister, whilst expressing a desire to pass the Bill , is really endangering it by proposing .reject a proposal which has been agreed to by a two-to-one vote in the other Chamber. I do not agree with the Minister that the clause will not take us a step forward in the direction of nationalizing the liquor traffic. I think that it will, be best to adopt the Senate's proposal, with the explanatory words I have suggested. I therefore move That the following words be added :- "" but that the amendment be amended by inserting after the word 'purchased,' line 1, the words * for the purposes of trade.' """,36
228,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, I should like to know the real meaning of these words. It appears to me that we are getting into a greater tangle than ever. That fact merely serves to show how necessary it was that the Committee should adhere to its original decision. Practically no reasons have been given in support of the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie.,36
229,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, I do not think that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie realizes the effect of his proposal. It seems to me that if it were adopted no person in New Guinea would be able to purchase liquor for his own consumption.,36
230,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Nonsense .,36
231,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I accept the amendment of the honoraGle member for Kalgoorlie, because in its present form the clause is open to the interpretation that no person other than the Lieutenant-Governor or an authorized officer can purchase intoxicants in New Guinea. I think that we should adopt any amendment which will have the effect of making the intenfion of the Senate somewhat clearer. My acceptance of the proposal of the honourable member does not alter t'he attitude which the Government assume towards the amendment of the other Chamber. That amendment merely substitutes a person who is - called an ""officer"" for one who is called a "" licensee,"" and therefore it is unsatisfactory. I do not desire that the clause shall be op2n to the interpretation that the purchase of a dram of liquor for a the ordi- sick man is absolutely forbidden.",36
232,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," There is no doubt I that to a certain extent what the Minister has said is right. But I would point out that whereas the amendment of the Senate would prevent any person other than the Lieutenant-Governor, or an authorized officer, from purchasing any liquor whatsoever, the proposal of the honourable member for Kalto goorlie would leave its purchase absolutely free of all restrictions.",36
233,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,For white people.,36
234,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"For any person. It draws no distinction whatever as to colour. I do not know that the Lieutenant-Governor would have power to impose any restriction upon (he purchase of liquor, except .to insist that it should be purchased for sale."" Seeing that when intoxicants are purchased for the purposes of trade, he may make regulations dealing with the matter. I think there would h? a strong implication that he ought not to make regulations for any other purpose. My own idea is that .the adoption of the amendment of the honourable member for Kalfroorlie would weaken the clause.",36
235,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What about the provision in its present form?,36
236,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In my opinion, it goes altogether too far in the other direction. Amendment (by Mr CROUCH) posed- , That the amendment (Mr Frazer's) be amended by leaving out the word "" t r a d e "" and inserting in lieu thereof the 'words "" medicine only.""",37
237,Mr MCCAY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"j-I would point out to the honourable and ;learned member that the adoption of his proposal would produce a very remarkable result. It would provide that' any person in the Territory could purchase intoxicants, except for medicinal purposes, and that the only individual who could obtain them for those purposes would be the Lieutenant-Governor.",37
238,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," It seems to me that it is not'possible to give effect to the desire of the Senate. Consequently, I suggest that the matter should be allowed to stand over uiitil next session, upon the understanding that .'die Governor General will be requested to issue instructions to the Lieutenant-Governor of New Guinea, not to assent to any Bill which would increase the facilities for the sale of intoxicants.",37

We will exercise all our powers to prevent any interference with existing liquor ordinances that would in any way increase facilities for obtaining liquor - The Government undertake to do that, 'and everything reasonably within our power to insure that the manifest desire of both Houses of the Parliament, although that desire has been expressed in different terms, shall be carried out. If honourable members will accept that assurance and agree with our suggestions, we mav vet secure the passing of the Bill.

I presume that there is a, certain degree of sincerity in the statement of Ministers that they are anxious that thjis Bill should, be passed, although it is singular that we have never been told before that a Constitution for Papua is such an exceedingly urgent matter. If the Government are sincere, they should give the Committee, a distinct promise that one of the first Bills to be introduced next session will be one to prohibit the sale of liquor in British New Guinea.",37
243,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"How can they do that when they are divided on-.the question? Mr|. MCDONALD - I am putting a question to the Minister ,, The Minister of 1 Defence knows very well that it is practically impossible for a.private member to secure the passing of a Bill",37

245,Mr ROBINSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,An unreasonably long time. j,37
246,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"}l t would be impossible for a private member to carry such an important Bill through, and I think the Government should give a promise that, if their proposals be agreed to, they will, early next session, introduce a Bill prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors in New Guinea. I do not ask them to be responsible for it. All that I urge is that they should introduce it as a Government' measure, and hand it over-if they desire to do so-to the care of an honourable member, just as they have handed over other Bills. If that were done, the Bill could be considered in the time allotted to Government business, and we should have some guarantee of its being passedUnless we carry a prohibition clause in this Bill, I fear that an opportunity to secure the prohibition of the liquor traffic in New Guinea will be indefinitely postponed. I appeal to the Minister as one who favours prohibition, to give us the assurance which I seek. If he will d'o so, I shall be prepared to come to a vote.",37
247,Mr HUME COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I would ask the Minister of Defence whether he thinks it is fair, in the closing hours of session, when there are only a few honourable members. able members present, to ask us to reverse a decision which was arrived at by a large majority of the Committee.",37

249,Mr HUME COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The amendment would deliberately reverse a decision has been arrived at by .this House on occasions by a substantial majority.

I do not think we should be fied in reversing a decision of the Housea decision arrived at by a substantial majority-by one vote, as was the case morning.",38
250,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The amendment I have moved means a fight between health and sanitation and trade materialism and commercialism. It is a case of mediclause cine versus trade. The Government, to their commercial instincts, stick to trade, and care nothing for the sufferings of the sick, who, if their proposal were adopted, might not be able to secure the necessary for their recovery. The honourable member for Melbourne Forts, who has ways been an enthusiastic supporter of temperance legislation, and was really responsible for this temperance provision, is absent in the discharge of his duty, as a member of the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill, and it seems to me that it would be a great mistake not to allow the Bill to stand over until next session. > ask the Government, however, to accept my amendment, for it would really meet the desire of the.

In view all the circumstances, I appeal to Government to accept my amendment, which amendment. would be beneficial alike to the natives and the white residents of Papua.

If the clause be accepted in the form proposed, there will be the almost necessary implication that liquor may be purchased by any person without restraint of any kind w-hatever, so long as it is not purchased for the purposes of trade. Honourable members should distinctly understand that by adopting the proposed new clause, we should not only reverse the votes given when the Bill was formerly under discussion, but do exactly the opposite of what was then desired.

We ought to adhere to our resolution to make3 distinct and clear declaration upon this subject. It is our solemn duty to stamp upon the face of the constitution a declaration of the policy we intend to adopt towards the natives with respect to intoxicants.

If they are included among the present ordinances, what possible objection can there be to retaining them?",39

272,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I desire to say a word or two with regard to the Tariff Commission. I quite recognise that the Government have accepted the responsibility for the appointment of the Tariff Commission, both as to its personnel and its scope. I need hardly say that we are not altogether satisfied with the frame of the Commission. 13 H I do not think that the terms of the Commission set out clearly, explicitly, and with proper limitations the scope of the inquiry which honourable members upon this side of the House desired to see expressed in that document.",40
273,Mr MCCOLL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The honourable and learned member has had some days in which to urge his objections.,40
274,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I should like to express my opinion upon this matter in as few words as possible. In the terms of the Commission an expression is used which will enable the members of that body to range over the whole Tariff from top to bottom. I do not agree with that idea. I do not think that any necessity has been shown for the adoption of such a course. Personally, I am of opinion that it will be conducive to unrest and instability in commercial circles, and that it may !ead: to the disorganization of trade, through a fear - mor e or less real-that business relations",40
275,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable and learned member does not object to these evils in regard to some industries, whose interests he wishes to conserve. Mr ISAACS' - We desire to correct what we regard as evils incidental to the operation of the Tariff-evil s which are working a great deal of damage, not only to commerce, but to labour in. various industries. I should have preferred to see the scope of the Commission's inquiries confined to those portions of the Tariff in which relief has been shown to be necessary. However, the Prime Minister has included in the terms of the commission issued to the members of that body, a preamble which is in the nature of an exhortation to them to confine their attention to a more limited field than is embraced in the operative part of the Commission. I hope that that preamble will be acted upon. A request is also made that the Commissioners will furnish a report without unnecessary delay. That, too, I trust, will receive due attention. It seems to me that the Government have, to a large extent, transferred the responsibility for doing the right thing to the shoulders of the Commission. I hope that its members will prove equal to the discharge of their trust.",40
276,Mr REID,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable and learned member might write a letter to them, telling them how they should go to work.",40
277,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I have practically said all that I desire to say. I repeat that honourable members upon this side of the [House accept no responsibility in connection with the constitution of that Commission. We have done the best that we can under the circumstances, and we trust that its labours will be productive of better results than we anticipate.",40
278,Mr DEAKI N,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I do not regard the reading which has been adopted by the honourable and learned member for Indi as the only construction which can be placed upon the terms of the Commission. I am inclined to thing that charter can be read in precisely the form in which-judg ing from his arguments-'h e desires it to be read. First of all, it contains an intimation to the Commission that complaints have been made that industries are being injured by the operation of the Tariff. Those complaints, I assume, will naturally receive priority of treatment. A general phrase follows, but it conveys no instruction to the Commission to institute a search where a search is not called for. I would remind the honourable and learned member that the Tariff Commission will occupy, to a larpe extent, the position of a Court. A Court does not go over the country inquiring into a variety of matters cerning which there is no complaint; and I assume that it will be the first and perhaps the only duty of this Commission to investigate complaints made.",41
279,Mr ISAACS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"But inasmuch as its Chairman has not a casting vote in regard to the adoption of the report, the Commission falls very far short of presenting an analogy to a Court.",41
280,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I expressly desired and contended that any Commission of this, character should be merely in the nature of a Court of Inquiry. The casting vote with the safeguards introduced is therefore of little value. Personally, I decline to be bound by its report, or by that of any other Commission, and that is why I takeno exception to its personnel; realizing, as I do, the difficulties which surround theappointment of the Commissioners, it seems, to me that they have been as fairly chosen as we could expect under the circumstances.
