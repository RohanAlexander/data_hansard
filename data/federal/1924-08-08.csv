In committee: - (Consideration Senate's amendments).",13
13,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Cowper-Trea surer) [11.6] - I move That the amendments be agreed to. The schedule of the amendments, which is in the hands of honourable members, seems rather formidable, but the majority of the alterations are consequential upon two or the© important ones. The principles of the bill have not been really altered since the measure was considered by this chamber. Most of the amendments were moved by the Government ^ for the express purpose of making the bill clearer, or of assisting the bank to exercise its functions as a central bank during the early stages of the re-organization. Another place decided by fourteen votes to eight to leave out the provision for the appointment of local boards, whioh was in the bill when it left this chamber. As the alteration is not in any way vital, the Government has accepted it . The only local board which the Government contemplated - appointing immediately waa to be located in Melbourne.",14
14,Mr MAKIN,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,Where the board of directors of the bank would meet?,14
15,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"The board of directors will meet in Sydney, where the bank has its headquarters. torate will now have full power to exercise such functions as were proposed to be assigned to the local boards. hoped that the board of directors may see its way clear to meet in Melbourne occasionally for the purpose of coming into contact with the controlling authorities of the private banking institutions here. Although the head offices of the various private banks are distributed among the state capitals, most of them are in Sydney and Melbourne. The Senate left out the word "" l e n t "" inclause 5 and inserted "" granted,"" in order to make it quite clear that the £6,000,000, which is to be given to the bank by - the Treasurer as capital, is not to be repaid. D u r in g the debate on the measure in this chamber I stated in reply to remarks by the Leader of the Opposition that the intention of the Government was that this £6,000,000 should be contributed to the bank by the Treasury in practically the same way as private shareholders contribute the capital of of private - banking companies, the only difference being that shareholders of private institutions receive dividends on their permanent investment, and the Government will receive on this £6,000,000, only "" a rate of interest equivalent to the effective rate of interest payable by the Commonwealth on the loan raised for the purpose."" The profits of the bank are, of course, to be apportioned equally between its reserve f u n d and the National Debt Sinking Fund. The National Debt Sinking Fund will gradually extinguish the loan raised for the purpose of providing this £6,000,0000, and then the Commonwealth Government will be in the position of ordinary shareholders. This amendment will, to a large extent, meet the objections raised by honourable members of the Opposition on the manner in which the Government proposed to create the capital of the bank. It will also give a greater sense of security to depositors; though, of course, the bank would be absolutely secure in any case, for the whole Credit of the Commonwealth is behind it . Buthad this amendment not been made there might have been a fear in some quarters that the bank would be obliged to repay this amount, and that that obligation would take precedence over the other liabilities of the institution, which was never The direc- intended. Another important amendment relates to the appointment of the board of directors. When the bill left It is this chamber it provided that the board of directors should include(b) two persons who are or have been associated with manufacturing industries or commerce; (c) two persons who are to have been associated with agricultural, pastoral, or other primary industries; and (<i) two persons who bave a knowledge of currency and are declared by the Governor General to have 'been chosen because of that knowledge. The other place deleted those sub-clauses, nnd inserted the following: (6) six other persons who are or who have been actively engaged in agriculture, commerce, finance, or industry. It will be noted therefore, that all reference to persons with a knowledge of currency is removed. The amendment will tend to reduce the danger of making in vidious distinctions in appointing the directors, and it will somewhat widen the scope of the Government's choice, for it gives a much more general power than did the former provision. I do not think honourable members will offer any objection to it . Another important amendment has relation to the control of the note issue. When the bill lef t this chamber, it contained a provision that any decision of the board which affected the Note Issue' Department of the bank should not be effective unless the directors who voted for it included two. of the following directors, namely, the Governor, the director who is the Secretary to the Treasury, and the directors appointed on account of their knowledge of currency. The amendment provides that any decision of the board respecting the note issue shall be effective if Six directors vote for it at a meeting at which all the directors are present, or five directors vote for it at a meeting from which any of the directors are absent. The Government considers that this provision contains adequate safeguards, and also removes a possible source of discord and trouble in connection with the in ternal working of the board. It will be realized that some such safeguard is necessary. In the Bank of France, three censors,, who have no vote in ordinary matters, must agree unanimously to any proposed alteration in the note issue before it can be effective. Another alteration made in another place will meet with the approval of the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes) in particular. The provision that, in appointing the board of directors the Government should, as far as possible, give due consideration to the fair representation of the geographical divisions of the Commonwealth, has been deleted. It was thought that the provision in the bill might l i m it the clioice of directors. The deletion of the words will relieve the Government of the necessity of keeping geographical divisions in mind when making appointments to the directorate, and will enable it to appoint the best men obtainable; but uo government, in making such appointments, would disregard the claims of the various states for fair representation, if that could possibly be arranged. Indeed, a direction from Parliament to consider state representation may be regarded as unnecessary. There are some consequential amendments to this clause, and the following new section is proposed to be inserted after section 1 2 A : 12AA -(1. ) There shall be a.Board of Advice in London hereinafter called the London Board. (2./ The London Board shall consist of three members to be appointed by the Governor General upon the recommendation of the Board of Directors. (3.) The members of the London Board shall, subject to this Act, hold office for four years and be eligible for re-appointment. (4.) The duties and powers of the London Board shall be such as may be delegated to it from time to time by the Board of the Bank. The amendment aims at giving the bank the benefit of the advice of financial experts in London in the flotation of loans, and the transaction of other business there. The Government recommends the acceptance of the amendment as it will assist the bank to function efficiently. Section 1 2 B is lef t out because it refers to the appointment of local boards of advice. In section 13, the words "" the ' London B o a r d "" have - been substituted for "" a local board.''"" That alteration is consequential. There is another amendment that prepares the way for words indicating how members of the board in London shall be remunerated. It"" leaves out the words, "" By way of salary at the rate of Two hundred pounds per annum,"" and substitutes "" as is fixed by the Governor General on the recommendation of the Board - of Directors."" The next eight amendments are entirelyconsequential ancl verbal alterations. The next I have already explained. The following amendment deals Will the appeal board. The Senate seeks to leave out sub-section 3 of the proposed new sub-section 1 6 B , and to insert the following new sub-sections :(3.) The Board shall refer the appeal to an Appeal Board consisting of three members, one of whom shall be appointed by the Board and one of whom shall be elected by the officers of the Bank in the manner prescribed, with an independent Chairman appointed by the Board. (4.) The Appeal Board shall consider any appeal referred to it under this section and shall submit its Teport thereon to the Board, which shall determine the appeal and notify the appellant of its determination, which shall be final and conclusive. That amendment amplifies and defines the rights of appeal of servants of the bank. A new elause proposed to be in serted after clause 11 makes a verbal amendment that was overlooked in the drafting of the bill ; the word "" G o vernor"" is struck out and the word "" Board "" substituted for it . The next amendment prepares the way (for the addition of new sub-clauses to clause 16. At the end of clause 16, a proviso that was urged in this Committee by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) has been inserted. It provides that Australian notes shall not be issued to the bank without the approval of the Treasurer. That will give the community an assurance that the bank will not, without the approval of the Government, issue notes to itself to meet its necessities and the circumstances of the moment. The Government is quite certain that such an amendment will not in any way affect the efficiency of the bank, and therefore recommends its acceptance. The following new clause has been inserted after clause 16:16A. After section 60o of the principal Act, the following section is inserted:60OA. The Board may issue Australian notes to the Bank or to other banks in Australia in exchange for money or securities lodged with the London branch of the bank. It will be noticed that the board "" may "" issue notes. The provision is not mandatory in any way. I expressly dealt with this point in my second-reading and I thought I had made it clear to every one that the bank has the power referred to. The Notes Board has the right to hold securities in Australian Government stock, British Government stock, and bills of exchange not exceeding 120 days against its gold. The amendment of the Senate is designed to make it clear to those who read as they run that the Bank Dr Earle Page. has this power. In my speech on the second reading of the bill, I said:Consideration of these possibilities will show that the Central Bank must not be directed to provide exchange at any particular rate or to issue notes for English money, and vice versa, up to any amount which the banks or the public may apply for. Unfettered discretion must be given to the Central Bank, in order that disturbances shall beavoided as far as possible. The amendment does h o t alter the powers of the Bank, but merely defines them. There is another amendment made by the Senate that was suggested by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory). The present act provides that the control of the note ' issue may, by proclamation, be transferred from the bank to the Treasurer. What the Government suggests is that that power should reside in Parliament, and not in the hands of the Government of the day. Should it be necessary 'to restore the power of control over the note issue to the Government, the conditions would be sufficiently urgent to necessitate the calling together of Parliament to discuss, the facts. The next amendment leaves out the date "" the 31st January, 1925,"" in clause 17, and in serts "" a date to be fixed by proclamation."" The banks are willing to adjust their balances by cheques drawn on the Commonwealth Bank, but they point out that their present clearing house arrangements are such that it may not be possible for them to make the necessary alterations by the 31at January, 1925. If the date is fixed by proclamation, they will be able to effect the reform before the date is proclaimed..",14
16,Mr GABB,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,Does that mean that the alteration will be postponed indefinitely?,16
17,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"No . The Government will get busy as soon as the bank commences to function as a central bank. In sub-section 7 of the proposed new section 60AD, it is desired to insert after the word "" public "" the words "" and speech, allows interest thereon."" The sub-section - reads(7.) In this section the word -""-Bank"" means a person or corporation carrying on the business of banking, and includes any person or corporation which receives deposits from the public, and which is proclaimed by the Go-vernor-General to be a bank for the purposes of this section. That phraseology could be construed to apply to a co-operative store, in which a man places £100, and gradually takes it out in groceries. The amendment will avoid any possibility of vexation to such companies, which are further safeguarded by the power given to the Governor General to proclaim what are banks for the purpose of the section. A co-operative society that pays interest would not be proclaimed, but some means must be provided to make certain - of getting statistics from those institutions that should supply them. The last amendment of the Senate deletes from clause 18 the proposed new section inserted by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), and accepted by the Government. The proposed new section refers to the relations between the bank and its architects. The Senate felt that it was too small a provision 'to make in the bill, and would give an instruction to the directors in a . matter that should be lef t to"" their own judgment. amendment is not of such importance that we should risk on it a conflict between the two Houses. I have taken this course of placing the whole of the amendments before the committee in globo because few of them are important, and many are merely consequential. Honourable members will have an opportunity of saying whether they prefer to discuss the whole of the amendments at once, or to deal seriatim with the more important.",16
18,Mr WATKI NS,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Newcastle) [""11.81] The bill contains eighteen clauses, and the Senate has made no fewer than 33 amendments which have absolutely recast it . Yet we are coolly asked to deal with the whole of those amendments on one motion.",17
19,The CHAIRMAN,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM," As some of the amendments are likely to be discussed, I shall put them seriatim. """,17
20,Mr WATKINS,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"I suggest that the Treasurer should postpone the consideration of all the amendments u n t i l - the next meeting of the House. Senate's amendment to clause 4 agreed to. Clause 5Section 9 of the principal act is repealed, and the following section inserted in its stead:""9 -(1. ) The capital of the bank shall be Ten million pounds, consisting of the following:(6) Such sum not exceeding Six million pounds as is lent to the bank by the Commonwealth from moneys borrowed by the Commonwealth in pursuance of this act; and Senate's Amendment - Leave out "" lent"" in paragraph (6), and insert "" granted '>. M o t i o n (by Dr EARLE PAGE) proposed - That the amendment be agreed to.",17
21,Mr LAZZARINI,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Werriwa) |""11.33]. - The Treasurer has stated that the money to be furnished to the Commonwealth Bank by the Treasury will be similar to.a subscription of capital to a limited liability company, and the Commonwealth as a shareholder in the bank will Teceive interest at the bank's current rate. The proposed amendment is a The mere side-stepping of the issue.. The vital money advanced by the Treasury is to be merely a 'loan on which the bank will have to pay interest, and there is no analogy between such a loan, or grant, or whatever it may be called, and the contribution of the capital to a limited liability company, the shareholders of which may, or may not, receive profits. The profits of the bank should first be utilized to liquidate its indebtedness to the Treasury. The Senate has practically recast the bill , and one feels entitled to ask for an opportunity to make another second-reading speech upon it . The majority of the amendments have been made in the interests of the associated banks, at the instance of their champion, Senator Greene. He admitted that he was in constant touch with representatives of the associated banks. While the bill, as it lef t this chamber, was well designed to serve the interests of the money trusts, it is calculated to do so infinitely more effectively since Senator Greene has made his mark upon it . I protest against 'the Government placing an almost new bill before the committee, and suggesting that it should be accepted in globo. Such procedure is not - in the best interests of the country. This is the first occasion in my experience of parliamentary Ufe on which a government has tamely accepted radical alterations made in a bill by the Senate. The explanation is that this measure is drafted in the interests of the money trust.",17
22,Mr WEST,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"East Sydney) [11.37] No government has ever shown more in capacity and disregard of the people's wishes than has the present Government in connection with the bill now before us. The measure was rushed through this chamber with the aid of the guillotine, and for several days afterwards lay dormant. When it reached the Senate some persons, armed with a certain amount of information, and with perhaps more knowledge than the Government possessed, set about altering the bill to meet the wishes of the financial interests which support the Government. The Treasurer would be wise to agree to postpone this discussion in order to give honourable members an opportunity to study the effect of the amendments. It is indecent to ask the committee on Friday morning to hurriedly agree to 33 amendments of vital importance to Australia. The Treasurer has not attempted to explain the effects of the amendment to clause 5. What difference is made by the substitution of ' ' granted "" for "" lent ""? I understand a grant to be in the nature of a g if t , and a loan to imply an obligation to repay. Is money to be granted by the Treasury to the bank to be used as the directors think fit, and without any obligation to repay ? A loan is usually conditioned in regard to the application of the money and the period of repayment. Instead of granting money to the bank, would it not be better to merely lend capital to it , so that as it prospered it may be able to repay the Treasury, and rely upon.its own resources? The clause, &s amended by the Senate, means that £6,000,000 is to be granted by the Treasury to the Commonwealth Bank. I doubt if even a legal member of the committee can explain what is meant by the word ""-granted "" as it is employed in this clause. An y amendment proposed in this Parliament by a member of the legal profession is usually to benefit in terests other than those of the general public. There is no doubt that the effect of this amendment will be to benefit those who, under the bill, will come into close association with the Commonwealth Bank. This should be the people's bank ",18
23,The CHAIRMAN,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM, The honourable member must not make a second-reading speech.,18
24,Mr WEST,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"The amendment will have a far-reaching effect, and I contend that the committee should be informed of the true position.",18
25,Mr HUBBY,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Does the honourable memberthink that there is any real difference between the words "" lent "" and "" granted ""?",18
26,Mr WEST,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"There is a serious difference. The alteration will not benefit the business of the bank. I should certainly support any amendment that would i m prove the bill, and I should like to know whether the Parliamentary Draftsman has revised this measure since it left another place.",18
27,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,The Government has been in continuous touch with the Parliamentary Draftsman.,18
28,Mr WEST,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"I ask the Treasurer to give a reason for the amendment. This is virtually a money bill, as it deals with finance, revenue, and the note issue. The spirit of the Constitution throws upon this chamber the responsibility for any amendment of the bill.",18
29,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,The Government suggested this amendment to make clearer the purpose of the bill.,18
30,Mr WEST,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"It is an unwarranted alteration, and the Government's action will not be appreciated by the people.",18
31,Mr WHITSITT,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Darwin) [11.54] - I think that I may ease the honourable member's mind if I explain why the word "" g r a n t e d "" should be substituted for the word "" l e n t . "" Unless this money is granted to the Commonwealth Bank for an indefinite period, how can it regulate its business ? If the period were fixed at, say, twenty years, the bank would be responsible for the return' of the money borrowed at the end of that period. If the money were lent only for a certain period, how could the bank finance individuals, aid the struggling settlers, or even conduct its own business ? Money is subscribed for an indefinite period to the associated banks"" by their shareholders. The Commonwealth Bank should have the same security in regard to its capital in order to compete with the other banks. Therefore, the word "" granted "" should be substituted for the word "" lent.""",18
32,Mr R GREEN,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Eichmond) [11.55] I have obtained Webster's Dictionary to ascertain the difference between the words "" l e n t "" and "" granted,"" which words affect, not only this amendment, but also others that are consequential. The intention of the Government is to make the sum of £6,000,000 available as capital to the Commonwealth Bank. Paragraph b of proposed new section 9, clause 5, as amended, readsSuch sura not exceeding £6,000,000 as is granted to the bank by the Commonwealth from moneys Iborrowed by the Commonwealth in pursuance of this act. Sub-clause 4 of proposed new section 10 has been amended to provide that the bank - shall pay interest on the grants made to it by the Commonwealth. The original word was "" loans "" and not "" grants."" Webster's definition of "" lend "" isTo allow the custody and use of, on condition of the return of the same; to grant the temporary use of; to allow the possession and use of, on condition of the return of an equivalent in kind; as, to lend money or some article of food. From that definition it is evident that this money has to be returned at some future period. The clause as originally drafted would have given the Commonwealth Bank an opportunity to return the money whenever possible. The following is the definition of the word ""grant,"" using the substantive and not the verb:The act of granting; a bestowing or conferring; concession; allowance; the yielding or admission of something in dispute; the thing or property granted; a gift; a boon. There is certainly a distinct difference between the two words. Under the amendment the Government will make to the bank a g if t of £6,000,000 for which it must pay interest at the rate equivalent to the effective rate of interest - payable by the Commonwealth on the loan raised for the purpose. This is not the right procedure to follow. The clause should stand as originally drafted. A loan to the bank implies that the money, or an equivalent, has to be returned at some future period. We are asked to grant this money as a loan, but a grant is not a loan. As I think that the word "" g r a n t "" would be incorrectly used in this clause, I cannot support the amendment.",18
33,Mr DUNCAN,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"HUGHES (Boothby) [12.1] - Since honourable members have raised this discussion on the meaning of the words "" lend "" and "" grant,"" I should like to give some details from Murray as to the meaning of the word ""grant."" I am not confident that the use of the word "" granted "" in this connection is correct, though it is probable that in the circumstances its use is preferable to the use of the word ""lent."" I doubt whether it is possibleto make a grant which is subject to the payment of interest. Murray gives as his third definition of the word "" grant. "" An authoritative bestowal or conferment of a privilege, right, or possession; a gift or assignment of money, &c, by the act of an administrative body or of a person in control of a fund or the like. He gives an example of the use of the word in Green's Short History - of the English People as follows: The Commons restricted their grant of certain Customs duties . . . to a single year. According to Murray, in law, the word "" grant "" meansA conveyance by deed or other written instrument- (b) Formerly in more restricted application. A conveyance of such property (viz., incorporeal hereditaments), as can pass only by deed. To be or lie in grant (of property) to be of a nature transferable only by deed. Dealing with the word "" g r a n t as a v verb, Murray's fifth meaning isTo bestow or confer (a possession, right, &c.), by a formar act. Said of a sovereign or supreme authority, a eourt of justice, a representative assembly, &c. Also in Law to transfer (property) from oneself to another person, especially by deed. The point may not be of the greatest i m portance, but I find nothing in Murray's definitions to suggest that it is possible to make a grant of the nature proposed, which under sub-section 4 of proposed new section 10 will be liable to the payment of interest. I know that some honourable members are not very particular in the use of correct English, because they have proclaimed themselves in favour of a "" compulsory franchise,"" which is a contradiction in terms. They therefore may not regard this matter as one of very great importance. As interest is payable upon this money it is not a grant, but in virtue of the circumstances the use of "" granted"" in this case is preferable to the use of the word "" l e n t ."" I still think, however, that "" g r a n t e d "" in this connection is not a correct English expression.",19
34,Mr WEST,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"East Sydney) [ 1 2 . 4 ] - I wish to move That the committee disagree with the Senate's amendment. I cannot say much more than I have already said on the question. I submit the amendment in order l h at the Treasurer may have an opportunity to say what he knows about the matter, and to explain why the substitution of ""granted"" for "" l e n t "" is proposed. Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [12.5]. - I do not see any reason why we should not agree to the substitution of the word ""granted"" for the word ""lent."" It seems to me that in the main what the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan Hughes) has said is correct. If we accept the suggestion of another place, and substitute "" granted "" for "" lent,"" we shall be giving a meaning to the word "" grant"" which has not yet been accepted by the best, authorities. But that the Government is proposing to give to the word "" grant"" a new meaning, which up to the present has not been acknowledged, is no reason why we should' not accept the amendment, because Ministers have done many things unique in the history of government, and we expect them to do more. There is no reason why they should not coin a new meaning for an old word. I know that the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) whilst going through his academic 'course in the Sydney University gave some very excellent; if unique, translations of phrases in other languages, and there is no reason why, having added to the accepted meaning of words in foreign tongues,' he should not give to words of the English language meanings which have not up to the present been identified with them. For this reason I accept the amendment. Whether we use the word ""granted"" or the word ""lent,"" as originally proposed, provided we do not make any alteration in the conditions of the ""grant "" or "" loan,"" we shall make no alteration in the bill. We therefore need not quibble over the substitution of one word for another. The interpretation of the bill will depend upon the conditions, and not upon the use of a particular word in this case. Possibly the time may come when My/tray, or some such authority; having seen the word ""grant"" used in this connection will accept the use of the hew meaning now proposed to be given to it, and will quote the Treasurer as his authority.",19
35,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Cowper-Trea surer) [12.8] - The amendment of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. West),, being a direct negative of the motion, is out of order; the proper course for him to take is to vote against the motion. The use of the word "" granted "" in this connection has been adopted for a special reason. Despite the remarks of my old schoolmaster, the honourable member for Barton (Mr F. MCDonald), whether the use of the word in this connection is correct or not, the word has been so used before by this House. It was so used in connection with the grant of £500,000 for main-road development. That was a grant made on certain conditions, for instance, that the State Governments should contribute £1 for £1 to the purpose for which it was made. We have made certain grants of money for the relief of unemployment, and granted loans on which interest has to be paid. The money which, under this Bill, it is proposed to allot to the Commonwealth Bank will be a grant under certain conditions. As I explained when introducing the Bill, it will be a grant to the bank as perpetual capital, but interest will have to be paid on it at the-rate at which the Commonwealth borrows the money for the purpose of making the grant. Every one wishes to see the Commonwealth Bank increase in credit, reputation, and prestige, and the main reason for the substitution of "" granted "" for' "" lent"" is to remove beyond possibility any doubt which ! might arise in the public mind that the Commonwealth Government would have priority in a claim for this money over bank depositors. The public must feel that they will be in a preferential position if they deposit their money with the bank. For this reason, in the interests of the bank itself, the quibble regarding the use of the word ""granted"" should not be pressed. Even though the use of the word ""granted"" in this connection may not be entirely in accord with the opinion of authorities upon English, I think the amendment should be accepted.",20
36,Mr ANSTEY,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Bourke) [12.14] - I should not have risen if the word "" quibble "" had not been used. If the employment of one of these words rather than another is only a "" quibble,"" why has the time of this committee and of another place been wasted, over it ?- The officials, after three months' incubation, produced the word ""lent."" After the bill had been dealt with here it was sent to another place, where it was discovered that the word used should be ""granted."" Now we are told that that is only a quibble. Why has the Senate submitted about a dozen amendments if the difference between the words in the bill and those they wish to substitute is only that between tweedledum and tweedledee? I was myself of bpinion that that was about the difference between them until I heard the honourable member for Eichmond (Mr E . Green), quoting from about half a ton of dictionary that he had in front of him. Thereupon, to show that all the learning and erudition is not on the Government benches, I went to the Library and procured Eoget's Thesaurus, and I propose to set this author it y against those cited by the honourable member for Eichmond, the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan Hughes), and the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West). According to my authority, "" g r a n t "" means to credit, or trust. I suppose that if a man trusts me he will make me a grant, but if he lends to me, that is an entirely different proposition. The Thesaurus says that "" g r a n t "" imeans "" to give credit, to believe, to 'put one's trust in . "" No one would ; do that with the Government. repose implicit trust in ; to take one's word for . "" We know what the Treasurer previously said, and we have just heard what he says now. Can we then take his word for anything ? "" To place reliance on; to swear by."" I set this interpretation against that of the honourable member for Richmond. I decline l o be regarded as standing in the shadows of ignorance. My definition continuesThink, hold, take it ; opine, be of opinion, conceive, ween, trow, fancy, apprehend; have-, posedbold-, possess-, entertain-, adopt-, imbibe-, embrace-, get hold of-, hazard-, - an opinion. Half-way down the page we come to the adjectives. The use of adjectives in this chamber is deplorable. The definition readsBelieving, &c, v.:-Certain , sure, assured, positive, cock sureLike the honourable member for Richbe mond. The definition goes onConfiding, suspectless, unsuspecting, picious, void of suspicion, credulous"", [118] When we come to the adverbs, which are more important than the adjectives, the definition readsIn the - opinion, - eye, - of; me judice, meseems, - thinks; to the best of one's belief; I - dare say, - doubt not, - have no doubt, am sure; sure enough, 4c. (certainty); depend-, rely-, upon it; be-, rest-, assured; I'll warrant you, &c. (affirmation). Now, perhaps, honourable members understand what the Government means by "" granted."" But let us examine the Thesaurus definition of "" lent."" It is as follows:N., lending, &c; v., loan, advance, accommodation, feneration; mortgage, &c. (security), investment. Mont de pieti, pawnshop, my uncle's. Lender, pawnbroker, money lender, usurer. The definition of the verb readsLend, advance, accommodate with, lend on security; pawn, &c. (security). Intrust, invest;, place-, put-, out to interest; let, demise, lease, sett, underlet. The adjectives are "" lending, & c , v . ; leu I, &c, v . ; unborrowed, & c , "" and the adver'bi are "" in advance; on - loan, - security -"" W it h those words of wisdom added to the definitions already given, I am quite sure that honourable members now know the exact difference between "" l e n t "" and "" granted."" "" To Motion agreed to. Clause 6Section 10 of the principal act is repealed and the following section inserted in its stead:'' (4) The bank shall pay to the Treasurer, half-yearly, interest on the' amount due by the bank to the Commonwealth in respect of loans made in pursuance of this section."" Senate's Amendment - Leave out "" amount due by the bank to the Commonwealth in respect of loans,"" and insert "" grants "". Motion (by Dr EAELEPAGE ) proThat the amendment be agreed to.",20
37,Mr LAZZARINI,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Werriwa) [12.22]. - I move That the Senate's amendment be amended by adding after the word "" grants "" the following words:-""and the bank shall retain its profits to enable ihe bank to meet its interest obligations."" I wish to ensure that, in a time of difficulty, the bank shall not be obliged to pay out interest to such an extent that it will hampered in its operations. We know that, in spite of all the talk about the need unsusfor water conservation, and so on, by wedded to. honourable members who support the Nationalist and ©ounHry parties, Australia is subject to-drouglits. In a time ofdepres- 1 sion consequent upon a drought, - when if might be specially, desirable that the bank should assist the. producers,, it might be obliged, unless^ m$ amendment is adopted* to pay out to theTreasuxesla»gesums m interest which would otherwise be available to aidthe prod-ueers. We - shall' be wiseto freethe., bank from ' any such obligation. As this bill is designed absolutely in the interest? of the private hanking institutions, the adoption o£ my amendment is the more necessary. I am qrci'te convinced! that, if ' the Government ancl some of the private financial institutions' with: which, it is. in. close een.ta'ct, could compel the bank toclose itsdoors; they would be delighted to do so. I do not think that, they would hesitate to use any means that would bring about that end. I trust, therefore, that honoa?able meEabeiis who. really believe that the hank is: of benefit to fhecommunity will support my amendment, and so. afford the institution some security. DE. EAELE, PAGE' (Cowper-Trea surer) [12.28] - This matter has already been discussed and decided in this chamber. Clause 11 of the bill repeals section 30 of the principal act, and' inserts in its stead the following word's: ""30 - (1.)

The real security of the Commonwealth. Bank, lies in the fact that. a. provision, in the Bank Act makes the Gove.nnm.eiit. ultimately responsiblefor. the bank's liabilities.

38,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"He will not do that.  grave doubts about that, and I am sure the doubts of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) are graver still - By his meek acceptance of these amendments the Treasurer practically admits that a member of another place knows more about banking than do Ministers and the Treasury oflicials. The gentleman responsible for these amendments desired to embarrass the Treasurer rather than to assist the Commonwealth Bank, for it cannot be contended that they are calculated to promote the welfare of the institution. No honourable member will deny that the amendment now before the committee is infinitely worse than the original clause, bad though it was.",24
39,Mr WATKINS,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"The workers are not be represented on the board.  will bo no representation of the masses, who are the mainstay of a people's bank. The Government's acceptance of this amendment lends colour to the statement that the real desire of - Ministers is to hamstring the bank. The Government desires the Commonwealth Bank to be a bankers' bank only, and, therefore, it offers no protest against an amendment which makes possible the appointment of a board wholly representative of private banking institutions. Tho amendment is most dangerous. It is said that the directors are to receive about £ 5 0 per sitting on one day in the month, and they may do something which will bolster up their private interests to the infinite detriment of the Commonwealth Bank. I have a shrewd suspicion that the Government has already decided' who the directors shall be. The names of Sir John Higgins and Mr Edmund Jowett have been mentioned, and it is to be expected of the present Government that it will appoint only representatives of the wealthy classes. We may be certain that no working farmer will get a seat on the board; yet, a practical farmer making a living - from a small area would have a better idea of finance than would some wealthy squatter who was rich merely by inheritance. It is quite possible that the majorit y of 'these directors will know very little about finance. The Treasurer would not call in a barrister to set a broken l i m b; yet he is prepared to entrust the control of the bank's finances to men who are not qualified financiers. The desire of the Labour party was to have a board of three permanent directors who were full y qualified by m a n j years' experience of banking. The only men who will be able to administer the affairs of the bank successfully will be those who have given many years of study to the involved problems of finance. The amendment makes it possible for the directorate to consist of men having interests in private banking institutions and engaged in ordinary commerce, which does not necessarily give a knowledge of finance. Mr M . CAMERON - It is not likely that unqualified men w i ll be appointed.  it is possible, and if the honourable member does not wish that to be done he to should assist to have his ideas expressed in the bill. The Labour party's proposal to appoint a board of three permanent directors received cordial support in another place from ministerial adherents. ' Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.  tinctly dangerous to appoint to the board of directors men who have not the financial knowledge necessary to ensure the successful operation of the bank. An y young person desiring to become a doctor or a lawyer must spend years of study to fit himself for such an occupation. The intricacies of banking are just as great as those of the medical or legal profession. Yet under the amendment it is possible that men not qualified for the position may be appointed to the board of directors. An y road now open to such appointments should be effectively closed.",24
40,Mr JACKSON,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"The honourable member wanted to put a farmer on the board.  say that. I said that, if one of the directors were drawn from the landed interests, he should be a working farmer, and not a person representing the great pastoral industry who had merely in herited his wealth. I shall have no objection to persons from any industry being appointed to the board so long as they have the necessary qualifications.",24
41,Mr MAXWELL,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Does not everything depend upon the care with which these appointments are made?  so, but it is wrong to leave the door open for the appointment of unqualified men.",24
42,Mr JACKSON,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"I would remind the honourable member that the same was said of the Northern Territory Land Board.  same can be said of any board when proper safeguards are not provided. It is only fair to the bank and to the people of this country that all possibility of unjustified appointments should be removed. assurance should be given by the Government that the appointees shall be persons with banking and financial experience, wholly employed in the service of the bank, and free from outside influence. If a representative of any great section of the community is appointed, he will act more in the interests of those whom he serves than in the interests of the Commonwealth Bank and of the people of this country. It would be intolerable to have such men controlling the bank. If the bill, as amended by the Senate, is passed by this committee, the door will be open for the operation of outside influences. The position is serious. I am strongly of the opinion that those who inspired this amendment in another place were thinking more about embarrassing the Government than about the bank's interests. I do not wish to impute motives, but any one who has the interests of the bank at heart could not say that the amendment was designed in the interests of the bank. The board should be responsible to the bank, to the people, and to this Parliament, and not to powerful sections of the community. Dr EABL E PAGE - Does the honourable member think that a knowledge of our industries is a disqualification?  should.not object to the appointment of a farmer or a person engaged in any other industry, provided that he had a knowledge of finance and banking.",25
43,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Does the honourable member think that the Government will appoint any one who has not those qualifications ?  the intention of the Government to insist on these qualifications, we should make doubly sure by providing that persons appointed to the board must be permanently employed in the service of the bank. To give effect to the Labour party's original amendment, that there shall be three directors on the board including the Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury, I move That the words in paragraph b of the Senate's amendment be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :"" one other person who shall be. permanently employed in the service of the bank.""",25
44,Mr MANNING,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,Macquarie) [2.26] The honourable member for Hume (Mr . Parker Moloney) has given the committee The merely .a re-hash of what we heard for five and a half hours when the bill was previously before the committee.,25
45,Mr WATKINS,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,What does that matter ?,25
46,Mr MANNING,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"I admit that it does not matter to honourable members who are here with the one idea of blocking progress ; but it is a serious matter to those who realise their full responsibilities when an important measure like this is before them. I am i u complete accord with the honourable, member for Hume in that we should discuss these amendments on their merits. If we think that they are not in the best interests of the bank, we should not hesitate to ask the Senate to review its amendments. This is a matter of vital importance.",25
47,Mr WATKINS,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,The honourable member does not give other people any credit for holding that opinion ,25
48,Mr MANNING,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"I do; but honourable members opposite simply bring up matters that were discussed u n t i l left absolutely threadbare on two previous occasions. The honourable member for Hume takes great exception to the clause as framed, because of the possibility that a wrong person may be appointed. I would point out that we cannot prevent by legislation an act of folly by a Ministry, or by a Minister. We must rely on the Government appointing to ' the board persons who hold qualifications for the position.",25
49,Mr MAXWELL,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,It is impossible to make any act fool proof.,25
50,Mr MANNING,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"That is so, but the law can be framed so that under reasonable administration its purpose - will be carried out in the proper spirit. The original bill provided that certain industries were to be represented on the board. It is absolutely absurd to suggest that men connected with great industries have not some knowledge of financial matters. ,",25
51,Mr GABB,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,That was never stated.,25
52,Mr MANNING,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"- It was stated over and over again. That was the whole essence of the debate. The Senate's amendment has broadened considerably the scope of the bill, because the Government will now have the power to reject any person ""whom it thinks is unfitted for the position. In ' my opinion, Government will use that power sanely and reasonably. The honourable .member for Hume has said that a director - of the bank should have had special training in hanking. He has reminded us that members of the legal and medical professions require special training. If we were dealing with the appointment of the manager of the Commonwealth Bank, there would be a good deal of force in the honourable member's contention. To propose that the iGovernor of this .bank should be a man without years of banking training would be absurd. But we want .on the directorate of the bank men possessed of a wide knowledge of the conditions of the country, .because, with that .knowledge, they will be.'able to render invaluable assistance to the Governor in the .administration .of the bank'.s affairs. The directorate should not ;be. composed only of men with hanking training. Although I have every respect for the conservative way in which our banking institutions have acted in the past, it has been felt that they ;are sometimes too conservative, 'because those con-, trolling them have not the practical knowledge of the conditions of 'the country to enalfle them to acquire a complete grasp of all matters brought before them. T do not thirfk That the Commonwealth Bank will function fin the way it should, unless, for instance, it widens the field within which it makes advances. Unless we have on the - directorate men qualified TO advise Ihe Governor--of the hank, we shall hamper 'the institution instead of assisting it to extend its functions for 'the benefit of the country. 'The scope of the bank's operations wiil, I believe, be considerably - widened if - we have on the directorate men, not only of great finanrawfl - experience, 'but who will under stand the hnoad issues which w i i l be submitted ito them as directors ot - this institution . - Mr WATKIJiS (Newcastle) { 8 . 3 3 } have listened with interest to ithe speech df 'the honourable u&eimuber for Macquarie :(Mr Manning) - One - wonld think from his remarks that ths Coa»m6nw!ea3th Bank , is-fust begmjaing its history., .instead - of being an institution established for w m e years as .a people's bank, and one that has rendered' gneafc :service to the people of Australia. The institution has been carried on successfully so far, mainly by men trained im ks service. The honourable member desires that 'certain sections in the co-mmnnity shall be' represented' ;on the the directorate in the interests of ithe very persons who opposed the establishment-off the bank in the first instance.",26
53,Mr MANNING,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,The members <df the honourable member's party in the Senate desired to have - on Ithe directorate a 'representative of the employees.,26
54,Mr WATKINS,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"If you allow .the representation on the directorate of one interest you must allow the representation of all.

My reason w.as given in - my .speech on the second reading of the bill. .1 then expressed m y approval .generally of the principles of the .bill, and the .form o>f management proposed. A great deal at criticism has been levelled ;at the - management of currency matters in this country, based - upon the view taken by 'the Notes Issue Board. .1 ventuired, in .speaking - otn the second reading of the ibi'il, to join a minority in this chamber in saying .that I considered that the Notes Issue - I .Board had done right, and that the currency experts had acted - soaindly. I - was, - therefore, inatiarally pleased lat the direcitorate proposed for - the 'bank when the bill was .originally introduced. I believed that the bill..was carefully and thoughptf-ully drawn up, and was &ased .on - souad principles.' Apparently an influence opposed to a conservative control of currency has made itself felt in another place. I hold the belief that in currency and financial' matters conservatism is a sound policy. Lookingat it from every point of view, I can see nothing in the past policy of the Notes Issue Bqard that can - b: considered wrong. wrong only if it is looked at from the point of view of certain definite interests.

In another place the views of this House with respect to the directorate were adopted with the exception of the proposed inclusion; of currency experts. 1 agree that the interests referred to should have representation on the directorate, but the Senate's amendment, does not specifically definethe relative degree to which the influence of those in terests may be exerted. In that respect, I think the Senate's amendment is wrong. It has been rightly said that it is impossible to make a measure such as this foolproof, and in this connection everything vvill depend on the care exercised in the - appointment of the directors,. perfectly true, but by acting, carefully in the matter we may l i m it the area within which under this bill carelessness - can. be exercised and diminish, the evils which may follow from it . The original provision for the directorate was in my - opinion better than that now proposed, because it afforded less scope for a. departure from sound principles. The Senate's amendment camouflages the position because, while apparently the clause as amended by the Senate is intended to - convey the same idea as the clause as - originally introduced, it really does not - do so, in that it leaves so much latitude to those who will have in their hands the appointment of the directorate. I do> not - say this because of the objection urged by 'the honourable member for' Hume, because I do not agree that a working farmeris necessarily a financial expert.  so.",26
55,Mr LAZZARINI,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,No r is a successful squatter.,27
56,Mr MANN,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,Every consideration of the matter shows how complicated' and difficult financial and currency questions are. The clearest thinking is necessary to avoid pitfalls in considering them.,27
57,Mr WATKINS,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,That is all the more reason why trainedbankers should be on the directorate. It is considered Mr MANN - It is all the more reason why we should have currency experts on the directorate.,27
58,Mr WATKINS,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"-Ar c not omcers of the The Senate's bank, experts 2",27
59,Mr MANN,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,They are not necessarily currency experts. When the honourable member talks in that way he showsthat he does not understand what a currency expert is. Some of the views expressed ou the matter areinfluenced moreby the business requirements of private banks than by sound currencyconsiderations.,27
60,Mr WAT,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"KINS. - It isi practical, bankers who will have to c a r r j on this institution..",27
61,Mr MANN,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"The honourable member is one of those who say that theprivate banks are suspect, and should be distrusted, but he now says that they are the practical people who know what they are talking about. I do not know how he can claim consistency forthat - kind of argument, Mr WATKINS . - I referred to the officers of the Commonwealth Bank. That is Mr MANN - The honourable member is not fair. He has not been following my argument. I said that the demands with regard to currency, whichhave been the crux of the whole difficulty, have come not from the Commonwealth Bank, but from private banks;, and have been prompted as much by the immediate business requirementsof the banks as by sound currency considerations. That is why I am opposed to the elimination from the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank of the mem who have, inmy opinion up to the present, beenstanding firmly and wisely against the pressure brought to. bear upon them. I believe those men, against great opposition and great pres1 sure, have been acting in the interests of the country. It will bevery much to be regretted if they are eliminated from the directorate. There is, in my opinion, nothing to be gained by accepting the Senate's amendment in this case. say I consider it is due to the pressure of certain interests which, so far as I could gather, were perfectly satisfied with the original pro-vision for the directorate of the bank, or at least were prepared to accept it . But because they saw an opportunity to exert influence they used it . W it h whatever knowledge and judgment I possess I shall oppose any outside in terests which attempt to dominate this Parliament.",27
62,Mr MAXWELL,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,Perhaps it could be stated definitely in the bill who are currency experts.,28
63,Mr MANN,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"It should be just as possible to decide who are currency experts as who are medical, scientific, or . engineering experts, although I suppose that just as opinions differ on that matter in one profession they will differ in another. The value of a man's opinion on any subject depends largely upon what he knows of it . An ignorant man is not qualified to decide who is an expert. Although a treasurer may not be an expert in currency affairs he has sources of i formation available which should make him capable of reaching an honest and honourable decision on them. Certainly he would be far less liable to error than the man in th© street who had no such advice available. There are men in the community who have made currency matters thestudy of their lives, and I can see no reason why they should not be represented on the Commonwealth Bank directorate. Honourable members of another place agree with us that the board of directors of the Bank should be representative of various interests in the community, but whereas we determined the proportion in which such interests should be represented they are willing to leave' that matter to the discretion of the Government. I consider that it would be in the interests of the. bank for honourable members to determine that at least the great producing interests of the community should be somewhat evenly represented. For the reasons given I shall oppose both the motion and the amendment.",28
64,Mr LAZZARINI,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Werriwa) [2.49],As the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Mann) has said, it is not difficult to infer that the associated banks, through Senator Greene, took a hand in the framing of the amendments inserted in this bill in another place. opinion, to"" make the alteration that the Minister now proposes to accept will be to remove still another provision which in some measure safeguards the public in terests. I am glad that the honourable member for Perth intends to oppose the motion,, but I am sorry that he cannot accept the amendment moved by the  Moloney). If the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning), and the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) vote in accord with their speeches we shall at least be sure of two more votes to prevent the directorate of the bank being exclusively representative of 'the associated banks and th© financial institutions of the country. I regret that the honourable member for Macquarie suggested that the amendment was moved to waste the time of the committee. This measure would have justified consideration for three months, and Parliament should have had the opportunity to give adequate consideration to it . I am suspicious that if the motion is agreed to the only n - interests that will be represented on the board of directors of the bank will be those of the big insurance companies and the associated banks. If that should be so, the bank would not be operated in the interests of the people. How can we reasonably expect men who are deeply concerned in the prosperity of the private banks to promote the interests of an institution which is diametrically opposed to them? Common sense forbids such a conclusion. The honourable gentleman who moved, in another place, for the insertion of the provision which the Treasurer now asks us to accept, prejudiced his own case by stating-and I speak on the author it y of press reports-that he was in daily contact with private financial institutions. The .honourable member for Macquarie ridiculed the statement of the honourable  that workers could have a sound knowledge of financial affairs. It is quite evident that he has never heard of, or else has given no consideration to, the reasons for the huge success of the workmen's banks in America. Those institutions were established on small capital, and are flourishing under the control of working men. How can we expect gentlemen, who all their lives have conducted their business operations with a view to In my the payment of large dividends to private interests, to make effective directors of a national institution, the chief aim of which is service to the nation ? Such men should not be entrusted with the guidance of a national institution like the Commonwealth Bank. Not only have they used the hours of daylight, but they have frequently burned the midnight oil to devise ways and means of squeezing a little more profit out of their business, or of extorting a little higher rate of interest from the people to whom they lend money. The chief aim of a national institution is not profit, but service. is the line of demarcation between a private and a government concern. One is operated for profit, and the other for service. The great captains of industry and the prominent financiers of the country are totally unfitted to evolve a progressive policy of national service, for they have been all their lives concerned with earning profits for private persons. Some honourable members opposite were amused at the statement of the honourable member for Hume that a working farmer might have an even better knowledge of finance than a big squatter. Many of the financial and currency problems about which honourable members opposite talk so glibly are only difficult to understand because of the stupid language which people use in talking about them - The principles of finance are not so intricate as the general public is led to believe. Farmers who have to work hard to pay the heavy in terest which the banking institutions demand from them are generally possessed of a sounder knowledge of finance than big squatter? who have inherited all their wealth and have never done a day's work in their lives. I suppose the Government would consider a wealthy man to be a currency expert. Perhaps it would even go so far as to say that the mad American millionaire, of whom we read in the press a few days ago, was a currency expert. Apparently, it gives no consideration to how a man obtains his wealth. It may have been inherited from the buccaneers of the years gone by, or obtained by the sweating of the employees in an industrial undertaking, or at any rate by many of the questionable practices which big business adopts. The fact that certain individuals arc wealthy is - no guarantee whatever that they are currency experts. I have said on every occasion when a bill has been brought before us for the appointment of men to such positions as these, that the Government should announce their names. The Treasurer may [H9 ] tell me that it is not the practice, but I do not care whether there is a precedent for it or not. It is time we broke away from x some of the precedents that have enslaved us in the past. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) rightly interjected that the success or failure of the bank would depend entirely upon the men appointed to the board. What is the use That of our wasting time considering this bill when we cannot say a word on the appointment of the members of the board, upon the choice of whom success or failure depends ?",28
65,Mr MAXWELL,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,It is impossible to say before the bill is passed who will be appointed.,29
66,Mr LAZZARINI,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Has the honourable member any doubt that the bill will be passed? His interjection is only a legal quibble. In any case, the Government could give the committee a guarantee that the names of the persons intended to be appointed would be submitted to Parliament for ratification. It is said that we should not mention names, but a lot of speculating has been going on outside Parliament. The name of Sir John Higgins has been repeatedly mentioned in certain circles, and, if we searched the Commonwealth, I do not suppose we could find a man less fitted for the job. I wonder whether he will lose his memory when he gets on the board ? Men with such commercial records as his ought not to be appointed to the board; they are eminently unfitted for such work. I question whether we could find one representative of big financial and commercial interests that is fitted for this job. Such men cannot view the business from the right angle, because their environment and the associations of their lifetime have unfitted them for the work.",29
67,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,Is it a crime to be successful ?,29
68,Mr LAZZARINI,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"I am pointing out that these men can only regard institutions like banks as means for squeezing out profits. The first function of a national institution like the Commonwealth Bank is to render service to the nation. The difference between profit and service is very great. With these gentlemen, the first and last consideration is profit, whereas the first and last consideration should be service.",29
69,Mr DUNCAN,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,HUGHES - Did not Sir John Higgins give his services to this country free during the war?,29

The TreaAustralia. surer' has let down his party-the Country party-completely . We are told that the Couutry party stood for the representation of rural interests on the board, but the associated banks, through their represenbusiness. tative in another place, have declared otherwise. They could not put it in the bill that representatives, of rural interests should not sit on the board, bub the amendment is so framed that they need never be appointed, and I make bold to say that they never will be appointed. stand behind the policy of the Labour party. If the Treasurer intends to appoint representatives of rural industries, why did the representative, of the ciated banks in another place deliberately move an amendment to omit all reference to them ? If there is no purpose behind the amendment, it is merely stupid. Six persons from any one of the interests named could be appointed, and, I believe, will be appointed from the financial, in terests. I strongly support the amend their ment moved by the honourable member for  wrong to give men £ 5 0 to sit on a board for half an hour or an. hour a month. The Governor and the staff of the bank will have to do all the work, and the are ignorant. Governor and one or two representatives appointed from the staff could manage the bank better than the proposed board. Once men from outside meddle with that institution, and have a voice in its future policy, the bank will suffer. Men pointed to the board should be compelled to divorce themselves from all other i terests; their lives should be devoted to truth . the welfare of this great national institution. It is not sufficient that give a few hours of their time to the bank after they have attended to other in terests that may be in direct rivalry it . Members of the Ministry would not for one moment tolerate a proposition this kind if it affected their own nesses. Would the Prime Minister allow a representative of a rival concern to on the board of directors of his firm decide its future policy? Certainly not. The thing is patently absurd.",30

77,Mr WEST,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"East Sydney) [3.15] Because the future of the Commonwealth Bank will depend wholly upon the men - controlling it , honourable members on this side attach a great deal of importance to this clause. Under the late Sir Denison Miller the bank was well managed, and the Fisher Government was many times commendedfor having made such a - wise choice of the first Governor.

78,Mr MAKIN,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"I call attention to the state of the ' committee. [Quorum formed.'] Mr - WEST - The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) seems to be greatly concerned because the Senate's amendment eliminates from the proposed board the two currency experts. I do not know why those so-called currency experts were ever included. I understand ciirrencj to mean liquid assets in the form of gold, silver and .notes, but there is no possibility of Australia reverting to a gold currency. Freetraders have some faddish ideas about currency. I ' cannot understand why the Senate did not adopt the Labour party's proposal to have . a board of three permanent directors. That chamber is. supposed to be a non-party body, and it might be expected to take a broad view of the requirements of the bank, and not be prejudiced in favour of or against a proposal because of the party from which it emanated. It must When the be remembered that the board of directors will have control of the note issue, and that will give it a great power for good or ill in the affairs of the Commonwealth. I am still hopeful that the state governments and state instrumentalities will do ' their banking with the Commonwealth Bank, and give it an even more powerful - influence upon Australian finance. If we. cannot have our proposal for three permanent directors adopted, I . shall be obr liged to accept the Senate's amendment as the less of two evils. The people of Sydney took a lively interest in the discussion on the original Commonwealth Bank Bill , and I feel that I am voicing their opinion by protesting against the the Senate's amendment. The Commonwealth having Bank should be placed under the manageCom- ment of financial experts who have the interests of the people at heart.",31
79,Mr OKEEFE,EXCISE ON SPIRIT FEOM,"Denison) [3.33] - The f original clause in the bili was more definite than and certainly preferable to the amendment fro m the Senate. I was strongly in favour of the Labour party's original amendment, that the board of management should consist of three members whose time should be wholly and solely devoted to the service of the ComI do monwealth Bank. That amendment was - defeated. Now we are faced with the Senate's proposal that the board shall consist of a governor and seven other persons, one of whom shall be the. Secretary to the Treasury-and we agree-the others to be persons who are or have been actively engaged in agriculture, commerce, finance, or industry. Much as I disliked the original clause, I regard this amendment infinitely worse. The original posal did provide that those six persons should not all be drawn from one industry, or from one section interested kindred industries. It provided for the appointment of two persons with manufacturing industries or commerce, two persons associated with agriculture, pastoral, or other industries, and two persons knowledge of. currency. The inserted by the Senate, at the instigation of Senator Green©, would certainly not have been accepted by the Treasurer had not pressure been applied by a majority in another place. It is quite possible that the whole of the six persons to be appointed may be drawn from one industry. The danger of such a provision cannot be too often impressed upon the public, who really own the bank. I do not profess to have any expert knowledge of except what I have gained in the course of many years' transactions with - banks. The Commonwealth Bank should be under the control of a board of three directors having a knowledge not only of finance', but also of the science of banking. The bill precludes the appointment of men' controlling other banks, yet we still have left a field wide enough from which to choose at least one expert financier a lifetime of banking experience. no doubt, be possible to appoint to the board an officer of the Bank who was previously drawn from a private bank. Those appointed should be wholly employed by the Bank; to keep the public mind free from any suspicion that the board of directors was acting in the interests of the private banks to the of those of the Commonwealth I have had the advantage of a long discussion with the manager of a very important Melbourne branch of one of the private banks. While he and I did not agree that managers of other banks ' should be excluded from the of the Commonwealth Bank, still I was glad to get his opinion on the general merits or demerits of the measure introduced by the Treasurer. This who has been engaged in banking his boyhood, absolutely laughed at the Mr O'Keefe. with that idea of governing this national bank by the board as at first proposed to be constituted. He quite agreed with the contention of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), and those as who followed him on the same lines, pro- that it would be very dangerous indeed to have a national bank controlled by men capable of being swayed by their in private interests - He held that the only way in which the institution could be made associated of real value to the people of Australia was to have a board of three or five gentlemen-he - preferred five-whose time primary should be full y devoted to the service of with a the bank, and who should be adequately amendment remunerated for their work. He thought that they should have no other interest in life but the control and welfare of the bank, and he expressed the belief that the bank would never advance to its fullest extent or become the great institution the people of Australia-wished it to be, and which it was intended to be when it was established, unless its management was in the hands of such a board. The honourable banking, member for Darwin (Mr Whitsitt), in his breezy speech of a few moments ago, private said that there has never been an occasion in Australia when a bank note has depreciated in value below 20s. The honourable member probably forgot the occasion on which the Van Dieman's Land Bank closed its doors, and next day its notes were being sold in the open street for 12s. 6d. That was an instance of the managewith ment of a bank by a board whose time It will, was not full y given to the service of the bank. It was under the management of Commonwealth one man, who had a board of directors associated with him . Motion (by Mr Bruce) putCommonwealth That the question be now put. The committee divided.
