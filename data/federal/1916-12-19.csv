19,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"R e c e n t l y the honourable member for We n t w o r t h asked for some in for m at i o n concerning the purchase of locomotives for the K a l g o o r l i e to P o r t A u g u s t a R a i l w a y . The following report from the Engineer-in-Chief is now a v a i l able : COMMONWEALT HRAILWAYS . Melbourne, 18th December, 1916. The Secretary, Department of Works and Railways. KALGOORLIE-POET AUGUSTA Supply of Locomotives. W it h reference to the question raised as to the locomotives for the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway, I have to report as under:In the early stages of the work the opinion was held that internal-combustion engines could be obtained which would haul material for building the line, for carrying on construction work, and be afterwards available to work the public traffic, and apparently the idea of obtaining these engines was not abandoned to the time of the present Engineer-in-Chief taking office. Presumably with such hopes, the ordering of steam locomotives was deferred. When the present Engineer-in-Chief took charge, in A p r i l, 1914, it was found that engines on hand, or which had been contracted for, numbered thirty-two; of these, six were not suitable for railway construction work of such magnitude. They were light passenger engines that had been running many years on the New South Wales' railways. They were procured in the early stages of the work because of the delay which occurred in the development of the internal-combustion idea and in having suitable steam locomotives built. They were not equal to the heavy construction traffic, nor were they capable of moving the tracklayer train from point to point as required to facilitate plate laying. So light and unsuitable were these engines that in assessing our requirements their services for main-line traffic had to be practically disregarded. They could only be deemed to be of value for minor runs and for shunting in the dep6t yards. The number of properly serviceable engines provided for to this date was, therefore, twenty-six; of this number, two only had been delivered, eight only had been delivered by June, 1914, sixteen by July, 1914, but it was not u n t i l July, 1916, that any further deliveries were effected and engines put into running. Even now, only nineteen of the twenty-six have been delivered. Serious water trouble had arisen in connection with the locomotives, the boilers and tubes being badly affected thereby; also a decision was reached before the middle of 1914 to adequately ballast the line, this work to be carried out, as far as practicable, before plate laying finished. Additional locomotives were therefore needed, and, on 14th January, 1915, the then Government decided, on the recommendation of the RAILWAY. Engineer-in-Chief, to procure twenty more, which would make forty-six main line locomoLOCOMOTIVES. tives in all. Of these, eight were imported from Great .Britain, as local manufacturers were unable to supply sufficiently early. The remaining twelve were submitted to tenders within the Commonwealth. Representations by local manufacturers were made that twelve was too small a number for economic construction, and that better conditions could be secured by the Government if the number were increased to, at least, twenty. It is understood that the Government at the time had in view the possible construction .of a north-south railway, and a strategic railRAILWAY. way eastward of Port Augusta, either during or immediately after the war. ' It appears to have been seized of the importance of linking the capitals, as far as practicable, by railways of uniform gauge, and of the necessity, in particular, of connecting for defence purposes the standard gauge Commonwealth line with the New South Wales system of similar gauge, as subsequently recommended by the Railways War Council. This latter work, it might now be emphasized, is essential from a defence point of view. The Commonwealth line, without such linking up to make State rolling-stock available, would be of. little value for military purposes. It would be impracticable to hold upon it sufficient rolling-stock to adequately meet the defence demands, even for light transport. It is imperative, therefore, to have direct access to the rolling-stock of the New South Wales railways if regard is.to be paid to effective service. It would be apparent, also, at the time, from inquiries made among private manufacturers and the various State workshops, that the volume of work in hand was such that if the Commonwealth Government did proceed with any other railway proposition, either as a defence measure in some immediate emergency, or as a means of providing employment for returned soldiers, or for the development of the country, the difficulties, delays, and expense which have arisen from shortage of locomotives for the construction of the Kalgoorlie Port Augusta - railway would be .repeated in respect of the new work. There was ample evidence, moreover, that prices of locomotive raw materials would rise, which has since been demonstrated, to the extent that most of them are now, and will continue to be, practically unprocurable. This condition will hot be greatly eased immediately by the cessation of war, because of the war wastage to be repaired. The Government accordingly accepted tenders for twenty-six locomotives to be manufactured within the Commonwealth (twenty in Queensland and six in South Australia). The contractors, in consequence of difficulties arising from the war, have applied for eighteen months and nine months extension - in delivery time respectively. It might be added that locomotive manufacturers in this country do not possess the requisite plant or facilities for that of construction. Consequently it has happened, not infrequently, that locomotives had to be imported from abroad, by Commonwealth and State Governments alike, to meet requirements that were beyond the abilities of local manufacturers in the matter of prompt delivery.

20,Mr CORSER,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,"Will the Postmaster General cause inquiries to be made as to the reasons why, between the l l t h and 17th December, no mails were eent by the daily train between Brisbane and Gayndah, and why the working of the telephone service between Maryborough and Gayndah is so unsatisfactory?",8

No honourable member has sent such a complaint to me without it ceiving expeditious attention. ' I honourable member to pursue that course. COAL STOCKS.",8

If so, has any prerepresented. caution been taken to protect the, large quantities of coal at grass in the castle district?",8

24,Mr HIGGS,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,"Is it the intention of the Treasurer to introduce 'this week a Bill to fix the rates of the income tax for the year ending the 30th June, 1917 ? If it is not his intention to do so, will the effect be to compel taxpayers to pay Federal and State taxation at about the same date, thus causing inconvenience?  mit, the Bill will be introduced today, and I hope that it may be passed before we adjourn for the holidays. TRAINEES FOR HOMEDEFENCE .",8
25,Mr LAIRD SMITH,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,"On 7th December, the honourable member for Maribyrnong asked this questionA number of those who were recently called into camp under proclamation were compelled to relinquish private employment, but were promised re-employment on their return. Many of them, however, have now found their places filled. Is the Commonwealth prepared to do something for those who have lost positions through obeying the proclamation? SERVICE. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:: Large numbers of cases have been received by the Department, and the applicants have been informed that the matter is under the consideration of the Attorney-General's Department, to whom the general question has been re-submitted as to whether section 134 of the Defence Act is applicable to Part IV. I should be glad to have a list of the names of those to whom the honourable member refers, in order that their cases may be directly dealt with. WHEAT POOL.  reto allowing the wheat-growers to have reask the presentation on the Wheat Board?",8
26,Mr HUGHES,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,"The objection to giving the growers direct representation on the Central Wheat Board was that the constitution of the pool provided only for for the representation of Governments as such, on that Board, and the Ministers of A g it riculture of the four wheat-producing States and the Commonwealth are directly In the second place, there is no need for the wheat-growers to have Newa representative on the Central Wheat Board, because they are directly repreon the State Wheat Board. The Central Board does not deal with handling, charges or with the arrangements for In effect, it deals with the sale bf wheat, and for that sponreason the Board could not see fit to agree to the request of the,Farmers Conference.",8
27,Mr RILEY,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,Will the Prime Minister inform the House what are the prospects of additional ships coming to Australia to take away the wheat now lying stacked in the country ?,8
28,Mr HUGHES,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,"I cannot tell the honourable member wliat the prospects are. I only know that the. best possible arrangements for the transport of wheat, in the - circumstances, are being made. The greatest quantity of wheat ever despatched in any one year was that sent during the present year. I think that, in 1913-14, 1,2000,000 tons of wheat were despatched, whilst this year wo have sent away about 1,500,000 tons. A f t e r the present harvest, all being well, there will be available in Australia, with the residuum of last year's crop, nearly 3,250,000 tons. If we have the same facilities as we have had this year, it will take about two years ""to shift that wheat. If those facilities are reduced, the time will be longer; if they are increased, it will be shorter. It is hoped that greater facilities for transport will be available.",8
29,Mr LIVINGSTON,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,Will the old wheat be shipped and paid for before any of the new wheat is sent away ?,9
30,Mr HUGHES,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,"I should not care to say that that arrangement will apply in all cases. The idea is to shift the wheat from the ports most convenient to Great Britain first. No man in the pool will be prejudiced by that arrangement. It does not matter to him which wheat is sent first, because the money received for it will be distributed evenly to all concerned. A few bushels of new wheat might happen to go before the old, but, speaking generally, obviously the old wheat will have to be shifted before the new wheat can get down in any quantity to the wharfs.",9
31,Mr RODGERS,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question, so as to clear up the financial position with regard to the No. 1 and No. 2 wheat pools. Por the future, will sales of wheat be credited to the No. 1 wheat pool until it has been wound up, or proportionately credited to the two wheat pools? Now that the value of the wheat has been definitely fixed in respect of both pools, we have a scrip which* is as good as money. For the 11 benefit of the growers and'' the financiers of this country, I shall be glad if the Prime Minister can give me this information.",9
32,Mr HUGHES,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,"Question s of this kind are a little difficult to answer off-hand. I should say, however, that each pool stands, if I may use such a term, on its own bottom. If , for instance, the sale of the 1915-16 wheat crop returned to the farmer 4s. 4 j d . per bushel- I am taking that price only by way of illustrationit might happen that the new crop would not return the same value, so that, if the two pools were taken together, it would follow that the man who grew wheat in only one year, and not in both, would be the loser. The idea is tb clean' up one pool-to - treat it separately-befor e we go on with the other.",9
33,Mr LYNCH,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,"Will the Prime Minister state whether it is not a fact that under the agreement made with the British Government for the purchase of Australian wheat for the two seasons, the arranging of freights is purely a matter for the Imperial authorities?",9
34,Mr HUGHES,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,Does the honourable member mean for the f.o.b. purchasers?,9
35,Mr LYNCH,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,Yes .,9
36,Mr HUGHES,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,"The f.o.b. purchasers - the Imperial authorities-fi x the freights and have to provide the freight. For the information of honourable members, I may say that the freight now equals the selling price of the wheat; That is to say, the cost of transporting a bushel of wheat from Australia to Great Britain is 4s. 9d., which is equal to. the price at which we sell the wheat itself.  ister make available for the information of honourable members a statement as to the trade' in which the Commonwealth steam-ship fleet is engaged, and the extent to which it has been utilized for the transport of wheat?",9
37,Mr HUGHES,GAYNDAH MAILAND TELEPHONE,"I have not the data at hand, and can make only a general statement. W it h one exception, all the vessels of the fleet have been used to carry wheat. In the case of the exception referred to the ship was loaded with copra for glycerine at the request of the Imperial Government, which required it for explosives. It was impossible to obtain freight for this purpose, because mixed freights pay much better, and private ship-owners were not prepared to carry copra. We placed one of our ships at the disposal of the I m perial Government at their express request. W it h that exception all our vessels have carried wheat. It was proposed to complete our c.i.f. transactions with Commonwealth steamers, because in that way we should be assured of freight being available for that purpose. It is only fair to explain to the House that we have been able to obtain only one steamer, and, I think, .,though I am hot quite sure, five or six sailing vessels in four months. There is no freight to be got, and, as I have stated, it costs as much to take a bushel of wheat to London as the wheat is worth. To take it to Mediterranean ports it costs even more. NA RAILWAYS. ELMORE TO COHUNA SERVICE.",9
38,Mr SAMPSON,CARRIAGE OP MAILS ON,"Havin g regard to beforei an appraiser, the long delay in the final settlement the agreement between the Railway Devalue, partments and the Postmaster-General for the carriage of mails over State railare ways, will the honourable gentleman at satisfied once give instructions for the mails to be of appeal to the Central Board. carried over the Elmore to Cohuna line pending the determination of the final arrangements to be made?",10
39,Mr WEBSTER,CARRIAGE OP MAILS ON,"I have been most anxious to arrive at a decision with the railway authorities as to their charges for carrying our mails on existing and new lines. Under the present conditions the charges are exorbitant. In these times, when the Treasurer is pressing me, perinterests haps more than any other Minister, to economize, I cannot consistentlv do what the honourable member asks until I have had a report on the-matter. SALE OF THE WOO LCLIP .  gard to the position of small wool-growers, I desire to ask the Prime Minister if he can so arrange that-(1 ) the growers have the right to employ independent valuers to protect their interests; (2) that in cases of dispute a referee board shall be appointed to which the growers shall have the .right of appointing, at least, half themembers, and the right tb cancel an appointment and to substitute another on his proving unsatisfactory; (3) that the values of the different combing qualities on which values are based be made known, so that a better idea of values can be more easily arrived at.",10
40,Mr HUGHES,CARRIAGE OP MAILS ON,"I think the honourable member had better give notice of his question. I have explained the matter fully in reply to the honourable member for Echuca and other honourable members. The position of the wool-grower is that'the Central Board is representative of the in dustry. The price of each man's wool is determined, not by any Board, but by skilled experts. The only difference between the selling of wool today and the sale of it in ordinary times is that there is now a fixed basis of price, and that the value of a particular clip goes above or below that fixed basis as the quality may demand. Once the wool-grower realizes that the price is not fixed by any body at all, there will be no trouble. The basic , price-the flat rate, as it were-is 15 Jd. per lb. for greasy wool. A bale is brought who, having of examined it , says, - "" On that basis of this bale of wool is worth 2 2 | d . "" And that is what the owner gets. There three appraisers. An y one who is diswith their decision has the righ t The interests of wool-growers are much better safeguarded than they werei n ordinary circumstances in the auction room. It is not now to any one's interest to give them a smaller rate than that which they should receive. The only limitation is the basic price of 15£d. per lb. for greasy wool. No one denies that that is a perfectly fair price, and it follows that the of the small wool-grower are amply safeguarded. If it can be shown that the arrangements made fall in any way short of protecting the small wool growers, I will see that ample provision is made to safeguard their interests.  decided not to give the small growers representation on the Central Board ?",10
41,Mr HUGHES,CARRIAGE OP MAILS ON,"The small growers will not have representation on the Central Board unless it can be shown that the representation now on the Board does ; not protect their interes'ts in common with 1 those of every one else. If that can be shown, I will see that the small grower does secure representation.  disturbed in their minds as to when payment for the wool clip will be made. Will the Prime Minister state whether they will be paid when the value of the wool is appraised?",10
42,Mr HUGHES,CARRIAGE OP MAILS ON,"I understand'that, in normal times, it is the practice to pay cash within fourteen days of the fall of the hammer, or within such other time as may be fixed in the conditions. For all practical purposes that practice will be followed under the present scheme, subject, of course, to the fact that we are now acquiring the whole clip. We shall not pay for the/ whole clip within fourteen days, but the time from which the wool will pass through the appraisers' hands until the grower gets his money will be' about the same as it would have been in the case of an ordinary auction sale.  said that the man who sends in wool worth 22£d. per lb. will get that price for it , notwithstanding the basic value of 15Jd. for greasy wool. I should be glad if he could clear a doubt in my mind as to whether he means that under the arrangement made a man may get 22£d. for any of his wool that is worth that price, but that in respect of his whole clip the price paid must not exceed 15^d. Where his wool is not worth 15Jd. per l b . , will he get the actual value placed upon it by the appraisers?",10
43,Mr HUGHES,CARRIAGE OP MAILS ON,"Let me illustrate the position by a reference to the procedure in regard to wheat. We sell f.a.q. wheat for 4s. 9d. a bushel, but if a man comes along with a lot of chickwheat we do not agree to take it at that price. In fixing the price for wool, the British Government said, "" We will pay you on the basis of 15^d. per l b . of greasy wool."" the honourable member knows perfectly well, some brands of wool always fetch much more than others. Some are sold for 6d. and 9d., while others fetch five or six times that sum. The only difference between normal sales and this sale to the British Government is that a sort of equilibrium is maintained so that the price cannot fluctuate wildly. only the quality of the wool itself which oscillates in regard to this level of 15Jd. per lb. for greasy wool.

Will the Minister for Defence take proper steps to secure the most qualified men as officers for the railway unit?",12
55,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MILITARY SERVICE,"The following are the replies: r. A railway official who holds the rank of major in the Australian Engineer and Railway Staff Corps in the 2nd Military District (New South Wales), with workshop and traffic experience, was mobilized for duty as railway transport officer at the end of March, 1916, no returned officer with railway traffic experience being available. He was not filling a clerical position, but was responsible for the arrangements for the movements of troops by rail in New South Wales, and from New South Wales to the other States. He ceased duty at the end of November owing to the reduction in the number of country camps. The pay granted to him was £375 per annum, the same rate that he was receiving in the Railway Department. 2. The duties of officers of the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps require little military knowledge. These officers are experts in the particular branch to which they belong.

There are only a few cases of the kind on record, and the general practice is to leave the question of censorship of films to State authorities.

60,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Yarra) [11.581- 1I have of no objection to the amendment pronosed the Treasurer, but I desire to know, what effect this clause will have on the season tickets issued by sporting, athletic, social, and other clubs. The point could be raised on any of the clauses up to clause 12, but I think we ought to have some information now. There are many such clubs devoted to bowling, quoits, and other games, for membership of which working men and others pay £ 1 Is. or more annually. From such payments there is absolutely no gain whatever to any person; and clubs of the kind have now the greatest trouble in financing their way. As is well known, no charge is made for admission to any of their competitions, but members and others show - a ticket or token, such as I suppose many honourable members possess, and such as I myself hold in connection with the Melbourne Cricket Club. On my ticket, for instance, I presume the club, if such membership payments are liable to taxation, will have to pay about 3s. 6d. I am speaking on behalf of many athletic and social clubs, which are not moneymaking institutions. Many cricket clubs spend all the money obtained from members' season tickets in beautifying their grounds. I wish to know whether a percentage of the revenue that these clubs obtain from members' tickets has to be paid in the shape of an entertainments tax. In many cases the holders of these season tickets pay their money, not for the purpose of being entertained by others, but for the purpose of taking part in sport themselves. For instance, the revenue derived from the annual subscriptions of rowing clubs does not. equal the upkeep of the clubs. These clubs have also to depend upon donations, and the only return that the members get beyond the actual sport itself are the prizes for which they compete. The same remark applies to the big cricket clubs. They get cally no revenue apart from the football matches, and' since the beginning of the war very littl e income has been derived from that source. Aa a matter of fact, with the exception of a few patriotic demonstrations, the Melbourne Cricket Club has not been able to provide any entertainments for the holders of its season tickets. The consequence is that the upkeep of the ground has had to be paid out of the revenue obtained from the membership tickets. In addition, it has been stated that the club has lost 2,000 members, or a revenue of over £4,000 a year. This club does not ask for exemption, but it and other clubs are entitled to fair treatment. There should be some exemptions. Possibly; the Board of Referees referred to by the Treasurer in his financial statement could pronounce upon cases where there should be exemptions. At any rate, I do not think it is the wish of the Government to tax clubs, the whole of whose revenue, obtained from membership tickets, is spent in maintaining and improving the grounds, and which are not run for the profit of the individual. I appeal to the Treasurer to exempt them.  [12.5] - Whereve r there is no charge for admission this tax will not apply. Do I understand that the honourable member seeks to exempt the big attendances at football matches?",13
61,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"No ; merely the season tickets of these athletic clubs.  for season tickets in clause 11. The tax will be charged in respect of admission to all entertainments on which the tax is payable. If there are two entertainments in the year at which a charge for admission is made, a proportion of the annual ticket is taken to represent those two entertainments, and the tax is payable on that proportion. Where there is no entrance fee there is no charge against the annual ticket. There will be no hardship imposed.",14
62,Mr CHARLTON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Hunter) [12.7] Am I to understand from the Treasurer that where no charge is made at the gate this tax w i ll not apply ? ,14
63,Mr CHARLTON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"I am pleased to hear the Treasurer's reply, because I had in mind particularly the season tickets of bowling clubs, which occupy pieces of ground in parks, and beautify them for practi- the benefit of the public generally. Amendment agreed to.  toThat the following sub-clause be added to the clause(2) In all cases in which entertainments tax is collected by the proprietor of the entertainment or his agent, the tax so collected shall, until payment to the Commonwealth, be held by the proprietor of the entertainment or his agent as property of the Commonwealth.

Clause 11- Where the payment for admission to an entertainment is made by means of a lump . sum paid as a subscription or contribution to any club, association, or society, or for a season ticket, or for the right of admission to a series of entertainments or to any entertainment during a certain period of time, the entertainments tax shall be .paid on the amount of the lump sum, but where the Commissioner is of opinion that the payment of a lump sum or any payment for a ticket represents payment for other privileges, rights or purposes in addition to the admission to an entertainment or covers admission to an entertainment during any period for which the tax has not been in operation, the tax shall be charged on such an amount as appears to the Commissioner to represent the right of admission to entertainments in respect of which entertainments tax is payable.",14
64,Mr BURNS,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Illawarra) T12.91 - I wish the Treasurer to explain the meaning of the words "" the entertainments tax shall be paid on the amount of the lump sum."" A m I to understand that the tax will be paid on the lump sum, that is to say, on the guinea or two guineas as the case may be, charged by the club for the season ticket ?  the public for admission to an entertainment provided by the club will be apportioned against the season ticket, and the tax wil l be charged on that proportion only.",15
65,Mr BURCHELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Fremantle) [12.10]. - As I understand the; Treasurer, the position is this: If a person pays two guineas for a season ticket and the club has one entertainment during the period and makes a charge of Is. or 2s. to the general public, the season-ticket holder will be called on to pay his proportion of the tax on the basis, of the Is. or 2s.  tion.",15
66,Mr FENTON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,The club will pay it .,15
67,Mr BURCHELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"That is so,' but think that explains the position. The tax will not be on the full value of the season ticket, but only on the charge for admission which is ma'de to those who do not hold season tickets on days on which entertainments are given-. ",15
68,Mr FENTON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,There is a/ charge for admission every Saturday in connection with football clubs.,15
69,Mr BURCHELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"That is the case, and the tax will be paid accordingly, but the Bill will not affect clubs which are more social in their character, and to which the honourable member for Yarra was referring. The tax will only be paid when there is a charge for admission.",15
70,Mr GSOOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Is the matter to be assessed by the Commissioner? ,15
71,Mr MANIFOLD,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Corangamite) [12.12] - A further point I wish to clear up is whether the Commissioner will charge the proportion on the whole of the membership tickets or merely on the tickets of those members who actually attend on a day on which a charge is made to the general public.  need to be made with the club so that the actual attendance may be estimated. The charge wil l be made on the actual attendance, and not on the general membership roll of the club.",15
72,Mr MANIFOLD,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"And that charge, will be according to the entrance fee which is being paid by the public? ",15
73,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Yarra) ri2.13] - The mere fact that we have the Bill before us shows that times are different from what they were. I know something about football clubs. Players who formerly received an allowance for playing in order to cover out-of-pocket expenses-and it has been stated that it used to be pretty highnow receive anything up to 5s. a week in order to recompense them for the time they lose when training, the allowance they formerly received having been donated to patriotic funds. But they aregiven honorary tickets. I wish to know whether these honorary tickets are to be taxed ? There are also trainers' tickets.  without payment.",15
74,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"T he Bill will affect clubs that have already been hard h it , many of them being faced with a deficit I which some members of the committees of clubs will have to stand behind. I wish 0 to know if the Commissioner will consider the exemption of honorary tickets?  ary tickets.",15
75,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"There are men who, commencing as players, have become officers of clubs, and, in the end* they have received life members' tickets, entitling them to admission to any ground. I understand that those tickets will not be taxed.  [12.17] - The tickets referred to. by the honourable member for Yarra will not be taxed. Similarly, the tickets of admission given to trainers, jockeys, caterers, and others connected with a race meeting will not he taxed.",15
76,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,No r will tickets given to distinguished visitors ? ,16
77,Mr GLYNN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Angas) [12.19] - I hope that the drafting is clear m regard to the taxation of annual subscriptions, which give the right to admission to race meetings and other entertainments. Provision is made in the case of a subscription covering in part a period for which the tax is not enforced, that there may be apportionment, but I am not sure that the clause enables the Commissioner to take into account, when a subscription ticket is used to obtain admission to subsequent entertainments, that the tax was assessed in the first instance on a lump sum.",16
78,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Darling Downs) [12.20]. - Obviousl y there will be only one assesment in connection-with season tickets. A subscriber to the Melbourne Cricket Club has the right to enter the. grounds whenever he presents his ticket at the gates, but while one member may avail himself of this privilege frequently, another may never use it at all. What will the Commissioner have to do? Is he to estimate the value of the ticket to the holder,- and prepare a scale accordingly? The members of some agricultural societies have the right of entrance to the show-grounds even when they are leased for the purpose of some entertainment not connected with the society.",16
79,Mr BURCHELL,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Thes e cases are to be met with chiefly in the big cities.,16
80,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Yes ; but in connection with places whose takings are very big. It will, according to the Bill , have to be left to the Tax Commissioner to assess the value of the tickets.  make adjustments that will prevent injustice.",16

87,Mr FINLAYSON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Most of the institutions which, conduct entertainments of this kind have a hard struggle to make ends meet, but often refreshments have to be provided, and in such a case it is impossible to keep expenses down to 20 per cent. The entertainments to which I refer are carried on, not for a personal or private profit, but wholly. for philanthropic or charitable purposes.",16
88,Mr SAMPSON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,Wimmera) [12.25] I do not think that the amount expended in providing refreshments for entertainments such as the honourable member for Brisbane has spoken of would be regarded as part of the expenses of the entertainment.,16
89,The CHAIRMAN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,May I ask the honourable member to confine himself co the amendment?,16
90,Mr SAMPSON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"It seems to me that clauses 12 and 13 must be read together. Why should it be necessary to provide, as He gets it is provided in paragraph c, that the entertainment is intended for the amusement of children?",16
91,Mr GLYNN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Angas) [12.26] - Whil e we desire to have the machinery of. this tax as perfect as possible, we wish to avoid inquisitorial administration. have known entertainments to be got up in connection with a convent to provide, perhaps, a playground. The children often try to assist by organizing separate entertainments to raise funds for , say, a stall. They may charge I d . for admission to their entertainment. In this way there is generous co-operation in philanthropic and religious effort. But under the clause the children would have to make application to the Commissioner for permission to hold their subsidiary entertainment. Is that intended? clause says that the Commissioner must be satisfied; that is, he must be satisfied in advance. It might happen, if persons in Western Australia, say, did not take the precaution of writing to .the Commissioner, that some one might, under another section, march into the convent to find out what they were doing.",16

93,Mr GLYNN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,We must be careful not to provide too much administration for our ends. We are developing a sysI tem of continual supervision qf every6 thing. Not a day will pass without an entertainment of the class of which I have spoken being held somewhere in the Comanother monwealth. If the promoters have to ply to the Commissioner to carrv on these entertainments there will be a good of annoyance and some congestion. Amendment agreed to.,17

In reply to the honourable member for Angas I may point out that the application will be made, not to the Commissioner i in Melbourne, but to the deputy in each place, and the Act will be administered in such a way as to recognise all bond fide efforts.",17
95,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Yarra) [12.34] - I do not think that the Treasurer will lose any revenue by accepting this amendment. Today religious, charitable, and philanthropic institutions find it very hard to The make both ends meet. It is difficult to raise any money at all for charitable purposes. The Institute for the A d u l t Deaf and Dumb some time ago held a bazaar in the Melbourne Town H all for the purpose of raising funds for the erection of a building at Blackburn Farm. The whole of the work in connection with the bazaar was voluntary. But the promoters had to pay rent for the hall and adadvertising expenses, and I think the exbe penses were over 20 per cent, of the takings. When a church is conducting any of these entertainments it has the advantage of the use of its own hall, rent free. n Victoria, if goods are to be sold, after p.m., in connection with any bazaar or fete, a permit has to be obtained from the Factories Department. Under this Bill permit will be required from the apCommissioner* of Taxation, and in addition to that, the organizing body, if the deal entertainment be for a charitable or philanthropic institution, will have to obtain a hall. It will be difficult for the expenses to be kept below 50 per cent.",17
96,Mr MANIFOLD,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"We can meet your on objections by increasing the 20 per cent, entertainin clause 13 to 50' per cent.",17
97,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"I commend that sug- , gestion to the Treasurer. Every honourable do not member knows the way in which women have to work for these bazaars and fetes, enand that the rent of the hall is often one ) of the biggest items of expense.

99,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"That will meet the requirements of the honourable member for Brisbane, but I think we shall almost err in going that far, because there are not many genuine charitable efforts which absorb in expenses 50 per cent, of the takings. Of course, it sometimes happens that adverse weather conditions prevent the returns being as good as the promoters had anticipated.",18
100,Mr SAMPSON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Wimmera) [12.41] It will be dangerous to make the allowable percentage of expenses too great. The great bulk of the proceeds pf a charitable entertainment should go to charity, otherwise the effort ceases to be properly - a charitable one. To increase the allowable expenses to 50 per cent, will permit of a very big slice being taken out of the proceeds of entertainments organized under the guise of charity. I should like to know how the Eight Hours Demonstration and similar efforts will fare under this Bill. . My impression is that, although the Eight Hours' Day celebration in Melbourne is ostensibly for charitable purposeSj about 80 per cent, of the proceeds go into the coffers of the promoting organization.",18
101,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,A big proportion is from the lottery. Only the charges for admission into the ground would be subject to the tax.,18
102,Mr SAMPSON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"What is ' to prevent the organization altering the nature of its demonstration in order to get the benefit of the allowance of 50 per cent, t demonstration purports to be a charitable effort, but whether it will be so interpreted by the Commissioner, I cannot say. If we are to exempt the proceeds of certain efforts for religious and charitable purposes, the Committee should provide that only a minimum proportion of the takings is absorbed in expenses. An allowance of 50 per cent, is very great. If this clause has been framed on the basis of balance-sheets submitted by those who have conducted these efforts, the Committee is entitled to that information. We should not pass a clause like this without data, which would enable us to judge whether 20 per cent, or 50 per cent, is the more reasonable allowance.",18

106,Mr GROOM,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,On e good purpose that this provision will serve is that it will prevent the getting up of entertainments unless they are likely to give a substantial return.,18

Mr .

Under the clause as it stands, the tax must be paid, but if the Commissioner is satisfied that the expenses of the entertainment have not exceeded a certain percentage, a refund is to be made.

The matter could be got over better by regulation. Will the Treasurer 'agree to deal with it by regulation?  [12.53] - I cannot agree to the amendment suggested h y the honourable member.

114,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Thos e of us who have had to do with the running of entertainments know that it is often an easy matter to get tickets out, but very difficult to get them back. It is often very hard to obtain the money for tickets that have been issued in that way. Many of the 0 tickets sold for entertainments of this class will , no doubt, never be presented, but the tax will , nevertheless, have to be paid.' In all probability, from 80 to 90 per cent, of this taxation will be derived from picture shows and theatres, race meetings, fetes, and carnivals, and not from the smaller entertainments such as tare held in local halls in the metropolis, 'as well as in country districts. As the result of experience, the Commissioner may find it desirable to ask for certain amendments of this measure. I agree with the proposal of the Treasurer to raise the percentage mentioned in this clause from 20 to 50 per cent.

Our only object is to provide for cases where the weather is so bad that the expenses take up the great portion of the total receipts. If we allow 50 per cent., no mathow good the conditions may be, we may permit such, undertakings to become a source of profit to private individuals.  [2.35] - Unde r the circumstances I think that, perhaps, it would be as well to leave the 20 per cent., and insert a proviso to the effect that if the Commissioner is that owing to "" adverse climatic conditions "" the expenses of an entertainment for religious or charitable purposes exceed 50 per cent, of the receipts, he return to the proprietors the amount of the entertainments tax.",20

131,Mr SAMPSON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Wimmera) [2.37] When speaking previously I instanced the Eight Hours A r t Union in Victoria. The ) tickets for this, which is claimed to be a true art union, are sold broadcast in all of the Commonwealth, and not only give chances for prizes, but admit the holders to the demonstration. ceipts for that art union from all sources in 1915, amounted to £5,912, which, after deducting £30 0 temporarily drawn from suspense account, and £ 5 7 earned by way of advertisements on the tickets, meant a net revenue of £5,555 . The distributions to. charities, after deducting expenses and salaries, cost of luncheon to delegates, clerical assistance, office expenses and so for t h , amounted to £ 9 2 3 , ' or only about 16 .per cent. The art union is supposed to be purely for the benefit of charities ; and under the clause it will be possible for the promoters to claim exemption from taxation on the whole of the admission tickets sold. believe that the feeling of the Committee is in favour of raising the allowance to 50 per cent., but, before that is done, the Treasurer should be able to give us the data on which he fixed it at 20 per cent. By raising the allowance to 50 per cent, we shall open the door to' abuse, and enable people, under the guise of charity, to use such organizations for the purpose of providing billets and enriching themselves. The honourable member for Yarra took exception to my reference ""to this particular undertaking, and, as usual, defended it because of some association with trade unions. I am not surprised, however, at such championship, because honourable members in the Opposition corner have to obey instructions on all occasions; no matter what the case may be, if any of their own institutions, are affected, they must be defended. Is the honourable member satisfied that the sort of. thing I have instanced shall continue under the guise of charity ?  [2.45] - I am assured by those who will have to administer the measure that the art union to which the honourable member has referred does not come under thi9 provision, but even if it did, on hia own showing it would be a big improvement on what was contributed on the last occasion.",20
132,Mr SAMPSON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"My point is that they may increase the expenses to 50 jper cent.  the expenses did not exceed 16 per cent. .If they had been increased to 50 per cent., as the honourable member indicates might happen, they would have been subject to the tax. But in any case the in stitution does not come under this provision. The re- Mr TUDOR (Yarra) [2.47] - The honourable member does not lose any opportunity of attacking the working man. He is always anxious to get his knife into the working classes, but he need not be anxious, as I understand the State At torney-General has decided that the art union will not be permitted again, be- cause of the efforts of his friends in bands, the Liberal party, which has always been anxious to crush the organization that promoted it . I have no doubt that they w i ll never succeed in crushing that organization. Every time action is taken in that direction, the workers strive harder to improve their position. The I expenses in connection with the art union referred to may appear to be very high, but I believe that as much as 30 per cent, commission had to be paid on the sale of some of the tickets. Speaking from memory, I think the boys who sell the tickets in the streets of Melbourne are allowed about 15 per cent. The man who. hands out the tickets to the boys gets an extra 5 per cent', to cover his risk. Agents in the country districts are paid 25 per cent., and agents in other States are paid 30 per cent. Honourable members in their desire to injure the trade unions point out one side of the picture only. They take very good care not to let the people know that the country barber or the country hotel keeper, or others, are paid about 25 per cent, for the sale of these art union tickets. All the advertising is paid for by the central committee. The honourable member is interested in several country newspapers which obtain high prices for those advertisements.",21
133,Mr SAMPSON,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,That statement is as correct as most of the statements made by the honourable member.,21
134,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"I understood that the honourable member owned several newspapers.

137,Mr TUDOR,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"I know that the point taken by the-honourable member for W i mmera was that ^only 16 per cent, of the gross takings went to charity, but the honourable member did not show where the rest of the money went to. He did not show that the gest percentage was spent in advertising and in paying commission on the selling of tickets. The 50 per cent, agreed to by the Treasurer is a fair compromise, but as I have expressed the opinion p r i vately to the Treasurer, I think that it will cost more to collect the tax from this source than will be actually received. I do not anticipate that the revenue from the very small percentage of entertainments that come under this clause will be more than £4,000 or £5,000 per annum. If this irritating taxation could be wiped out it would be a wise step on the part of. the Treasurer. If during the working of the measure the Treasurer finds that what I have said is true, I hope that he will bring down an amendment giving the Commissioner power to make certain exemptions, at the same time notifying Parliament as to the class of entertainments so dealt with.",22

If one is privileged to look at the expenses he finds that nearly all the money is mopped up by such items as refreshments, hire of costumes, hire of wigs, and so on. It would be well to make provision, either in the Bill or by regulation, to compel every one to pay the maximum amount of the tax until a duly audited balance-sheet is furnished, when the Commissioner may make a rebate if it be necessary to do so.

146,Mr GLYNN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Angas) [2.58] - The mistake in this Bill is that there are too many separate offences grouped under the one penal provision. There are six subclauses with great disparity between them as regards the enormity of the offence dealt with. Apparently the proposal .is to leave it absolutely'to the discretion of the 'Judge in every case to say what penalty shall be, imposed. why there are so many limitations as to sentences in our Statutes is that we distrust the wisdom even of Judges in regard to the imposition of sentences. In Great Britain there have been Judges who have inflicted sentences of fifteen years' imprisonment for offences for which other Judges have not imposed sentences of more than twelve months' imprisonment. The last' offence provided for is the fraudulent gumming, sticking, or attaching to each other by any process whatever the pieces of a stamp or stamped ticket which has been divided or cut. Therefore, if a youngster fifteen years of age gummed together the pieces of a ticket to get admission into a subordinate entertainment, he would be guilty of an in dictable offence, and could be sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years if the Judge trying the case were foolish enough to impose such a penalty. The Treasurer says that he has been copying the English legislation in this matter, but I would point out that a good many of the faults in our war legislation are due to the slavish copying of the English law. Thus we have adopted the moratorium laws of the Old Countrv holus bolus, without regard to the action of the States. We ought not to copy English legislation without regard to our local conditions.

165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Yes , and they have given two or three turns to the screw since Federation. I agree with the right honourable member for Swan that this double-banking of taxation must come to an end at some point. It cannot go on indefinitely ; but I think this tax is an unfortunate one to choose for making a fight. If possible, I would rather see a clear line of demarcation agreed upon, so that our respective spheres of taxation may be adjusted scientifically. But in time of war. anything which savours of luxury is a proper subject for taxation for war purposes. I hope the time will soon come when we shall readjust altogether our - ideas of taxation. The sooner we reach that day, the better; but, until that time, this National Government is entitled to tax any luxury for the purposes of the war, and not for the purposes of the ordinary civil administration of the country. At the same time, I agree with the right honourable member for Swan that if the double-banking of taxation proceeds as at present it will bankrupt both the States and the. Commonwealth. As to the suggestion that I am a Unifieationist, I must let my record be my answer. Ever since I have been in the Federal sphere I have stood for reasonable State rights; and I think State rights rest on the safest and surest foundations when they recognise our national rights, and the supremacy of the National"" Government, particularly .in the strenuous days of war.",24
166,Mr GLYNN,ENTERTAINMENTS TA X,"Angas) [3.20] - I quite agree with the Leader of the Opposition that we must use every reasonable source of taxation in war time, and, of course, conwe cannot quibble at the amount of the sacrifices we are called upon to make, considering the tremendous pressure to hear on the men who are gallantly fighting for us in the trenches. In comparison with what they are doing, our little abnegations are not worth talking ahout. At the same time, in raising taxation it is incumbent upon us to raise it in the manner most productive to the State, most uniform, requiring the least machinery, and in the manner closest to economic principles. I do think that, in the taxation of entertainments, we ought not to be duplicating the machinery of the States. In America a meeting is held periodically to arrange between the State and the Federal authority what taxes are to be imposed by them respectively; for, while it is competent for both Congress and the State Legislatures to impose any direct tax, yet in matters of minor taxation they realise the folly of having two sets of machinery to produce the same result, and two sets of taxes on the same individual under different laws. I am glad that, after the slumberous composure of the last fifteen years, the Prime Minister and the Premiers are awaking to the importance of some measure of Unification in connection with the direct taxation of land, electoral laws, and also iucome tax. This policy was recommended by . many of us in the early days of Federation. In 3901 I moved in regard to t-ome - of these matters, and I find now an awakening to their importance. In the course of the debate in 1910, attention was drawn to the evil of having two methods of valuation for income-tax purposes, and two sets of laws applicable to the same individual.. It is for that reason that the right honourable member for Swan referred to the fact that it was expected that, whilst we would not surrender our powers of direct taxation, in minor matters some arrangement should be arrived at as to the exercise of our rights. It would be even possible to arrange that the total amount of the taxation should be collected for botli authorities by the (one set of machinery. I hope that some Administration will prove' itself worthy of the good name that should attach to a wise Administration, by looking into these matters, which, though they do not pay for the moment, from a party point of view, are of great importance to the taxpayers of the States. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. Afr. Gltfnn. INCO ME TAXBILL (No. 3). In Committee of Ways and Means:  [3.25] - I m o v e That a tax be imposed on incomes derived from sources in Australia at the following rates, namely:NA PERSONAL EXERTION. (a) Por so much of the whole taxable income as does not exceed £7,600 the rate of tax per pound sterling shall be threepence and three eight-hundredths of one penny where the taxable income is One pound sterling, and shall increase uniformly with each increase of One pound sterling of the taxable income by three eight-hundredths of one penny. The average rate of tax per pound sterling for so much of the taxable income as does not exceed £7,600 may be calculated from the following formula: R = average rate of tax in pence per pound sterling. I = taxable income in pounds sterling. R (3- - J I ) pence. 800 (&) For every pound sterling of taxable income in excess of £7,600 the rate of tax shall be sixty pence. NA FROM PROPERTY.

R = (3 + ) pence. 181.058 (6) For income of a taxable value exceeding £546, but not exceeding £2,000, the rate of tax shall be calculated in the following manner:-The rate of tax on each additional pound shall increase continuously with the increase of the taxable value of the incpme in a curve of the second degree in such a manner that the increment of tax for one pound increase of taxable income shall beat a taxable income of £546, 11.713 pence, at a taxable income of £600, 12.768 pence, at a taxable income of £700, 14.672 pence, at a taxable income of £800, 16.512 pence, at a taxable income of £900, 18.288 pence, at a taxable income of £1,000, 20.000 pence, at a taxable income of £1,500, 27.600 pence, at a taxable income of £2,000, 331600 pence, (c) For income of a taxable value exceeding £2,000 the rate of tax shall be calculated in the following manner:For so much of taxable value as does not exceed £6,500 the rate of tax on each additional pound shall increase continuously with the increase of .'the taxable value of the income in a curve of the third degree in such a manner that the increment of tax for one pound increase of taxable income shall beat a taxable income of £2,000, 33.600 pence, at a taxable income of £2,500, 40.000 pence, at a taxable income of £3,000, 45.300 pence, at a taxable income of £3,500, 49.600 pence, at a taxable income of £4,000, 53.000 pence, at a taxable income of £4,500, 55.600 pence, at a taxable income of £5,000, 57.500 pence, at a taxable income of £5,500, 58.800 pence, at a taxable income of £6,000, 59.600 pence, at a taxable income of £6,500, 60.000 pence. For every pound sterling of taxable income in excess of £6,500. the rate of tax shall be sixty ' pence. NA - DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL EXERTION AND PARTLY FROM PROPERTY. (a) For every pound sterling of taxable income derived from personal exertion, the rate of tax shall be ascertained by dividing the total amount of the tax that would be payable under , the First Schedule if the total, taxable income of the taxpayer were derived exclusively from personal exertion by the amount of the total taxable income. (b) For every pound sterling of taxable income derived from property the rate of fax shall be ascertained by dividing the total amount of the tax that would be payable under the Second Schedule if the total taxable income of the taxpayer were derived exclusively from property by the amount of the total taxable income. In addition to the tax payable under the preceding provisions, there shall be payable, in the case of incomes ih respect of. which the tax is calculated under the foregoing provisions, an additional tax equal to 25 per centum of the amount of the tax so calculated. ' TAX PAYABLE IN CERTAIN CASES BY PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO DEPENDANTS. Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding provisions,, the tax payable by any person who(a) is not married, has no dependants, and is not an absentee, and (b) has a gross income of not less than £100, or, in the case of a person carrying on business in Australia, has an income from the business which, after deducting from the gross income the deductions specified in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of section 18 of the Income Tax Assessment, Act 1915-16 amounts, together with his income from all other sources in Australia, to not £100, and (c) would, apart from ""this provision, not be liable to pay an income tax of £1 ' or upwards, shall be £ 1 . RATES OF TAX UPON THE INCOME OF A COMPANY. (a) For every pound sterling of the taxable . income of a company which has not been distributed to the members or shareholders Company, the rate of tax shall be Is. lOjd. (6) For every pound sterling of the income must be applied. of a company distributed to the members, shareholders, or stockholders of the company who are absentees, and of interest paid or credited by the company to any person who is an absentee, in respect of debentures of the company, or on money lodged, at interest with the company by such person, the rate of tax shall be 6d. The Bill is framed on the lines of the Act which operated for the purpose of the first income tax assessment in the financial year 1915-16. The differences between the two measures are:-(1 ) The increase in the rates by 25per cent.; (2) provision of a separate schedule for ascertaining the rates applicable to parts of composite incomes derived from personal - income and property respectively; (3) provision for ascertaining the rate payable by persons who are not married, who have no dependants, who are not absentees, and whose total incomes from all sources in Australia is not less than £ 1 0 0 ; (4) provision for taxing a company on dividends or interest paid or credited to absentee shareholders, debenture-holders, or depositors, at a flat rate of 6d. in the £1. There is no necessity to explain the 25 per cent, increase. The second d if -' ference, the provision of a separate schedule for ascertaining the rates applicable ADDITIONAL TAX. to parts of composite incomes derived from personal income and property respectively, is necessary owing to the judgment of the High Court in the case of Adam Forsyth v. the Commissioner of Taxation. That case rested upon the interpretation of sub-section 2A of section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1915. The Department has taken the total taxable in come from all sources, and ascertained the amounts of tax that would have been payable on it if it had been derived wholly from personal exertion or wholly from property. By dividing these amounts by the total income, the average rates of tax on the personal exertion basis and the property basis respectively were obtained and applied to so much of the total income as was derived from the respective sources. The High Court held that this method was not supported by less than the law, when the part of - a composite income derived from personal exertion or from property exceeded £7,600 in the case of a personal exertion income, or £6,500 in the case of property income, and that the rates of tax fixed by the ' schedules applicable to income from perof the sonal exertion and property respectively That judgment reduced the tax assessed by an* estimated amount of £30,000. In regard to the third difference, this is a complete departure from the scheme of the Income Tax Act of 1915. In 1915-16 the income tax produced £3,933,471. For 1916-17 Mr Higgs estimated to receive £3,250,000, and from the 25 per cent, increase £1,000,000, making the total £4,250,000. anticipate receiving £1,000,000 from the 25 per cent, increase, because a quarter of £3,250,000 is only £850,000 in round figures. I am informed by the Department that the reduction in the Estimates is caused by adjustments made in assessments and the general decrease in profits from business. So that we do not anticipate to receive as much from the income tax this year as was received last year.",24

On the top of that I anticipate securing increase ? an additional £150,000 by the abolition of the exemption in respect of all in comes of £500 and over,  £156 disappear in the case of incomes of £500 and over?  comes there will be no exemptions.",27

I have here a few examples' of the difference in the which will be paid under this Bill as compared with what is payable under existing law. On an income of derived from personal exertion, a tax £ 3 19s. 7d. would have been paid under the old rate, whereas under this rate tax will be £ 7 19s. 7d. On an income £400 derived from property the tax £ 6 18s. 2d., but under the new rate will be £ 9 2s. 8d.

171,Mr TUDOR,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"The Treasurer said that he had increased the rate of income tax by only about 25 per cent., whereas it would seem that he has increased it by honourable about about 80 per cent, in some cases.  by £800 from personal exertion, the tax under the old rate was £ 1 7 l is . lOd. Under the new rate it will be>£25.",27
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"The Treasurer surely does not say that is a 25 per cent,  - of 25 per cent. It is the abolition of the exemption that accounts for the increase over and above the percentage.",27
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Then why say this is an increase of 25 per cent., when it .would appear to be an increase of any- thing from 50 per cent, to 100 per cent. ?  the abolition of the exemption it is an in crease of only 25 per cent. An income of o r £1,000 from personal exertion under the 6 , as old rate paid a tax of £ 2 7 17s. 3d. On Under this rate it will pay £ 3 5 3s. I d . On an income of £ 1 , 5 0 0 . from personal exertion, the tax formerly payable was. £53 18s. I d , Under the new rate it will tax be £ 6 7 7s. 7d. On an income of £2,000 from personal exertion, the tax under the the old rate was £ 8 7 10s.; under the new £400 rate it will be £ 1 0 9 7s. 6d. It will be of observed that the increase in the tax becomes proportionately less as the amount the of income rises. This is due to the fact of that under the old law the exemption was disappeared when .an income reached it £1,020 per annum. It is the abolition of £500 the exemption on all incomes of £ 5 0 0 and over that is responsible for the in creased payments in respect of the lower incomes. On an income of £8,000 from personal exertion a tax of £1,097 10s. was payable; but under this: Bill the tax payable will be £1,371 17s. 6d.  surer blame for this ? Does he blame the mathematical curve?  figures. They are from a scale I have had prepared, showing the taxation that will be payable on all incomes, from the lowest grade upwards. Under this Bill , the income of a person without dependants becomes taxable when it reaches £ 1 0 0 per annum; but there is a gradually disappearing exemption, which wholly disappears when' an income of £500 is reached. Under the old law in respect of a person - without dependants no tax was payable on an income of £156 from personal exertion. Under this Bill , however, a person without dependants earning such an income will pay £ 1 Is. 3d. Under the old law, l is . 7d. would have been paid on an income of £200 per annum from personal exertion; under this law, a tax of £ 2 5s. 2d. will be paid. On an income of £300, a tax of £ 2 2s. 6d. would have been paid under the old law, but under this Bill the tax payable will be £ 5 2s. 6d. On an income of £400 under the old law, a tax of £ 3 19s. 7d. would have been paid by a person without dependants; under this law, the tax will be £ 9 7s. 6d. The increased payments are brought about partly by the abolition of the exemption in respect of all incomes of £500 and over, and partly by the increase of 25 per cent. on.the flat rate applying to all incomes.",27

The Department is particularly anxious that this Bill should be passed without delay. I regret that time will not permit a much simpler form of taxation, but I hope that in the futur e either myself or another Treasurer will have the benefit of some arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth to insure uniformity of method. This would be a great saving, not only to the Commonwealth, but to the taxpayer, in as much as, at the present time, owing to the complex nature of the forms, it is necessary to engage an expert to make up the returns. However, there is to be. a conference early next year between representatives of the Commonwealth and the States with a view to arriving at some uniform basis for the future. There is no necessity, in my opinion, to have so many duplications as there are today. The ordinary taxpayer, when he makes out his return for the Commonwealth, ought to know that at the same time he has made out a return that will apply to the State.",28
177,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"The exemptions are not the same, and they ought to be.  the present form of taxation.",28
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"[3.47] - I confess that the Treasurer has me completely ""knocked o u t "" with his curves and his schedule. However scientifically the honourable gentleman may express himself, and however precise may be his mathematics, we have the result here in plain cold figures; and it seems to me, looking at the figures, that we have here a simple device to begin on - the lower rungs of this tax, and make tliem as high as possible while leaving the others at, perhaps, a moderate rate. We have been led to believe that what was proposed was an increase of 25 per cent, in the income tax; but it turns out that, in some of its bearings, the increase amounts to nearly 100 per cent. Let us take the case already presented, namely, that of a man with £500 a year from personal exertion. This is the man who, with, his fixed in come, is today in many ways hard put to it, considering the social and other obligations laid upon him. Such a man, who feels the pinch, perhaps, as much as any in the community, will pay under the Bill £12 13s. in taxation as compared with £ 6 3s. previously-a n increase of over 100 per cent. That, I venture to say, is a tax that nobody ever dreamed would be attempted when the Government made their announcement to the House. Surely, under the circumstances, some alteration should be made. We ought not to .pretend that we are imposing an increase of 25 per cent, when, as a matter of fact, the increase is from 75 per cent, to 100 per cent. I suggest to the Treasurer that he should do away with all this rigmarole of figures, wipe out his curves, and let Mr Knibbs, as a sort of recreation, go over the matter during the Christmas holidays. The Treasurer could, I think, by a simple enacting clause, increase the taxation by 25 per cent, in the way promised. This ought not to prove by any means a difficult matter; and all the provisions about exemptions and so for th might be left to a future period, when we are reviewing the finances as a whole. This is not the time to deal with such a question exhaustively, and, further, this has come on us all as a surprise.  sired an increase in the income tax.",28

180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"That is an easy way of putting it , but would not the proper way be to say that such a man is called upon to pay double what he paid before? In view of what it means in revenue, I question whether it is worthwhile getting at these men, who find themselves heavily taxed all round now. It all comes from the Treasurer slavishly following his predecessor, that Svengali who covered things up in his own way, and hypnotized us until we did not know where we were.",29
181,Mr HIGGS,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,If it is as should like to have time to look into the matter.,29
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Eve n the ex-Treasurer desires time to look into the matter; and I think the better way would be to make some simple proposal, such as I have suggested.",29

185,Mr HUGHES,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Is about to die. I stand here as a humble but stalwart champion of this method of taxation. The calculation is scientific, equitable, and, by general consent, effective.",29
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,You are really responsible for it ; you began this curving business!,29
187,Mr HUGHES,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"In order to deal with the thir d degree in sub-section c, there is required an introduction to take the form of almost-well , I shall not say an Odyssey-bu t it requires a suitable in troduction, whereas my colleague has broken it to the Committee too abruptly. The two sets of figures have to be read in connection, and the fatal mistake of the Treasurer was in attempting to deal""with them singly. I am not going to express any astonishment at the results that are allegedly declared by this method; all I desay is-and no one can deny it-that the basis is scientific. By mathematical, in finitesimal, and equitable gradations, each £ 1 of additional income bears its fair additional increment of taxation. If the result prove - unsatisfactory, that would appear* to me to be ample proof that the taxpayer has unaccountably found himseli in the wrong place; if he were lower down in the schedule, the tax would press on him less hardly. The intention was to increase the taxation by 25 per cent. But the Treasurer, as he pointed out in his second-reading speech, decided to remove certain exemptions, and that has caused the trouble. I have no doubt the Treasurer will consider what has been said, and, if possible, proceed with the Assessment Bill while he and his officers, have an opportunity to generally consider the position.  you say, I have to withdraw this Bill ?",29
188,Mr HUGHES,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"No , no. If it is found that the amount of money the Treasurer requires cannot be reduced, then, of course, it cannot be reduced. It is quite impossible to make an amendment such as the Leader of the Opposition haa suggested, unless and until there has been an opportunity to find precisely what the effect would be on the Treasury; and it cannot be expected that this could be calculated at a moment's notice. The amendment might, perhaps, make a difference of £100,000 in the revenue.  ence of £120,000.",29
189,Mr HUGHES,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"It is evident that the revenue cannot stand that. If an additional 25 per cent., with the exemptions removed, gives a certain revenue, and if to restore the exemptions means a loss of revenue to the extent of £120,000, perhaps the loss may he made up by in creasing the income tax by 27J per cent. I do not know whether that would be the case, but, no doubt, there must be an increment which would give an equiva' lent return. The Treasurer must have the money, and the question is how to get it with the least possible hardship on the community generally. I agree that people with incomes of £500 may already nave burdens on them which are very difficult to bear, and that we have nd right . to impose a heavier proportion of the tax on them than on the man with £50,000, but if we lessen the burden on the men with incomes of £500, we must place the burden somewhere eise. That means that we must steepen.the curve, so that instead of the increase being 25 .per cent, on all incomes it may be 26 per cent, or 27 per cent. The Treasurer himself will indicate which course he prefers to follow: whether he will go on with the Assessment Bill now, and take the opportunity of reviewing the taxing measure at a later hour, or whether he proposes to deal with the latter now. Mr ""BOYD (Henty) [4.2] - When the Bill was passed last year just before the Christmas holidays, it was passed on the same attitude that the Prime Minister has adopted today- He . admitted that he did not understand anything about' it , but the House caught the infection of his genial laughter, and the Bill was allowed to go through without a solitary member knowing the ABC of it . Here, again, not a solitary member of this House can explain the schedule before us today, The position nowadays is. that an officer of the Treasury, or a statistical expert of the\ Commonwealth, dove-tails some scheme for taxation drawn' from the higher mathematics, and puts it before Parliament in the shape of a Bill , and when honourable members go to their constituencies they cannot explain its meaning. On several occasions I was asked by some of my constituents to explain the schedule of the last Bill , but I said that I would take home to my children the curve and the problem contained in it , and see whether they could work it out, for I could not do so. My constituents said to me, "" Then why did you allow a Bill like this to go through?"" I candidly confessed that it was because I did not understand it , and that I had been told that it was a scientific, accurate, and equitable schedule. I am told that the schedule now before us is also scientific, accurate, and equitable.",30
190,Mr HUGHES,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,So it is.,30
191,Mr BOYD,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Well , I deny that it is. The man who says that this schedule is scientific, accurate, and equitable should be able to prove that it is. When the Prime Minister was asked to explain the schedule in the last Bill , he smiled broadly. But that was no explanation.",30
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"On e of my constituents, who is an expert mathematician, insists that the schedule is not accurate.",30
193,Mr BOYD,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"If we wish to get a solution of the difficulty, let the right honourable gentlemen bring their two experts here to settle it between them; we will all be dead by the time the explanation is given.",30
194,Mr EODGERS,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,What has the taxpayer got to do with' the system of assessing the tax ?,30
195,Mr BOYD,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"The principal thing is that we should know what we have to pay. When I get a notification from my banker that my overdraft is so much, and that he wants me to wipe it out, I know what I have to pay. When the Postmaster General charges me for telephone calls, many of which I know I have never used, f simply pay up. As representatives of the people we ought to understand clearly the meaning of these formulae. I reflect on"" no honourable member when I say that there are not two men in the House who could explain them. When taxation is imposed is it not reasonable that the people who have to pay it should have some enlightenment upon it from those who have passed the legislation?",30
196,Mr ARCHIBALD,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"How could we have a properly graduated tax without these formula? ? Mr BOYD' - I do not care twouence about a graduated scale, so long as I can understand it , and so long as I am assured that it is all right ; but though we were told that the proposal wasto place a 25 - per cent, super-tax on the existing income tax, we find"" it works out that the man with an income of £ 5 00 pays an increase of over 100 per cent.",30
197,Mr MATHEWS,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,Because he paid too little previously.,31
198,Mr BOYD,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"That is a different proposition. "" Mr ABCHIBALD - It is accounted for by the removal of the deduction.",31
199,Mr BOYD,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"A thousand reasons may account for it , but if the Treasurer must have increased revenue, and an increase of 25 per cent, will not give it , then the Treasurer, as the Prime Minister suga gests, make the increase 26 per cent., or even 30 per cent., so as to secure the quisite revenue instead of putting before honourable members a l o t of Egyptian hieroglyphics such as we have in f r o n us today, and which we are asked to agree to, and later on to explain to constituents. It will not only put individual honourable member in a ridi culous position, it will also make Parliabe ment appear stupid. I do not know any State that has a scheme of income taxapropound tion similar to this. If we take rough-and-ready method adopted_ toria, where the graduated scale goes up in £ 1 0 0 stages, it is easily understood; but where we impose a graduated rise (3 + 1 over 181.058) pence, what is variation in the scale from £400 to £500 Will the Prime Minister work it out me?",31
200,Mr HUGHES,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,It is only the second formula that is difficult.,31
201,Mr BOYD,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Can the Prime Minister explain thisThe average rate of tax per pound sterling for so much of the taxable income as does exceed £,7,600 may be calculated from lowing formula:- > K = average rate of tax in pence per sterling. I = taxable income in pounds sterling. R = (3 - l 1) pence.",31
202,Mr HUGHES,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,That is perfectly simple.,31
203,Mr BOYD,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,It is as clear as mud.,31
204,Mr HUGHES,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"No . The rate is to be per £ 1 as 3d. plus 3 over multiplied by the income. That will give the result in pence. That is quite simple problem. The honourable member will never get out of the lowest form less he "" bucks up . """,31
205,Mr BOYD,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"The Prime Minister got out of - the form he was in last year when he shifted this proposition on to the surer. It was evidently too steep for . salary? him. I would like to know how he got on in his last examination. But, seriously, I ask him and the Treasurer to consider the question of placing before honourable members the principle of the tax in such a way that every one can understand it ; not only every honourable member, but also every person who has to pay the tax, so that he may understand what he has to pay, and be able to calculate it for himself. If I am sent up for t r i a l, and the Court proceedings are conducted in let the Greek or Dutch language, when I , as Britisher, think that I ought to be tried in the English language, would I be satisrefied with the verdict-unles s I was let off? We are quite prepared to pay the amount of taxation that the Governmenr t of say it is necessary to raise in this war time, but the scheme laid before Parliaour ment should be clear and distinct, and the honourable members should know what - they are doing. Furthermore, it should the work of the Government, and nor. that of an expert in a Department, to schemes of this sort. Not one th© honourable member can understand the in Vicscheme before us today.",31
206,Mr TUDOR,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Yarra) [4.14] - It is u n of fortunate that we have not before us a the statement showing the operation of the ? proposed tax on varying amounts. It was for understood by honourable. members that the existing tax was to be increased by 25 per cent., but, according to the examples given today, instead of the in crease being 25 per cent., it is over 100 per cent, on certain incomes. On an income of £500 the increase in not taxation is about 100 per cenl., and on the folan income of- £600 between 75 and 80' per cent., because of the alteration that ispound proposed in the exemption. Previously, all incomes below £156 were exempt from 3 taxation, but now the income of a person who has no dependants is not exempt if 80 0 it exceeds £ 1 0 0 . If it is fair that the man without dependants, getting a salary of £ 1 0 0 a year, should pay £ 1 , it isof tax equally fair that a man getting £ 1 5 6 800 should pay a like amount; but, in m y opinion, neither salary should be taxed. a I do not agree with the honourable member for Wannon that the exemption should unbe lowered so far as small salaries areconcerned.",31
207,Mr RODGERS,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,Does the honorableTreamember regard £500 a year as a small',31

211,Mr TUDOR,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"We should have a clearer statement of the incidence of the proposed taxation. If the Customs Department tried to deal with the public in the way here proposed, its' charges would not be understood by the business community, who comprise, as a rule, the best educated persons in the country. Without the assistance of a ready reckoner, such as was issued by the In come Tax Department last year, most persons cannot know what they will have to pay.",32
212,Mr ABCHIBALD,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,Parliamen t ways clamoured for a scientific graduation,32
213,Mr TUDOR,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"We are given to understand that the method proposed is mathematically correct, but I doubt if even members who have had a University education can explain it . Unfortunately for them, not many of my constituents are called upon to pay income tax, and, therefore, I have never been asked to explain the methods of the Income Tax Department. If the suggestion of the honourable member for Wannon be carried out, and the exemption lowered, they will be taxed. The honourable member for Wannon said that the members of the Liberal party should not object to the lowering of the exemption so that men with small incomes might be taxed. It is unfortunate that this proposal has been sprung on us at what, perhaps, will be the last sitting of the year. The statement which has been made by the Treasurer this afternoon should have been circulated for the information of honourable members before the discussion of the measure. It seems to me that it would be better under the circumstances for the Treasurer to propose a simple increase o4 25 per cent.",32
214,Mr RODGERS,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Would not the honourable member agree to any reduction of the exemptions, even in respect of a salary as high as £500 a year ?",32
215,Mr TUDOR,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"I have not said so. Last year all incomes under £156 were exempt, and the exemption diminished by £ 1 in £ 1 0 , until it disappeared in regard to salaries of £1,000 or thereabouts. As to the merits,of that proposal, I have nothing to say now, but I consider it unfair to pass the present proposal without discussion and a proper understanding of it . I am certainly in favour of increasing the exemption in respect of children under the ag^e of sixteen. It has been said that we should deal with this matter today, so that the community may not be called upon to pay the Commonwealth and the State income tax at the same time. The State of Victoria now requires returns for the financial year ending on the 30th June, instead of the calendar year-that is, for the same period as that for which the Commonwealth returns must be furnished. In my opinion, we should relieve taxpayers of the trouble of making separate returns, as they do now. Even honourable members whose salary is has al- a fixed amount find the making up of returns a trouble, and to the business community it must be a serious undertaking. I plead for a simpler method of estimating the tax, and for a simpler schedule. We shall be meeting again in February, and I think, therefore, that the Treasurer might agree to a postponement of .these proposals, so that honourable members may have an opportunity to study the examples that he has given, and to deal with the matter with full information.",32
216,Mr RODGERS,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Wannon) [4.26] - I am in favour of raising revenue by income taxation; there can be no sounder or more equitable taxation. Some honourable members have captiously criticised these proposals without understanding them. The only points that are now at issue are whether the exemptions shall be retained at what they were or reduced, and whether the rate of the tax shall be increased by 25 per cent. We, on this side, have always contended that it is unfair to exempt one section of the community from taxation. The members of the Corner party claim that in practice all taxes are borne by the whole community. That is too big a subject for me to pursue this afternoon. It is of very little concern to the constituents of the honourable member for Yarra what the exact machinery for computing the income tax may be. That is entirely a matter for the taxation officials. Being highly scientific, the computation must be complicated. The scale makes a distinction between the taxation of small incomes and that of large incomes. would be, however, unfair during war time to absolutely exempt from persons who can afford to pay, the whole burden on the comparatively few well to do. The obligation of fighting for the country has been recognised by individuals in every class of the I should like to know why a single man with an income of £150 a year should not pay taxation. Every one whose income is above that amount might fairly be taxed on a graduating scale of increases, because it may be assumed that £3 a week will provide the necessaries for a home. The people, especially in war time, sliould be prepared to pay in accordance the privileges which they enjoy. At a time like this all capital should be assumed for the purpose of taxation to return a certain minimum interest. Unless you make that provision you allow crafty to hide their incomes and to evade taxation. A balance-sheet should be associated with every return of income, and there should be an assumed return of , say, 4| per cent, all the capital during war time. be that certain industries would be hard hit, and pay more than they should under that system; but in war time, when money must be found, I cannot conceive of a more equitable system of taxation the income tax. The present Government and their predecessors have forecasted a wealth tax to provide funds for the purpose of prosecuting this war. Let us imagine the case of a widow and her children, to whom £2,000 has been bequeathed. Under the proposed tax, that £2,000 will hive to bear a levy of £30, although the revenue from it, if the capital be invested at the highest rate of interest-6 per cent - would only £120. I have heard no honourable members in the Labour Opposition Corner raise their voices against the iniquity of taking away £30 from the capital frpm which the widow and children are to derive their income. But I have heard protests from all round the chamber because those who were previously are to be hit by an equitable* form of taxation. I agree with the proposals of the Treasurer in the main. If there is one equitable form of taxation, it is the inMr Rodgers. come tax, because it makes no distinction as to the source from which a man gets his income, whether from shipping, mines, or land. All must pay on the same basis. It I have a distinct objection to that particular form of taxation which assails the taxation man who puts his money into land. There putting are land-owners' in this country who have uot much equity, when they have to pay"" two land taxes and two income taxes, while men; whose fleets are floating round community. the world, are collecting 200 per cent, and 300 per cent, more profits than ever before. Their industry is operated from no base, but they are allowed to go free, whilst the men who carry on the primary industries of the country are singled out for special taxation.'",32
217,Mr SAMPSON,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Wimmera) [4.32] - I hope the Committee will hesitate before with slaughtering the proposals of the Treasurer. There can be no doubt that the Committee agrees with most writers that the income tax is the fairest form of taxation. As the Leader of the official Labour individuals party remarked, it is unfortunate that the Treasurer did not introduce his proposals at an earlier date, in order to give the House an opportunity of studying them in minimum detail. As I understand these proposals, from the Treasurer is asking the Committee to It may increase the rate of tax by 25 per cent , to lower to £ 1 0 0 the exemption allowable to those who have no dependants, and to make an allowance of an additional £ 1 3 - for each child. He proposes, also, that than the exemption shall ct ase at £500, instead of at £ 1 , 0 2 0 . ' In Victuria, the exemption has always terminated at £500. When this Parliament imposed the income tax last year, it made the exemption too high. The Treasurer has stated that, owing to the extent to which the war profits tax is wealth likely to affect incomes, he expects the receipts from the income tax to be reduced by £700,000 or £800,000. If the Committee insists upon taking another slice yield from the income tax revenue, where is the Commonwealth to obtain the money with which to finance the war? A good deal of criticism has been offered in regard to the schedule. It is not a good principle to have' increases in the rate of taxation at every £ 5 0 or £ 1 0 0 . This schedule clearly sets out the basis upon which the exempt income tax will be levied, and the amount of tax that will be paid on incomes of all amounts. An objection has been raised that the taxpayer will not be able to ascertain from this schedule what his liability to the Department is. I am confident that the majority of taxpayers, when they submit their schedules, leave it to the Tax Department to assess the amount of tax they must pay, just as we leave it to our banker to calculate the interest we must pay on our overdrafts. .",33

219,Mr SAMPSON,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,Any trained accountant can work out the amount of the tax on any income from this schedule.,34
220,Mr COBSEB,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,Every person is not a trained accountant.,34
221,Mr SAMPSON,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"When my income tax assessment reaches me, I can calculate the tax accurately enough to satisfy me as to whether the computation of the Department is correct. I would sooner have a schedule based on a scientific principle than a schedule which increases the rates of taxation at every' £ 5 0 or £ 1 0 0 . Por instance, in Victoria the lowest rate commences at £100. The tax then increases at various stages until at about £500 the exemption is extinguished. The effect is that the man who has an income of £490 gets the full benefit of the exemption, but the man whose income is £ 5 0 i gets no exemption whatever."" Under the system contained in this schedule a man pays on a graduated scale, every pound of income bearing its own weight, and receiving the exemption that is-due to it . If the Treasurer could see his way clear to postpone further consideration of the tax u n t i l a later hour in the day, so that honourable members might have a chance of reckoning the effect of the adjustments he has made, it would be an advantage to - all of us; but having regard to the war profits taxation to be' dealt with later, and to the levy in connection with the repatriation scheme, I ask the Committee to hesitate before asking the Treasurer to slice off £120,000 from his income by altering this schedule, which, I say, is based on a thoroughly scientific and sound principle. If the exemption was too high before, the Treasurer has done right to reduce it . I understand that because of the exemption, and the raising of the allowance for each child, the gradual extinction of the exemption until it expires at £500, instead of £1,020 as formerly, and the increase of 25 per cent, in the tax, there is a large apparent increase in the tax on incomes between £100 and £ 5 0 0 . The schedule seems to have been adjusted in order to give us a more scientific system of income taxation, a method of taxation which every honourable member agrees is a fair one.  would like the^ Treasurer to reconsider - this scheme before he asks me to vote for the Deit. An y proposal that may be brought forward on a scientific basis will receive my support if it can be shown to be fair and equitable. I am agreeable that what, is commonly known as a living wage should be exempt from taxation. ' If theliving wage be fixed at £ 1 5 6 , let incomes; up to that amount be absolutely exempt.",34
222,Mr SAMPSON,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Nobod y is objecting to that.  is just in regard to a man who is earning only £156, there ought to be the same exemption of the living wage in the case of a man earning £1,000 a year. All in come over and above that living wage the Treasurer may tax by any scientific formula he chooses to adopt. Income that has been earned is quite capable of bearing taxation. One of the reasons which' the Treasurer has advanced for this scheme is that.whilst he is decreasing the exemption on some income in a certain ratio, he is giving another concession in the form of an increased allowance for each child. The honourable member knows as well as I do that the men who are earning today incomes over and above the living wage are principally men well up in years, and that, their families beinogrown up, they do not get the benefit of this allowance for each child. Therefore, that increase in the allowance for children cannot operate as an inducement to pass the schedule. It operates merely in regard to those who are young, and whose opportunities are such that they can earn just the living wage, which I am willing to exempt. I say again, that if £156. is to be regarded as a living wage, it should be sacrosanct, and be exempt in regard to all income. That would be a fair and reasonable attitude for the Treasurer to adopt. Then those who are earning largerincomes could be made to bear the burden of taxation to whatever extent the Treasurer thinks necessary. Let me refer briefly now to the method by which the amount of tax payable on a given in come is to be determined. Here we have what is commonly known as the mathematical curve. I can understand what it means, but it may be difficult to explain it to a general audience. We bave an algebraic formula put forward as a means of ascertaining the tax payable on any income; but under that formula, in order to arrive at the actual amount of taxation payable on a given income, one might have to dive into no less than six places of decimals. It would be practically impossible for a man on a public platform to explain it to a general audience assembled to hear him give an account of his stewardship, without hurting the selfrespect of his hearers by treating them as one would treat a child in an elementary school. In order to make himself intelligible, he would have to do so.",34
223,Mr WEBSTER,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"He would merely need a blackboard and a piece of chalk.  of patience, in order to give his audience even an elementary knowledge of algebra. But when you come, as in this case, to something approaching - the differential calculus, which is amongst the highest of our mathematical studies, the position is still worse. As it is, if a member were asked by an intelligent constituent in a public meeting how the formula was applied, he would have to hurt the feelings of other people, who could not follow his explanation unless he resorted to the simplest terms. If this system is to be ' adopted, then I suggest that every member of Parliament should be armed with a sort of ready reckoner, so that when a constituent approaches him to ascertain what is likely to be the tax on his income, he may be able to enlighten him without having to resort to the devious ways of the third degree, the mathe^ matical curve, and all these algebraic mulas.",35
224,Mr WEBSTER,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Would a ready reckoner satisfy the honourable member?  need one; but it might satisfy the Postmaster-General. The point that I wish to emphasize is that, since on an income of £500 the increase in the tax would amount to something over 100 per cent., instead of 25 per cent., as we were led to believe, the Treasurer should allow the exemption to continue as before until an income of £1,020 is reached. That would give him an opportunity to increase the present rate of tax up to, say, 26 per cent, or 27 per cent, on incomes below £1,000 a year, without involving such a drastic and extraordinary increase as is embodied in the proposal now before us. When the public realise what this proposition really means, I do not think they will thank jthis Parliament for imposing a burden of over 100 per cent, increase in respect of certain incomes which cannot bear that additional impost. Incomes between £300 and £800 are today bearing a very large portion of the taxation of the country. The public will be surprised when they realise that those who have incomes of from £1,000 to £7,000 per annum are not being called upon, under this proposal, to bear anything like a proportion of the extra taxation' which is falling upon those who have incomes of between £400 and £800. I ask the Treasurer to make his scheme a little more equitable, and, if possible, to do away with this algebraic formula for ascertaining the amount of tax payable on a given income, so that there may be an ordinary reply to an ordinary question that may be put'to an ordinary-politician in regard to the amount of tax payable on any income.",35
225,Dr MALONEY,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,"Melbourne) [5.51]. - Whil e I have the greatest admiration for the highly-cultured gentleman who supplied the Treasury with this system of determining the taxation payable on incomes, I am afraid that his formula will be the cause of many headaches. I should like to compare this system of ascertaining the amount of taxation payable with that prevailing in Great Britain, and particulars of which are to be found in Hazell's Annual. The sysfor- tem followed in Great Britain appears to be simplicity itself, compared with the highly-technical formula adopted by us. It can be understood by a schoolboy, whereas our method can be understood only by clever accountants. I asked three different accountants to explain to me a certain matter relating to income tax payable under the Commonwealth Act; but, apparently, .they were puzzled, since I could not get two of them to agree as to the amount to be levied. At page 582 of Hazell's Annual for 1915 there appears a table showing the amount of tax payable on certain incomes under the Imperial Finance Act of 1914, and under the proposals made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 17th November, 1914. table:TAX PROPOSED POR 1915-16, AT DOUBLE TBE RATES CBABOED UNDER FINANCE ACT Income.

It should be the duty of every statesman to try to make the taxation proposals of the Government so simple that every taxpayer can clearly underweek stand what he has to pay, without having to consult an accountant.",35
226,Mr GREENE,BATES OF TAX IN RESPECT OF TAXABLE INCOME,All the taxation schemes sity. of the late Government were based on the same lines as that now before us. This system was originated by the late Governof ment in connection with the land tax.,36

As I said before, I am very glad to find that consideration, in the case the income tax, is given to married men with , families, for no doubt such men are serving the State unselfishly, and the best advantage. A married man with a large family spends three or four times as much as does a single man, and, over, contributes in a much greater to the revenue through the Customs House. Our Customsrevenue is something like £17,000,000, or £ 3 8s. per capita, married man with six children contributes £ 2 7 4s. before he is touched by the come tax, as against £ 3 8s. spent by single man.

I must confess that, the examples are a perfect eye-opener to me. It appears that it is not until incomes of £1,500 are reached that the proposed increase of 25 per cent, of operates, and that down to £400 the tax is almost doubled, while in no case is it only 25 per cent. But we are only having to the usual experience when we find such proposals as these introduced' on the last day of the session, when, of course, they morehave to be rushed through. Something degree has been said in condemnation of the Federal basis of taxation, but I infinitely prefer it to that of the States. I do not and a profess to be able to explain the mathematical aspect, but I know that I in - have to pay a great deal less on the the Federal basis than I have to pay under the rough-and-ready system that prevails, not only in my own State, but, so far as .

The ' States basis is not only unscientific, but Surely the Labour a party have been in power long enough to to make some effort to have a uniform basis of valuation and taxation, and to provideare that the returns shall be made at one period of the year. At present two sets of income tax returns and two sets of land tax returns have to be sent in at different times; one has no sooner done with the State returns than the Federal returns have to be prepared. Taxation is mounting up in a most extraordinary way, and it continues this will be a good enough that country to get out of.

This introduces a new principle. It is very hard to say whether this profit should or should* not be taxed. It is often difficult to determine what is capital and what is not, and a profit obtained in this way may have been accruing over several years instead of coming in one year. However, I shall not oppose the amendment. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 6 (Taxation, of companies).",39
244,Mr GLYNN,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Angas) [5.39] - This is a clause that requires a good deal of study, though I think that, on the whole, it is right. Under section 16 of the Act the income of a company is the balance of the total income after deducting t e payments 1 by way of interest or dividend. There was a doubt whether, in the case of a company carrying on business - here, but incorporated elsewhere, payments of in terest to debenture-holders not resident in Australia were liable to income tax, that is, whether we had the jurisdiction which wo professed to have in respect of them, and could tax the interest paid to them., at the l t has been decided in America that a similar tax is invalid. An inconvenience, Commiswhich was pointed out by a few of us when the measure was under consideration, is that by making the company here an agent for the absentee shareholder or debenture-holder who is living in London or elsewhere, for the purpose of levying the tax in respect of his dividends or in shareterest, we can prevent the company from being sued for the .reimbursement of the amount. Although we collect the tax here, and make it compulsory on the company to .pay it , we cannot empower the company to deduct it in England, and, therefore, if the absentee preferential shareholder chooses to sue the company at home, it can be obliged to pay to him the tax that the Commonwealth has collected. The amendment of the law now proposed enables us, without any doubt, to tax the interest paid to preferential shareholders resident in England; and to tax dividends paid to absentee shareholders. If a company, registered in England, starts business in Australia, we tax the whole of its profits here, and under the amendment now proposed we endeavour to make the preferential shareholders or debenture-holders pay taxation. We tax the whole of the company's income made here, and then allow the debenture-holders, if resident in Australia, to get an abatement in respect of their proportion of the tax. debenture-holder or preferential shareholder resides in England, there is no power to allow the company to make a deduction in respect of his interest. We collect the tax from the company, but I am almost convinced that we have no power to make absentee debenture-holders contribute to our revenue. An absentee, on suing the company, could recover any amount deducted by it from' his interest. We have provided thatA company, notwithstanding any contract, agreement, or arrangement entered into by it, may, with the approval of the Commissioner, charge pro ratd,the amount of the tax actually paid by it against those beneficially interested in the income of the company. In other words, if the company under the earlier portion of the clause income tax on so much of its assessable come as is distributed to shareholders or stockholders who are absentees, or if it has paid 'income tax on 'interest paid or credited by it to an absentee, then we profess to allow it to charge them with what it has paid on their share of total income. We profess to do that to apply the same principle in regard resident debenture-holders or shareholders. But while the Treasurer can collect tax, he cannot enable the company to charge it to debenture-holders or sharethe holders who are absentees, because it been decided in Queensland Spiller v. Turner that the absent preferential shareholders are bound by contract entered into in England, that we have no power to bind them respect of interest paid by the company elsewhere. Although we have power tax a company on the whole of its local profits, and although Treasurer can thus get at the in terest paid to shareholders here, I do not think he can enable the company to regain what it pays from the shareholders or debenture-holders resident in England. That difficulty might be overcome by an amendment as follows: "" Provided that a company shall not be liable under (IA ) of this section to pay income tax on incomes or interest in respect of existing debentures or shares in cases to which (IB ) of this section is, from lack of jurisdiction, inapplicable.""  ber will let me have that suggestion, I will have it inquired into.",39

(1) In the case of a person . . . there shall be deducted . . . the sum of still one hundred and fifty-six pounds, less five pounds. for every eleven pounds by which the income exceeds one hundred and fifty-six pounds."" -.  peal to the Treasurer to reconsider his decision with regard to the abolition of the exemption in respect of all incomes of £500 and over. I propose that the exemption should gradually be reduced u n t i l it disappears on incomes of £1,000, just as it does under the existing law. I move That the word "" eleven,"" line seven, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""twenty-two."" My amendment, if carried, would carry out what I think the public were originally led to believe was the intention of the Treasurer, namely, that the income tax should be increased by 25 per cent, all round. As the Bill stands, the tax on incomes up to £500 is increased by over 100 per cent, instead of by 25 per cent. In other words, such incomes are called upon to bear a burden which is too much for them. Will the Treasurer accept my amendment ? ",41
250,Mr GROOM,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Darling Downs) [6.8] This clause really carries out what the Treasurer announced some time ago that he intended to do. In making his financial statement he said, as reported in Hansard, page 9444Thc only alteration in this tax, compared with the proposals of my' predecessor, is the abolition of the exemption on incomes of £500 and over. The present exemption of £156 on income from personal exertion is allowed in full on all net taxable incomes not exceeding £500. Over that amount it diminishes by £ § ' for every £10 increase in the net taxable income, until it disappears entirely, when the net taxable income reaches £1,020. - That is the only respect in which this proposal varies from that made by the ex-Treasurer. The honourable gentleman himself pointed out that this variation front the proposals of his predecessor would increase to a very great extent the income tax payable on the lower grades of in comes. T'he increase of 25 per cent, is reached only when we come to the higher grades; the increase on the lower grades of income is more than 25 per cent. Will the Treasurer tell us what loss of revenue the adoption of this amendment would involve ? Is the amendment so serious that it would greatly impair his proposals before the Committee ?  [6.11] - I would remind honourable members that they have already agreed to a Bill which makes provision for the abolition of the exemption in respect of all incomes of £500 per annum and over. In making my financial statement. I distinctly told honourable members that an all-round increase of 25 per cent, in the income tax was proposed. I also said that the exemption of £15 6 would disappear when an income of £500 was reached. Tn the working out of this system it is found that incomes of between £200 and £1,020 will be subjected to more .than an increase of 25 per cent, in the tax. That is in consequence of the abolition of the exemption. I am not quite sure what would be the effect of this amendment.",41
251,Mr WATT,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,It means that the exemption would disappear at about £850.  tween £800 and £900 and over.,42
252,Mr WATT,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"What loss of revenue would it involve?  £130,000 per annum.",42
253,Mr WATT,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"This amendment would not involve Such a loss.  ceptance of the amendment at this stage would mean the withdrawal of the Bill , and the introduction of another, and I cannot agree to it .",42
254,Mr GROOM,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Darling Downs) [6.15]. --Without expressing an opinion one way or the other, T take it that the amendment suggested would not interfere with the schedule. If it was desired to raise the same amount of money the schedule would have to be altered, but otherwise the Treasurer has only to shade off the exemptions at a more gradual rate. Of course, the Treasurer knows his requirements, and we must, to a large extent, depend on his recommendations. If he feels that the sacrifice involved is too big for him to make, that ends the matter so far as I am concerned. The whole scheme, to my mind, is most equitable and just.",42
255,Mr TUDOR,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,'Ih e honourable member for Hume could not have submitted the amendment at any other point.,42
256,Mr GROOM,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"TEa t is quite true ; but the Treasurer says what is objected to is an essential part of the scheme, and we must bow fo his judgment in the matter.",42
257,Mr WATT,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Balaclava) [6.18] - Does the Treasurer propose to carry the Bill through at this sitting? ,42
258,Mr WATT,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Some of us made in quiries, and we were told that the Bill would not now be pressed to a final stage. There are certain mercantile interests in volved, and those concerned have been told, by myself amongst others, that they need not worry, because it was understood the Bill would not be proceeded with before Christmas.",42
259,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I understood that.  body to so understand; but, on the contrary, have said that I wished the tax to operate this year.",42
260,Mr WATT,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I do not think that, so far as administration is concerned, it can be so essential to the Treasurer that the measure should be passed now.  honourable member has mentioned not satisfied with the measure?",42
261,Mr WATT,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I do not say that the Legislature is to stand still because of those mercantile interests, but if we have given those concerned to understand that the Bill would not be proceeded with, it may embarrass them somewhat.",42
262,Mr GLYNN,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Does the honourable member know the exact point in which those people are interested ?,42
263,Mr WATT,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I do not. I have not inquired, because 1 was under the i m pression that the measure would not be proceeded with until next February. Of course, tliere may have been a bond fide mistake for which the Treasurer is in no way responsible. The great necessity to the Treasurer is the fixing of the rate for the year; all the other points are minor matters of administration.",42

271,Mr GLYNN,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Angas) [8.5] - Has the Treasurer had the opportunity to confer with his officers in regard to the point I have raised concerning debenture-holders? ,43
272,Mr GLYNN,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Then the matter may as well stand over, but it involves a point of considerable importance. As things now stand, if a company that is registered in England, and carries on business in Australia, borrows money on debentures in England, and the contract is to pay the interest on the debentures in England, we cannot interfere with that contract beyond declaring that the company, in its operations here, can be taxed on the amount of interest paid on the debentures. We leave it to the company to recover from the debenture-holders the amount of the income tax paid on their behalf. As a matter of fact, the company has no recourse against the English debenture-holder as long as the debenture-holder resides in England and lends the money to the company under a contract by which the interest is to be paid in England. The provision made in the Bill , by which the company may make a deduction from to debentureholders in respect of the proportion of the income tax paid, that might be debited to them, is all right s6 l a r as it apbe plies to those who receive their interest or their dividends in Australia, but it will not apply in the case of those of whom I have spoken. Consequently, the company will have to pay for something proviso to that it cannot recover.  to the I should agree to the amendment which any the honourable member has suggested it will mean the loss of considerable revenue.",43
273,Mr GLYNN,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I am not framing an That was a suggestion I renewal drafted on the spur of the moment. It a question of morals. We are attemptof ining to tax absentee shareholders and abas a sentee preferential shareholders by taxof arriving at ing the company.  panies deduct the taxation from the dividends, as is done in England ?",43
274,Mr GLYNN,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Because we have no iurisdiction in that regard. This point has been decided in several cases, and particularly in the case of Spiller versus Turner, a Queensland case, decided in 1897, in which the decision was that the terms of an English contract with the company, under which the company was bound to pay, without deduction, the full amount of interest,' could not be altered. Now we propose to tax that interest, and, apparently, give power to the company to deduct it in face of the contract with the debenture-holder in England, but it cannot be done.",44
275,Mr WEBSTER,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Shoul d we not deduct the taxation before the interest is paidl,44
276,Mr GLYNN,INCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"We deduct the amount of taxation we require hy declaring that the whole of the income of the company is liable to taxation, and we allow the person who receives interest to claim an abatement of his personal taxation in respect of that portion that ought to be debited to that interest, but we enable the company which pays the interest to charge proportionately to the debenture-holder the taxation that it pays collectively. Tn other words, the company will pay the taxation, and not the individual shareholder, but.the company cannot have recourse to the preferential shareholder who resides in England, and has lent his money to the company in England. It is an English contract to pay the interest in England, and is beyond our jurisdiction. Therefore, although it is a proper proposal to get at these preferential share- amendment. holders, we will not be doing' so. The company will have to pay the taxation, and will be unable to deduct the proportion payable by these people, or to recover it from them. T raised this question on the original Bill, and pointed-out that the provisions were ultra vires. It has since heen discoveredthat they were wrongly drafted, and now the' measure has 'been very properly amended, giving the powers that I have indicated; but, incidentally, we are not giving the company the power to pass on the tax to the absentee shareholders. The only method of meeting the difficulty is to have an arrangement with the Imperial Government to enable it to be done, or to past* an amendment such as I have suggested, namely, that the tax will not apply in the case of existing shareholders against whom these companies have no recourse to recover what is paid on their behalf. But I do not press the point, although it affects a considerable number of companies operating in Australia. Clause agreed to. Clauses 13 to 17 agreed to.
