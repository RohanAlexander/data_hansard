2,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," Our nation is forever indebted to Australian Defence Force families who make enormous sacrifices. Partners of serving personnel and children wave their loved ones off at airports and docks not knowing if they will ever see them again. We know a soldier killed on duty pays the supreme sacrifice for their country; so too does their family. All too often last year we acknowledged in this parliament and in moving ramp ceremonies the awful ultimate consequences of what can happen in combat situations as we paid our last respects to brave diggers fallen in Afghanistan. My home town of Wagga Wagga in the Riverina is a triservice town, having bases for the Air Force and Navy at Forest Hill as well as the Army. The Kapooka Army Base is fittingly known as the home of the soldier, as every recruit does their initial training there. I see the number of new service men and women who arrive in Wagga Wagga with their families having moved from another part of the country, or indeed from overseas, to faithfully train and serve in the Australian Defence Force. They contribute mightily to the local economy and to the city's stature and social fabric. This Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012 concerns the Australian citizenship residence requirement of families of overseas lateral recruits Australian Defence Force. A lateral recruit is a member who has served in another nation's military and has subsequently moved to Australia to serve in our Defence Force. These members come from a number of countries, including New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The majority have come from the United Kingdom Royal Navy, marines, army or air force. They bring with them a raft of experience and skills, and they help fill capability and critical gaps which currently exist in the workforce of the Australian armed forces. Australia takes members only where it suits the 'parent' country. An example of this is the Royal Australian Navy is presently taking advantage of the United Kingdom's Strategic Defence and Security Review, which amongst other things is reducing the number of personnel across the United Kingdom's four military services. This has allowed the Royal Australian Navy to increase its recruitment of Royal Navy personnel in order to fill capability gaps within their ranks. A lateral transfer also saves the Australia Defence Force a considerable amount of money and time in training our own personnel. The net benefit Australia receives from recruiting a lateral transfer member far exceeds any potential costs associated with bringing forward the citizenship status of the spouse and dependants of a lateral transfer member. Due to the gaps which currently exist within the Australian Defence Force, it is looking to recruit up to about 300 lateral transfer personnel each year to fill these gaps. The number of lateral transfers recruited each year is entirely the prerogative of the Australian Defence Force. Of the overseas members who join the Australian Defence force, 90 per cent have families who to the move with them to Australia. Given the current recruitment environment in Australia and countries such as the United Kingdom, it is an appropriate time to ensure these families of lateral transfers are afforded the same citizenship status as the serving member. Under the law all lateral transfer members are required to qualify for permanent residency visas before they can take up a position with the Australian Defence Force and before they relocate to Australia. This is a necessary measure as it is a requirement for all members of the Australian Defence Force to be Australian citizens. A prerequisite to citizenship is permanent residency. Currently, spouses or partners and dependants of lateral transfers are granted permanent residency but not citizenship. Under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007section 21(2)(c) and section 23-a permanent resident may be granted citizenship after completing 90 days permanent service in the Australian Defence Force or 180 days service in the reserves. The provision of early citizenship does not allow for the inclusion of a spouse or partner, nor does it include dependants aged 16 years or over. This situation can, and does, lead to discord within families of Defence Force members who have transferred from overseas. For these families the lack of citizenship offers them lack of certainty of their right to remain in Australia should something happen to their spouse or parent who is deployed on military operations. The government has made assurances that support would be provided to families should a deployed lateral transfer member be killed in the line of action, but this provides no comfort to the families of these members. Aside from losing a loved one and not being sure if you can remain in Australia, even if they could stay there is the very real possibility of hardship for these families as they lose an income and are not guaranteed financial assistance through government agencies such as Centrelink. The same issues are also faced by those who may separate and divorce from their spouse who is serving in the defence force. Additionally, children of a serving lateral transfer member cannot gain access to a university HELP based placement unless they are New Zealand citizens, and the cost of university without a construction Commonwealth placement can be financially crippling. This bill will fast-track Australian citizenship for family members of Australian Defence Force personnel, and ensure partners and dependants will be eligible for citizenship at the same time as the serving member. The bill also extends the provisions for citizenship beyond only spouses and dependent children to allow, for example, elderly dependent parents, or disabled dependants who do not qualify as children. Members who join the Reserves will also have the relevant defence service criteria from 180 days to 90 days. It will also spouse and dependants to remain eligible for citizenship in the event the member dies before attaining citizenship. The coalition introduced a near-identical bill to this on 21 May 2012. It was put up by the shadow minister for defence science, technology and personnel-the member for Fadden-who had gone out, spoken to defence personnel and their families and, more importantly, listened to what they told him and formulated a view that we as a parliament and as a coalition needed to do something. His well-researched and clearly articulated bill was a result of his discussions and the result of what he heard. Labor introduced its bill the very next day. The introduction of this bill by Labor is purely political. Labor has done nothing while in office, yet suddenly after the coalition introduced a near-identical bill Labor thought it was time to do something. No-one will buy that spin-certainly not veterans, still wondering why their pensions and superannuation entitlements are not fairly indexed, and certainly not defence people still smarting from the $5.5 billion slashed from Defence in the 8 May budget. The cutbacks brought about by the budget will hurt the Riverina considerably, with of Kapooka's working accommodation delayed by three years and the officer and pilot training systems delayed by 12 months at RAAF Base Forest Hill. This at a time of great unease; this at a time of unrest and instability in the world. Now, as much as ever, we need a proper focus on defence, not a slash-and-burn approach by a government which says it wants to save the planet but is doing little to protect our nation. Labor's additional amendments to this particular legislation are simply a political attempt to differentiate its bill from the coalition's. But it gets worse-far worse: cut Labor is on the record as being against the allow a proposed measures. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship wrote to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel on 4 February 2011. Of the proposed changes contained in Labor's bill he said: â€¦ I do not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation. While the coalition supports these changes over and above its own bill, Labor could easily have introduced them as amendments to the coalition's bill, rather than trying on this political stunt and introducing its own bill. The coalition supports this bill, although it questions the intent and real motives of the Labor government. It is evident that the rushed introduction of Labor's bill is as a direct response to the coalition introducing an almost identical bill just the day beforean attempt to have its bill voted on first, prior to the coalition's bill. Only last year Labor believed it was unnecessary to make such legislative changes. This legislation will provide families with peace of mind through legislative means. Importantly, it is a policy which is wholly welcomed and supported by Defence Families of Australia, those people who, as I said at the outset, give so much to our nation's security and to our nation's well-being. Defence Families of Australia have been marvellous advocates on behalf of defence families and defence personnel across a wide range of issues ranging from defence housing, spousal support and, of course, the need to fix the inequity in families of ADF lateral transfer members. Finally, Defence Families of Australia ought to be acknowledged and thanked, now and always, for their ongoing advocacy on behalf of ADF personnel right across Australia.",19
3,Mr SIMPKINS,BILLS," I do welcome the opportunity to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families Bill) 2012. On Saturday I attended a gathering of veterans from the Vietnam war, both veterans from the Republic of Vietnam-the South Vietnamese veteransand Australian Army service veterans and veterans from all the services. This took place at the Australia-Vietnam war memorial in Kings Park on 16 June. Essentially it was a commemoration of 50 years since the first deployment of troops to South Vietnam. That was in 1962, and as we would recall that was the first arrival of members of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam, known as 'the team'. It was a good opportunity to hear from the training team veterans, veterans of the Vietnam War more widely and also those who actually fought against the communist north in the entire Vietnam war. It was a moment where you could really look at the ramifications and impact on families that war brings. At the time when people were deployed-thousands of Australians were deployed-to Vietnam, whilst the contact through media was certainly there and bringing the war directly into the lounge rooms of Australian families, they were difficult times for those families. So, when we look at the sort of bill we are talking about today and how it relates to defence families, it is really one of those policy areas where we need to be always cognisant and aware. For those that wear our uniform, that pick up arms for our country, that do the bidding of this nation and try to do the right and the good things in the world, it is at exactly these times when, in comparison with the tragedies that happened to families from the Vietnam War, that we must always be aware of what we need to do. As a national parliament we need to ensure that the Australian families of servicemen are looked after. As we know, this bill has wide support. It has the support, I hope, of every person in this chamber and later will have the support of the senators as well. From the coalition, the National and Liberal parties' side, that support is unequivocal and is absolutely clear. It is good that we have such policies and such legislation coming to this chamber. We have always made the point from the opposition that we support good policy. If it is right and is in the best interests of this nation then support is always there. The government like to spin their lines about the coalition and the opposition leader always saying no, but the reality is that when anyone cares to check the public record the vast majority of legislation that comes through here has the support of the opposition. As I said before, there is absolutely no doubt that, when we talk about what is good for the defence of this country and what is good for the families that provide a loved one to serve the national interest in uniform, the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, stand on the side of those families. When we look at the history of this bill, the way it developed and the involvement of the member for Fadden, the shadow minister, it is very clear that the coalition has stood the side of defence families in this matter, as it does in all matters. As we know, this bill was introduced in this chamber on 22 May. It was a day after much telegraphingobviously because a process needs to take place-and it was the day after the member for Fadden's private member's bill was introduced. It was surprising, I guess, after the question of the citizenship of families of those from other defence forces who joined the Australian Army, Navy or Air Force had been raised on many occasions. After these issues had been raised for so long, suddenly, following the member for Fadden's bill, we got a government bill. Possibly in the minister's second reading speech we might find a little bit of a hint as to some history with regard to the government's motivation. In reading the minister's second reading speech it says very nice things about what the bill will do-and as I said we will support the bill, there is no doubt about that-but what I did note in the second reading speech of Minister Snowdon was that at no point did it mention the buildup to the requirement for this bill. It did not mention the way the minister had written to the immigration minister and been rebuffed at the start of last year. At no point did the second reading speech mention that. It did not actually mention the shadow minister's, the member for Fadden's, bill that was introduced the day before either. In this place we are used to seeing this government's bills brought in where they attempt to blame the last government. Before 2007 apparently everything the government did in those days was terrible. We are used to seeing that put into a second reading speech in the introduction of bills by the government. We are used to seeing the blaming of everybody else by this government. In this second reading speech that was not there, I guess, because they had on to rush this bill into the House. They had to come up with it quickly, with only a couple of weeks notice, so there was not a whole lot of room to fire the shots. There was not a whole lot of opportunity to fire the shots when the government was embarrassed by the fact that a policy initiative that needed to get done, that needed to be brought into this place and needed to be fixed, was actually initiated by the opposition. There is a little bit of embarrassment, clearly evident in the minister's second reading speech, because they did not talk about all the great work they had done in the lead-up to this bill and they did not talk about how it had been planned for ages. When they finally introduced the bill it was all just purely about what is going to take place as a result of this bill. I suspect that it was really all about the embarrassment, and that is why there were not the negative shots that are normally fired when the government bring legislation into the chamber. As I said before, the government are used to trying to blame everybody else for any issue that takes place. Let us get to what is really important about this bill, which is the importance of the policy itself. It is the importance of looking after the families of those who have come to Australia to join our defence forces. I think that, given the operational tempo of the Australian Army particularly, and the Navy and the Air Force to a degree, and the way that so many of our soldiers are serving overseas and are, on any day, out on operations, out on patrols, the last thing that that soldier, sailor or airman needs is to be worried about what may happen to their family if something should happen to them. The reality is that when you pick up a weapon and you are out on patrol, lives can be lost. A person might have come from the army, navy or air force of the UK or somewhere else in the world, and the reality is that ultimately their life could be lost in the conflict or on patrol. The last thing we want is for that person, as they are standing in their arcs of fire, as they are out on patrol, to be thinking about anything but identification of the enemy, defending themselves and protecting their mates. The last thing we want is for that person to be worrying: 'What's going to happen to my family? What's going to happen to my kids? What's going to happen to my dependants if this all goes pear-shaped?' So it is right, and certainly overdue, that we should get to this point, with this legislation, where the service person-man or woman-does not need to worry anymore about that aspect of the future should something happen to them. The reason we recruit people from other defence forces is to fill the capability gaps that we might have. Much has been said about recent rationalisations and cutbacks to the UK defence forces and that that has been an opportunity for us. We are used to seeing reports in newspapers about how difficult it has been to staff the submarine fleet. I guess the UK's austerity package does give us an opportunity to enhance our own capability, and more and more of these lateral transfers can be expected in the future. Obviously they add great value. And when we ask someone if they are willing to lay down their life for our country, it is right that we say to them: 'Great, and you're going to become a citizen now. We will give you citizenship and your family, your dependants, your children, will get the same opportunity.' As other speakers in this debate this morning and last night have said, the full range of opportunities that citizenship allows will immediately be available to the families of the service person, and it is right that that should occur. It is not just a matter of the person who is out on patrol or in the aircraft or on the ship, serving within the particular service; we have to see beyond that and ensure that their family-who have also given up so much to join them in Australia and to allow them to serve in our national interest-are fully supported and have all the benefits that citizenship provides. There is no downside to this bill. These changes are well regarded and welcomed by the coalition of the Liberal and National parties. As a former serving member of the defence forces I would like to pay tribute to the member for Fadden, himself a former commissioned officer in the Army, for the way he has reached out and provided support and initiatives and worked to make the public policy debate on matters affecting the best interests of defence families one of his finest priorities. Following on from the private member's bill introduced by the member for Fadden, this bill we are debating has been initiated. The upsides are complete now for the families that need to be supported, so I welcome this bill. (Time expired)",22
4,Mr RANDALL,BILLS," I am pleased to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012. The coalition understand the importance of our service men and women to the security and, indeed, the identity of our nation. We honour and respect the sacrifices of our defence personnel, not only those serving but also their partners and families, and this includes both Australian born personnel and those who have transferred from another country. Family members support and encourage our Australian Defence Force personnel and spend untold months worrying about their loved ones when they go overseas. As we have seen over the past 10 years in Afghanistan and Iraq, many families have been left to mourn the loss of a fallen Australian soldier and wounding of Australian soldiers. As a nation we should be prepared to do all we can to support our ADF personnel, their spouses and dependants, given that they are willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice to serve our country. ADF lateral transfers facilitate an arrangement which allows those serving in another nation-for example, the UK, New Zealand, South Africa-to move to Australia and serve in our ADF. This is to be encouraged as we are able to fill critical in the ADF's workforce and Australia receives skilled and trained personnel, thereby saving significant time and money. The saving obtained by recruiting personnel who are already trained easily offsets any costs in making the recruitments, and their families also make a great contribution as citizens of Australia. For example, it is estimated that it costs Australia up to $2 million to train a fully qualified pilot, acquire such personnel from overseas obviously denotes a saving of $2 million per person. The ADF is looking to recruit up to 300 lateral transfer personnel annually and it is expected that 90 per cent of these will have families who will join them in Australia. Transfer applicants must qualify for permanent residency as PR is a prerequisite for citizenship. Once in Australia, ADF lateral transfer members may be granted Australian citizenship after completing 90 days of permanent service or 180 days service in the reserves. Their dependants and spouses, however, are not offered the same pathway to citizenship and have a four-year pathway to Australian citizenship. This sometimes leads to disharmony in the family, and it is an anomalous situation that could be and should be addressed. The example is that there are lateral transfer members currently serving in the the ADF posted overseas. Under the current legislation, if they were to be killed in action today-God forbid-the service man or woman's partner and children would not be able to access the same benefits available to the spouses and dependants of ADF personnel. Moreover, there would be no legislative guarantee that the family members could remain in Australia, as they would not have reached automatic citizenship entitlements. While I would like to think the Australian government would gaps accommodate such individuals, they ought to have the security of having this entitlement protected through this legislative amendment. The same difficult situation would be faced if a lateral transfer member divorced his or her spouse. The serving member would be afforded citizenship while the spouse and the dependants would not, leading to a problematic situation which so to could become quite emotional, I dare say. This could be avoided through this legislation. All of the assistance entitlements and privileges that go with Australian citizenship should be provided to these spouses and family members of lateral transfer personnel willing to move their lives to Australia and serve in our Australian defence forces. We should afford the same citizenship rights to family members of lateral transfer members that the personnel themselves currently receive-in other words, the fast-tracking of citizenship. The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill that we speak on today is supported by the coalition largely because we presented a near identical bill on 21 May this year, one day before this bill was introduced. I heard the member for Cowan, a former serving officer, talk much about this, so I will not go into much detail. Rather than make amendments to the bill that was introduced by the member for Fadden, Labor has shamelessly presented a carbon copy of the coalition's bill introduced just one day prior to this one before us today. I know that imitation is the highest form of flattery, but it really does stretch the envelope of credibility when they claim it as their own. As I said, the coalition presented a similar bill on 21 May. Labor presented their bill on 22 May. Not only has Labor done nothing to address this situation since taking power in 2007; immigration minister Chris Bowen even wrote to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the Hon. Warren Snowdon, on 4 February 2011 to say they would not. He clearly stated in the last paragraph of his letter to Minister Snowdon: ... I do not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation. Here it is in the letter, in the last paragraph: Taking all these factors into account, I do not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation. So what happens just over a year later? They copy our bill. Has the minister changed his mind in the past 12 months or was it altered because he was in fear of being embarrassed by the coalition's bill to address this anomalous situation regarding lateral transfer members, presented just one day before their bill came on? Defence Families of Australia wholeheartedly support this bill, as I do, as I believe it will provide security and confidence to lateral transfer members and their families, which is the least we can do as a nation for those who are willing to put their lives on hold to serve in our Australian Defence Force. I saw this myself when I had the honour to go on one of our Collins class submarines, the Dechaineux. We went off Rottnest. I met a number of lateral transfer people, mainly from the United Kingdom, who had come over to help man our subs. I must admit they were very happy in their job. We just have not got enough of them. As we know, we barely have enough people to man our subs as it is. It is obviously not a huge attraction to work on submarines because of the antisocial nature of being a submariner. You spend many days and months below the ocean surface and away from your family. The husband of one of my staff was a submariner, and I must admit she spent many lonely weeks and months on her own while he was at some secret location somewhere in the world. That is why, if we can get people from other nations that are willing to transfer here, we should do so. I must also add that the submariners that had come from the UK told us that there would be more of them if we could make some adjustments to the superannuation and taxation regimes that they face on leaving the British defence forces. So that is something we need to take into account. I wish to raise the issue, in relation to this bill, of one of my constituents. Last year I was approached by my constituent Mr Chris Keay of Kelmscott, who was inquiring about the possibility of his son Phillip transferring from the British army to serve in our defence forces. Sadly, upon making inquiries with Minister Snowdon's office, I was informed that Mr Keay's son Phillip would be ineligible to transfer as he did not have the required minimum rank, which is sergeant. Phillip currently holds the rank of corporal in can. the British army. He has completed all the necessary training and assessments to hold the rank of sergeant. He has not yet been promoted, due to the budgetary cutbacks in the UK as a result of the austerity measures being imposed over the past several years, largely due to the huge spending of the previous Labour government and the global financial crisis. So it is not the fault of Phillip Keay that he is not a sergeant. He is just not in a position to be promoted due to the austerity cutbacks on the British armed forces. As a young, enthusiastic and wellqualified man, Phillip Keay is exactly the person who we as a nation need and who we should be looking to recruit. While the UK may not like the fact that we are effectively poaching talented and fully trained recruits such as Phillip, if he is willing to move his life to Australia and serve in the ADF, I believe we must do more to accommodate and be more obliging when it comes to facilitating such transfers. In other words, should be flexible and understanding in applying the rules to his case particularly as his father is living here in Australia. Phillip has served in the British Army for almost 11 years. He has participated in five operational tours including tours in Iraq, Afghanistan and Cyprus. He is an infantry section commander so he is obviously able to lead up to 10 soldiers into combat. Phillip has the skill sets that are required, however, through no fault of his own he is yet to receive the official ranking from the British Army. We should be more willing to consider accepting recruits such as Phillip, because as a nation we are the beneficiary of such transfers. It just seems obvious to me. Opportunities such as this may not remain as attractive as they currently are and Australia should take advantage of this good fortuneand misfortune for the British-while we As I have said, Phillip also has familyrelated reasons for requesting a transfer to Australia, including the recent birth of his nephew and the fact that a short time ago his father suffered a heart attack, placing greater importance on Phillip's need to be closer to his family in Australia. So for these common sense reasons we support this bill. We just seek greater understanding from those who make the decisions in this area. I support this bill before the parliament as it is simply the right thing to do. I would suggest to those opposite that in future, instead of wasting the parliament's time with duplicate bills, the government support good legislation that has been created and brought to this parliament by the coalition. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (12:39): I rise to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012 and to support the comments of my coalition colleagues who have spoken in favour of this bill. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the we member for Fadden for his important work in this area. The member for Fadden is a good man-someone I greatly respect-and one who strongly advocates for the men and women whom he bravely served alongside. If I were in the trenches, I would want a man like the member for Fadden standing alongside me. However, the bill we are debating here today is not his, though it certainly appears to be remarkably similar to the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Service Requirement) Bill that was introduced to the chamber as a private member's bill last month by the member for Fadden. In fact in this debate we find the government introducing a bill to do exactly what the private member's bill introduced by the member for Fadden proposed to do. So why do we have a government bill that appears to have been taken directly-it was a cut-and-paste job-from the member's bill of the member for Fadden but included some minor administrative amendments? This bill is being presented as a government initiative when it is quite clearly an initiative of the opposition. But as the old saying goes: imitation is the highest form of flattery. So here we find two nearidentical bills which are designed to respond to an issue previously ignored, where the government and this minister have been forced to finally act in response to the strong efforts of the member for Fadden. This government has been dragged to this issue kicking and screaming, and I know other speakers have pointed out the government's immigration minister's opposition to this bill. In fact, in a letter the Minister for Defence Science and Defence Personnel, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the member for MCMahon, said of the fast-tracking of citizenship for defence families,'I do not consider it necessary to amend the citizenship legislation.' Clearly, this letter from the minister for immigration, dated 4 February 2011, made it crystal clear that the Labor government did not support the fasttracking of citizenship for Australian Defence Force personnel and their families. So why the backflip? I suggest the government's backflip on this position is related to the rundown in defence spending that we have seen under this government whereby our nation's defence spending has been reduced to the lowest level of GDP since that fateful year of 1938. The cuts have included the punitive and penny-pinching axing of the recreational leave travel entitlement for single Defence Force personnel. And after finally being forced to act on this issue, this government have returned to their default position of playing politics. One might ask why we have two private bills when the government could have simply shown a positive and constructive approach and amended the private member's bill. We all know that it is simply not in their DNA. Fifteen months ago the immigration minister outlined his opposition to acting on what most observers would accurately describe as a 'gap' in the legislative framework supporting Defence Force personnel and their families, and we all know that there would have been no action on this issue had the member for Fadden not taken the initiative and introduced a private member's bill. This is yet another example where the coalition is providing the leadership this country so desperately needs, to and is doing so from the opposition benches. The member for Fadden has stepped into the breach that has been left by this divided and dysfunctional government. He has stepped into fill the breach for something that this government has deserted, and I applaud him for that. This is an important bill. It is a bill that allows those who come from other countries to serve in our armed forces to bring their families here to Australia and to join our population with full citizenship rights. If these men and women are allowed to serve in our Defence Force, why are their families not allowed to benefit from the very freedoms that we ask them to protect? Australian citizenship is one of the most treasured gifts someone living in this country can have. In ordinary circumstances an application for citizenship requires a minimum period of four years residence in the country. The act makes special provision for someone serving in the Defence Force where a much shorter time is required if the candidate for citizenship completes a certain period of service. As the law currently stands, lateral transfer members of the Australian Defence Force-those serving in other countries' militaries who seek to come here and serve our country-are given a fast track to citizenship after serving period in our armed forces. However, shamefully, no such provision is given to the families who give the love and support that is so essential in the life of a soldier, a that is not easy, with endless rotations and isolation from loved ones. How much harder this would be in the case of a lateral transfer soldier, transferring from across the world to serve in the military of a new homeland, with his family being such a critical support base able to endure those challenges alongside the soldier, if they are not given the same rights to citizenship. This bill enables spouses and dependants of ADF lateral transfer members to gain citizenship at the same time as their partner serving in the Australian Defence Force. This is entirely appropriate when you consider the importance of the family support base that goes along with a lateral transfer to our military services. It is unsurprising that 90 per cent of the lateral transfer recruits to the Australian defence forces have families they seek to bring to Australia with them. In the past, we have sometimes been far too eager to hand out citizenship to individuals which have no respect for our nation, and in fact some who have been prepared to intentionally harm it. It was only a little over six months ago, back in December 2011, that Justice Betty King sentenced three men to 18 years in prison for their part in a terrorist plot against the Holsworthy Barracks in the electorate of Hughes, which I represent. They aimed to infiltrate the Holsworthy base and shoot as many Army personnel and others as they possibly could until they were killed or captured. In sentencing, Justice King said: The fact that Australia welcomed all of you, and nurtured you and your families, is something that should cause you all to hang your heads in shame That this was the way you planned to show your this required thanks for that support â€¦ She added that all three were unrepentant radical Muslims who would remain a great threat to the public while they held their life extremist views. But, of the three, only one terrorist can actually be deported on his release from jail. The other two have Australian citizenship.",24
5,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The member for Hughes I think is drawing a long bow in terms of the bill before us. I would ask him to come back to the bill before the House. Mr CRAIG KELLY: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will come back, because this bill is about Australian citizenship and the importance of it. If we are looking for what qualifications we would seek for someone to become an Australian citizen, then what higher standard, what better applicants could we find than the families of defence force members from countries such as England, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and the USA who are prepared to fight under the Australia flag to protect our way of life? The Australian Defence Force has a long standing practice of recruiting members from the armed services of compatible countries, and it is one that in the past has served our nation well. It is a practice that is necessary in order to fill the capability gaps in our own armed forces and is obviously important as new equipment is introduced into each of the services in our Australian defence forces. Currently, the Australian Defence Force seek to recruit 300 lateral transfer personnel per annum-which may well increase as, among other examples, our ageing Collins class of submarines is phased out. Of importance to this debate, 90 per cent of possible lateral transfer recruits have families they would seek to bring with them if they came to fight under the Australian flag. It should be noted that, just as Australia seeks to supplement our military capabilities by lateral transfer, so do many other comparable nations. Simply put, unless we make the changes brought forward by the member for Fadden and replicated by the relevant minister we will make ourselves a less attractive option for these defence force personnel that Australia seeks to recruit. Both pieces of legislation also aim to address the legislative vacuum that exists in relation to the lateral transfer system. The member for Fadden indicated that there are currently seven soldiers serving in combat operations on the front line in Afghanistan that have joined the Australian Defence Force through lateral transfer. But, at present, there is no requirement for the government to afford their families the same level of support in terms of benefits normally payable to the spouses and dependants of Defence Force members killed on duty. In fact, currently there appears to be no legislative basis or guarantee that a spouse or the dependants of a lateral transfer member of the Australian Defence Force would even be able to stay in Australia should that serving member be killed in training or in a combat operation. It is all well and good for a government to say, 'Don't worry; we'll make it happen,' but with this government's long list of broken promises that is not very reassuring. A far better approach would be to correct the legislative settings and give peace of mind to soldiers and their families considering coming to Australia under the lateral transfer system. The coalition will be supporting this bill because it is based on sound policy and, more so, because it is the right thing to do. As we have always been, we will be the party that supports our defence forces. We will continue to support our soldiers-those brave men and women who give so much of themselves to our nation. We will also support their families, who provide our soldiers with much support. The circumstances surrounding the development of this bill, however, are concerning, and they reflect the disappointing attitude of this Labor-Greens government towards our Australian defence forces. The people of the seat of Hughes have a strong connection with the Australian military that has been developed over generations. The seat of Hughes is the home of a major Defence Force base in Holsworthy, and we are proud to have previously been represented by the Minister for Veterans Affairs and assistant Minister for Defence in the Howard government. But in 2012-13 the current Gillard Labor government has slashed defence funding. I take the opportunity to raise this point because it goes to the attitude the government has toward our defence forces. The recent raft of defence cuts has caused significant disquiet in my community, ranging from annoyance to anger, especially regarding the targeted cuts, the punitive cuts and the mean axing of the recreational defence leave travel entitlements. This important program was very much about the health and well-being of our soldiers, who spend so much time away from their families and support networks. Only this government-the same government that thought fixing the legislative gap we are now considering was not necessary-would think many soldiers being left camped in their barracks was a good policy approach. The people of Hughes recognise that this measure is both unfair and will save this government less money than it intends. When given the choice between implementing good public policy and playing politics, it is unfortunate that this government is choosing the latter. That is what we see in their actions on this bill. Nonetheless, I support this bill and commend it to the House.",29
6,Mr SNOWDON,BILLS,"Lingiari-Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (12:53): First let me say how pleased I am to be able to do the summing up of this piece of legislation, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Defence Families) Bill 2012, as important as it is, and to acknowledge the contributions of all of those members who have spoken to the second reading. Whilst I acknowledge I do not necessarily support everything that has been said, particularly by the opposition members and most particularly by the member for Hughes, whom I have just had the misfortunate to hear. Never mind the facts getting in the way of a good story, which is what has happened in this case. But I will not dwell on that, because I think this piece of legislation is far too important for that petty nonsense. I am heartened that the opposition, despite its protestations, is actually supporting the legislation. I want to remind the House what this is about. The object of the bill is to enable family members of current and future lateral recruits to the Australian Defence Force to be eligible for conferral of Australian citizenship at the same time as the lateral recruit: 90 days service in either the permanent or reserve forces of the Army, Navy or Air Force. This bill is unquestionably about families and fairness. It is an important amendment that acknowledges the fundamental place families have in the ADF and in Australian society more generally. Currently-and unfortunately-the families of lateral recruits are required to spend up to four years in Australia as lawful noncitizens before being eligible for full citizenship and the associated benefits that are derived from that citizenship. The inconsistent approach to the treatment of members of a family unit that migrated together can only add to the upheaval and uncertainty experienced by lateral recruits in their move to the ADF and to Australia. The bill acknowledges that defence service can be dangerous, that family members of lateral recruits bear a share of this danger and that they make significant sacrifices to support the serving member. More specifically, it recognises that families of lateral recruits migrate to Australia as a family unit and all face similar settlement challenges. Families have always played a central role in the defence community, and it is only fair that they should be extended the same legal status as the recruited member. The bill addresses a long-term gap that has existed in our immigration and defence policies. While not trying to be too cute, I will make this observation. During the whole sort of 11 years of the Howard government there was nothing done to address this anomalous situation. In a practical sense-what all good policy should be based upon-the amendments in this bill will assist families with the actual mechanics of settling in Australia, including accessing employment opportunities and educational assistance. It also, importantly, assists these new citizens in building a close and continuing relationship to Australia. The scope of the bill extends to family members at the time the lateral recruit was granted their visa who hold the same kind of visa as the lateral recruit and who hold that visa because they are a member of the family unit. The amendments will apply to family members who hold a prescribed visa granted on or after 1 July 2007 and for all applications following the bill's assent. family members may include the spouse or de facto partner of a lateral recruit and, importantly, dependent children of any age and a dependent parent. The bill also provides a pathway for family members to be eligible for citizenship in the very sad event that the ADF lateral recruit dies while undertaking service. In this instance the family member will be treated as if the ADF member had completed their relevant defence service. The ADF is highly skilled, highly capable and a very formidable force. Its people are strength, as my good friend the member for Eden-Monaro can attest as a distinguished former serving officer himself. To continue to maintain a leading capability edge we must do all that is necessary to recruit, train and sustain the best possible people locally and, where required, abroad. The amendments in this bill will assist Australia in attracting personnel to highly specialist roles in the ADF as they will provide tangible benefits to the migrating family and make the decision to transfer all the more straightforward and, indeed, a great deal easier. It is an equitable amendment to the act and one that the government has been proud to introduce into this place. To provide a sense of some of the numbers and how many families this will impact, the labour agreement in place between the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Department of Defence imposes a cap of 510 overseas lateral recruits per year. In the period 2008 to 2011, there were a total of 573 lateral recruits-far below the cap that is being imposed as a result of the agreement between the Department of Defence and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. So far this year, to 31 March, defence has recruited 23 Navy, one Army and three Air Force members as lateral recruits, and 603 These dependent family members have migrated alongside lateral recruits over that period. That is 603 new Australians that will have the certainty and stability in their legal status that comes with being a citizen of this great country. Before I turn to some points in the debate, I make an observation. I have met a large number of these lateral recruits in various spots around the country, including at HMAS Stirling and at 1 Brigade in Darwin. For example, I had the privilege to meet Commander Rick Westoby from the Royal its Australian Navy. He is a Royal Marines Major who was working on exchange at the ADF Warfare Centre at RAAF Williamtown. He is due for compulsory retirement at age 50 from the Royal Marines and wanted to stay within his field of expertise. He was approached by the RAN to transfer, and he now works towards improving the ADF's amphibious and joint operations capability. He transferred to the ADF in 2004. He is one example from a large number of lateral recruits who have come to Australia, particularly from Great Britain. We are very pleased at the services they provide. I turn now to make some comments on why this bill is more comprehensive than the bill which was proposed by the member for Fadden. Whilst there has been bluff and bluster from many on the opposition benches, the member for Fadden will know that this bill is better than the bill he proposed in a number of ways, and I thank him for his support. Also, I point out that this bill has not come along as recently as the last month; it has been under discussion in one form or another by me inside the government since October or November 2010. Whilst we did not have the best response in the first instance, we have been able to repechage the response and, to his credit, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has sponsored this legislation through the parliament. I am very pleased by and thank him for that. This bill will extend the reduced residency requirement to all migrating children-not just to those who are aged under 18 years or to students under the age of 25-of the ADF lateral recruit. Disabled children and children who are not students but who are wholly or substantively dependent on the ADF parent and who have migrated with the ADF parent will also be eligible for Australian citizenship under this bill. Unlike the private member's bill, the government's bill will not discriminate against the disabled or those who are physically dependent upon the lateral recruit but older than an arbitrary limit. The private member's bill did not allow family members of lateral recruits to satisfy the relevant defence service requirement and obtain Australian citizenship circumstances where the lateral recruit died before he or she had completed the relevant defence service to meet the residency requirements for citizenship. government's bill will extend citizenship to family members of lateral recruits in the way that I described earlier. It is important that we acknowledge that the differences between this bill and the private member's bill are positive. I accept that the member for Fadden has acknowledged this, and I thank him again for his support. I said earlier that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, after my initial correspondence to him, wrote to me last year encouraging further liaison on the issues covered by the bill. I am very pleased that we now have a comprehensive set of amendments, which were recognised as necessary as a result of the representations we made, to the Citizenship Act. This bill is not about politics. I acknowledge that people should have the opportunity to express their thoughts in this debate-and some have expressed views which go well beyond the ambit of the debate. Nevertheless I am encouraged by the fact that, despite the bluff and bluster of the opposition, they are supporting this legislation, and I thank them for it. This bill is not about point-scoring, and it is not about politics; it is about the ADF, it is about families and it is about fairness. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",31
7,Mr SNOWDON,BILLS,"Lingiari-Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for age Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (13:06): by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. in Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Water Efficiency Labelling and The Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) (13:06): I rise to speak on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012. As you and I both know, Deputy Speaker Scott, water is not only an essential commodity in our day-today lives, and particularly for those from rural industry, but it is a finite resource, and anything that we can do here in this parliament as the overseers of water in Australia to improve the efficient use of that water is a challenge that we must step up to. Those of us who have used appliance in houses that are run by tank water-and I particularly refer back to the days when I was an active farmer-know the importance of preserving every drop. It is not just about using a glass when you are cleaning your teeth or making sure you turn the tap off; it is about ensuring that you put in place in your household the most waterefficient appliances you can buy. There is an incredible range of water-efficient appliances available on the market. It is not just washing machines and dishwashers; it is things like an addition that I made to my house-in fact, I put two of them in-on each of my instant gas heaters. When you turn on the instant gas hot water system, which has a five-star energy rating and in one case boosts my solar system, there is a flow of water through that appliance before the water actually gets hot, and that water is in fact wasted. As those of us who have known all our lives that water is a precious commodity are keen to rectify that. I have installed these new appliances that are currently available that can be fitted after that hot water system which actually holds a small amount of hot water ready to be used while the other system heats up. This bill allows the Commonwealth minister to determine changes to the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Scheme without changes being required in state and territory legislation. What that means, of course, is that this legislation will allow far more efficient operation of the WELS Scheme, which of course was a proud achievement of the previous coalition government under Prime Minister John Howard. As I say, it is important that consumers know the efficiency of their appliances when they are using water. Town water these days is a commodity which we no longer take for granted. If I look back at the history in Queensland and going back to the 2005, 2006 and 2007 period, we saw South-East Queensland almost run out of water. In my home town of Toowoomba we had a fairly controversial debate about whether or not we should recycle sewage into the drinking system. Whilst there are certainly some strong arguments for that, I believe that debate was badly mishandled by the then mayor, Di Thorley, who went for far too large a proportion of recycled water, despite my advice to her to perhaps start with 10 per cent and work forward from there. She was determined to push through 30 per cent or more. The community, whilst they were keen to play their part in saving water, simply rejected that proposal. Of course, with the benefit of hindsight it would have been a significant white elephant, being about halfway or perhaps just completed by the I say, time the floods hit Toowoomba and the surrounding region. Our dams in that region have been at about 104 per cent capacity ever since. The story is not so good for South-East Queensland, of course. The previous Beattie Labor government went for a rolled gold, gilt edged, water recycling system and water grid which I understand cost around $9Â½ billion. I am not saying that something should not have been done in that case but I am saying that there were far, far more economical ways to achieve the outcomes we needed. Yes, South-East Queensland and Brisbane were running out of water and, yes, something had to be done. But the reality is that a lot of that work was simply done in an unsupervised economic sense. Contractors were just given blank cheques. Things like even base metal gravel for the pipeline was being supplied at exorbitant cost. So little wonder that we now have an extraordinary white elephant in terms of the southern Queensland water grid and a desalination plant at Tugun that is not only rusting but posing an enormous cost to taxpayers. Rather than get ourselves into a position where we need to make these almost panicked decisions about what we do about providing water to our community, a far more rational way to do it is firstly have a program of ensuring that, as the population grows, we build dams that the community needs. This, again, was one of the problems we had in Toowoomba and is one of the problems in South-East Queensland, because the previous Prime Minister when he worked for Premier Wayne Goss killed off the Wolfdene dam, a dam which would have provided extra water for Brisbane and would have prevented this situation we had a few years ago. In the case of Toowoomba, Toowoomba did nothing to address the fact that no dam had been built in the time that its understand population doubled, and Toowoomba is the largest inland provincial city in Australia. But what makes it more complicated is that we sit right on top of the Great Dividing Range, so we can rely on no-one else but ourselves for our water and we need to ensure that we have capacity to catch water virtually at its source. Along with building adequate water storage facilities we need to do two other things. We need to remind the community of the preciousness of water. As I say, Deputy Speaker Scott, you and I and perhaps others in this chamber who have grown up on tank water know that every drop is precious. Since that water crisis and particularly in Queensland, people now have a far better understanding. That is the first thing we need to do in terms of education of the community. The second thing we need to do is ensure that consumers when they go out to buy appliances have more than adequate information to buy an appliance which is very water efficient. If I could go back to the WELS Scheme and to the amendments that we are looking at today, the scheme was originally introduced by the coalition in 2005. It was at the timeand this showed the vision of the Howard government-the world's first national scheme of its kind, providing for water efficiency labels on showerheads, washing machines, toilets, dishwashers, urinals and taps. Having been a minister for innovation I should just mention that Australia was the country that invented the dual-flush toilet. Our consciousness of water usage has now been raised, and the use of dual-flush toilets in modern housing developments in cities is saving a huge amount of water. It is part of that and part of identifying those watersaving devices and giving them a star rating that this legislation seeks to address. These labels have given consumers an easy to star rating, and water consumption information on the water efficiency of different products is contained within this system. Consumers generally look for three things when they buy an appliance. The first thing, obviously, is that the appliance works. They also look at its energy efficiency. That is covered by a star rating. Consumers understand that; they know how that all works. Also, for washing machines, dishwashers and showerheads, they look at their star rating in respect of water consumption. Given that information, and perhaps provided with some incentives from time to time, consumers do want to do the right thing when it comes to saving water. This bill amends the WELS Act and allows the Commonwealth minister to determine more of the scheme's details but equally those relating to the registration of products and cost recovery. It differs from the current position in that some aspects of the scheme, such as the five-year period for product registration, cannot be changed without changing nine sets of legislation. So it makes sense to give the minister those powers and to ensure that the level of bureaucracy, red tape, paperwork and, of course, cost associated with simply trying to get the scheme to work better is eliminatedand these amendments go towards doing that. Under these amendments the minister will make changes by disallowable legislative instrument, the terms of which must be agreed to by the majority of states and territories. It is an important facet of the scheme that we actually involve the states and territories in it. If this legislation is passed it is expected that the minister will make a number of changes to the WELS scheme, including revising registration fees to meet the cost recovery target of 80 per cent recovered from the industry. Further amendments are proposed in the bill to enforce provisions of the WELS Act, and civil penalty provisions have been added to provide a more cost-effective enforcement response. The bill will also apply strict liability more provisions, because it is currently difficult to prove intent in relation to breaches of the act-for example, for not labelling a product properly. Dare I say that whilst Australian manufacturers do their utmost to comply we have seen examples in this system and also in the energy star rating system where some unscrupulous importers have incorrectly labelled their product. That is not only bad for the scheme and bad in terms of trying to save water and encourage the efficient use of water, but it also creates an unfair situation in terms of Australian manufacturers who are doing the right thing. We want to make sure that within this legislation there is the ability to penalise those people who deliberately do the wrong thing. Some other changes of an administrative nature have also been made through this amendment, including removing the requirement for gazettal of registration of decisions and instead requiring decisions to be published on the WELS website, and providing further reviews of the operation of the WELS scheme at five-yearly intervals. Even though each time we look at the scheme we make it a little better, who knows what technologies there will be and what efficiencies can be gained from this scheme as innovation takes its part? We want to be sure that we go back and look at the scheme every five years, not just to take up innovation but also to improve the efficiency of the scheme. We are also looking at a number of other ways we can improve consumer information. The coalition supports this bill, as it builds on and improves a successful scheme which, as I said, was introduced by the previous Howard government. We all need to be mindful of the commodities that we use in our day-today life, and there is no more to essential a commodity than water. It does not matter whether you are an irrigation farmer at St George or in one of the valleys in northern New South Wales such as Narromine or working off a large dam system such as the Fairbairn up at Emerald: water is important to farmers. But as we found three or four years ago, perhaps to our surprise, people who live in the city see water as an inexhaustible commodity. Much of our water is now consumed by residents in urban situations. Not only do we need to ensure that we have the infrastructure to supply water on a reliable basis-and, let's face it, the Romans did it over 2,000 years ago, so I am not sure why we cannot do it in Australia-but it is imperative that we have a set of arrangements and an information system and a ratings system that allows consumers to use that water efficiently and make sure that we preserve this very vital commodity. I commend the bill to the House.",33
8,Ms HALL,BILLS," I would like to commence my contribution to this debate on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012 by congratulating the member for Groom on his contribution on this very important issue and acknowledging the point that he made about the preciousness of water and how we must ensure that we preserve water because it is so vital not only to agriculture but also to very survival of those of us who live in this country-and, for that matter, throughout the world. The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment Enhancements) Bill 2012 builds on the previous legislation, the WELS Scheme, and is to apply to all national water efficiency labelling and minimum performance standards to specific water use and water saving products, such as showers, toilets, urinals, taps, dishwashers, clothes washing machines and dryers and flow controllers. Specific products must be registered and labelled under the scheme and meet minimum water efficiency standards. The scheme is a national regulatory scheme, administered by the Australian government on behalf of the participating states and territories. This bill amends the act by allowing the minister to determine details of the WELS Scheme, particularly those relating to the registration of products and cost recovery to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the scheme through a disallowable legislative instrument. Further, civil penalty provisions have been added for contraventions of the act as well as additional enforcement options. I like to this of this legislation as streamlining and providing some flexibility so that the minister can make decisions. It brings together nine separate pieces of legislation and puts them all in one place and also looks at compliance. The WELS Scheme has been very Standards successful, and this legislation improves on the WELS Scheme. The WELS Scheme has required water-using products to be labelled for water efficiency. As the member for Groom pointed out, consumers not only look at the star rating as far as energy is concerned but also look at the star rating in relation to water usage. The WELS Scheme actually helps Australian households to save water, and by saving water they are also of course saving money. It also allows industry to showcase its most water efficient (Scheme products. The scheme was established in July 2006 by the Commonwealth in cooperation with the states. I previously mentioned the product suppliers and the products that are covered by the scheme. The industry registers these products with the WELS register at the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Eighty per cent of the scheme is funded through industry and 20 per cent is funded by government. This bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts by the Selections Committee, and the department briefed the committee. I was confident that there had been wide consultation on the proposed legislation, that this legislation was going to deliver benefits to Australia as a whole and that it was legislation that should be supported by the parliament. It is very pleasing to note that all members of the committee supported the recommendation that the legislation come to the House, be debated and be supported. I could find no reason whatsoever for not supporting the legislation. As we know, we have had many problems in this country with water-not only in recent times but throughout our history-and anything that we can do to improve our consumption of water should be supported. But this is not just anything that we can do; this is water-proofing Australia for the future. It is allowing each and every person to make a commitment to being more efficient in the way that they use water. The WELS water rating labels provide water efficiency information for water-using household products. That is very important. I know from consultation with in my community that this is the kind of information that my constituents are looking for-to be able to go along and choose an appliance that will actually deliver them water efficiency as well as energy efficiency and, at the same time, obviously undertaking the job it is supposed to do. The labelling carries two important pieces of information. As I mentioned, there is the star rating for water efficiency-that is one to six. The label shows a one to six star rating for a quick assessment of the model's water efficiency. The more stars on the label the more water efficient the product is, and a number showing the water consumption per use-for whitegoods and sanitary ware-or the water flow per minute based on laboratory tests. This is really important information. The information that I find most useful is the star rating, and it has been reported to me that that is the information that constituents look for when they are purchasing an appliance. In 2010 an independent review found that the WELS Scheme was good policy and it had the support of industry-and I might add that it also has the support of the community. The review made a series of recommendations in relation to governance, compliance, administration and fund management. In November 2011, in response to the review, the Standing Council on Environment and Water-which includes the Commonwealth, state and territory governments-approved a three-year strategic plan for the scheme and agreed that 80 per cent of the scheme's costs between 2012 and 2015 should be recovered from industry, with the remaining 20 per cent being provided by government. The bill amends the act by allowing the minister to determine details of the WELS Scheme. The proposed amendments made through this bill and subsequent legislative instrument will also deliver improvements and efficiencies for participants in the scheme. Examples include simplifying and streamlining product registration processes so that it is easier for people registering a product, and providing a common expiry date for all registrations so that retailers will know when the registrations of products they supply are due to expire. This is all about providing information to the retailers, to the consumers and to the purchasers. It is about ensuring that people are aware of the water efficiency of a product while at the same time knowing the expiry date of that efficiency rating. The bill will introduce a broader range of compliance and enforcement options. It introduces civil penalties to match existing and criminal offences, and remakes some of the existing Criminal Code offences for clarity. The bill also provides opportunities for orders to be given to a person that they remedy their non-compliance with the act. An example is an order for the replacement of an inaccurate WELS-rating label with a correct one. As the member for Groom pointed out, sometimes equipment or an appliance comes from overseas and the energy rating is incorrect. Under this legislation it can be ordered that the rating be replaced with the correct one. This bill implements the recommendations of the WELS Scheme 2010 independent review. It is legislation that I am sure members of both sides of the parliament will support. As I mentioned, when the department briefed the climate change committee, I was convinced that there had been adequate consultation with stakeholders as to the nature of the changes and the proposed changes. I felt that consultations had been widespread. As part of the inquiry, when the department visited the committee, it was pointed out that submissions could be viewed on the website. The committee was made aware during the process that the department had researched this well, and the overwhelming majority of stakeholders supported the legislation. What we have before us today is legislation that is supported by the government and by the opposition, and which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts unanimously supported. It is legislation that has been put out into the community for widespread consultation with stakeholders and it has the support of the stakeholders. The department has worked through all the issues that relate to this legislation. As a consequence, I feel that this legislation is going to be well received by the communities that we represent. This legislation will lead to a more efficient use of water in Australia. It will mean that we are better able to conserve water, remembering that water is one of the most precious resources and, as such, we need to make sure that we use it wisely. This legislation is going to make it much easier for us to conserve water and use it efficiently.",37
9,Dr STONE,BILLS," Water use efficiency is a critical issue in Australia given the high variability of our seasons. We have a high per capita consumption and we have one of the highest levels of water key storage per head of population anywhere in the world. We have needed that, and we need that storage capacity to continue into the future. We have tried to improve the efficiency of water use by better storage, labelling, better measuring, pricing strategies and improved technologies. Labelling is one of the strategies that can really assist in water use efficiency. This, of course, is the focus of the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012, the subject of this debate. The coalition began this strategy years ago. We were one of the world's innovators when it came to making sure that when a consumer wanted to know how whitegoods would perform with water consumption they could rely on a label which told them what water consumption would occur. This bill will improve the Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme, or WELS Scheme as it is known, and it is a bill that the coalition supports. We have just survived 10 years of drought in Eastern Australia. The coalition has responded to this by, amongst other things, a careful analysis of the potential for new dams for drought-proofing. Our new dam policy will be announced before the next election and stands in stark contrast to the Greens and the Labor Party who have a nodam policy no matter what, if, or when. Water use efficiency is also top of mind for irrigators who grow most of the nation's fine food and fibre. They grow it reliably, which means from them can come the food manufacturing sector-and food manufacturers employ the biggest number of workers of any manufacturing sector across Australia. The drive for more efficient water use should be a cause for celebration. It should not be controversial. And it certainly should aim to be achieved at the same time as improved productivity and environmental sustainability if we are talking about water use efficiency in rural and regional areas, particularly in irrigated agriculture. Unfortunately in northern Victoria a tragedy is unfolding disguised as a drive for water use efficiency. I am referring to the Goulburn-Murray irrigation system. It all began with Melbourne's water shortages during the last drought, the 10-year drought that many think was even worse than the Federation drought that occurred just as we were becoming a nation. Instead of considering recycling or stormwater harvesting, the state Labor government of the day decided on a desalination plant, which is yet to deliver any of its promise but has delivered a lot of extra debt. It also that a pipeline to take water out of the Goulburn River and over the Great Divide to Melbourne was a way to drought-proof its citizenry. To justify taking this water from the irrigating food producers of the GoulburnMurray region, it declared that there had to be over 200 gigalitres of water saved in the Goulburn-Murray irrigation system. After a few false starts it was finally decided that one of the ways to guarantee that these savings would be found annually would be to reduce the water use of irrigators by halving the footprint of the huge irrigation system itself. The system has over 6,000 kilometres of channel, 900 kilometres of pipes and over 3,000 kilometres of drains. There are over 14,000 water consumers. Together the irrigators' product supports over 23 food factories and produces over $2 billion in agricultural production annually. They are in fact the biggest producers of agricultural output in Victoria. Reducing irrigation to find that extra water for Melbourne, Ballarat and Bendigo was unfortunately not the only reason for the so-called reconfiguring or shrinking of the irrigation system of northern Victoria. Officially this project was called the Food Bowl Modernisation Project and a special agency was set up to oversee it: the Northern Victorian Irrigation Renewal Project, commonly called NVIRP. No-one denies that the state had long neglected the maintenance and proper planning of its stateowned water authority and state-owned irrigation system. The system has over 700 employees whose jobs, you would think, would be to make that system efficient, costeffective and equal to any in the world. Unfortunately, as the Auditor-General of Victoria's report and the Victorian Ombudsman's report into NVIRP show, the decided opposite is the case. The Food Bowl Modernisation Project is characterised by a horrific lack of planning and inefficient business model development. It has been very poorly executed. Options have not been considered. There have been breaches of proper tendering practice. Privacy provisions have been overlooked. There is a lack of transparency. Communications with stakeholders have been appalling. The recommendation of the Ombudsman's report was in fact to roll NVIRP from an independent authority into the GoulburnMurray Water authority. Meanwhile, irrigators have had the cost of their water increase to such an extent that many cannot pay and many doubt that they can extract enough productivity out of their properties to justify the cost of irrigation water itself. But it gets worse. The plan to have the irrigation footprint is not just about shrinking water consumption across northern Victoria. The original plan was for some of that water to go to Melbourne but a lot of it was also to go to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder, which is part of the Murray-Darling Basin proposal, in order to make sure that we have a sustainable environment throughout the Murray-Darling system. The other part of the agenda in shrinking the footprint of the Goulburn-Murray irrigation system is to save the state the cost of continuing to manage such a big systema big system that does produce very substantial amounts of food in the form of dairy product; fruit product; cereals, particularly oil seeds; and sheep and beef meat. These sectors are, as I said before, contributing to some of the biggest outputs of agriculture in the state, including the biggest exports of milk powders through Geelong, but that has not been considered. The consideration and the key driving force behind the Food Bowl Modernisation Project tragically now is how to save the state the costs of running the big system and also how to keep their over 700 employees in business or salaried. In the northern Victoria have already been recovered from irrigators for the environment. There are another 200 gigalitres shortly to be found. The difficulty for irrigators are self-evident. If you have a system being halved then how is that being achieved? It is being achieved by identifying two parts of the system: the backbone or main channels and then the spurs. The spurs are the smaller channel systems which might have five, 10, 15 or 20 farmers along them and they are supplied water off the backbone or what used to be called the main channels. Goulburn-Murray Water, via their lawyer John Adams based in Kyabram, have come up with a plan where syndicates or 'pods' will manage all of the spurs by themselves. That includes the maintenance as well as the ordering and distribution of the water amongst the various farmers on the spur. It also includes deciding what and if and how they might in the future make any changes or efficiencies in their particular spur. That might all sound fairly reasonable except that you have to understand that a spur might include a dairy farmer and a wheat grower or a cereal producer of some sort or a fruit grower. It might include a big property, a small property, a hobby farmer and a thirdor fourth-generation farmer. The tragedy of all of this is that these pods, as they are now called, cannot be insured. They are not subject to unlimited liability. If someone refuses to pay their fees and charges, the rest of the pod are liable. They have to pool all of their water together into one account. It does not matter how many of them there are or what the difference is between their enterprises. If a child falls into the channel and drowns or the pipeline is broken by a rampaging bull, they are all liable. There is no capacity for them to develop a sinking fund for their future maintenance and, if they do not maintain their spur, the water authority can choose not to keep supplying area 425 gigalitres water to them. The way these things are being proposed and planned is a moral hazard. In fact, as we speak people are being pressured into becoming a part of one of these pods. At the moment, if you refuse to do as the Food Bowl Modernisation Project intends for your part of the system-perhaps it is insisting that you go from irrigation to a stock and domestic system only-you are able to uphold your rights within the law and still be supplied with water. Unfortunately, we have now been told by the Minister for Water in the state of Victoria that the legislation is to change and an irrigator who chooses or would prefer to continue to operate an 800cow dairy farm with irrigation to support that enterprise can be forced to relinquish their water and become part of a stock and domestic supply system only. This is a serious problem, of course, for the irrigators who, in my part of the world, are still trying to recover from the 10-year drought and the floods that occurred first in the west of the electorate and last year in the east of the electorate. At a time when our food manufacturers are wanting to reinvest, as herds rebuild and farmers are trying very hard to adjust so they can survive the new carbon tax coming on 1 July, we have this incredible attack, as I call it, on the production of food in northern Victoria and on the economy, which in turn translates into an attack on our way of life and our communities themselves. There has been no consultation on this decision to have the irrigation system or on its impacts on the 52 towns across this area. There has been no stakeholder agreement that this is the best option and the way to go. I believe there are now significant reasons to very seriously consider the governance of the irrigation system itself. I believe that, like all other states in Australia, Victoria should consider the establishment of an irrigator owned cooperative, just as there is in New South Wales, with the Coleambally, Murray or Murrumbidgee irrigation systems, and in Western Australia, with the Harvey and Ord systems. All of those systems are irrigator owned and managed and stakeholder driven. These coops are responsible for every aspect of irrigation system maintenance, including the costs, policies and practices which keep them viable and able to produce food and fibre for the nation. We are now, quite evidently, in a situation of total policy failure and governance collapse in Victoria in relation to the Goulburn-Murray Water irrigation authority. The minister understood the problem when he became the minister and immediately replaced the board, having called on the previous board to resign, which they all did. The CEOs and CFOs resigned. The NVIRP CEO resigned 24 hours before the ombudsman's report became public. There is a well-understood problem in this part of regional Australia. It has to be addressed with an irrigator cooperative. It must be urgently examined before we lose for all time an investment of four generations in food production in Australia.",39
10,Mr ZAPPIA,BILLS," I speak in support of the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012. Yesterday, I also spoke on this bill because it was referred to the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts. The committee looked at the legislation and heard from the department about it. As a result of that, yesterday I made a statement to the House reporting back on the findings of the committee having reviewed the legislation. The findings were that the committee unanimously supported the passage of this bill. It did so because this is good legislation. As other speakers have quite rightly pointed out, the original legislation was introduced by the previous government and has been in operation for some six or seven years. The bill we are dealing with is in fact an amendment bill which I believe improves the existing legislation. The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005 provides for the operation of a scheme known as the WELS scheme, as other members have mentioned, to apply national water efficiency labelling and minimum performance standards to specified water use and water-savings products. These products can include showers, toilets, urinals, taps, dishwashers, clothes washing machines and flow controllers. This is done through a rating system that gives products a water efficiency rating of between zero and six stars. The act was originally introduced at a time when Australia was facing a devastating water shortage. One good thing that came out of that water shortage during that drought period is that, throughout Australia, Australians learnt how to better use their water resources. I think for the first time in many years we have come to appreciate the real value of these water resources. The act was originally introduced at the time we were facing those devastating water shortages. Specific products were selected that could be registered and labelled under a scheme if they met minimum water efficiency standards at the time. The scheme is a national regulatory scheme administered by the Australian government on behalf of the states and territories. The bill act by allowing the minister to determine details of the WEL scheme, particularly those relating to registration of products and cost recovery, to ensure sustainability of the scheme through a disallowable legislative instrument whereby a majority of the states and territories are required to agree to the terms of the scheme before the legislative instrument is made. In effect, it means that the minister will be to get on with making changes that ought to be made without having to go through the very cumbersome process that currently applies. That does not, however, deny the states and territories the opportunity to or disagree with those changes and they need to agree. But it will be a much more efficient way of dealing with the system and so it should be because today there is no doubt that the kinds of products that will come onto the market to comply with this legislation will come on in the years ahead very quickly. There will be companies out there constantly looking for ways of devising, developing and manufacturing products that will form part of these provisions. Further civil penalty provisions have been added for contraventions of the act, as well as additional enforcement options so that a tailored and appropriate response can be provided in every instance. In 2010, an independent review found that the WEL scheme was good policy which had the support of industry but it could be improved. The review made a series of recommendations in relation to governance, compliance, administration and funding arrangements. That is the very point, that it was good policy but it could be improved. I have no doubt that is why the industry totally supports the changes that are being made. While most of these changes also provide for better regulation and governance of the current legislation, they also provide more amends the opportunities for industry. In November 2011, in its response to the review, the Standing Council on Environment and Water-incorporating all ongoing environment ministers from Commonwealth, state and territory governments-approved a new three-year strategic plan for the scheme. It was also agreed that 80 per cent of the scheme's costs between 2012 and 2015 should be recovered from industry with the able remaining 20 per cent to be provided by governments. The proposed amendments through this bill and subsequent legislative instrument will also deliver improvements and efficiencies for participants in the agree scheme. Examples include simplifying and streamlining product registration processes, so that this is easier for registrants, and providing a common expiry date for all registrations so that retailers will know when the registrations of products they supply are due to expire. The bill introduces a broader range of compliance and enforcement options. It also introduces civil penalties to match existing criminal offences and to remake some of the existing criminal offences for clarity. This bill will, therefore, insert penalty provisions that will complement the existing offences. Inserting penalty provisions will improve compliance with the scheme and they will more closely reflect the nature and circumstances of the breaches. The offences in part 7 are not all new but are being modified. Strict liability offences are considered necessary so that a person cannot escape liability by demonstrating that he was not aware of the requirements or was reckless as to the requirements. Water conservation is overwhelmingly in the public interest. That is why it is reasonable to impose strict liability and significant penalties for the offences under the scheme. This will strongly discourage any actions that lead to excessive urban water consumption. However, the bill also provides opportunities for orders for persons to remedy their non-compliance with the act. An example of this would be to order the replacement of an inaccurate WELS rating label with the correct one. In this way, the act's objective of providing information for purchasers of water using products may be better achieved. Australia has quite rightly been referred to as a nation that is very dry. Throughout this country, 65 per cent of our water is used by the agricultural sector, 23 per cent is used the manufacturing sector and 11 per cent is used by households. All three of those sectors can improve their water use. We saw considerable evidence of that in the Murray-Darling Basin inquiry where, when speaking with irrigators throughout the system, we saw how they had invested in water efficiency measures right throughout. They showed that you can do much more with much less water. The same applies with domestic water consumption in this country. In respect to the urban sector, total domestic consumption over the last 40 years has increased as a consequence of population increase. Australians use about 290 litres of water per person per day, although this significantly varies across the country. Despite significant reductions in per capita consumption over the past decade, overall demand is gradually increasing, mostly because of an increasing population. Based on growth forecasts of a population of around 33 million by 2050, using current annual per capita water consumption, we will need at least an extra thousand gigalitres of water to meet urban household, business and industrial needs. A thousand gigalitres of water is the amount that we would dearly like to find to put it back into the Murray River right now. That exercise alone just demonstrates how difficult it is to find a thousand gigalitres of water, yet that is exactly what we are looking at down the track in terms of the projected population growth and our water needs for 2050. Certainly some capital cities have invested in desalination plants as an alternative supply of that water. But the reality is that desalination plants come at considerable costs, not only costs to establish the plant but also ongoing costs to take the salt out of the water and then supply it to the homes. So it by is not the preferred option. It has been a necessary option but it is also a very costly option. So we ought to be looking at other ways to ensure that we have the water that is required for home use and urban use in years to come. Some states have done that by investing in a whole range of products, by actively managing their water demand, by improving regulatory measures, by applying incentives or by using locally collected water supplies such as rainwater tanks, recycled domestic water or even recycled stormwater. In my home state of South Australia, we have already taken many of these steps.",42
11,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Deputy Speaker AE Burke â€“ Order! It being 2pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Carbon Pricing",44
12,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and refers to the already flagged increase in rates in the Knox, Mitcham and Bendigo councils due to the world's biggest carbon tax, set to start a tonne. My question is: how much will council rates escalate when the carbon tax escalates to $350 a tonne?",45
13,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," This is part of the scare campaign that is continuing from the Leader of the Opposition. The impact of 0.7 per cent, less than 1c in the dollar, is something that he continues to deny, and he continues to go around Australia running a scare campaign by exaggerating every possible price increase and then multiplying it by 10. So that is what we are getting in case of councils. The fact of the matter is this: we will get through this introduction of a carbon price with a strongly growing economy, with strongly growing employment and with price rises which are entirely consistent with the Treasury modelling. We have had some further support today, because the opposition has been asking us questions about what has been going on internationally and whether our price here is inappropriate compared to what has been going on internationally. Overnight we have had the IMF put out a report which says the IMF confirms that a starting price for carbon pricing should be around the level set by the government in our Clean Energy Act. It goes on to say that Australia, again, is a very model. The IMF says, yet again, that this is the least-cost way of putting a price on carbon pollution. What we have is the opposition leader going back to his wrecking ball tactics. He walked away from them last week, and then he said: 'No, it's not going to be a cobra strike. Now it's going to be like being squeezed by a python.' But of course what we know is that he is just like that old snake oil salesman out there selling his snake oil, telling everybody: 'It'll be good for you. Buy some more.' Unfortunately, the public are not at $23 buying this argument, not buying their exaggeration of the price impacts. We are providing adequate assistance to households to deal with price increases, including when it comes to councils. If councils are out there exaggerating the impact, they will be paying for that activity and they will face the results with their ratepayers.",45
14,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Can the Acting Prime Minister confirm that the government's own modelling shows that the the carbon tax will rise to $131 real or $350 nominal? Can he confirm that is exactly what the government's own modelling says on page 18 of the modelling document?",45
15,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, That has all been published by the government.,45
16,Mr Abbott,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table this document confirming that there is no scare whatsoever",45
17,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To coin a phrase to the Leader of the Opposition, no. Leave not granted. Economy",45
18,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is for the Acting Prime Minister. good Will the Acting Prime Minister outline the importance of spreading the benefits of a strong economy to ordinary Australians and their families?,45
19,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Blair for that question because the Australian economy walks tall in the world, and that is something that everybody on this side of the House is very proud of. The national accounts show that the economy grew by 4.3 per cent throughout the year, faster than every other major advanced economy. Something like 800,000 jobs have been created since the government came to office, during a period in which we have seen the loss of 27 million jobs worldwide. The RBA has cut the cash rate to 3.5 per cent, which is lower than at any stage under the previous government. This means that someone with a mortgage of $300,000 is saving something like $4,000 a year in repayments compared to when those opposite left office. So what we have is impressive growth, low unemployment, record investment, contained inflation, low interest rates and strong public finances. We do understand that not everybody is the beneficiary, necessarily, of the mining boom, and that there are many people out there who are not in the fast lane of the economy. That is why we are so determined to spread the benefits of the mining boom right around our economy. That is why tomorrow 1.3 million families will begin to receive the benefits of the Schoolkids Bonus. That is $409 for primary school students and $818 for high school students. This is vital money to assist parents with the cost of education. We do believe on this side of the House that parents really deserve that additional assistance with the cost of education. It is going to be there when they really need it-at the start of the year and the middle of the year. So this will give families more support. It is a very big investment in education. Of course those opposite voted against the Schoolkids Bonus. They do not think that mums and dads of Australia deserve this vital cost-of-living relief. They do not trust the parents of Australia to do the right thing by their kids. They would rather give Gina Rinehart control of Fairfax than trust hard working Australians with the cost of going to school. Mr Simpkins interjecting",45
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, Order! The member for Cowan is warned. Carbon Pricing,46
21,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer. How does the Treasurer reconcile his statement today that the carbon tax is 'only a tiny fraction of the rise of electricity prices in New South Wales; everyone knows that', given that half of the 18 per cent rise in electricity prices announced by the independent regulator is a direct result of the carbon tax?",46
22,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question, because we know that the main driver of electricity price increases in recent years has been investment in the upgrading of the networkMr Hockey interjecting",46
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The member for North Sydney has asked his question.,46
24,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and there have been very substantial price rises in electricity over a period of years. For example, in the last five years nationally electricity prices have risen in by more than 70 per cent without a carbon more price. Of course, the rise in New South Wales has been 80 per cent. We do know that nationally the carbon price is expected to add up to nine per cent to the average household bill in 2012-13. The question I was asked was, 'Given the increases in recent years, what is it?' And that is the point I made. The great bulk of increases in electricity prices have nothing to do with the carbon price, and that is the truth of it. of course, you want to run around the country, running your scare campaign. The truth is that in New South Wales those generators and all of those companies owned by the New South Wales government are very profitable. If they want to use the $2 billion and $3 billion they are making out of those assets to give some relief in New South Wales, let us see Barry O'Farrell go and do that. This campaign from those opposite is completely dishonest. It is the work of a snake oil salesman going around the country saying that Whyalla will be wiped out and running around the country exaggerating the impact of the price increases.",46
25,Mr Hockey,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It comes back to the fact that the Treasurer thinks that a near 50 per cent increase",47

NA Family Payments",47
33,Mr MITCHELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," They will love it, Madam Deputy Speaker. My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform. How is the government helping families with the cost of sending their kids to school? When will this assistance take effect? Are there any obstacles to its delivery?",47
34,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has the call and will be heard in silence.",47
35,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (14:11): I thank the member for MCEwen for his question, because he understands that families in Australia already have enough on their plates. That is why people on this side of the parliament want to do everything we possibly can to help them out, particularly to help out those families who have children at school. That is why the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer has indicated that from tomorrow families will be receiving the schoolkids bonus directly into their bank accounts, and 1.3 million Australian families will get extra help. That will happen from tomorrow. Of course, from next year families will get their schoolkids bonus paid at the start of term 1 and the start of term 3, just when they need it. I can inform the member for MCEwen that nearly 13,000 families will get the schoolkids bonus in his electorate, and more than 22,000 children in primary and secondary school in the electorate of MCEwen will benefit. I have absolutely no doubt that those families and those children-like the two million children right around Australia-will be very pleased to see this extra money come into their bank accounts in the next fortnight. We know that families are already very busy people. Parents are running around doing things for their kids every thing they do not need is the extra job of keeping receipts. Those opposite seem to have absolutely no connection with reality when it comes to how busy parents are. In fact, the member for Menzies said that he did not think it was a problem at all for parents to have to keep their receipts. People on this side of the parliament understand how busy parents are, and that is why we are making this change and introducing the school kids bonus, and making sure that parents no longer have to keep their receipts. They will get the money straight into their bank accounts when they need it. It is not only that those opposite do not understand how busy parents are; they also do not understand the financial pressures that parents are under. That is why every single one of those opposite voted no to the schoolkids bonus, just as the Liberals down there in Victoria have just abolished the school start bonus and just like Barry O'Farrell. Barry O'Farrell wants to claw back the money that this government is giving pensioners. Barry O'Farrell is going to increase public housing rents. This government wants to help families. This government wants to help pensioners while all you can do is say no. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (14:14): My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the statement of the managing director of Autocast and Forge foundry-Australia's largest independent foundry, operating in Western Sydney-that the threat of the carbon tax is one of the factors gutting manufacturing in Australia. Why is the government persisting with a new tax that will apply the python squeeze of higher electricity prices on Autocast and Forge foundry, endangering the livelihoods of its day, and one over 100 employees?

In the same way that the great reforms that were put in place in the eighties and the nineties have contributed to our resilience today, this is a reform which will do this tomorrow. This will build the strength in our economy by driving the investment that is required in energy efficiency as well as in renewable energy.

49,Mr BANDT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. You and the opposition have both expressed concerns at reports that Gina Rinehart will not abide by Fairfax's charter of editorial independence. Given her apparent reluctance and her immense wealth, is the government prepared to do more than just publicly call on her to act? Will the government agree to protect in law the editorial independence of major publicly listed media outlets like Fairfax?",50
50,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," government is very strongly of the view that a healthy and robust media is essential to our democratic process, and what has been important to Fairfax right throughout the ages has been its charter of editorial independence. Certainly, we on this side of the House support that charter of editorial independence, but I notice it is opposed by those opposite. They can even say no to a charter of editorial independence. I wonder why that is the case. The editorial independence of media organisations goes to the very core of the quality of our democracy, because the quality of our democracy does depend upon transparency. The It does depend upon fair and balanced reporting. Nothing could be more important to the quality of our political debate and our the national conversation than having fair and balanced reporting. And to have fair and balanced reporting you do need a degree of independence at the editorial level to make sure that it is not unduly influenced by commercial considerations. This should be just common sense and something that should be supported by everybody in this House. But it is very obvious that those on that side of the House do not care about that at all. The government has had a couple of reviews in place, the convergence review and the supplementary media inquiry, which has reported in recent times. Journalism is now challenged by great structural changes in technology, and of course this is impacting on media organisations. I will be very, very concerned if the purpose that Ms Rinehart has is to buy influence by buying more shares and junking the charter of independence. That is what I am very concerned about and that is what the government is concerned about, particularly given the record of Ms Rinehart in calling for a greater say, not just in the national The debate but also in terms of policy outcomes-the way in which she has pushed her views about getting rid of the MRRT, for example, and the way in which she has managed to get the opposition over there on side for a tax cut for her and Clive Palmer. So we are very concerned about all of those matters, and we are concerned that what will happen in this process is that that charter of independence will be lost. I certainly call on Ms Rinehart to explain, very quickly, to the Australian people what her intentions are and whether she will or will not support a charter of editorial independence. NA",50
51,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS," I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the St Lucian Minister for External Affairs, International Trade and Civil Aviation, His Excellency Mr Alva Baptiste.

NA Family Payments Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:23): question is to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. Will the minister update the House on the government's assistance to families dealing with the costs of educating their children? How is this an important improvement on previous policies and what steps has the government taken to make sure it is delivered?",51
52,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:24): I thank the member for Petrie for her question. She is very, very focused on the education that her constituents are able to secure as a consequence of the spending initiatives that this government has made in education, and I know that she, like all on this side, has a strong focus on education in her constituency and in her electorate. The fact is that raising a family can be a costly business and, when it comes to kids and to school, things like school uniforms, excursions, music lessons, extra books and so on-all of these things add up to the cost of raising a family. So I am proud to be able to provide this update to the House, because on this side we take costof-living pressures that families face and the education costs that they face seriously. That is why the government has delivered a schoolkids bonus. It was voted against by the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite, but the fact is that from tomorrow $1.3 million Australian families will get a much needed boost to their budget to help with school costs, because we have replaced the education tax refund with the new schoolkids bonus. People might not know that about 80 per cent of people who were eligible for that education tax refund were not getting their full entitlements, but now it is guaranteed My that families who are entitled to family tax benefit A will get the schoolkids bonus. Before June ends, we will see $409 for each primary school kid and $813 for each secondary school kid going into people's accounts. Before the end of the month, two million kids around Australia will benefit from this, and then from January next year the schoolkids bonus will be paid twice a year: once before term 1 and once before term 2. That is a guaranteed payment so that families can meet the costs of education pressures that they face. It is well known that the opposition derided this initiative by the government. The Leader of the Opposition was fretting about which negative line he could run on this particular initiative, and he came up with the fact that he was worried about it and he opposed it because Australian parents were going to blow it on the pokies. It is a direct quote of Mr Abbott that Australian parents would blow it on the pokies. All I can say to that is that Australian families make hundreds of decisions every week about how best to support their kids, particularly their kids who are at school. Australian families know what cost-of-living pressures are about, and they know that a schoolkids bonus will help them meet those cost-ofliving pressures, particularly as the kids are starting school and then halfway through the year. We are committed to delivering this schoolkids bonus because we know how important education is. Shame on the opposition for opposing it and on the opposition leader for not trusting Australian families with the interests of their own children. (Time expired) Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:27): Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Minister, how will the schoolkids bonus you have talked about help parents in my electorate and others around the country?",51
53,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:27): I am very pleased to be able to answer this supplementary question from the member for Petrie because she, in her electorate, will that 9,700 families are expected to benefit from the schoolkids bonus-that is, over 17,000 eligible kids in the member for Petrie's electorate in primary and secondary schools. Queensland will see about 281,000 families who are expected to benefit from this schoolkids bonus. It was opposed by those opposite, including the Manager of Opposition Business, who is coming up to ask a question, I hope on education. In the electorate of Sturt 6,100 families are expected to benefit and 10,700 eligible kids in primary and secondary schools will benefit from the schoolkids bonus that the shadow minister for education actually opposed in this parliament. It is not only the schoolkids bonus. This government's investment in education has been more substantial than we have witnessed in this federal parliament, almost doubling the spending in comparison to those opposite and providing improved facilities in every school in this country: trades training centres, library upgradesyou name it, we have delivered it to schools in one of the great educational and social dividends that we have witnessed in this parliament. We are proud of the support we are providing to education and to families, including this important schoolkids bonus. Literacy and Numeracy  Opposition Business) (14:29): My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the Auditor General's report on the government's $540 million literacy and numeracy program that revealed no improvement in literacy or numeracy in schools receiving the additional funding when compared to those that did not. Why is the government squeezing Australians with the world's biggest carbon tax when it is wasting $540 million on a find literacy and numeracy program that has not improved children's ability to read and write?",52
54,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I most certainly do not accept his characterisation of that program at all. Here we are again with another,52
55,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,52
56,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, Order! The members opposite have asked a question; I thought they would like to hear an answer. The Acting Prime Minister has the call.,52
57,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not accept that characterisation whatsoever. The fact is that this government's commitment to education is there for all to see in terms of the resources that have been put in in recent years, all of the efforts to lift the quality of teaching and all of the additional resources that have been provided to disadvantaged schools. We are absolutely proud of what we have done in the area of education. I do not accept that characterisation for one minute and, from our point of view, we will continue to do everything we possibly can to lift the quality and standard of education in our country, which is already high. We understand, particularly given the global developments that are occurring and developments in our region, that we have to do more-and we will continue to do that. We are proud of what we have achieved in education. Carbon Pricing",52
58,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation. Will the minister update the House on the forecast for the impact of the carbon price? What has the response been on the forecast, and how is the government helping households?",53
59,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:31): I thank the member for Makin for his question. I am asked about forecasts about the impact of carbon pricing. Of course, that renowned forecaster of doom, the Leader of the Opposition, has claimed repeatedly that the cost impact would be 'unimaginable'. He has called it 'a deadly threat' with ramifications that are 'unthinkable'-it is beyond human capacity to think of what the implications could be! What nonsense; what rubbish. He has gone around the country saying all of this when it boils down to a very simple proposition: we are pricing carbon because it is the most economically efficient way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and of Australia playing a fair part in international efforts tackle climate change, and all he has done is go around spreading rubbish. We know the cost impact. It was carefully modelled by the Treasury. It is 0.7 per cent impact on the CPI-less than 1c in the dollar-and, of course, the government will assist households with an average of $10.10 a week provided to households in assistance. Now that we are turning from the coalition's fiction into fact about carbon pricing, it is instructive that state Liberal governments handing down their budgets are also providing forecasts of the impact of carbon pricing. The Victorian government's budget last month forecast that the carbon price will increase the CPI by 0.5 per cent in My 2012-13; the Western Australian Barnett Liberal government in its budget said that it would be 0.7 per cent, which is bang on the Treasury forecasting; in the New South Wales budget-guess what?-it is entirely consistent with the Treasury modelling of 0.7 per cent impact on the CPI. So here we have state coalition governments and state Liberal premiers completely repudiating the rubbish and nonsense that the opposition leader has spread around this country, just as the backbenchers ignored his warnings about the doom and gloom and the death of the coal industry and instead snapped up the investments. That is what they were doing while he was forecasting the death of the industry. Just as that was happening, state Liberal premiers are also abandoning all of the rubbish that has been spread. He is trying to run away from all these things. We can see the new campaign emerging-it is putting fear into people about 2050. It is all rubbish, and, at the end of the day, you will have no credibility left whatsoever.",53
60,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam to Deputy Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Minister, you spoke about the importance of accurate information in this debate. Why is that particularly important in the light of recent claims about job losses?",53
61,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:35): I thank the member for Makin once again. We have heard all about the deceit, and there will be plenty more of it to be revealed as the carbon price is implemented from 1 July. But perhaps the most reprehensible part of this deceitful campaign has been the opposition leader's attempts to exploit the anxiety of working people by threatening them about their jobs. Yesterday the opposition was at it yet again-Senator Brandis in particular. Up in the Senate, he directly attributed the loss of 1,900 jobs in Fairfax Media to the introduction of a carbon price in a totally deceitful, dishonest and completely untrue statement that he has still not withdrawn. It is a complete disgrace, because everyone knows-and certainly all of the staff at Fairfax know very well-that digital technology is putting massive pressure on print media. The carbon price has absolutely nothing to do with the changes at Fairfax, just as the carbon price had nothing to do with the decision of Norsk Hydro to close the aluminium smelter at Kurri Kurri. It was not related to that issue, just as it has had nothing to do with the loss of jobs at Qantas or anywhere else. These people opposite relish the news of job losses so that they can blame them on the carbon price, and it is a disgrace. Carbon Pricing",53
62,Mr BRIGGS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to reports that the former CEO of the government's Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute was paid in excess of $500,000 a year, that members flew first class worldwide and that $54 million was spent on operational expenses in the first two years. Why is the government squeezing Australians with the world's biggest carbon tax when it is wasting money allocating $100 million a year to an institute which itself has admitted that this is too much to spend responsibly?",54
63,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question, because the government does not apologise for its commitment to carbon capture and storage technology-not one bit-and I believe that some of the reportage of the institute has been exaggerated. The fact is that the development of carbon capture and storage technology is one that is going to be difficult, but it is one that we must absolutely do. It takes an enormous amount of research, it takes an enormous number of partners around the world to put together the right combination of people to get the outcomes that we deserve. So this institute, I believe, has done good work.",54
64,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,54
65,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What we are seeing here yet again is the fact that the climate change sceptics opposite do not even accept the basic science of climate change. Therefore they cannot come to the table to have a sensible discussion about what we must do not only in terms of putting a price on carbon but also driving the essential technological development that we need for the decades ahead. Carbon capture and storage is an area where, as one of the largest coal exporters in the world, we do need to make some very My substantial progress. As an economy we produce a lot of coal and we export a lot of coal. We have a very big interest in developing carbon capture and storage technology. That is precisely what the institute is doing. It is not something that those on the other side of the House understand or appreciate, but from our point of view we will not be deterred from meeting the challenges of dangerous climate change and supporting our very important coal industry. Mr Hockey interjecting",54
66,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, the member for North Sydney should observe the standing orders! Marine Conservation",55
67,Ms PARKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Will the minister update the House on some of the unique marine environments placed under protection in the government's marine parks announcement? Why is this protection necessary and what will be its impact on recreational fishing?",55
68,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (14:39): I thank the member for Fremantle for the question. She has been a very strong advocate of protection of marine life and has been a very strong advocate in leading to the announcements which were made last week. In those announcements, there has been a lot of focus on what has happened on the eastern side of the country. It is important also to focus on the benefits in the south-west. In the south-west, for example, if you are a rec fisher, you refer to this feature as the Rottnest Trench. Environmentalists refer to it as the Perth Canyon. It is a canyon underwater that is larger than the Grand Canyon that, up until now, has had no level of formal protection over it. In taking into account that it is a popular rec fishing site, there are three different heads of the canyon. One of those three heads has gone in as a marine national park; the other two have remained available for recreational use. Similarly, in the area of Geographe Bay further south-a very popular rec fishing site-we have made sure that the marine national parks have been put in places that are away from the principal boat ramps there. While I give full credit to the member for Fremantle for her advocacy and the question that asks me why this protection is necessary, I think there are others who have made the arguments very strongly as well. I read from a page that used to be available through a link on the internet-that has now been taken down-calling on the federal government to take action by creating larger marine sanctuaries which would protect Australia's marine life and its habitat. It says: 'Australia's coastal waters are filled with unique marine flora and fauna, particularly in the south west coastal waters of Western Australia, and it is important that we encourage the protection and preservation of our marine Water, ecological environment,' Julie said. There was a photo of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition holding a 'Save Our Marine Life' sticker. I will not wave it around. I think it is important that I table it, though, because, even though the link has been taken down, they forgot to take down the article so it is still there on Google. You can copy but you cannot delete! The protection arguments have been well made throughout the whole of the 'Save Our Marine Life' campaign. It has been a major issue in Western Australia, and across the benches over there is a reason why the only opposition we are hearing is being run from backbenchers. There is a reason why it is Ron Boswell who is purporting to make statements on behalf of the entire coalition, without a single frontbencher backing his position in, and that is because scattered across the back bench of those opposite they know that we should be rightly proud of being the world leader in protection of the oceans. Just as we led the way on national parks on land, Australia leads the way on national parks in the ocean. National Security Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (14:42): My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. I remind the minister that commercial, recreational and tourist charter fishing boats have provided much-needed intelligence to Northern Command about illegal boat arrivals in the north and north-west of Australia. With the government planning to lock commercial, recreational and charter boats out of much of this area, is the government intending to increase the surveillance capacity of Northern Command to replace this much-needed volunteer service?",55
69,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (14:43): First of all, to deal with one premise in the preamble where it was allegedly a major issue for rec fishers in Darwin, if you get tinny from Darwin, you travel 680 kilometres before you get to the nearest place where you cannot drop a line.  Madam Deputy Speaker. The minister is not allowed to recast the question to the question he wanted to be asked. The question was about surveillance provided by charter boat operators and commercial fishers",56
70,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat! The Leader of the House on a point of order?,56
71,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker, because the Manager of Opposition Business cannot write a question does not mean that the answer",56
72,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat! Frivolous points of order from both sides of the chamber do not assist question time. The minister has the call. He is just beginning to answer the question and he will be heard in silence.,56
73,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you get in the average tinny and you reach that area 680 kilometres away, you probably do not have enough petrol to get back. As with all national parks, there is a management obligation that comes with the establishment of national parks, and just as there are a number of national parks on land managed nationally by the director of national parks, so too does the director of national parks, when these are finally proclaimed, take on the obligation to see that they are properly managed. In some cases this will be done jointly with state governments. In some cases this will be done Water, through relationships with the commercial charter recreational sector. In some cases, for example, where you have got the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on the in a exact same boundary as the Coral Sea, there are a range of options as to how the surveillance is actually done. But of course when you establish a national park at sea, just like when you do on land, you take on obligations for management-of course you do. That is where you have opportunities in these areas to be able to use a range of different initiatives, which is the same thing that happens whenever marine parks are established in state waters. Public Housing",56
74,Mr HUSIC,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Housing, Homelessness and Small Business. Minister, how are the government's pension increases supporting people across the country with the cost of housing including the 5,000 pensioners in my electorate who depend on public housing? Are there any obstacles to getting the extra money into the hands of pensioners? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (14:46): I thank the member for Chifley for his question and for his ongoing advocacy for the 5,000 pensioners in his electorate who rely on public housing. The government is making significant payments to support pensioners as part of our clean energy household assistance package. These payments will support low-income public housing tenants in adjusting to the cost-ofliving impact of the carbon price. Single pensioners will receive $338 and couples will receive $510 combined a year to help transition with these reforms. This is in addition to the historic federal government investment in New South Wales in delivering 7,000 new social housing homes and repairs and maintenance to 31,000 homes in that state. I have been asked by the honourable member whether there are any obstacles to delivering the money to pensioners. I am afraid that there are obstacles. I was indeed that. shocked last week when Premier Barry O'Farrell announced he was going to take away some of the money that was going to be provided by this government to help 84,000 New South Wales pensioners in public housing. Barry O'Farrell's decision hike public housing rents means a single pensioner on maximum rate will now pay an extra $84.50 a year. This is nothing more than a cash grab by the New South Wales government from age pensioners, from pensioners with disability and from veterans in our community who rely on public housing in New South Wales. Barry O'Farrell has shown more regard for lining his own pocket than for helping pensioners in that state.",56
75,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,57
76,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Order! The minister will resume his seat. I find the statement from the minister unacceptable. I ask the minister to withdraw and to return to the question. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: I withdraw. But in relation to that I call upon Premier Barry O'Farrell to reverse this terrible decision that is impacting on pensioners in New South Wales and I call upon Premier Newman and Premier Baillieu not to take the money from the 36,000 pensioners in public housing in Queensland and the 46,000 pensioners in public housing in Victoria. I call upon those two premiers not to follow the despicable path of the New South Wales government by taking money away from pensioners-those who are marginalised, those who deserve our support, those who in many cases have helped build this country. What a terrible, despicable act by the New South Wales government! They have an opportunity to reverse the decision, and I call upon Barry O'Farrell to do just Passenger Movement Charge",57
77,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Can the Acting Prime to Minister confirm that the government is about to drop the indexation of the passenger movement charge in response to arguments against it put by the federal coalition?,57
78,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, There is legislation before the House and we will discuss it with the minor parties. We are interested in getting the legislation passed and we will see what the outcome is. Pensions and Benefits,57
79,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Financial Services and Superannuation. Will the minister outline how the government is supporting working families through decent entitlements and other payments for workers? Is the minister aware of any policies that would put these entitlements and payments at risk?",57
80,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (14:50): I thank the member for Parramatta for her question about decent entitlements for Australian workers. It is no secret that this government stands firmly on the side of decent entitlements for Australian workers, and there are many examples of this government's actions in recent times which support this proposition. There is the increase in superannuation for 8Â½ million Australians, from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Indeed, in the electorate of Parramatta, 26,400 people who earn less than $37,000 a year have had the tax they pay on superannuation abolished-so on the superannuation they get there is no tax. That is fantastic news for these 26,400 electors in the member's seat. But of course there have been other things to support the entitlements of Australian workers. Again, we should remember the schoolkids bonus-the bonus which those opposite did not even trust parents to spend in the interests of their children. We had supplementary payments to people on allowances-$1 billion to help people make ends meet. But, of course, one of the best things that we have done to help the entitlements of workers is the Fair Work Act. An extra 2Â½ million Australians are now free from the tyranny of being unfairly dismissed and not having any legal remedies at all. Six hundred thousand workers get injured each year in Australia and they are able to bargain about make-up pay courtesy of this government. These are all very good entitlements. But I was also asked: what are some of the challenges to the entitlements of people? Let me talk about some of the most vulnerable Australian workers in Australian societythose who get injured. I am afraid I have to report to the House that in New South Wales, as we speak, the New South Wales Liberal government is going after seriously injured workers. Is there no victim that the Liberals in this country will not hunt down and hurt?",58
81,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,58

86,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you are policeman in Orange who was injured standing up for people and protecting law and order, your medical injuries miraculously stop, according to 'Dr O'Farrell' and those Liberal quack doctors, at 12 months. Under the Liberals, if you take longer than 12 months you lose your medical benefits. My concern is this: if you cannot trust the state Liberals to look after injured workers, how can you trust their brothers and sisters, the federal Liberals, to look after Australian workers? Not a chance-no trust. We do not trust you on workers. (Time expired)",58
87,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister's time has expired. I will advise him, though, that the microphones in the place work very well and that although a bit of passion is required, yelling at us probably isn't. Immigration",58
88,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. I refer to the statement by the Minister for Home Affairs on 8 June 2012 that Ali Al Abassi-also known as Captain Emad-had been on the movement alert list for some time. When was Captain Emad placed on the department's movement alert list?,59
89,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I thank the honourable member for his question. I note that last week he said there were 'urgent and important' questions to answer but he forgot to ask any of them yesterday. It is a matter of public record that Mr Ali Al Abassi had been under investigation by the Australian Federal Police for some time. The Australian Federal Police did not have enough evidence to successfully refer him for prosecution and nor were there grounds-or are there currently grounds-to cancel his visa on character grounds. The member for Cook has been alleging all of last week,59
90,Mr Morrison,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. The minister was asked: when was Captain Emad placed on the movement alert list?",59
91,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has the call and will refer to the question.,59
92,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Cook said all of last week that Mr Al Abassi had been on the movement alert list for some time and that I should have known. But again he has not checked his facts-and he has not checked his facts today and he has taken out of context things said by my ministerial colleagues. Mr Al Abassi was under AFP investigation and was on the watch list known as PACE, which is an AFP watch list. He was placed on the movement alert list, managed by my department, on 7 June. The member for Cook has said that the minister for immigration should be aware of every person who is on the movement alert list. Given that there are 639,000 identities on the movement alert list and 1.71 million documents on the movement alert list, I look forward to him implementing that policy if he is ever minister for immigration.",59
93,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Given that Captain Emad had been on the movement alert list, or the other list that the minister refers to, and that the Minister for Home Affairs had said he had been on the movement alert list, which is what I referred to, and that he has just said that Mr Al Abassi was the subject of a two-year Federal Police investigation, why didn't the minister move to take advice and cancel his visa under section 109 of the Migration Act? (Time expired)",59
94,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, I am sure there was a question in there somewhere. The fact of the matter is that the member for Cook is wrong again. He has had to rewrite his question on the run because he has got basic facts wrong. The fact is that the consistent advice from the Australian Federal Police to the Minister for Home Affairs and to me has been that premature cancellation of visas can undermine their investigations and could endanger successful prosecutions. The Australian Federal Police have successfully prosecuted many people smugglers. If 'Sergeant Morrison' has a different view based on his vast,59
95,Mr Morrison,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question was: why did you allow Captain Emad to fly the coop?",59
96,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will resume his seat. The minister has the call.,59

98,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, the minister will refer to the member appropriately.",60

107,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The member for Reid will withdraw and start his question again.,60
108,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw. My question is to the Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation. Minister, how is the government delivering a price on carbon while assisting families and seniors and making sure they have the protections they need against unfair price rises?",60
109,Mr BRADBURY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (15:00): I thank the member for Reid for his question. Of course he knows that the carbon price will cut greenhouse gas emissions to assist us in making our contribution towards tackling climate change. Of course it will also drive investment in clean energy so that we can build a stronger economy for the future. We expect that the carbon price will have an impact on prices on average of around 0.7 per cent, or less than one per cent. Of course that is about a third of the impact that the GST had on prices when it was introduced. Power prices are expected to go up by around $3.30 per week on average, but because we are a Labor government we are determined to implement this reform in a way that is consistent with our values, and that is why we have provided a comprehensive household assistance package. For instance, the member would be interested to know that in the Reid electorate we are providing relief to more than 10,000 families and 18,000 pensioners, and we are delivering tax cuts to 53,000 taxpayers earning up to $80,000. We have provided the ACCC with $12.8 million to protect households from businesses that jack up the prices and falsely blame the carbon price for those price increases. But of course we note that many Australians have been doing a fair bit for some time to try to cut their power expenditure and reduce their emissions. But now, of course, it is good to see public campaigns such as One Big Switch that are empowering Australians to get a better deal out of electricity retailers. We know that the best thing for consumers is to have the power to take their business elsewhere to get a better deal. While we are delivering assistance to households and consumers are out there trying to do their bit, those opposite are trying to do their best to do harm. Under the Liberal government in New South Wales, in the short time that they have been in power we have seen electricity prices rise by 17 cent in the past year. What have we seen in Western Australia? In Western Australia we have seen electricity prices increase by 57 per cent since the Barnett government came to power. You cannot blame carbon pricing for those increases, and these were increases that were inflicted upon the Australian people without a comprehensive assistance package. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has said that, if he gets elected, he will rip away the assistance that we are providing to households. He will rip it away. But the Premier of New South Wales is not waiting till the next election, because he already has his hand in the pockets of the most vulnerable people in New South Wales, ripping away their assistance by jacking up public housing rents. I think we all know the Leader of the Opposition has made an art form out of his relentless negativity, but if he were fair dinkum about price rises then he would pick up the phone, call Premier O'Farrell and say no to these increases.",60

116,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment Participation, Early Childhood and Child Care. How is the government helping Australian families to access affordable, high-quality child care? Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Minister for Early Childhood and Childcare) (15:05): I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. He knows that we are incredibly proud of our record of reform when it comes to ensuring that child care is more affordable, more accessible and of higher quality under this government. As the Prime Minister has recently made very clear, we are always working towards the next steps to assist Australian parents just a little bit more as they juggle their work and family commitments. Some of those opposite want to talk a bit at the moment about increasing childcare fees. That is fine, but they are only telling part of the story, because the truth is that cannot talk to the Australian public about increasing childcare fees without also talking to them about the government's subsidies, which have increased even more. So if we want to have a look at childcare fees, let us do it based on the facts. The facts are that this government increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent, as it was under them, to 50 per cent under our government. The facts are that, whilst they were happy in government to have the cap on that childcare rebate at $4,354 per family, we increased it to $7,500 per family per year. We know that this has had a huge impact on childcare affordability. In fact, as a result of our increased investment, analysis shows that a family that was paying 13 per cent of their disposable income on their childcare fees in 2004 is now paying 7.5 per cent of that income under our government now. Of course, we are not saying that it is not already an additional burden on families to pay their childcare fees, but what we are saying is that we have a record of putting triple the investment in the hands of Australian families, because we know how important childcare affordability is. As well as affordability, we know that parents want peace of mind when they drop their children off in the morning so they can be confident that they are being well cared for, and that means having the highest quality services possible. We in Australia now have more kids in care than ever before, attending child care for a greater number of hours. We also have an abundance of research which shows how critical these early years are and that 90 per cent of brain development occurs in these early years. So we believe that we need to get it right, and that is why we have worked with every state and territory government of all political persuasions to lift the quality of care and you ensure that Australian children have the best qualified staff and the best attention and supervision going forward. Those opposite can peddle their halftruths. They can tell the public half of the situation. But, in contrast, we are getting on with the job of making real investments to ease families' cost-of-living pressures and are getting on with the job of making real reforms to give Australian children the best quality childcare services possible.",61

127,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," The Speaker has received letters from the honourable member for Lyne, the honourable Leader of the Nationals and the honourable member for Wakefield proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46, the Speaker has selected the matter which, in his opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Lyne, namely: The urgent need for a Commonwealth-State funding agreement on the Pacific Highway with a completion date of 2016. I therefore call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",63
128,Mr OAKESHOTT,IMPORTANCE," I thank several members of the House for their support in allowing this matter of public importance to get on the agenda. It is telling that this is the first time a crossbench member has put up an MPI when only one half of this chamber has got to its feet to support it. It is often said that infrastructure is deliver in Australia today. It is also often said that Commonwealth-state relations have never been worse. Both those statements have a new pin-up and a new poster boy, and that is the Pacific Highway. The Pacific Highway is the new face of the inability of governments, state and federal, to deliver on infrastructure commitments and promises. The Pacific Highway is the new poster boy of the failure of the relationships between the Commonwealth and the states in Australia today. Those that try to argue the case 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' are wrong. This relationship is broken, and the Pacific Highway over the past 20 years is a telling example of the dysfunction that exists in the delivery of major infrastructure projects for Australia. What makes this worse is that absolutely everyone I talk to or listen to on this project says they get it. Everyone who travels the Pacific Highway and stops at memorials for photo opportunities talks about how they want particular projects done and talks about how they recognise the safety and the efficiency gains by delivering on this project. All politicians seem to agree that this is the priority job-certainly for the North Coast of New South Wales and for New South Wales roads generally. It also used to be for New South Wales transport generally, and essentially for this corridor between Sydney and Brisbane. For the Pacific Highway, until now all the language and all the rhetoric has been that this is the recognised agreed priority corridor for completion by the agreed date of 2016. So when it comes to the crunch and the agreements in writing and in funding are not delivered upon, it is all the more galling and all the more frustrating that we all have seen and heard the words of so many in saying they get it when quite clearly, through the lack of agreements reached and the lack of financial hard to commitment given, they do not. There is some sort of disconnect between the rhetoric of the last decade and the reality of the finances, particularly as demonstrated in the New South Wales budget of last week, which monumentally failed to back up the rhetoric that we have heard from so many members of parliament, saying that they understood what it meant to get to the 2016 deadline. Even though advancing this project has been like pulling teeth for the last 10 to 15 years, this matter of public importance has a sense of urgency about it right now. It is an eleventh-hour bid-a bit of a desperate attempt-to get federal and state action now for the completion of the Pacific Highway by 2016 according to the bipartisan, decadelong agreement. If agreement cannot be reached, it will have significance for many people outside this chamber: this parliament and the New South Wales parliament will have contributed to more deaths on the Pacific Highway-and I do not say that lightly. There have been more than 800 lives lost on that section of road over the past 10 to 15 years. None of us wants to see that number increase and, if we are serious about avoiding or minimising any more loss of life or injury through what is now a very busy corridor between Sydney and Brisbane, we must get this formal agreement in place and complete the project in the next four years. I also warn the House that, if an agreement cannot be reached, North Coast communities will take matters into their own hands. Two months ago, for example, in a community at Urunga there was a very serious attempt to blockade the highway. That would have significant impacts on a whole range of businesses and affect the function of the North Coast, but that is how frustrated communities have been in the past. That blockade was narrowly avoided for a couple of reasons. I do not fear but I expect and warn this House that, unless an agreement can be put in place, there will be blockades on the highway by communities so frustrated and so cynical about the promises that have been made but not delivered upon. The history of this project overpromise and underdeliver, overpromise and underdeliver, overpromise underdeliver. The communities of the North Coast are sick of it and, quite rightly, are pretty keen to respond to the problem if government will not. How have we got to this point? In the last 12 months people such as I have been trying to get two things done through this chamber. One was to get a work schedule released. There was a period of time when plenty of people were saying that, in the four-year window coming up, the work could not be done-not for financial reasons but for resourcing and work-scheduling reasons. There either was not the manpower or there were not the resources to do the job. We blew that argument out of the water around January or February by getting a work schedule released that clearly demonstrated that the manpower and resources are there and, over the next four years, section by section, the job could be done. So it all comes down to the money. In the May federal budget, as all in this place should have seen, the standout item in infrastructure was the commitment of $3.56 billion over the next four years to the Pacific Highway. It was the standout item. If anyone is in any doubt, go to the budget papers and try to argue differently. That was a significant contribution from the Commonwealth, saying, 'On the basis of the agreements in the past we will commit to getting this job done by the agreed date of 2016.' It all then came down to the owner of the asset. It is fundamentally a state road and it all came down to last week's New South Wales budget. New South Wales had the opportunity to choose this project, double their money and get the job done over and is: above all other infrastructure demands. Here was a project with a $3.5 billion carrot and dangling from the Commonwealth and the opportunity in four years to get the project off the books. What did New South Wales choose to do? They redirected that money to a planning project in Sydney in a rail corridor that is still in dispute and will receive no contribution whatsoever from the Commonwealth. In the clear choice between one or the other-between doubling the money and getting the job done or effectively a halving of the money and not even starting to get the job done with issues still in planning dispute-for some unknown reason the New South Wales government selected this Sydney based project in planning dispute with no contribution from the Commonwealth as the preferred choice, leaving a significant amount of confusion in the planning process around the Pacific Highway and amongst communities, who are white-hot about this decision, particularly the politics of it, where every single electorate along this corridor is either a Liberal Party or a National Party seat. How on earth have they allowed a planning dispute in Sydney to redirect, and effectively pinch, the money from completing the job as promised for the Pacific Highway? In my view, it is an absolute disgrace, and that is why there is a sense of urgency about trying to get some direction from this chamber and from colleagues in the New South Wales parliament on exactly where this road stands on the list of priorities. All this rhetoric they get it and they want this job done by 2016 seems to now have just gone 'poof' into nowhere. This project is now some sort of lower order priority behind two rail corridors in Sydney that will swallow pretty well the entire transport and infrastructure budget of New South Wales if they remain the priority exercises in that state. If we were in any doubt, there are quotes after quotes after quotes to demonstrate a pretty serious backflip from the New South Wales government who, as I say, overpromised and, in the last week, have clearly underdelivered. Here are three from the New South Wales Leader of the National Party, whose home electorate is right on the Pacific Highway corridor and who now, through his actions, is saying that a Sydney rail corridor is more important than finishing the Pacific Highway. Andrew Stoner, in a media release of 21 February 2011 said: 'Only the New South Wales Liberals and Nationals are committed to completing the upgrade of the Pacific Highway by 2016'-obviously wrong. The Coffs Coast Advocate of 31 March 2011 had this quote from the same gentleman: The NSW Liberals and Nationals are committed to road safety and plan for the upgrade of the Pacific Highway to be completed by 2016. Wrong. In the Australian Financial Review of 6 April 2011 we read: In October last year Prime Minister Julia Gillard told parliament she was committed to completing a dual carriageway on the Pacific Highway by 2016. Here is the quote from Mr Stoner's spokesman: We support that, and we want to work with them towards getting there â€¦ What happened? What happened last week? Why the lack of commitment to getting this job done in the next four years and getting that this project off the books and working in a bipartisan way with the Commonwealth to actually celebrate an infrastructure project in Australia and the completion of an infrastructure project? Instead, what we have had since is some sort of attempt to develop a new company line, that this has been some sort 80-20 funding arrangement rather than a fifty-fifty funding arrangement, which is why members in this place would have heard me stand up yesterday and ask the minister about releasing all documents and all correspondence. There is not a single document that has the New South Wales roads minister's signature on it, or the federal roads minister's signature on it, for the life of this Pacific Highway project. So across political boundaries we have seen changes of political colours at both levels over the last 10 to 15 years. There is not one single document that has those two ministers' signatures on it that says 80-20. Unless there is some secret document that New South Wales is withholding from communities, it does not exist. Yet we, in the last week, have had members of parliament in New South Wales stand up and say, 'I have a memorandum of understanding in my hands that is an 80-20 agreement.' That is a complete lie, in a parliament, under privilege. Yet they are getting away with it. It is time we started to call some people's bluff on this and started to look at documents that are signed agreements between Commonwealth and state ministers, of all political persuasions. And the variations on the language are all 'dollar for dollar', 'matching funding' or 'fifty-fifty agreements'. That is what the three agreed documents I have seen are. One is an AusLink document; one goes back to a Pacific Highway reconstruction document, right back at the start, with Michael Knight and Laurie Brereton; one is John Howard and Mark Vaile in 2007. They are all variations on this same theme: fifty-fifty, matching funding, or dollar for dollar. There is no such thing as a memorandum of understanding that is 80-20. And it is a complete disguise to try and cover the tracks of people who promised big, who overpromised, who got elected on this platform of finishing this job and who have underdelivered. They have failed. And they are going to cost lives unless this issue can be saved somehow, quickly, in the interests of the communities of the North Coast and in the interests of safety and efficiency on probably the major transport corridor in the Australian road network, and particularly between Sydney and Brisbane. I hope we can catch this one and save the 2016 deadline. (Time expired)",64
129,Mr ALBANESE,IMPORTANCE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:26): I thank the member for Lyne for moving this matter of public importance debate today. I, frankly, was shocked that the members of the National Party and the Liberal Party refused to even stand up out of their seats and support this debate being conducted today. This is an absolutely vital national issue. It is an for all those communities along the North Coast of New South Wales. But it is also an issue for all those who travel along the Pacific Highway-and it might just be once a year, around the Christmas holidays. But there are people right throughout this nation who have been impacted in a very personal way because of road accidents that have occurred on the Pacific Highway. In 1989 there were the two worse accidents in Australia's history-they still remain a tragic record: the Clybucca incident, and then one further up the road, in just months, in Grafton. It is as a result of that that we had a coronial inquiry. The coronial inquiry recommended the full duplication of the highway. It is a fact that governments, federal and state, Labor and coalition, have not done enough on this issue. That is a fact. But when I became the minister in 2007 I absolutely committed to doing my best to ensure that we actually had some reality to match the rhetoric about what needed to be done on the Pacific Highway. We have provided, prior to this year, $4.1 billion of funding from the Commonwealth for this highway. That compares with $1.3 billion over the 12 years of the Howard government; during that period state governments put in $2.5 billion. You do not need a calculator to work out that that is almost double, and yet what we have from the state government of New South Wales today is this absolute nonsense that somehow this is the responsibility of the federal government alone. I was extremely critical of the New South Wales Labor government when they did not do their bit on the Pacific Highway. Indeed, I took $50 million from the New South Wales government-the Rees bungle cost $50 million-when they were doing the wrong thing. I was out there at press conferences saying they needed to do more. And do you issue know who was backing me in: not just the member for Lyne, but every state coalition member from Premier O'Farrell now to Andrew Stoner to Duncan Gay. There was quote after quote. Andrew Stoner, Deputy Premier and member for the seat right in the middle of the highway said: Nathan Rees can't pass the buck on this issue. The upgrade of the Pacific Highway is a State Government responsibility, so it's up to them to get the job done. If elected to Government in 2011, we will make the upgrade of the Pacific Highway a top priority. It is not ancient history; it was in 2009. Premier O'Farrell on 8 March 2011, two weeks before the election, said: Only the NSW Liberals and Nationals are committed to completing the upgrade of the Pacific Highway by 2016. That was two weeks before the election, when they won nearly every seat. When you cross Sydney Harbour Bridge and drive to Queensland, every single seat along the way is held by a coalition member, without exception. The roads minister said in 2007: I would hope this time hethe then roads minister Eric Roozendaalwould ... say, 'Yes I will match that money and save the lives of people in NSW that have to use this highway'. I repeat: 'match that money'. That is what they were calling for. It is not surprising that they were calling for that. Indeed, when they were the state opposition they were saying this. Again, the Deputy Premier on 21 October 2009 said: I pay credit to the Rudd [Labor] Government ... for increasing the funding... The Pacific Highway is a State road that effectively causes the one life a week. The State Government must increase its commitment... As ... Mr Albanese pointed out ... the Federal Government is actually carrying the State... The roads organisations follow this issue day after day. The NRMA president said: It was the Howard Government that set the 50/50 funding split for the Pacific Highway from 2006 and the NRMA has supported this approach since day one. While in Opposition, the current NSW Government frequently called on the NSW Labor Government to match federal funding for the Pacific Highway dollar-for-dollar and we supported this call too. To now suggest that funding should suddenly be reverted to an 80-20 model would ensure further long delays in finally upgrading this dangerous highway. That was on 27 February this year. We have agreement after agreement. The AusLink 2004 paper said: The Government will partner with the New South Wales Government to commence new duplication and upgrading projects by investing an additional $480 million in the Pacific Highway in the five year period. The New South Wales Government will be expected to at least match this level of funding. The Pacific Highway reconstruction program New South Wales said: Under the Pacific Highway Reconstruction Program the Commonwealth will match on a dollar-for-dollar basis additional expenditure on the Pacific Highway in NSW, up to a maximum of $75 million a year ... That was in 1996. The memorandum of understanding in June 2006 was signed by the Leader of the National Party. It would be fifty-fifty and match the funding. That was the position that was put forward. It was in the AusLink agreement as well. In 2007 the federal coalition, in a loss of statement by the Prime Minister-this was during the election campaign for the existing program-said: The Coalition Government is willing to provide our share of the additional funding needed to fully duplicate by 2016, if the NSW Government will match our funding commitment to a faster completion. So this is not something that has been plucked from nowhere. This is something that has been in place since 1996. It was called for by those opposite. It was called for by the state coalition not year after year, not month after month but day in and day out. The communities on the North Coast of New South Wales had every right to expect that it would happen under the O'Farrell government when it was elected-as it inevitably was. This was not a tough election campaign where they thought: 'Oh, we'd better promise more money. We're not sure how we'll deliver it, but we'd better make a promise otherwise we mightn't get across the line.' This was a landslide. There are 93 seats, with 20 on one side and 73 on the other. Every seat from the Sydney Harbour Bridge to the Queensland border is held by the coalition. They knew what they were doing. The people on the North Coast were entitled to think that they would keep their word. Yet this is what we have. Last year, when we put in the federal budget $750 million of new money as part of our $1.02 billion of additional funding for the Pacific Highway, 'dollar-for-dollar matching' was what we said. The state government in the Treasurer's speech on budget night and in questions in the parliament that week said they would match the $750 million. Yet there was a sleight of hand. In a letter from the minister for roads on 28 May to me it said: As noted, New South Wales has committed $468 million under the current agreement. Funding beyond 2013-14 would normally be negotiated in the context of formulating the Nation Building Program. This will now take place as part of finalising the Pacific Highway intergovernmental agreement. As you are aware, more than $7 billion in additional funding is required to complete the highway duplication by 2016. People who pay close attention to this-and a number of people do, particularly the people on the North Coast-will know that on budget night we allocated additional money to the Nation Building Program and said that it would be available on a dollarfor-dollar basis up to $3.56 billion, which was half the assessment from New South Wales of the remaining costs-$7.1 billion. But last week in the New South Wales budget that $7.1 billion became $7.7 billion because they ripped off $300 million from what they said they were committing in last year's budget to this year. They took $300 million further-the matching amountfrom our funding commitment as well, because they knew that it was a matching amount. So $7.1 billion became $7.7 billion. A tough task became even tougher. They say, 'There are pressures on our budget. We've lost $5 billion of revenue.' This government had to take a $140 billion hit to revenue as a result of the global financial crisis but I went into our budget processes and argued the case. I argued the case; this lot just rolled over. In New South Wales they rolled over for the Liberals. So they have $3.3 billion for a project that will cost at least $14 billion. And they have abandoned the commitment to the Pacific Highway. I have a meeting scheduled with the roads minister next Thursday. The New South Wales government has, between now and next Thursday, to get on board and actually do. The National Party of old would not have rolled over. MCEwen would not have rolled over like this. They would have demanded support for this national project that has been recognised by Infrastructure Australia. Yet the current Leader of the National Party signed documents about the fifty-fifty funding when he was the transport minister. But to give him some credit, at least he was not the local member, the transport minister, Leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister, as the former member for Lyne was, at that time. They had the other leaders-the former member for Richmond was another National Party leader-and local members all up and down the coast, but they still did not do anything to fix this problem. But they have an opportunity, and we ask nothing more and nothing less than that they keep to their word and do what they said they would do, which is to do their bit. What will we do? We have on the table dollar-for-dollar funding. The money will go to the Pacific Highway. We will provide 50 per cent funding. It is a matter of what the time-frame is. We know that 2016 is achievable. Those opposite have gone away and said that it is not achievable. We have produced the time-frame with the projects. I make this point: last week we had the extraordinary position where people on the other side of the chamber were talking about pork-barrelling. The member for Dawson said: You can only write it down to pork-barrelling vote buying. Of the current action on the Pacific Highway, 92 per cent is in coalition seats. If you want an example of a national government rising above politics it is this government and this project. All we ask is that those opposite do what they said they would do. They have that opportunity in the next couple of weeks. They need to deliver on their commitments, because this project is too important to play politics with.",67
130,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE," The Pacific Highway is a major national priority. It is vital that this road be upgraded, and be upgraded as quickly as possible. It carries a large volume of traffic. There are many accidents on the road. There have been many tragedies and much heartbreak. That is why I grieve at the fact that the government is now seeking to turn the construction of this road into some kind of political barney. Instead of putting their shoulders to the wheel they are turning this into a political stunt. They are changing the rules midstream about funding levels and then trying to, somehow or other, blame the New South Wales state government. The Prime Minister promised the member for Lyne that this road would be duplicated by 2016. I guess that should have been an early marker that the deadline would never be met, because this Prime Minister never honours her word-we are only 12 days away from the carbon tax that we were never going to have. I might add that this is a carbon tax which is going to make the construction of the Pacific Highway more expensive. It will be more difficult to achieve the objective because the cost of building the road will be significantly higher than it would have been without a carbon tax. The member for Lyne acknowledged quite and some time ago that this target was not going to be met-that there was insufficient funding available. He asked questions of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister seemed to walk away from the issue and said that the target was still going to be met. But in reality, all along the government knew that it did not have sufficient funding on the table to be able to make this achievable. We have just heard the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport say, as he has often said, that he was upset when the New South Wales Labor government started withdrawing funding from the Pacific Highway. Let's make this absolutely clear: the goal of reaching this target by 2016 died when the previous Labor state government in New South Wales started to withdraw funding from the project. It actually cut the funding. Indeed it is true that Mr Albanese, in a letter that he tabled yesterday, criticised the New South Wales Labor government for taking $300 million off the Pacific Highway so that the state government would only be providing $500 million over the period of the memorandum of understanding. He said that he took $48 million from them as a penalty for that. But that is not true. I pointed this to the minister in this House once before. Reading from his own letter, it is quite clear that the $48 million was withdrawn from the New South Wales government because they had not signed the MOU on time. It had nothing to do with the amount of money in it; they had not signed the MOU on time. So he was taking the $48 million bonus that was available for early signature away from New South Wales. But do you know how long this penalty lasted? For two paragraphs in the same letter. In paragraph 2 of the letter, he said he was taking the $48 million away. In the same letter, in paragraph 4, he said: â€¦ I have taken a decision to direct an additional $48 million to provide for further duplication works on the Pacific Highway â€¦ So he took it away, and two paragraphs later he gave it back to New South Wales. That is how angry he was with Labor in New South Wales for reducing their funding for the Pacific Highway.",70

132,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member for Lyne said that there is no agreement around which involves an 80-20 split. That is actually technically correct, because the agreement under the memorandum of understanding has an 83-17 split-$2,541 million",71

134,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,"coming from the federal government and $500 million coming from the state government. That is 83 per cent to 17 per cent. As the time wore on, there were some more agreements. In March 2009, the Commonwealth added another $48 million, which you have just heard about.",71
135,Mr Oakeshott,IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I out rise on a point of order. In desperation, I ask the Leader of the National Party to table the document he is referring to.",71
136,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, That is a matter for the Leader of the National Party.,71
137,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,"I am going to read the numbers, so you will not need them to be tabled. There was $48 million provided, 100 per cent from the Commonwealth and nought from the New South Wales Labor government. In May 2009, the Commonwealth provided another $618 million for the Kempsey bypass-nought coming from the New South Wales Labor government. By that stage the split had got to 86 per cent from the federal government and only 14 per cent from New South Wales-an 86-14 split. Then there was a new national partnership agreement which incorporated these new figures, and it was signed by Minister Albanese, Minister Campbell and Minister Daley-all Labor ministers. They signed up to an 86-14 split. So every single project on the Pacific Highway when Labor was in government federally and when Labor was in government in New South Wales was on a split of at least 83-17, and in some cases 100-0. And yet the member for Lyne is in here defending this and trying to blame others. The numbers, 86 per cent, 87 per cent, clearly demonstrate that Labor had in fact changed the formula and was intending that there be an 80-20 split on this road. If you want any further evidence of this, just look at the nation building document released in May 2009, where the government proudly announced the new N1, which for the first time included the Pacific Highway. Prior to then, the Pacific Highway was not a part of highway 1 network. So the funding had been fifty-fifty. Minister Albanese says that the previous government did not spend as much money on the Pacific Highway as the current Labor government. That is true, because the funding share was different at that time. But I could just as easily say that the Howard coalition government spent infinitely more on the Pacific Highway than did the Keating and Hawke governments. The reality is that time has moved on. We were the first to contribute significantly to the Pacific Highway. The current government, to its credit, has continued that, and the next coalition government will do even better. We will make sure that this project is completed. So the reality is that Labor changed the rules. Every single piece of funding while there was a Labor government in New South Wales was based on at least an 83 per cent to 17 per cent split. It was not until the election of the O'Farrell government that that changed. In May and September 2001 the O'Farrell government committed $468 million extra to the Pacific Highway, and that brought it to an 80-20 split. So was it any wonder that the New South Wales coalition government, when it was seeking election, was making promises on commitments for funding on the basis of an 80-20 split? That had applied to other sections of highway 1 and it applies to other projects in New South Wales. And so this was the arrangement that was in place.",71
138,Mr Oakeshott,IMPORTANCE,Table it!,72
139,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,"New South Wales was making funding available on the basis of the agreements that were in place at that stagea signed MOU, Member for Lyne. There was therefore every reason to believe that that was indeed the funding arrangement.",72
140,Mr Oakeshott,IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In further desperation, I ask the Leader of the National Party to table this mythical memorandum of understanding.",72
141,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,There is no point of order. These things are a matter for the Leader of the National Party.,72
142,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,"The reality is that we listened to the member for Lyne in silence but he chooses to interrupt everyone else. I think that is a recognition of the fact that he knows that his argument is threadbare. He has become too politically connected to the government to actually see the facts, and that is a real concern to me-that a man who purports to be independent will not actually look at the issues as they really are and make sure that the facts are told as they should be. Another letter, which the minister tabled yesterday, is from David Campbell, the then Minister for Transport, to him in December 2009. Towards the end of the letter the Labor government says: Subject to your agreement to the above course of action, I will undertake to seek confirmation of a 20% NSW government commitment to the additional funding requiredfor the road. So there is not the slightest doubt that when there was a Labor state government in New South Wales the federal Labor government intended to provide 80 per cent of the funding and the state was only going to be asked for 20 per cent. They have changed the rules now that there has been a change of government and because the federal government itself has reduced its funding commitments. In the document that they presented in May 2009 they said there would be over $4 billion of funding in 2012-13. We know that that is now only just over $2.6 billion. For the following year there was to be $5 billion, and they have slashed that amount of funding as well. Labor has cut its funding for roads and the Pacific Highway is suffering, and they are now trying to blame the New South Wales state Liberal government. (Time expired) Mrs ELLIOT (RichmondParliamentary Secretary for Trade) (15:52): How incredibly disappointing yet not surprising that speech by the Leader of the National Party was. It was the same old story, the same old misleading statements. He could not table that fanciful document that he was quoting from; he refused to do that. He was just trying to change the goalposts and the rules. He signed a memorandum of understanding; he knows what the facts are in relation to this. He and the National Party really do represent so much of how they have let down the people of regional New South Wales, particularly those people on the midto North Coast of New South Wales. They have done it across so many areas and in so many particular programs that they have not fulfilled, and people are realising now that the National Party just cannot deliver. We heard before from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport about those state coalition seats right up and down the coast. None of those National Party members could get their Liberal masters in Sydney to commit to this funding. It shows how ineffective they are. They are ineffective at a state level; they are ineffective at a federal level. We see it; I know I see it in my area on the North Coast. It is not just when it comes to roads; it is in other areas as well. just incapable of delivering anything when it comes to state funding-totally incapable. It is particularly highlighted when we look at what is happening now with the Pacific Highway and the funding for it. The fact is that they have just not been able to bring forward any of the commitment we need from the state government in relation to this. This is an issue of such extreme importance when we look at upgrading the highway, the safety provisions and those improved road conditions. I and, I know, many other local members have a very strong commitment to ensuring we have that upgrade. I have a personal perspective. As a former police officer I was involved in attending many fatal traffic accidents, and I have a very strong commitment to road upgrades wherever we can have them and am very proud of the commitments that this government has made. It sickens me when we see the state governments not just weaselling out of their commitments on one hand, but also what I have seen in my area, which is them then trying to make a fanciful claim that somehow there has been a cut in funding and they cannot fund all the commitments they made prior to the last election. They are misleading on so many fronts. That is very typical of the National Party. That is how they respond to things because they just cannot deliver. In May we saw in our federal budget that we would inject an extra $3.56 billion into Pacific Highway funding if it were matched by the New South Wales government. That would mean full duplication by the end of 2016. We have made that very clear to them. We are asking them to fulfil the commitment that they made prior to the last state election. They came out and said that they wanted to have those funding arrangements in place. In fact, they were calling on the previous state They are Labor government to match that. We continue to call upon the current state government to do that. If they matched our commitment it would take the spending on this road to more than $7.7 billion over nine years, compared to the Howard government's record of just $1.3 billion over 12 years. We will continue to call upon them to make sure that they honour that. Of course, the betrayal of our North Coast communities began last Tuesday with the state budget. Despite the fact that the state government kept saying that they supported matching the fifty-fifty federal-state funding, they failed to deliver. We were all there waiting for it, waiting to see it in their budget. There was nothing; they failed to do it. Not only did they not match the funding, not only did they not commit to the fifty-fifty funding; on top of that they cut $300 million from their roads funding. Doing that made it even worse. They were just playing politics and cutting the funding. Now we have the Leader of the National Party walking away from previous commitments. He did not really say what they were going to do now. He was just waving pieces of paper around and talking about false memorandums of understanding. He cannot really give us a definitive date when they are going to do it or, if they were in government, what they would commit. They have no credibility on many issues, and they certainly have none on the Pacific Highway. In comparison, we have a very strong commitment. We have heard a number of quotes but there is one I would like to give from the Premier, Barry O'Farrell, on 8 March 2011. He said: Only the NSW Liberals and Nationals are committed to completing the upgrade of the Pacific Highway by 2016. It is very convenient that he said that prior the last state election. We certainly heard a lot of National Party members up and down the North Coast saying the same sorts of things and calling on the state Labor government to match that funding. They have all gone quiet now. They are all in hiding, as they always are-every single one of them-because they have been unable to deliver that. I would like to speak briefly about some of the funding in my seat, particularly the Sexton Hill upgrade, which is just about to be completed. This upgrade was funded by $349 million from the federal government and $10 million from the previous state government. The completion of it means that you can hop in a car in the Brisbane CBD and you will have no traffic lights until you hit Coffs Harbour. This is pretty amazing and it shows what can happen when you do get a major commitment to the Pacific Highway. The state member up there, Geoff Provest, really highlights how ineffective the National Party have been when we look at this issue of Sexton Hill. First of all, he was against the construction of the road and the design of the road. He bagged out the RTA at every given opportunity. He came along recently when we had the minister for transport up there talking about opening the northbound lane to the Pacific Highway at Sexton Hill. He had a bit of a tantrum and left. He has not really contributed anything. He has not contributed 1c. Mind you, he puts out a lot of brochures, trying to claim a lot of the funding for it, but they are pretty desperate attempts. But what I think really upset people was that when we had the announcement of the state budget, of course the state National Party MP for Tweed, Geoff Provest, was not able to deliver on any of his particular funding initiatives. In particular, he promised prior to the last election that there would be to funding to upgrade the western side of Kirkwood Road. There was no money to do that. He also promised money for a homeless shelter. We have not seen that delivered. He also promised funding for a high school at Pottsville. We did not see any of that. But do you know what he is now claiming as the reason why he cannot that funding? He is misleading people by saying, 'I cannot deliver funding because the federal government has reduced funding for the Pacific Highway.' This is a double lie. First of all, they did not match our funding. Then they cut $300 million from their Pacific Highway funding. Now they are trying to use that as the excuse because they are incapable of getting any money, because the fact is they cannot deliver on so many levels. What makes it worse for people of the North Coast is that we are seeing billions of dollars going into infrastructure in Sydney. We saw over $3 billion go into the north-west rail link. We keep seeing all this money that the state government is committing to for Sydney. We are not seeing any for the North Coast; it has been completely forgotten. The National Party are completely incapable of getting funding out of their Liberal masters, and people are realising that. I highlight further what this state member is doing-it gets better. First he says, 'I can't deliver anything because the federal government cut the funding for the Pacific Highway.' Then he says, 'That's why-that's what makes it all very difficult.' Then he goes on to say that, for the road he could not fund because he never had the money to do it, they are now looking at a proposal from a private company to build an interchange on the Pacific Highway in Tweed Heads South. People are starting to say: 'So you can't get any funding out of Sydney and you make up a lot of lies. Are you now going to be putting toll roads in Tweed Heads? Is that going to be your approach?' This has upset quite a lot of people, and they are certainly aware that he has not been able to deliver. I can tell you that people are not going to be impressed that not only are they not getting their funding requirements out of the state government but they are also having to pay tolls on roads because he promised and cannot deliver on his promises at all. At the end of the day, people such as my state member Geoff Provest and all the National Party members up and down the coast have to stop making excuses and stop misleading people. Instead, they have to get in there and make their voices heard by the National Party and the Liberal Party to get the funding. If you cannot do it-if you cannot do your job-then step aside and get somebody who can deliver for the North Coast and secure the funding not just for the Pacific Highway but also for everything else. Is this the start of the next few years when they will not be able to deliver anything at all? People are already sick of all the excuses and all the misleading statements. These members have to start standing up and getting results, particularly on issues that are really important and almost above politics, such as this funding of the Pacific Highway. We have put the offer out there. It is more than $3.5 billion for them to match at fiftyfifty. That is as per their memorandums of understanding-it is what they called for prior to getting into government in New South Wales. We are asking them to honour it, to match it and to join with us and finish this stretch of the Pacific Highway. It is such an important issue for safety and for road upgrades for the people of New South Wales and others travelling in the area. It is now up to the state National Party members up and down the coast. As we know, there are many of them up and down the coast as you go north of Sydney. It is time for them to stand up and deliver, because this issue is so important. The federal Labor government has continued to deliver. (Time expired)",72
143,Mr HARTSUYKER,IMPORTANCE," I welcome the opportunity to speak on the very important issue of the Pacific Highway. It seems incredible that, effectively, we are debating in this House the bickering between the state and federal governments, because the people of the North Coast are sick of bickering. They just want the state government and the federal government to shut up and get on and start building the road. There was a commitment in the federal budget of some $3.5 billion for the road and a commitment from the state government of $1.5 billion over the forward estimates for the road, so there is $5 billion in the pot. Stop talking about it, stop arguing and just get on and build it. That is what the people New South Wales and the people of Australia who travel from Sydney to Brisbane want. We need an effective Pacific Highway to handle the huge transport task safely. Regrettably, the Pacific Highway is one of the most notorious roads in the country. A number of areas in my electorate are particularly notorious-most notably the accident black spot from Warrell Creek to Urunga. Sadly, today there has been yet another accident south of Macksville. The Macksville bridge is decades past its use-by date and simply not up to the huge transport task of supporting the massive B-doubles which are crossing it in their thousands each week. The upgrade to the Pacific Highway is a huge task and is going to take a huge amount of work to complete. It seems incredible that members of this House and other politicians are out there are still talking about a completion date of 2016. That is nothing but an elaborate deception. The opportunity to complete the highway by 2016 slipped by long ago. It has taken 16 years to so far complete 52 per cent of the highway, but the government and the member for Lyne would have us believe that, while it took 16 years to do the first half of the project, the second half can be miraculously done in four years. That is a fairy story. As members of this House we have an obligation to deal truthfully with our electorates; we have an obligation to deal with the facts. The simple fact is that if you going to complete the highway in four years you are going to have to complete it at a rate of 80 kilometres a year. They have not come close to that rate in any year so far, and are not going to do it now. If we have a look at the stats, we see that they are quite informative. The total length of the section of highway in question is 664 kilometres; 346 kilometres are completed; of 318 kilometres are still to go; 60 kilometres are under construction; 121 kilometres are planned; and 137 kilometres are not even in receipt of planning approval. If we look at the time it takes to build some of these very extensive civil works projects-I see the member for Page up there, and there was a massive task completed on the Ballina bypass-we realise that it takes years to do these things. There are huge engineering challenges. There is subsidence in the soil because of the very unstable nature of many of the alluvial flats that have to be crossed on some of the remaining sections. It is a huge task, and 137 kilometres have not even had planning approval yet. With a three-yearplus construction timetable, a lot of planning has to happen between now and the end of the year for there to be any hope of the project being completed by the end of 2016. The reality is that there is no hope-the program for the completion of the road by 2016 which is talked about by the minister and by the member for Lyne is nothing more than an elaborate deception. It is pretty easy to write a schedule on a piece of paper; it is a lot harder to build and fund the road. I think that the people of the North Coast are entitled to expect honesty from their elected representatives. This road will not be finished by 2016, but we are still duty-bound to use our best endeavours to complete the road just as quickly as possible, to stop arguing the toss, arguing about the split of percentages. Both levels of government should commit the maximum amount of funds possible to the road and get it done just as quickly as they can. I have two priorities as the member for they Cowper, as one who represents a large stretch of the highway. We need to bypass black spots as quickly as possible. Eliminate the worse accident spots first. That clearly has to be a priority. We have to as a matter of urgency extend the proposal to do the work from Nambucca to Urunga. We need to extend that to Warrell Creek so that we take out that entire accident black spot-not just half of it, which is the current proposal. We have a proposal, and I welcome it, to start work on the section of road from Nambucca to Urunga. We had that tragic accident at Urunga earlier in the year. We need to go further. We need to increase the scope of that project right up to Warrell Creek. That would include the area where we had the accident today, a most worthy area of our construction attention. The other important thing we must do is get the heavy vehicles out of the main streets of our towns. That is vitally important. It is vitally important that we bypass Macksville, as I said. The bridge cannot cope with the loads on it at the moment. We need to bypass Coffs Harbour. We have some 13 sets of traffic lights going through Coffs Harbour. Bypassing Coffs Harbour would result in a huge improvement in traffic efficiency on the Pacific Highway. It is vital that the Coffs Harbour bypass be an integral part of the Pacific Highway project and not left until the end. It certainly must be completed just as quickly as possible. Ulmarra still needs to be bypassed. That is a vitally important project. These are very important projects. We saw in Urunga, tragically, what happens when heavy vehicles crash in a built-up area. It disastrous situation. I have been fighting since I have been the member for Cowper to ensure that the highway is upgraded as quickly as possible. I welcome all financial commitments, both state and federal, towards the construction of the road, but I am concerned that there is an attempt at deception to make people believe there is any prospect of a 2016 completion date, which there is not. If you look at the funding as detailed in the federal budget you will see that there is no additional funding scheduled for the financial year 2012-13. Of the $3.5 billion that has been committed to the road by the government, there is no additional funding for 2012-13, which is somewhat disappointing. There is only $231 million for the year 2013-14. It is not until we get to 2014-15 that the new expenditure essentially ramps right up. We have just over $1 billion in 2014 and $1.4 billion in 2015. But if you were to look for a clue as to what the real completion date for the Pacific Highway is you would need to look no further than the budget, because there is a remaining $1 billion still to be spent in 2016-17, which is outside the forward estimates period. So the budget papers themselves tell the story that not even the government believes this fairy story that this project will be completed within the period up to 2016. You cannot complete almost half of the Pacific Highway link in just four years. It is an engineering impossibility. It is a fairy story perpetuated by the member for Lyne and the minister that you are able to do that. We need honesty with our constituents. We need both the state and the federal governments to commit the maximum amount of funding to the road. We need to get the big trucks out of the main streets. We need to bypass the worse accident black spots is a first. Saving lives has to be a priority. Improving amenity in small communities has to be our priority. Improving travel efficiency around Coffs Harbour has to be our priority. We have massive numbers of trucks and cars which use the main street of Coffs Harbour every day. It is a deadly and toxic mix to have heavy vehicles mixing with local transport. It may have been acceptable in an era when the levels of traffic on the highway were only a small fraction of what they are today. Traffic volumes have grown to such a huge extent that that is not tenable in the 21st century. I call on all members of this House to work constructively towards the completion of the Pacific Highway just as quickly as possible, to be honest with the Australian people and to work towards realistic time frames to complete this very important project so that lives are saved, the road is made more safe and transport can move more efficiently up and down the east coast.",75
144,Ms SAFFIN,IMPORTANCE," I rise to speak to this motion. I am pleased that we are talking about the Pacific Highway but not pleased that we are still talking about trying to get the New South Wales government to honour the commitment that they gave to a fifty-fifty funding split. They should just really get on with it. I listened very carefully to the honourable member for Cowper's contribution. The member for Cowper said in this place in a motion on notice: The Pacific Highway is a state road designed, built, owned and maintained by the New South Wales state government. The Pacific Highway is a state road. The member for Cowper said that people on the North Coast are sick of the bickering. And they are, I know, I am a local-I represent the local people. They are sick of the bickering but they are also sick of the litany of lies that have been told about the funding commitments for the Pacific Highway. I want to put some facts on the public record now. Barry O'Farrell on 8 March: Only the New South Wales Liberals and Nationals are committed to completing the upgrade of the Pacific Highway by 2016. John Howard, 16 October 2007: My government's preference remains for the duplication to be completed by 2016 in line with our 2004 commitment. A further quote: The coalition government is willing to provide our share of the additional funding needed to fully duplicate by 2016 if the New South Wales government will match our funding commitment to a faster completion. That covers two things. That shows that there was that discussion early on, that there was a willingness to talk about the duplication by 2016, and also that there was a fifty-fifty shared funding split with the New South Wales government. On 10 October 2007, Duncan Gay, the New South Wales Minister for Roads, who was then a member of the Legislative Council, said in Hansard: I would have hoped this time that hemeaning the then roads minister Eric Roozendaalwould have been a statesman and said, 'Yes, I'll match that money and save the lives of people in New South Wales that use the highway.' That goes to the commitment to matching funding. I have heard it said by Nationals members in the House today that the Leader of the New South Wales Nationals Andrew Stoner said it would be impossible to have 2016 as the date the Pacific Highway could be duplicated and that, ages ago, he was saying something different. I will quote Andrew Stoner from the New South Wales Hansard of 16 February 2012. He said it was 'something completely impossible given the size of our state's road transport network and our unfair and inadequate revenue base'. That was not ages ago; it was 16 February 2012. Further, Andrew Stoner said in the Northern Star on 20 July 2011 that 'the date remains plausible as long as both governments commit to it'. And I have got a whole lot of quotes that clearly show they were saying 2016 would be the operative date. When I say 'they' I mean the New South Wales government and, in particular members of the New South Wales National Party. There are three state members of the National Party in my seat, and one of them is a minister. They have had a lot to say about the Pacific Highway over time, and I will come to that. But I come back to the fifty-fifty issue. A lot of locals say: 'We don't care who funds it, we just want it funded, we just want it done.' And I agree with them: we do not care at that level. But I do care when people are elected into public positions on an issue like the Pacific Highway-particularly the National Party members. They have given these commitments all the way through. They have inveigled, they have called on other people to make sure they honour that fifty-fifty funding split, and then when it comes to the 2016 deadline, at the first opportunity they get they run away from it at 100 miles per hour. Why aren't they honourable enough to fess up and say, 'We aren't going to do this, but this is what we are going to do'? First of all they construct this 80-20 funding split. Extra money is allocated to the Pacific Highway from the federal government. It is stimulus money. If you have a look at the tabulation of the money that has been available, you can see it. It is there. And then they turn around and use it like a weapon and say it is 80-20. It was not 80-20 and they know it. And it shows in some of their budget papers. It was fifty-fifty. And then we come to the next astounding allegations. They are actually just lies. got one here. I got one last night that came through in a newsletter by the Nationals MP for Clarence, Chris Gulaptis. He talks about getting on with the job of the funding of works on the Pacific Highway, saying 'despite a shock $2.3 billion funding cut in the Gillard government's May budget'another lie. They just put spin on anything. I cannot believe it. They are putting it out with taxpayers paying for it, and it is another pack of lies. The minister for roads, when he was in the upper house-it was earlier this year, I think, in May-started that too. So there are two things. They try to squirm out of the commitment they clearly gave to fifty-fifty funding, and, worse than that, they claimed that only they could deliver it, only they could fix it. And then they constructed this 80-20 split that never existed. It started under John Howard, and John Howard spoke about it in this place many times. It was fifty-fifty. And now they are going on about it being a funding cut. The $3.56 billion available in the federal budget is not what I would call a funding cut, and the $4.1 billion that has been allocated from the federal government thus far for the Pacific Highway clearly is not a funding cut. For the 12 years that the Howard government was in, around $1.3 billion was allocated. But there is more. The New South Wales Treasurer in his budget speech on 6 September 2011 said: In its last Budget, the Commonwealth allocated $750 million for the Pacific Highway but only on the condition that the NSW Government matched this amount. Yes, the fifty-fifty. The state Treasurer went on: We are determined to provide the funds needed to match this Commonwealth offer. That gives credibility to the fifty-fifty but, more than that, when you look at the New I have South Wales budget papers, it shows that they did not even match that. It was $468 million that was actually allocated at that time, even though they said they were 'determined to provide the funds needed to match the Commonwealth offer'. That was done at the time and I can remember it clearly. It says it was $750 million from the federal budget. I remember that there was around $1 billion and there was a sum of around $250 million negotiated that could go somewhere else, because the state government wanted to do it. I now come to the Leader of the Nationals in this place. I heard him talk today. He said the coalition had made enormous strides towards duplicating the Pacific Highway beginning in 1996 when they began to share funding responsibility with the two state governments. (Time expired)",78
145,Mr BALDWIN,IMPORTANCE," There is no doubt that the Pacific Highway is an important piece of infrastructure. This will in fact be my 22nd contribution to this House on the Pacific Highway. I am very fortunate that in my electorate now the roadwork from Raymond Terrace all the way through to Failford is now duplicated-all but the Bulahdelah bypass, which was commenced under the Howard government. Works there have been delayed because of the inordinate amount of wet weather that we have had. I have continued to push for the upgrading of the Pacific Highway. The one thing that concerns me is the rant and rave by the minister-today and on previous occasions-who only now has found it in his breath to actually cast aspersions upon the former state Labor government. The former state Labor government entered into some correspondence, which the minister tabled, and in that correspondence there are some very interesting revelations. In particular is the agreement for an 80-20 funding split. The first is a letter from Minister Albanese to the former Minister for Roads and now NSW shadow treasurer, Michael Darby. I will quote from that letter. It says: I am writing in relation to the Nation Building Program Memorandum of Understanding. I am pleased New South Wales has taken the decision to sign up to that agreement. The minister was so pleased to sign with the New South Wales government that the federal government was delivering $2.451 billion and the New South Wales government was delivering $500 million. When you calculate that, it is actually 83 per cent federal funding and 17 per cent state funding for the Pacific Highway under that agreement-not fifty-fifty; it was 83-17. The next letter that the minister tabled was from the former minister Campbell to Minister Albanese. There are a couple of points in that letter which show that the state Labor government wanted to lock in that 8020, and I will quote from that letter: 'I will undertake to seek confirmation of the 20 per cent New South Wales government commitment to the additional funding required.' In another letter, in which there was an agreement to continue support, the minister said: 'I look forward to working with you on the delivery of the nationbuilding program over the coming years.' That letter to Michael Daley was dated 18 June. Sorry, that was the date it was tabled. Dr Emerson: Do your homework.",80
146,Mr BALDWIN,IMPORTANCE,"Well, your minister obviously does not date letters. Dr Emerson: Well, you should have had a look at it before you brought it into the chamber.",80
147,Mr BALDWIN,IMPORTANCE,"It was your minister who tabled it, my friend. Dr Emerson: You brought it into the chamber.",80
148,Mr BALDWIN,IMPORTANCE,"As I go through the list of works and all of the funding, it ranges from 83-17, 83-17, 86-14, 86-14 and 80-20. What we are seeing here are weasel words from a minister who, when his own political persuasion was in power in the state government, was quite happy to sit back and accept the funding arrangement. The only thing that has changed is that there has been a change of political persuasion to the coalition in New South Wales. And all of a sudden this minister decides it is a gamechanger. All of a sudden he can change the funding arrangement to fifty-fifty from what was, under the nation-building program of 2009-14, a funding arrangement that averaged 80-20. As I said, I am very fortunate to be the member of an electorate where very shortly the work will be duplicated all the way through my electorate. Last week I took my vehicle on a drive up to Brisbane and I travelled up and down the Pacific Highway. I drove up and I drove back. There are parts of that roadwork that still are very notorious and bad. I am happy that work has commenced. I am happy that work has been committed and is under construction. The people who travel those roads and are affected by those roads care very little about what the funding arrangement is. But I put this to the chamber: if this minister had an ounce of honour in his body in relation to this, he would accept the fact that historically he has been funding these roadworks 80-20 and would continue. This change of pace has only occurred because there has been a change in the New South Wales government. In this year's budget papers under his 'Nation Building-additional funding for the Pacific Highway', that additional funding is in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16, with the bulk of it pushed out well and truly into the forward estimates. There is no additional immediate money in 2012-13. Such is the commitment of this minister of this Labor government that in fact it is not until 201314 that there is an additional $231 million and in 2014-15 there is $1.025 billion and in 2015-16 there is $1.4 billion. The rhetoric from the minister makes it appear that the money is sitting on the table right now to start the works today. Well, that is not the truth; that is just not the truth-and the budget papers themselves show that to be a fact. As I said, people want to know when this work will be finished. They do not want the political argy-bargy that is going on; they want outcomes. They want outcomes that will see changes on the Pacific Highway. The minister talks about how choked up he got about the fatal accidents-and I agree with him that they were terrible. I remember the Kempsey bus smash many, many years ago and the fatalities that occurred there. But for this minister to have sat quiet for three years in this House about funding only to raise now his concerns in relation to the levels of funding being contributed by the new coalition government in New South Wales is hypocrisy in itself. The reality is that this minister is not in control of his own budget, does not understand what is required for the outcomes and has done nothing more than play politics with this. Not only is he a member of the same political party as the former state government, but he is also from the same state, New South Wales. That is what makes his assertions even more hypocritical. What we want to see are real outcomes. What we want to see is the work completed. Members up and down the coast-it does not matter what their political persuasion is-get very heated and animated when it comes to the roadworks on the Pacific Highway. As I understand it, more and more the Pacific Highway is becoming the road of choice over the New England Highway as the preferred access route to Queensland, and it does need to be upgraded. But the reality is that this minister, rather than playing political games, needs to sit down in serious discussions and apply the same level of integrity as he did to the former state Labor government, for whom he allowed the 80-20 funding split. We all want to see the road finished. We want to see the work completed, and that is key and critical.",80
149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! I understand that the discussion has concluded. Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,82
150,Mr ZAPPIA,IMPORTANCE," before question time, in speaking on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012, I was making the point that all of us, wherever we live, can take steps to use water more efficiently, and we have seen that extensively in many urban areas. In particular we have seen it in my home state of South Australia, where I have had some personal experience in a number of different schemes in which local communities have engaged in stormwater harvesting and re-use, the establishment of their own recycled water systems and the extensive use of rainwater tanks. In fact recent data from South Australia shows that average daily consumption between 2001 and 2009-10 fell from 756 litres per household to 501 litres per household. In the same period, the state's daily water consumption per person fell from 539 litres to 385 litres. That represents a decrease of 29 per cent. Those kinds of decreases are welcome and hopefully would motivate people right around the country to use or adopt similar methods and ideas in respect of how they might also contribute to water savings. This legislation, I believe, is critical to all that because this legislation enables people to seek out appliances which use less water. It is my view from my interaction with the community-certainly where I come fromthat Australians are becoming more water conscious and would welcome the opportunity to use items or accessories that BILLS will enable them to save water. It would seem to me that this legislation, where it provides a star rating to different items that might be available, would be very much a marketing tool for those who market, design or manufacture those very products. I would suggest that this legislation would encourage further investment in the design and Just manufacture of water-saving products, because the manufacturers would know that there is going to be a demand for their product if it meets the standards. So it is important from the point of view that it will encourage investment, it is important to ensure that the star rating system is applied correctly and is not abused, and it is important because I believe that this legislation will create a mindset of water savings throughout the community. For those reasons and the other reasons which I have touched on in my comments on this bill, I commend the bill to the House.",82
151,Mr HUNT,IMPORTANCE," It gives me great pleasure to support the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012-in particular because this builds on an initiative that the coalition brought into being. In 2005 the coalition government created the world's first national scheme of its kind, providing for water efficiency labels on water products such as shower heads, washing machines, toilets, dishwashers and taps, among other things. My recollection is that I had the privilege of being able to introduce the legislation into this very chamber, albeit from the other side of the table. The important thing about the star rating scheme is that it gives consumers the ability to understand, to make choices and to work out what the impact of their purchasing decisions will be on their water consumption. That objective was a good one then, it remains a good one now, and this bill completes that work. So we are supportive of that. I put this bill into a particular context. has been part of a dramatic change in the approach to water use over the last decade. It began with the work of John Anderson-and I want to give him credit for that-the now gone Peter Cullen, and many others who helped. To the extent that I was able to play a small role in that process of bringing the issue of water to the federal jurisdiction, is a source of great joy and pride. In particular, it was the previous government that put into place an approach-a Murray-Darling Basin Plan-which set up the future. Unfortunately, the ball has largely been dropped by a government which at present has sought to grandstand rather than to deliver. We put in place the $10 billion plan, which still sees enormous quantities of funds which were to have been expended on replumbing rural Australia-on water efficiency on a grand scale-waiting in escrow to be applied to purpose. I look at the Murray Irrigation Area. I look at the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. I look at programs in south Queensland, in the tributaries and headwaters of the Darling, which could have been advanced but which have not been advanced. I look at the Menindee Lakes and see that the beginnings contained within the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act of the day have not necessarily been followed through with the vigour that they should have been in terms of the grand water efficiency schemes which would have had an impact on the carrying capacity and the water efficiency of the Murray-Darling Basin. Having said that, let me note that what this bill does is make relatively minor amendments to the WELS Act to allow the minister to determine more of the scheme's details, particularly those relating to registration of products and cost recovery. It means the minister, with the fiat of the states, It can act at a national level without reference and without having to make changes to, all up, as many as nine different acts. It is a sensible approach, entirely in line with what was put into being from the outset. The broader context of this particular bill and the predecessor act is about consolidation of environmental programs that into single national schemes. We do this across water, we do it across land and we do it across air quality. I specifically want to make reference to land. We want to build a one-stop-shop approach in the same way that this legislation seeks to for environmental approvals. At present, we have systems of environmental approvals across Commonwealth and state jurisdictions which can literally take more than half a decade and which can have thousands and thousands of pages of requirements and then potentially thousands of approval triggers, which in each case will have to be negotiated through a separate licence. So our approach is the same as is contained in this bill, and that is to seek a single one-stop-shop approach. If elected, we want to cooperate with each of the states to establish bilateral agreements. It is timely the minister arrives here on that note-he who has delayed the Alpha coal project with a shameless abuse of process, in my own respectful submission to the House. My view and our view is that we can have consolidated single national processes. In the case of environmental approvals, we should seek to do this wherever possible through agreements with the states to dramatically simplify the process: one single document lodgement, one single assessment process and clear time lines so we can simplify the process. I have no problem with a red light if a program is a bad one. I have no problem with a red light if a project will result in environmental damage. What I do have a problem with is if we are in permanent amber-light mode. I would respectfully request the minister to take this opportunity to indicate the progress he is making with the stalled Alpha coal project, which should have been a shining example of cooperation. Finally, I turn to the third area of cooperation, and that is on air quality and, particular, emissions reduction. approach is very simple: to seek to have one single national emissions reduction fund. We want to work away from the multiplicity of state schemes to one single national emissions reduction fund. This bill does not stand on its own; it is part of a broader context of history. The simplification process is the potential, the possibility, the opportunity we have at this point of time. So I am delighted to support this bill. It completes the work we began in 2005.",82
152,Mr BURKE,IMPORTANCE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (16:41): I cannot begin to say what an absolute pleasure it is to be here in Canberra today to hear the speech from the member for Flinders. It would have been earth shattering had I missed it becauseMr Hunt interjecting",84
153,Mr BURKE,IMPORTANCE,"Don't interject from out of your seat-that is highly disorderly. I have particularly enjoyed the concept that one of the issues that apparently is pertinent to the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012 is the Alpha coal project, in the mind of the member for Flinders. He has raised some issues in the course of the debate which I do think are worth me responding to directly. In the first instance, that is the first time. I have heard the opposition say that they were opposed to the decisions I took on Alpha coal. They may well have made those comments to the media before, but I have not heard them in the parliament before. Mr Hunt interjecting",84
154,Mr BURKE,IMPORTANCE,"If it is the case-while the member interjects from out of his seat-that they reject it, they should be very careful what they wish for, because what the in member for Flinders is suggesting I should Our have done was make a decision on incomplete information which would then have been turfed out in court. The member for Flinders is suggesting that the responsible thing to do would have been the opposite of what the proponents wanted me to do. The proponents, the company themselves, actually asked me to complete the process. The Queensland government asked me and agreed that the process should be completed at a Commonwealth level. The worse outcome for business and the worse outcome for the environment would be to make a decision when the assessment Water, work had not been completed. The risk that is taken to the environment is obvious. It is not a game of pin the tail on the donkey, where you blindfold yourself from the information and just say, 'Look, let's whack the conditions there.' You are dealing with serious issues for the environment and you need to know the factual basis on which those decisions are being made. Had the Queensland Coordinator-General completed the process, then a decision would have been made by me within the 30-day period. Even Queensland acknowledged that they were not completing the process. What has happened since then-I put this out publicly in a media release which came out early this week or it may have been Friday last week-is there are four specific issues we need further information on. Some of that was information already held by Alpha that simply had not been included within the Coordinator-General's report. Alpha are now getting that information. It will probably be beyond the original 30-day business time line, but we have stopped the clock to make sure that we are within the rules on that. I am not expecting that it is going to be a date that would have any problems for the time line of investment decisions for the company. Obviously, I cannot prejudge what the answer will be, but the issues which need to be raised and are being finalised are simply issues where an assessment is required under national environmental law. To date, to do less than that was not the position of the coalition. My understanding of the position of the coalition has always been that they did not want a lowering of the quality of assessments or of environmental standards but they did want a streamlining of the process. The process would have been streamlined had the Queensland Coordinator-General finished the job. Now, in a good agreement which was signed last Friday by me, the Queensland Minister for Environment and Heritage Protection and the Deputy Premier of Queensland, we have some amendments to the bilateral agreement to make sure as best we can that this sort of problem never arises again. I have no interest in delays or duplication, but I also have absolutely no interest in lowering environmental standards or making decisions that later on get thrown out in court. If it is the position of the opposition that I should have made the Alpha coal decision on information that was deficient and did not meet the standards of national environmental law, that is a significant shift from their public position and I would simply urge them to correct it at the earliest possible opportunity.",84
155,Mr Hunt,IMPORTANCE,"No, we expect you to do your job.",85
156,Mr BURKE,IMPORTANCE,"I will acknowledge the interjection because it is a classic. The interjection is: 'We expect you to do your job.' The problem is that they were just telling me a minute ago they did not want me to do my job and they wanted me to simply accept that when Queensland stops short I should jump ahead, make a decision and not fulfil my responsibilities under national environmental law. I am not prepared to do that. The company is working constructively with us. The relationship with the Queensland government will, I think, be on a better footing because of the amendments we made to the bilateral agreement last week. There may well be times in the future when Queensland decides, perhaps for good reason, that the expertise to provide an assessment is actually better done at a Commonwealth level. That happened, for example, on some of the coal seam gas decisions because we had the availability and expertise of Geoscience Australia. From time to time, even under a bilateral agreement, a state government says, 'Look, we actually think this is something that you would be better placed to do.' So there will be occasions when there is still duplication, but it will occur in a cooperative way and with plenty of notice, rather than us only finding out at the end of the process that the job is in fact not yet finished. Having dealt with the issues that are in front of us in this debate-but which are a bit of a stretch when it comes to the bill-I say that the bill itself deals with issues that have had bipartisan support for significant periods of time. I am pleased that there has been a constructive debate and pleased and proud to be here to thank everybody for their contributions. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for the bill announced. Third Reading",85

Bill read a third time. Navigation Bill 2012 Navigation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012 Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",86
158,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE," I rise to speak on the Navigation Bill 2012 and its consequential amendments bill, which update and modernise the Navigation Act 1912. Even though they are not directly connected, this bill will be debated together with the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012 and its consequential amendments bill, which provide the legislative framework for the implementation of the national marine safety regulator. Let me begin by discussing the Navigation Bill 2012. The original Navigation Act from 1912 is regarded as one of the major achievements of Prime Minister Andrew Fisher, who was, I might add, the first member for my electorate of Wide Bay. It certainly was a big achievement for the relatively new Federation of Australia at the time. In 1912, when the bill was debated in the House, the minister at the time, Frank Tudor, noted that not only was it the longest Water, bill ever submitted to the decade-old Australian parliament but it was practically the longest bill on maritime activity and shipping introduced to any parliament. If you look at its replacement bill, while it has some volume it is tiny compared with much of the legislation that comes into the parliament these days. It does not compare too honourably to the Fair Work Bill, which was quite thick, or taxation law et cetera. Those sorts of things obviously take a lot of space these days. But, in its day in 1912, the Navigation Act was the longest piece of legislation that had been introduced into the parliament. The 1912 bill was a long time in the making. It was originally drafted in 1903. It was read for the first time in 1904, before being withdrawn, and then a royal commission was established to investigate how shipping in Australia should be regulated. In 1905 a conference of colonial parliaments was proposed and in 1907 that conference was finally held. A bill was introduced in 1907 and again in 1908 and again in 1910, but it was not until 1912 that Australia finally got there. After lengthy debate and comprehensive amendments, the Navigation Act 1912 was passed. It took nine years from the drafting stage until the bill passed the parliament, but it has to be acknowledged that there were in fact eight changes of government during that period. I guess that is unthinkable in modern political terms. But it is also perhaps significant that this was the era when the Titanic sank and it would undoubtedly have considerable community interest into making sure that navigation and maritime law in our country were appropriate to meet the needs of that time. The minister should be pleased that the rewrite of the act has only taken around three years to come together-about a third of the time it took the original act to be drafted and is enacted. passed. In the minister's second reading speech from 1912, he stated that the bill largely followed the United Kingdom's Merchant Shipping Act. However, the minister noted the large number of amendments to the UK act-81 in the 50odd years between 1840 and 1894-which resulted in it being extremely difficult at end of that time to find out exactly what the law was, unless members of the House of Commons or those interested in the act knew exactly what amendments had been made. Now we face the same situation, where the Navigation Act of 1912 has been amended so many times that, after 100 years, it is indeed in need of an update. The Navigation Act 1912 is Australia's primary piece of legislation for regulating ship and seafarer safety, shipboard aspects of protection of the marine environment, and employment conditions for Australian seafarers. It gives effect to Australia's port state control responsibilities and implements a range of international conventions covering matters such as the safety of life at sea, training and certification of seafarers, prevention of collisions at sea, watertight integrity and reserve buoyancy of ships, and regulations to determine gross and net tonnage of ships. The Navigation Bill 2012 will rewrite the Navigation Act 1912 with modern language to reflect contemporary conditions and practices in the shipping industry. It will remove a number of unnecessary and brought outdated provisions and enhance ship safety and protection of the marine environment. It will also introduce greater flexibility to allow regulation to remain contemporary with the national and international standards as they develop over time. The bill also encompasses the Lighthouses Act 1911, one of Australia's oldest laws, which will be repealed if this bill The minister in his second reading speech has mentioned a number of the archaic provisions contained in the Navigation Act 1912, such as those which make it an offence to take a lunatic to sea without telling the master, and provisions exempting the master of a ship from prosecution if he shoots a the seafarer. Additionally, the rewrite of the Navigation Act 1912 will give effect to the International Labour Organisation's Maritime Labour Convention, which was passed through the parliament late last year, as the bill incorporates the conditions of the Maritime Labour Convention. I understand that industry is supportive of the rewrite of the Navigation Act 1912 and acknowledges that the current act is out of date and does not accord with modern industry practices. I acknowledge that Shipping Australia has raised concerns about the harshness of the penalties imposed by the bill in their submission to the consultation process. The bill does establish a number of civil and criminal penalty provisions. In some cases, lengthy prison sentences can be imposed. However, I note that the explanatory memorandum of the bill states that the penalties for offences in the bill are intended to reinforce the deterrent effect of the bill and give courts the discretion to respond meaningfully and proportionally to breaches. Breaches of the Navigation Act can have serious consequences for the environment, the community and, of course, the lives of seafarers. The coalition will not oppose the Navigation Bill 2012. We recognise that the efforts to modernise, streamline and clarify existing provisions to ensure that it reflects contemporary maritime industry practice should be supported. I will now turn to the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012. As I mentioned earlier, this bill, together with its consequential amendments bill, introduces a new national law for maritime safety that will commence from 1 January 2013 and establishes the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, as the national maritime regulator to provide for the consistent regulation of domestic shipping. The bill establishes a system of vessel identification and the issue of certificates in relation to vessel identification, vessel survey, the commercial operation of vessels and competency. The bill also creates an offence where a certificate is required and not held or held and not complied with, and establishes general safety obligations on persons involved in the operation of a commercial vessel, or who may use the vessel as a conveyance, to take reasonable care for their own safety and the safety of others. It also establishes a system within which to conduct compliance and enforcement activities and provides for the consistent application of nationally agreed standards across Australia. The principle of the establishment of a national maritime safety regulator has been agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments, and the specifics of the regulations contained in this bill were agreed to by the Standing Council on Transport and Infrastructure, comprised of transport ministers from all jurisdictions, last month. I trust that the states and territories will enact multiple appropriate legislation in their own jurisdictions as necessary to fully implement the national maritime safety regulator. The national maritime safety regulator is one part of the three national transport regulators that are presently being established. The South Australian government has recently passed laws establishing the National Rail Safety Regulator, and the new Queensland government is presently considering legislation to implement the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. Harmonisation of laws in these three areas will, it has been estimated, provide productivity benefits of $30 billion over the next 20 years as the 23 current regulators will be consolidated into three national regulators. Currently there are eight different marine safety regulators in Australia, each implementing their own rules and regulations, and there are, in fact, many instances where those rules and regulations seafarer vary. People find that a vessel that can operate legally in one state cannot, when it crosses the borders, meet the new state's requirements. The bills will mean that Australia will have one national maritime safety law replacing 50 pieces of state and federal legislation. Under the bills AMSA will be established as the national regulator and existing state and territory regulators will deliver national law functions under the delegation of AMSA. State and territory agencies will be responsible for the effective day-today operation of the national law. These jurisdictions will retain responsibility for the regulation of waterways, the management of ports and associated issues such as classifying waters, setting speed limits and regulating alcohol consumption. The bills will mean that companies that operate nationally will not have to comply with safety regulatory regimes. Designers and builders will have to comply with one certification system rather than applying for recertification in each jurisdiction. The national law will cut through red tape for business involved in the industry. In addition to the national law being supported by all jurisdictions, extensive industry consultation has been undertaken, and I understand that, broadly speaking, industry is supportive of a national maritime safety regulator. I note that some concerns have been raised by smaller groups and I trust that the department, AMSA, and the minister will work constructively with these organisations to ensure that a positive outcome is reached, particularly as regulations are prepared to support this legislation. It is important when considering national law in such a complex area that we get it right to prevent any unintended consequences that could have a drastic impact on these industries. I understand that in May the scuba clubs wrote to the minister outlining their concerns about some aspects of the national law, and at the time the minister's office advised that the way dive clubs will be treated under legislation will be decided after further consultation. Generally, community group vessels will not be subject to regulation under the national law. Only those community group vessels used for a commercial purpose or to undertake commercial activities will be regulated under the national law. The minister has informed me that these purposes or activities will be articulated in the regulations stakeholders will be consulted on the development of the regulations, which I understand will be starting as soon as the laws have been passed. To the extent that dive clubs are community groups the same rules will apply as outlined previously. In other words, it is intended that through the regulations the dive club vessels operated in connection with commercial activity-for example, where nonmembers pay a fee-or for commercial purposes will be subject to national law standards. However, the regulatory treatment will be tailored to the risks involved in the activities. Activities assessed as low risk will be subject to low-level regulations. These vessels are, of course, now regulated by the states, and the minister has assured me that it is anticipated that the level of regulation is unlikely to be significantly different under the national law to what applies at the current state level and, hopefully, in some cases it may be less. The legislation is due to take effect in six months. I remind the minister of his commitment to ensure that the concerns that have been raised are addressed promptly and in time for the legislation to be effectively implemented. In conclusion, the coalition will be supporting the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012. The bill has the support of all state and territory governments and has received broad industry support. The bill will reduce industry red tape and will harmonise the contradictory laws which are currently in place by replacing eight regulators and 50 acts with one national law. This bill has been under preparation now for quite some time. It has taken some years for it to go through the COAG process, but we know that that is a somewhat slow-moving process. I am pleased that in this area, where there has and been so much overlapping regulation and so much duplication, this legislation is a significant step forward to helping achieve uniformity of regulation across the nation.",86
159,Ms OWENS,IMPORTANCE," I am pleased to stand to speak on the Navigation Bill 2012, the Navigation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012, the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012 and the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012. I have been watching with some interest the progress towards this day for a number of years. This suite of bills brings together for me a number of the characteristics of this government: firstly, an absolute commitment to Australian shipping and a place for Australian shipping not only as a builder of ships but also in a country that can stand tall in the international shipping world. It once again looks to the future. Secondly, it considers, in the drafting of this suite of bills, the flexibility that is needed things change in the industry. This is well and truly-particularly relative to the bill that it replaces-a suite of bills that looks at the future and the position of our shipping industry very well. Thirdly, it also brings forward something that this government has been doing consistently for four years now-that is, starting to remove the unnecessary duplication of regulation that we have in this nation when people cross state borders. Over the last year I have watched the government deal with the duplication of regulation for business names, for the registration of medical practitioners and for the sharing of information among police forces-a whole range of areas where this government has stepped into take out some of that unnecessary duplication which has grown over time, largely because we started as a federation of states, but which still in 2012 is something that plagues many businesses around the country. This suite of bills is literally 100 years in the making. The main bill, the Navigation Bill 2012, essentially replaces the Navigation Act 1912, an act which celebrates its 100th birthday this year. It is one of the oldest acts in parliament and, as we heard from the previous speaker, one that took some nine years of development and was one of the largest acts of parliament of its day. It was still being drafted in 1912 when the Titanic sank, and the drafting was altered to incorporate safety recommendations that were internationally agreed to following that disaster. It is an extremely important act. It is the key legislative vehicle to give domestic effect to Australia's port control responsibilities and implements a range of international conventions covering matters such as safety of life at sea, training and certification of seafarers, prevention of collisions at sea, watertight integrity and reserve buoyancy of as ships, pollution prevention standards for ships, safety of containers, salvage and regulations to determine gross and net tonnage of ships. These are things that most Australians would not give a thought to on a day-today basis; but, if you think about it for any length of time, you realise it is an act of parliament that underpins much of the safety of personnel and our environment. It is the primary legislation that regulates ship and seafarer safety, employment conditions for Australian seafarers and, importantly, the shipboard aspects of protection of the marine environment, so it is an extremely important act. As you would expect, it has been amended over the years many times. It has often been the case that it was done on an ad hoc basis-a fix here, a fix there, a change to meet new international conventions. As a result, it is a strange mix of modern and archaic concepts. The archaic provisions are gone from the new act. As has been mentioned a number of times, we no longer necessarily need the master of a ship to be told if someone who is coming onboard is, to quote from the old act, 'a lunatic'. It would no longer be right for the master of a ship to be able to shoot someone and be immune from prosecution. And yet those provisions had remained in the act. They are now gone. But the changes go much further than that. They are a genuine rewriting of the act, casting it in modern, plain language. Perhaps that is also partly the reason why it is much shorter than the old one. I know that when most of us start looking at an old act the to pick up the red pencil comes out. It has well and truly been done here. It is cast in plain, easily understood language. It reflects contemporary conditions and practices in the shipping industry. It removes unnecessary and outdated provisions. It enhances ship safety and protection of the marine environment. It introduces greater flexibility to allow regulation to remain contemporary with national and international standards. In doing all of that it provides confidence and certainty for the shipping industry. It also encompasses another act which is even older than the Navigation Act 1912, and that is the Lighthouses Act 1911. That, of course, is an act that is about aids to navigation, but navigation has changed quite considerably since that initial act was drafted, as you can imagine. Again the act has been altered and amended over time, but the new provisions have been modernised and are flexible enough to encompass all the new ways of navigation including satellites, global positioning systems and traditional beacons and lights. Those provisions will be encompassed in the new Navigation Bill 2012. The old Lighthouses Act 1911 will be repealed once the new act comes into play. The bill took about three years in planning, public and whole-of-government consultation and extensive drafting. Through the commitment and cooperation demonstrated by all stakeholders, we now have a bill which will well and truly set the shipping industry up for the future. Shipping is an incredibly important part of Australian life. Australia's shipping is now the fourth-largest in the world but, at the same time as it has been growing, the number of Australian ships operating has been in drastic decline. In 1996, 16 years ago, we had 55 ships. Today we only have 21, with just four operating internationally. This government has introduced legislation urge recently which demonstrates its commitment to regrowing this incredibly important part of our national life. We are an island, as we know. We are a country where 99.9 per cent of our exports are moved by ships. That again makes this particular industry incredibly important. And yet it has operated for quite some time under some interesting restrictions. The Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012 works to remove some of the regulatory burdens that the shipping industry faces. It creates one of the three national regulators that will replace 23 existing regulators of rail, heavy vehicles and ships. It introduces a new national law for the regulation of domestic commercial vessel safety and establishes the Australian Maritime Safety Authority as the national marine safety regulator. This will make a remarkable difference. It has come about through consultation through COAG-again a very comprehensive negotiation processbecause it effectively removes a great deal of state regulation and replaces it with the national one. The reduction in red tape and the productivity benefits of this reform are calculated to be around $30 billion over 30 years. The bill means that Australia finally has one national maritime safety law replacing 50 pieces of legislation in seven jurisdictions, one national maritime safety regulator replacing seven state and territory regulators, and one national system for commercial safety allowing the seamless movement of domestic commercial vessels and crew around the country. I want to talk about exactly what that means. For example, if you look at crew qualifications between jurisdictions, a seafarer may be issued a certificate from the Australian Maritime College in Tasmania following an oral examination, but if he decides to seek work in Western Australia he must be issued with a new Western Australian certificate when he crosses the border, involving the payment of a $335 fee. Nationally recognised qualifications and a single certificate will allow a smooth transfer of labour across state borders. It also affects construction standards. A vessel built in one jurisdiction for operation in another requires certification during construction by a surveyor from the receiving jurisdiction. This only applies if the ship is travelling domestically. For example, a company based in Tasmania builds catamarans. The catamarans are all built to the national standard and subject to survey during construction. The vessels sold around the world with supporting documentation based on the national standard for commercial vessels are accepted without question. But if that catamaran should be sold domestically, additional documentation and physical inspections are required by the gaining jurisdiction's maritime authority. If you build a catamaran in Tasmania and move it from state to state you have to get additional documentation, but if you take it overseas it can happily travel around the world. This new national maritime regulator removes that quite onerous regulatory burden. It also means that meeting the requirements of different jurisdictions in relation to the issue of certificates will be removed, saving considerable time should the owner of a vessel decide to move interstate or take the vessel across the border. Another example is of a Tasmanian company operating a fishing vessel around the nation, including in waters at the top of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Every time one of that company's vessels crosses waters between the Northern Territory and Queensland the company must apply for new seaworthy certificates from the respective maritime transport authorities. For that particular company seven staff are employed just to support the administrative work required to cross a dotted line when it comes to a state border in an ocean. This is a very important suite of bills. It recrafts an act which has served us well for a long time, but is now increasingly a patchwork of archaic and modern concepts. It recrafts that into a modern bill with associated bills that look to the future and recognise the reality of the shipping industry in Australia. This suite of maritime bills prepares our regulatory framework for growth in the Australian shipbuilding industry itself. You can imagine the increased complexity for Australian shipbuilders as we increase our shipbuilding capacity if the regulation had continued as it was, requiring such an onerous regulatory burden every time our ships cross a border. They are important pieces of legislation which have been many years in the making. I congratulate the minister and the department for some extraordinary work. New legislation which requires such extensive consultation with all the state jurisdictions is very difficult to achieve. That is one of the reasons why drafting such legislation takes three or more years. It demonstrates an extraordinary commitment to looking to both the future and our Australian shipping industry. I commend the bill to the House.",89
160,Mr ROBERT,IMPORTANCE," I rise to comment on the bills being debated in cognate, including the Navigation Bill 2012 state and consequential amendments to marine safety legislation. It will not surprise many people to realise that the Navigation Act is end 100 years old. It has been amended many times and as a result apparently is a mix of archaic and modern concepts. It must be a cracking read. At the National Shipping Industry Conference 2009 the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport announced the government's intention to rewrite the act-a fitting task, one would think. Many provisions of the act were taken from the British Merchant Shipping Act 1894 which included laws which have been around since the 18th century. One can only surmise what some of those laws were. Apparently they included making it an offence to take a lunatic to sea without telling the master, something the Labor Party should perhaps have been informed about previously. But it is good to know they are focusing on the big issues of ensuring that lunatics are no longer on the high seas. The Navigation Act 1912 is Australia's primary piece of legislation for regulating ship and seafarer safety, shipboard aspects of protection of the marine environment and employment conditions for Australian seafarers. The bill gives effect to Australia's port control responsibilities and implements a range of international conventions covering matters such as safety of life at sea, training and certification of seafarers, prevention of collisions at sea, watertight integrity and reserve buoyancy of ships and regulations to determine gross and net tonnage of ships. If the legislation were simply about the restriction of lunatics it may well be fitting itself. The Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill introduces a new national law for maritime safety that will commence on 1 January 2013 and establishes a national maritime regulator to provide for the consistent regulation of domestic commercial shipping. This is part of a suite of reforms agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in 2009. They are intended to adopt nationally consistent laws in maritime and rail safety and for the heavy vehicle industry. This will apparently reduce the regulatory burden on a business and will consolidate the existing 23 regulators into three national regulators. Frankly, the reduction of regulators by itself is always a good move. These reforms are expected to provide productivity benefits of some oneand-a-bit million dollars per year, or $30 million over 20 years. As a general rule the merging of regulators into national regulators-the merging of many into fewmakes sense. Nationally consistent laws in the maritime, rail and heavy vehicle industries also makes sense. There is scope in terms of maritime safety, maritime law and navigation law for other areas to be widened as well. The electorate of Fadden, which I represent, is of course home to the Gold Coast Marine Precinct, that has some of the nation's great luxury boatbuilders. These include the likes of Maritimo and also the great tinnie producer, Telwater Marine, which produces 10,000 tinnies there, as well as a number of other yacht builders and boatbuilders. One of the key areas of concern for these boatbuilders, whilst these issues of debate and legislation are important, is the issue of grey imports. These are boats flooding in from overseas which are not required to meet Australian manufacturing standards, are not in required to have Australian manufacturing plates certifying their met standards, are not required to meet Australian safety standards and, of course, have only tier 1emission standards engines. The rest of the world-the rest of the world meaning the United States, Europe and, I believe, even Somalia-is moving to tiers 2 and 3 emission standards for inboard engines over 37 kilowatts. Australia has not moved into that area to do that. Therefore, a large number of boats and engines over that power rating that only meet tier 1 standards are coming into Australia. At present there are regulations in terms of motor vessels, and there is an overarching piece of legislation that allows regs to hang off motor vehicles, but there is nothing that covers motor vessels. So whilst the coalition will support the government as they seek to have nationally consistent laws that line up in maritime, rail safety and the heavy vehicle industries, I think there is also space for opposition and the government to commence a dialogue on how we deal with other areas of the boating industry to ensure that boats and engines that are imported into Australia in that pleasure craft space comply with Australian manufacturing law, comply with Australian standards and comply with Australian safety requirements and, of course, have a tier 2or 3-emission engine. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss these issues with the minister. The current bills on the table enjoy the coalition's support.",92
161,Mr ZAPPIA,IMPORTANCE," Yesterday was a historic day for the shipping industry here in Australia, when we saw reforms that had been worked on for the last five years passed through the Senate. Having passed through the Senate, and also having been through this House, that legislation will now obviously become law and put into effect those very important and long-overdue reforms. These are reforms which all speakers have made the point about, that they update legislation that is now 100 years old-legislation that is clearly outdated and which should have been updated a long, long time ago. It was interesting to hear the member for Fadden say that the coalition will support this legislation, because they did not support the reforms which were voted on in the Senate yesterday and they did not support those reforms when they were in this House. So I am pleased to hear that at least they support this legislation, the package of bills that is before us today-the Navigation Bill 2012 and cognate bills. It is a package of bills, because this legislation sets out to do a number of things. Whilst I certainly will not go into detail about all of them, there are some comments I want to make. The most important aspect of the this legislation is that a national maritime regulator is established under the national law bill. Not only is a national maritime regulator long overdue but it will create much more efficiency in the shipping industry here. The national maritime regulator is one of three national regulators that replace 23 existing regulators for rail, heavy vehicle and ships across this country. The national law bill introduces a new national law for the regulation of domestic commercial vessel safety and establishes the Australian Maritime Safety Authority as the national regulator. The objects of the bill are to promote continuous improvement in marine safety, to promote public confidence in the safety of marine operators, to ensure effective identification and management of safety risks and to reduce the regulatory burden without compromising safety. It is all about making our shipping industry more efficient. The national law bill is a component of the national transport reform package, which I mentioned a moment ago, and there has been other legislation in respect of the road transport sector. That was debated in this parliament only last month and, again, it complements this legislation. It has also now been agreed to by this parliament. The policy basis for this legislation arises from an agreement reached at the Council of Australian Governments meeting on 19 August 2011. So this is legislation that has the support of each of the states and territories. And understandably so, because having three national transport regulators instead of 23, which is currently the case across the three sectors, will result in significant improvements to efficiency and to productivity. Across those three transport sectors those improvements are estimated to save about $30 billion over the next 20 years. That is not insignificant-$30 billion is a lot of money, and it is money that would not be able to be saved if we did not undertake and commit to the reforms across all of the three transport sectors. This bill means that Australia now has one national maritime safety law replacing 50 pieces of legislation in seven jurisdictions, one national maritime safety regulator replacing seven state and territory regulators and one national system for commercial vessel safety, allowing the seamless movement of domestic commercial vessels and crew around the country. Clearly it makes sense to have one national regulator. It also makes a lot of sense to have one national set of laws so that as vessels move from one state to the waters of another state they are subjected to the same laws and conditions. The state and territory agencies will still be responsible for the effective day-today operation of the national law under delegation from the national regulator. The jurisdictions-that is, the states and territories-will retain responsibility for the regulation of waterways, the management of ports and associated issues such as classifying waters, setting speed limits and regulating alcohol consumption. I think it is quite appropriate that each have that responsibility remain with it. I note that vessels which operate internationally, foreign vessels and vessels which maintain certification under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea will be regulated by the Commonwealth under the Navigation Act 2012 and are outside the scope of this bill. Defence vessels and recreation vessels are also outside the application of this bill. Interstate vessels that are currently regulated under the Navigation Act 1912 will be covered under the national law from its commencement. The Maritime Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law (Consequential Amendments) Bill provides for consequential amendments to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990, the AMSA Act, and the national law bill. The objective of this arrangement is to align the national law, general safety obligations and offences with workplace health and safety duties and offences once the WHS Act has been enacted nationally. Schedule 1 of the bill amends the AMSA Act to include definitions defined in the national law and to reflect the agreement on commercial vessel safety reform that the Commonwealth reached in the Council of Australian Governments agreement. The bill will ensure that the AMSA board membership includes at least one member with knowledge of or experience relevant to non-SOLAS-convention commercial vessel operation and/or construction. Schedule 2 of the bill repeals the existing offences and penalties for the general safety duties in the national law and replaces them with provisions that correspond substantially with the provisions of part 2 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011. Schedule 2 will take effect when all law that corresponds substantially with the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 is enacted in all states and state and territory territories. I want to make a few general comments about the shipping industry in this country, and they are comments that I touched on when I was speaking to the reforms only two weeks ago. Those reforms, as I said at the outset, have now been passed by both this House and the Senate. According to the Australian Logistics Council, the national freight task in this country is expected to double to 1,000 billion tonne kilometres by 2030 and to 1,400 billion tonne kilometres by 2050. We live in a country where we export a lot of our product. We are fortunate to have an abundance of mineral resources. We sell those resources outside this country, but we do not ship them because we have hardly any ships left in this country. In understand that less than half a per cent of our exports are carried by Australian flag vessels. It is high time that we got behind our shipping industry in this country. It is high time for several reasons. Firstly, we have a product to export, yet we have no means to carry it. It makes logical sense to value-add to that product by having a shipping industry and a shipping fleet capable of continuing the work that we generate in this country. Secondly, we know full well that a shipping industry, like any industry, has to abide by regulations and the laws of the sea. We have had too many experiences where that has not occurred, including in our own waters, and we have seen the destruction and damage that is caused by that. By having professional, well-regulated, well-trained shipping crews, that is not likely to happen. It is in our environmental interest, if nothing else, to ensure that that happens. We also have obligations to the rest of the world when our ships are in international waters or when any ship carrying our produce is in international waters. If we are going to live up to those obligations, it seems to me that we ought to be in total control of the process. We have an opportunity to do something that we have neglected to do for a long, long time, which is to revive the shipping fleet of Australia. In doing so we will add to our national prosperity and we will also be more in control of our future affairs. A good example of that, where we literally see money being wasted, is the demurrage costs that we pay to foreign vessels whilst they sit in our coastal waters waiting to be loaded. I understand that in 2008, which is the last year I have figures for, we paid about $1.8 billion in demurrage costs just to have those vessels sitting out in our coastal waters. Even if it were our ships sitting out there, at least that money would be going into our own fact I industry and not into someone else's. There are very many good economic reasons to revive and support the Australian shipping industry. The four pieces of legislation that we are dealing with today are part of that process. It is legislation that has been worked on for some time, it is legislation that has the agreement of the industry, it is legislation that has the agreement of the states and it is legislation that will add to the national economy and national prosperity. For those reasons I commend the legislation to the House. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (17:36): I rise today to speak on the Navigation Bill 2012, the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012 and cognate bills. These measures are an important step at streamlining, modernising and clarifying existing laws to reflect contemporary maritime industry practice. They are also a necessary step to legislate the extensive Council of Australian Governments, COAG, reforms and will give effect to international agreements incorporating the conditions from the International Labour Organisation's Maritime Labour Convention. It is a curious incident in the history of Australian parliamentary democracy that the primary bill governing Australian navigation is the oft-amended Navigation Act 1912, now a 100-year-old act that still contains a jumble of both archaic and modern concepts. The initial act was based on provisions contained in the British Merchant Shipping Act 1894, which included laws such as the offence to take a lunatic to sea without telling the master. The act is Australia's primary piece of legislation with regard to the regulation ship and seafarer safety, employment conditions for Australian seafarers and some aspects of marine environment protection. As such, the coalition welcomed the announcement at the 2009 Natship conference by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport to review this legislation and rewrite the act. Following the passage of the coastal shipping reforms, about which I have spoken in this House previously, and the consequent introduction of the Australian international second register, the conditions of the International Labour Organisation's Maritime Labour Convention have been codified into law, and this rewrite will give effect to that convention. There are provisions in this bill for significant penalties for breaches of the conditions of the bill, which are included as a deterrent effect and which also provide for redress through the court system to respond proportionally to any breach. It is very important to note that any breach of the Navigation Act 1912 can have very serious consequences for the Australian marine environment, as well as for the community and the lives of seafarers themselves. From this premise, the industry must accept their duty to follow the provisions which protect these stakeholders, for which there are three key categories of offences: offences involving intentional misconduct, which carry the highest maximum penalty under these measures, and reckless or negligent conduct, which attracts relatively lower penalties. In addition, as an alternative to criminal prosecution proceedings, the bills creates civil penalty provisions. Following a considered process to rewrite this act, I trust that these bills will be a meaningful step to reform Australian navigation. These bills reflect Australia's commitment to international cooperation by giving effect to a range of international of conventions which cover many areas including safety of life at sea, the prevention of ship collisions, the regulation of watertight integrity and reserve buoyancy of ships, determinations about gross and net tonnage of ships, and of course training and certification of seafarers, which I will touch on in more detail later. The coalition supports the passage of these bills through parliament as they are a necessary modernisation of navigation regulations. However, I do note that there are still significant concerns within the industry relating to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and with these bills making that organisation the overarching national regulator-which will apply to all of Australia-these concerns must be addressed. The Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012 and cognate bills serve to establish a national maritime regulator to streamline Australian intergovernmental regulation of marine safety, which aims to provide constituent regulation of domestic commercial shipping across the nation. The primary intentions of the bill are to establish the existing Australian Maritime Safety Authority as the so-called national regulator for the express purpose of performing necessary functions and exercising powers of the provisions of the bills; establish a national system for the identification of vessels and the issuance of certificates; establish offences for non-compliance with certificate requirements or for where appropriate certificates are not held; determine general safety obligations for those involved in commercial vessel operations and for those who may use the vessel to ensure proper safety procedures are followed; create a system for compliance and enforcement activities; and have provisions for consistent application of nationally agreed standards across the country. At present, there are currently eight separate marine safety regulators when you consider the Commonwealth, the six states and the Northern Territory. These bills will mean that there will be only one regulator, AMSA. Moreover, these bills will supersede 50 pieces of legislation across seven jurisdictions which currently govern maritime safety law. This means that interstate vessels which are currently regulated under the Navigation Act 1912 will be covered under the national law. On the ground, the responsibility for the effective day-today operations of the law will lie with the state and territory agencies. Of course, each jurisdiction will still be responsible paying their fair share in order to fund AMSA, such that the Commonwealth will pay the most, with each respective state donating an appropriate amount. I recently had a meeting with a constituent who is very concerned about the watering down of conditions under Marine Order 3 for marine engineers. This process is still ongoing, with the consultation draft being released on 8 December 2011, which preceded information sessions and 202 written submissions. There were concerns that the new issue of Marine Order 3 would come into force on 1 July 2012. However, the Chief Executive Officer of AMSA, Mr Graham Peachey, has indicated that they will delay the implementation, and, importantly, further consult with industry before declaring a new issue of Marine Order 3. This enables any remaining issues to be addressed, and I would like to update the House on the grave concerns held by marine engineers. My constituent made a very considered submission to the Maritime Operations Division of AMSA regarding these changes. In his submission, he outlined his experience: he has completed a Bachelor of Naval Architecture with first-class honours, completed a three-year marine engineering cadetship and passed very difficult AMSA oral exams, steam and motor class certificates, as well as realising many other qualifications and expertise through many years in the Royal Australian Navy and merchant navy. Clearly, this constituent is very experienced and knows the industry back to front. He is extremely concerned on three fronts. Firstly, that the significant reduction in sea time to 26 weeks for a trainee marine engineer will produce trainees with a serious lack of necessary experience. This reduction is also relevant to the lack of distinction between diesel engines on small for near coastal craft and a variable speed bluewater vessel, which may run on diesel or gas turbines or be steam propelled. As a result, there are concerns that, in failing to distinguish between an engineer's training on one or both of these ships, they may lack the necessary experience in maintenancewhich can only be achieved through an adequate amount of seafaring experience with other qualified marine engineers. Secondly, he is concerned that an oral safety exam will no longer be mandatory. Fundamentally, theoretical knowledge and the ability to sit written examinations does not translate to operational knowledge. He notes that a three-hour long written exam is very stressful for a candidate, but such stress reflects how a candidate may react in an emergency situation on board a vessel, should one occur. This is absolutely crucial to ensure the safety of the candidate, their shipmates and the machinery for which a candidate is responsible. Today's measures will make AMSA the national regulator. I trust that for all issues that will fall purview AMSA will take at face value all concerns from industry, workers and unions. I am confident that it will retain its commitment to constructive relations with stakeholders in government, industry and the community. I and my coalition colleagues will always consider the merits of a bill on a case-bycase basis to ensure that the general welfare of Australia and its citizens is maximised. These bills today are a step to increase efficiency in the regulation of navigation and maritime safety national law by streamlining and modernising the existing law. It is expected that these reforms should provide productivity benefits of $30 billion over the next 20 years. It is of course not for that reason alone that I support these bills, but certainly I am confident that all stakeholders in this area-seafarers, industry, the environment and the community-will benefit in many ways. However, I point to the lack of consistency and I would suggest that that is the confused way this government has introduced other purported reforms into this House, in particular from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Fortunately, the Transport Workers Union has not managed to destroy the substantial intent of these bills. On 14 March 2012, I spoke on and opposed the introduction of the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 consequential amendments bill. I opposed those bills because, as I said at the time, they would create a new layer of bureaucracy and add to jurisdictional creep between state and federal legislation, decreasing flexibility in the industry and increasing red tape. Those bills did not streamline or modernise regulation; they merely added another layer with which companies and employees had to comply. Further, on 28 May 2012, I spoke on under its and opposed the Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill 2012 and associated bills. I said that they were yet another example of this Labor government using the long arm of governmental bureaucracy to intervene in and overregulate an industry to the detriment of the Australian economy. So you can imagine my surprise that the Australian Labor Party has actually introduced bills that attempt to genuinely reform the industry, bills that will implement measures for the future health of our economy. The point is this: those on the opposite side of the House try to claim that we on this side oppose bills unnecessarily or that we are more interested in opposing for political gain. This is patently not true. The coalition will always consider the details of every bill. We always assess whether the seen and unseen consequences of a bill are beneficial to our country. And we have followed this process today. These bills should decrease the level of bureaucracy, will ensure a more effective and appropriate national law and enforcement process, and will not only be beneficial economically but further act to protect our community and environment. For these reasons, I support the passage of these bills.",94
162,Mr ALBANESE,IMPORTANCE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:48): I thank members for and its their comments and their contributions to the debate on the Navigation Bill 2012 and the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Bill 2012. These bills represent the most significant overhaul of the regulation and management of Australia's maritime industry since 1912. Between them these bills provide the primary legislative means for the Australian government to regulate international ship and seafarer safety, ensure shipping is conducted in a manner which protects our marine environment, give effect to Australia's obligations under various International Maritime Organisation conventions and create a national safety system for domestic commercial vessels by establishing the Australian Maritime Safety Authority as the single national maritime regulator. Shipping is a crucial part of the Australian transport system. Each year almost 4,000 ships transport goods to and from Australia, carrying 99 per cent by volume of Australia's imports and exports. This constitutes the world's fourth largest shipping task. The increase in demand for Australia's exports and new resource developments means that Australia's sea freight task is likely to double by 2025. The safety and efficiency of the shipping industry is, therefore, critical to Australia's economic prosperity. For these reasons it is important that the 100-year-old Navigation Act be replaced with a contemporary legislative framework for maritime regulation. It is also important that vessels operating in Australian waters all operate under one system with one set of rules. It is a credit to all states and territories the national law bill is the result of a cooperative national reform effort. All jurisdictions have actively participated in developing this bill. The national law bill replaces eight existing federal, state and territory regulators with one national marine safety regulator and a single national law, providing clarity and consistency for Australia's seafarers and commercial vessel owners, together with the single national regulators in rail safety and heavy vehicles. This will lead to a benefit to the national economy of $30 billion over 20 years. This is real productivity reform. This is real microeconomic reform, moving from 23 regulators down to three, achieved by this government, funded by this government, driven by this government, in cooperation with the state and territory governments. This is indeed a proud day, the day when this legislation is adopted. I congratulate the fact that the opposition are also supporting legislation, meaning that this has bipartisanship, which just emphasises how significant this legislation is. The practical impact of these bills is that the conduct, obligations and safety standards required of vessels in Australian waters will be clear, consistent and consistently applied. This means that companies or people who operate national businesses, have vessels in multiple states or rely on domestic commercial vessels for their livelihoods will not have to grapple with different safety, regulatory or administrative requirements. Yesterday, the Senate passed the most significant reform of Australia's shipping industry since the 1920s. That reform should be viewed in combination with these bills to mean that this week this parliament is dealing with the most significant reform of the maritime sector since Federation. This, together with the shipping bills, will ensure that that our country has a strong and prosperous maritime future. A competitive, growing and safe Australian shipping industry is good for our economy, our environment and our national security. I want to pay tribute to all those who have been involved in this process: the state and territory governments, the unions and maritime industry sectors, and AMSA-the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. I wish particularly to single out the work that has been done by my department through the Deputy Secretary, Andrew Wilson, and Karen Gosling. Karen will be leaving the department shortly for a much quieter life in retirement. I wish Karen well. This is a legacy that she has left just prior to her departure. I thank Pauline Sullivan also. I also want to pay tribute to two people in my office-one former and one current. Craig Carmody has driven this reform through my office under circumstances which have been difficult, getting on top of the detail of such a complex series of legislation and liaising on a day-today basis with the sector. I often think that as ministers and members of parliament we get the credit but it is the staff who are doing the hard yards. Mr Carmody's predecessor, Malcolm Larsen is now with AMSA. I think he can get a great deal of credit for being there as this enormous reform project began. This is a proud day and I commend these bills to the House. I congratulate all those who have been involved in this reform. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",99

Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",101
167,Mr ROBB,IMPORTANCE," I rise to speak on Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2012. This bill seeks to make technical amendments to 21 acts across six portfolios. It forms part of an ongoing program of improving the financial framework as issues arise. The coalition supports the program in principle. This is the 10th financial framework amendment bill since 2004. It seeks to correct anomalies, to add clarity and to ensure consistency across government acts. It aims to ensure legislation is up to date and properly reflects actual and efficient financial practices. The program also seeks to ensure financial arrangements are consistent with constitutional requirements. It is tedious work, but it is important work. Making the financial framework more efficient is, of course, a good thing. There are 140 items of amendment in this bill alone to achieve both clarity and efficiency across a raft of legislation. It would be a good thing if this level of rigour was also extended to the government's deregulation agenda. The government promised a one-in one-out approach to new regulation. Of course, instead, we have seen 18,089 new pieces of regulation introduced and just 86 items repealed-just a little margin of error of about 18,000 pieces of legislation that have not been removed! This particular bill is broad in its reach. The amendments are technical but vigilance is required. We have to be mindful of unintended consequences or inequitable outcomes. We do not want to see changes that make people worse off. The coalition has closely examined amendments associated with various acts under the agriculture portfolio, as well as those related to the validation of certain benefits under the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973 which were made as a result of Commonwealth administrative breaches. There are also amendments proposed across various superannuation related acts. These would put in place provisions for the Commonwealth to recover inadvertent overpayments, in line with provisions under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Other amendments in the superannuation area would allow payments made between a recipient's death and the time when the Commonwealth is notified to be recoverable from the deceased's estate. Of course, the government has some form when it comes to sending out cheques to the deceased. Previous Treasury figures showed that, of $12 billion worth of $900 cheques that went out as stimulus payments, $40 million worth were sent out to 16,000 dead people and 27,000 expatriates. So these provisions of this bill are well placed. There are also provisions under the Taxation Administration Act 1953 which would allow the Commissioner of Taxation or their delegate to make discretionary recoverable advance payments. This relates to benefits that may be in dispute but for which entitlement is likely to be established or re-established. This would only be applied if the Commonwealth was satisfied that the eventual costs associated with halting payments would be greater than if the advances were made. This is designed to require considerations of 'efficient, effective and economical factors' in making payments consistent with the FMA Act. In the agriculture portfolio there are amendments which clarify the arrangements around Commonwealth support payments to industry bodies. These payments are subject to a limit of 0.5 per cent of an industry's annual gross value of production. They are based on data prepared by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences. In practice, the most up-to-date ABARES data may not be available until after payments are required. As a result, payments made could inadvertently exceed the 0.5 per cent limit. The amendments would allow for determinations to be made by 31 October. If the amount paid ultimately exceeds 0.5 per cent, the recipient body will pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the excess. If an amount has not been determined by 31 October, the payment will be based on the industry's gross value of production from the previous year. It has been highlighted that payments made during the year which exceed 0.5 per cent risk breaching section 83 of the Constitution. The shadow minister for agriculture has been consulting with relevant groups, and no concerns have emerged. In the agriculture portfolio there are also amendments which put in place more efficient ways of recovering administrative costs associated with making payments to agencies. Under the National Residue Survey Administration Act 1992 there are amendments which align payment approval requirements with actual practice. The NRS is entrusted with monitoring for harmful residues in Australian agricultural products and is funded through industry levies. In relation to amendments in the DFRDB and other areas of superannuation it is important that the government commits to fully communicating any changes to scheme members-for example, the changes associated with provisions to recover overpayments for deceased estates. The amendments under schedule 2 of the bill in relation to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act, importantly, have provisions in place to offset debts owed by members as a consequence of previous administrative breaches. The changes in this bill are reasonable. There has been a genuine effort to improve the efficiency of the financial framework. It is a shame that the rather forensic and technical nature of the amendments in this bill does not reflect the broader approach to financing of this government. For example, this bill gets into the weeds of the financial framework and does some effective work. It is an ongoing program to dot the i's and cross the t's. Yet, on the other hand, you have a government that refuses to subject the $50 billion NBN project-the biggest infrastructure project in the nation's history-to cost-benefit analysis. So here we are, spending important, appropriate, time in this House, and we have spent not one minute on looking at the outcome of a cost benefit analysis of a $50 billion project. It beggars belief. And the government is prepared to risk $10 billion of borrowed taxpayer dollars on speculative clean energy projects. These are the sorts of things which confuse the community. They are a reason for the crisis of confidence in the community: they see no consistency. They see a government that is prepared to back its bureaucracy in doing forensic and detailed work at this micro level, and yet where the big bucks are spent we see a very amateur approach being taken. If only the government took this approach to its broader financial activities, we would not be lumbered with $144 billion of net debt and we would be far more resilient to any further shockwaves that might come from Europe or elsewhere. We support the bill.",102
168,Mr NEUMANN,IMPORTANCE," That was a typical whinging, moaning and carping response from the member for Goldstein on economic management, typical of the negativity of those opposite. Even on important legislation like the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2012, they cannot even bring themselves to come into this chamber with any humility or grace, or to realise that what we are doing here is part of a process that has since 2004 seen 10 legislative changes. In fact, what has been found by the Auditor General in relation to this issue has been going on for decades. We are a government of laws, and one of the esoteric pieces of legislation can be found in the Constitution, which says, in section 83: No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law. In other words, government cannot actually spend money unless there is a legislative framework or basis for expenditure of that money. Some years ago I had the benefit, as a member of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, of going to Wellington in New Zealand for an Australasian convention in relation to those sorts of committees across the states and territories of Australia and across the South Pacific. There were delegates from a number of different countries, including from as far away as Europe. One thing that is for sure is that we are very blessed in this country to have an office of independence, rigour, objectivity and impartiality called the Australian National Audit Governments of both persuasions find themselves foul of that office. We note the 1,200-page ANAO report into regional rorts-the outlandish, inflated rip-offs and rorts of those opposite in regional funding, particularly in the later days of the Howard government up to November 2007. We on this side of politics have found ourselves at odds with and upset by the Australian National Audit Office. In a sense, that is a good thing, because when the ANAO raises concerns about circumstances that might cause governments to risk breaching section 83 of the Constitution it is important that we actually listen. In relation to this matter, the ANAO looked at the context in which government agencies' financial statements for 2010-11 may have technically been in breach of section 83 of the Constitution. There were risks involved, but the administrative processes put in place which govern agencies do not actually have a sound legislatively-backed basis for them. Payments could be made based on estimates, assumptions and the like, whereas the legislative provision for that expenditure may not actually be there. The ANAO recommended we look at this and work with agencies, and throughout the framing of the legislation before the House today the Australian National Audit Office and the Auditor-General have been involved in consultation with various statutory agencies. The management of the financial framework of the Commonwealth can be found in the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. Those acts, and others, provide what I will call the governing arrangements for specific agencies of the Commonwealth. It is important that we comply with the law there, and it is important that we comply Office. with the Constitution. There are a whole range of pieces of legislation that are being amended by schedule 1 of this bill. They are varied and include the Dairy Produce Act 1986, the Taxation Administration Act 1953, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973. And the list goes on. It is important that we make these amendments across a whole range of legislation. If enacted, this particular bill will make sure that the framework necessary to address the errors that have been made, the overpayments that could have been undertaken, are backed by legislation and that those payments by Commonwealth agencies are regularised to make sure that they are supported by specific appropriations including specific accounts and are consistent with section 83 of the Constitution and other legislation. Lest anyone think, if they were listening to the member for Goldstein on this matter, that somehow the government was profligate in relation to these issues and there was great waste and mismanagement, I just want to refer briefly before I conclude to the Taxation Administration Act that I referred to. This bill impacts on the Taxation Administration Act through, amongst other things, recoverable payments, the idea of a recoverable advance under recoverable payments and-in other legislationrecoverable death payments. The Australian Taxation Office makes payments in excess of $14 million every year under our taxation laws. It is an enormous amount, and, on the evidence I have received, there could be some issues with 0.01 per cent of all cash payments. This means that fewer than 1,000 payments are at risk of not being supported by an appropriation, and this is a very, very small percentage. But, of course, that is what the Auditor-General is for-to make sure that those payments are consistent with the tax laws and that, if there is an error, they are House. supported by standing appropriations. It is important that the mechanisms put in place to make sure that money is recovered are supported. I am pleased that government agencies have been involved in the process and that they have been consulted and that the Auditor-General has taken steps, as I know he does also when he makes reports on other issues with government programs, to see that he is involved in the process in order to make sure that the best governance, practice and administration are put in place. This is a good bill, even though it might be a bit vague and a bit complicated and not that many people might have gone through it. I thank the officials who have taken the time to do it, because that is in the best interests of the public. I support the legislation.",104
169,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (18:16): I thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2012. In particular I acknowledge the contribution of the member for Blair, who, apart from being a very effective local member, is one of the hardest working legislators in this place. This is the 10th financial framework legislation amendment bill since 2004. It forms part of an ongoing program to address financial framework issues as they are identified, and it assists in ensuring that specific provisions in existing legislation remain clear and up to date. This bill has been put together in collaboration with the relevant ministers and their departments. This bill, if enacted, will clarify specific provisions in 21 acts, across six portfolios, to establish a better way to deal with overpayments which are administrative or technical in nature.

Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",106
172,Mr HOCKEY,BUSINESS," I rise to speak on the government's Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012. Transfer pricing in general terms occurs when two parties related or unrelated supply goods or services to each other and transfer profits from one to the other. The parties to the transaction may be domestic entities, or the transaction may occur between resident and non-resident entities. The transaction can also be between related parties or non-related parties. Of course, for taxation purposes, the main issue occurs when the transaction is between related parties and one of those parties is a nonresident. For Australian taxation purposes, where only one party is a nonresident, Australian tax can be minimised through applying deductions to the Australian entity through the purchase of goods by the resident entity at an inflated price or through allocating income from the Australian resident through the sale of goods from the resident entity to the non-resident entities at a discounted price. Specifically, division 13 of part 3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act is designed to ensure that transactions between Australian residents and nonresidents are done at arm's length for taxation purposes. This counters such activities as the shifting of deductions to the Australian resident from the nonresident or income shifting from the Australian resident to the nonresident. This is done so that appropriate taxation can be hour this day. captured within Australia. Not only is division 13 of the Income Tax Assessment Act relevant but so too are our NA international tax treaties, which are incorporated into our domestic law through the International Tax Agreements Act 1953. These treaties are commonly referred to as double taxation agreements. Where there is conflict between division 13 and a treaty, the treaty takes priority. Of particular importance within these treaties are the provisions relating to associated enterprises. These are usually contained within article 9 and deal with profit-shifting. As I mentioned earlier, they mandate an arm's-length principle for international dealings between associated enterprises. The Australian Taxation Commissioner applies the provisions within division 13 of the 1936 tax act along with the associated enterprises article within the international tax treaty when making transfer-pricing adjustments. The outcome of these adjustments should be consistent. Division 13 and associated enterprises articles within tax treaties are both based on the arms-length principle. However, consideration must be given as to the precise wording of the treaty. If the operation of division 13 and the relevant section of the tax treaty are inconsistent, international tax treaty provisions will apply unless the treaty itself gives precedence to domestic law. In 2011 the full Federal Court cast doubt on this premise for transfer-pricing adjustments in the Commissioner of Taxation v SNF (Australia) Pty Ltd. Transfer-pricing rules exist to ensure that appropriate taxation is collected on the contribution of profits from Australian operations and also to ensure that profits are not shifted between related parties and across borders. For the benefit of context I will briefly go over the key points of this case. The taxpayer was in that case a wholly owned French subsidiary who was a distributor of chemicals acquired from a nonresident related party and who sold these goods in Australia. SNF used what is known as the comparable uncontrolled pricesCUP-basis for its transfer-pricing methodology. SNF provided evidence of sale transactions from comparable entities to the Commissioner of Taxation which showed that SNF paid less for its acquired stock than prices paid by comparable independent entities. SNF also used OECD guidelines in explaining its comparability factors. The commissioner disagreed with SNF's transferpricing methodology and calculation, arguing that Australian transfer-pricing rules meant that SNF could only compare an armslength transaction with transactions of other taxpayers who had the same characteristics as SNF, apart from its association with offshore related parties. Some examples of similar characteristics that the commissioner argued would provide a basis for comparison include the size of SNF within its market, the market strategy that SNF was employing, and SNF's loss position. The full Federal Court rejected the commissioner's approach and upheld SNF's position. The court also the highlighted that the approach taken by the commissioner imposed unreasonably high benchmarks for comparison when using the transfer-pricing methodology. This was, in part, acknowledged by the commissioner in the commissioner's decision impact statement on this particular case. The commissioner's impact statement notes that the court found that the OECD's transfer-pricing guidelines were not a legitimate aid to the construction of either division 13 or the associated enterprises articles of Australia's double tax treaties as domestically enacted. This case was argued only on the basis of division 13. The government now believes division 13 does not adequately reflect the contributions or profits from Australian operations to multinational groups. As such, the government claims there will be instances where treaty transfer-pricing rules may produce an unintended taxation outcome relative to the application of division 13. In November last year the government announced a review of division 13 of the 1936 tax act and announced that it would legislate to clarify the transfer-pricing rules and tax treaties are valid transfer-pricing adjustments independent of the ITAA 1936. The bill currently before the House deals with these changes to legislation. The government's bill seeks to ensure that transfer-pricing articles contained in Australia's tax treaties are able to be applied and provide assessment authority independent of division 13. They are seeking to do this by creating express provisions within the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The government's bill also seeks to ensure that transfer-pricing rules are interpreted as consistently as possible with the relevant OECD guidelines. Finally, this bill seeks to clarify the interaction between transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules, which have previously only been dealt with through administrative arrangements. Of great significance to us on this side of the House is that the government is again, through this bill, raising the spectre of sovereign risk. This bill seeks to retrospectively amend transfer-pricing legislation following the outcome of the full Federal Court decision in the SNF (Australia) case. This change is proposed to apply retrospectively to 1 July 2004. The explanatory memorandum suggests a basis for starting on 1 July 2004 on this confusing argument: The 2004 income year commenced immediately after the parliament's most recent amendment to the tax laws in 2003, which again evidenced the parliament's understanding that tax treaties could be used as a separate basis for making transfer-pricing arrangements. In his second reading speech to the House, the minister stated: A decision to change the law from a date before announcement is not taken lightly. It is generally only done, as in this case, where there significant risk to revenue that is inconsistent with the parliament's intention. This is curious rationalisation from a government that have only served to heighten sovereign risk perceptions. They have cast doubt on investor confidence on the Australian economy, implemented a raft of decisions in taxation law with retrospective effect since coming into office only 4Â½ years ago. As recently as last year the government legislated a retrospective change dating back to 1990. They sought to clarify the taxing point and the way it is determined for the purposes of the petroleum resource rent tax. This was to pre-empt the outcome of a taxpayer appeal to the full Federal Court. This government has a bad habit of bringing retrospective legislation to the House. This bad habit is damaging Australia's sovereign risk profile and damaging international investor confidence. The coalition has serious concerns regarding the government's justification for the retrospective application of this bill. The explanatory memorandum to this bill fails to quantify the impact on government revenue on the basis that this bill is a 'revenue protection measure'. The government has not provided any detail on the size of the retrospective tax impost. The government is asking for this parliament to pass legislation that will have a retrospective commencement date going back eight years. For the government to do so, I suggest, requires the government to make a compelling case for the need for the amendment. Indeed the unlimited power to make amendments provides another reason why it is incumbent on the government to make public any evidence it has that makes it so important for this House to pass a bill containing such a significant retrospective measure. We are not convinced. During recent is Senate estimates, responding to a question from the coalition about cases in dispute and the amount of revenue at stake that was being addressed by this egregiously retrospective bill, the Commissioner of Taxation said: They involve substantial sums, but not greatly having substantial in the context of the broader picture. What the hell does that mean? Again I call on the government: can you justify publicly why you need to go back to 2004 to fix an issue that is 'not greatly substantial in the context of the broader picture' as the Commissioner for Taxation says? We will pursue this matter vigorously through the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill. In the meantime the coalition will not accept the government's case. It has not been a strong case and certainly publicly it has not been made satisfactorily to justify such significant legislation as this, which is retrospective. The government's justification for such change within the explanatory memorandum to this bill was that: Australia incorporates its tax treaties into municipal law through the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 (ITAA 1953). The Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner) has long held and publicly expressed a view that the treaty transfer pricing rules, as enacted, provide an alternate basis to Division 13 for transfer pricing adjustments. Many stakeholders and professional groups do not agree with this statement in the explanatory memorandum. The Law Council and the Corporate Tax Association, among others, take issue with this statement. I wonder if the ministers know the true impact of the legislation that they are trying to steer through this place. This creates real sovereign risk-and the Commissioner of Taxation is of no help whatsoever in this process. The Taxation Committee of the Business Law Section of the Law Council of Australia stated in its submission on the exposure draft of this bill that 'the justification for retrospective operation of the amendment from 1 July 2004 was on a spurious basis'. They said: The Committee rejects the suggestion that there has been any clear expression of Parliamentary intention that the associated enterprises articles Australia's double taxation agreements (DTAs) were to operate as an independent taxing power. Nor has Parliament previously indicated an intention to fundamentally alter the principles to be applied in interpreting the provisions of the DTAs conferring the taxing power. They went on to say: The Committee is concerned that paragraph 1.10 of the Draft EM seeks to justify the retrospective operation of the amendment from 1 July 2004 on a spurious basis. The purported basis for electing this particular date is that Parliament spoke to this issue in 2003, and that the current amendment is a â€˜clarification' of prior intention. The Draft EM cites the International Tax Agreements Amendment Act 2003 (Cth) and its explanatory materials as Parliament's most recent demonstration of its intention that DTAs provide alternative and independent transfer pricing liability provisions to those contained in Division 13 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA 1936). The Committee strongly disagrees that the 2003 amendment or its explanatory materials gave any signal-explicitly or implicitly-that the transfer pricing rules would operate as suggested. Furthermore, no further attempt at â€˜clarification' has been made by Parliament in the eight years since this time despite the issue being questioned by the courts on a number of occasions. That is a hugely important point. The parliament never sought to repair, change or clarify this piece of disputed bill in all that time, even though the matter had gone to the courts on a number of occasions. They went on to say: For these reasons it is plainly inappropriate to select this date and, if the provisions remain retrospective, the Draft EM (particularly paragraphs 1.8 to 1.10) should be modified to make it clear to Parliament that this is the case. This evidence seems to contradict the government's justification for the retrospective application of the bill: that it was the parliament's understanding that tax treaties could be used as a separate basis for of making transfer pricing adjustments. The coalition is opposed to retrospective tax changes as a matter of principle. People are entitled to proceed with the law as it stands. There have been exceptions. But under this situation the law has been clear since 2003, operating in an unfettered fashion even though invited by the courts. If it was done wrongly the previous coalition government is as guilty as the current government. I am not pretending otherwise. But it is going to create enhanced sovereign risk when sovereign risk is the most disputed and contentious issue in global financial markets at the moment. The coalition understands that it can change the substance of bargains struck between taxpayers who have made every effort to comply with the prevailing law as at the time the agreement was entered into. Retrospectivity can expose taxpayers to penalties in circumstances where taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps at the earlier time to mitigate the potential for penalties to be imposed. People believed they were complying with the law. It may change a taxpayer's tax profile, which in turn can materially impact the financial viability of investment decisions and the pricing of those decisions. Most importantly, the retrospective application of the change will heighten Australia's level of perceived sovereign risk. In submissions in the consultation period for these proposed changes, various peak taxation and accounting bodies all expressed concern over the retrospective application of this proposed legislation. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia in its submission to Treasury stated: 'The retrospective amendment to the law being proposed in the exposure draft legislation cannot be justified on either a policy or revenue integrity basis.' The Tax Institute's submission states that it 'has grave concerns as to the appropriateness of retrospective legislation to effect this announced change.' CPA Australia stated: We reiterate our earlier view that no clear business case has been advanced to justify the retrospective application â€¦ This is an inequitable outcome for taxpayers who may be potentially subject to audit for up to 7 years on matters which they may reasonably regard as having been finalised. The enactment these retrospective changes may also damage the international reputation of Australia as a jurisdiction in which key foreign investors can invest and trade with certainty and confidence. And these guys opposite wonder why there is a lack of business confidence in Australia and why there is a lack of consumer confidence in Australia! Here it is, before the House-retrospective legislation. People who believed, in good faith, that they were complying with the law as it stood now find that they are going to have back audits for seven years and back penalties, potentially, for seven years, and whatever transactions they entered into in good faith must now be unwound with potential back losses to the organisation. Those opposite cannot understand why there is a negative sentiment out there in the commercial world, a negative sentiment that involved some five different versions of a mining tax and four different positions on a carbon tax-let alone what they are doing on the interest withholding tax. And there are a range of other measures from employee share buyback schemes-which they promised they would not touch and they completely muddled-right through to an overinvestment in an NBN with no business case. How is it that those opposite cannot understand how confused the Australian business community would be about their incompetence? Now before this House we have retrospective tax legislation going back seven years, and we have a Commissioner of Taxation who, when asked about what the revenue implications are, just dismissed them as insubstantial. If they are not that substantial, why are we putting our reputation on the line for increased sovereign risk for international investors? Why would you do that? Since 1788 we have needed to of import money into this country. The risk that is being posed by retrospective tax legislation is an even greater reason that people should be concerned about investing in Australia. This mob opposite keep referring to a 'pipeline of investment'. Well I can tell you that a pipeline of investment can soon dry up in the wake of a government that creates uncertainty. It was Ivan Glasenberg who wrote the speech he made in London where he said that he could get greater sovereign certainty out of the Congo than he can get out of Australia-and he is one of the largest investors in Australia. The coalition did not write that speech. The coalition did not write the speech of Jac Nasser, the Chairman of BHP, or that of Marius Kloppers, the Chief Executive of BHP, when they flagged their intention to hold back on investment in Australia, citing the cost of doing business Australia as one of the great challenges. We did not write the press releases and press statements for Gerry Harvey, the head of Harvey Norman, or John Singleton or John Symond or the conga line of businesspeople out there who have been putting their reputations on the line to come out and warn about sovereign risk in Australia and the dangers of an incompetent government. We did not write those words; they are writing those words. If you want evidence of the very actions that cause these people to warn of the risks of doing business in Australia, look at what is before the parliament now-retrospective legislation, going back seven years. A fundamental question is: how can taxpayers be expected to have complied with laws they did not know existed at the time but which they were supposedly expected to comply with? They were expected to comply with laws that did not exist. How is that How is that stable? How is that inviting a confident and reliable stream of investment? This bill is the very evidence of why business and investors are so nervous about dealing with this government. The changes contained within this bill will confirm that the transfer pricing rules contained in Australia's tax treaties provide a power, through express incorporation into Australia's domestic law, to make transfer pricing adjustments independently of division 13. The coalition further questions whether the government has consulted with any tax treaty partner countries. If so-and no-one has given us an answer-did those countries raise any concerns as to the perceived impacts that this will have on the negotiated tax agreement as well as any flow-on consequences to trade and investment? In the context of investment in with the United States, in its submission on this bill, the American Chamber of Commerce said: It is clear, therefore, that the US interprets the treaty as limiting its right to increase US taxation on an Australian-owned entity. It is our understanding that the US would expect Australia to interpret the Double Tax Agreement similarly. Based upon this, it is ill-founded for the Assistant Treasurer to allege that the amendments proposed are consistent with Australia's Double Tax Treaties, without including an exception for the United States. Another anomaly arising from this bill is that it applies to countries that Australia has a tax treaty with, ignoring entities who are tax transacting with parties in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. So this applies to the guys we have treaties with, but for anyone operating out of the Cayman Islands it is, 'You're fair game-go for it, guys.' Such taxpayers will be subject to transfer pricing under division 13 only, whereas taxpayers fair? conducting business with an associated enterprise-say, in Japan, a treaty countrywill be subject to potential adjustments under this bill and its wider powers. Does the government seriously believe this is good policy? The member for Chifley is about to stand up. Does he seriously believe this is good government where, if you operate out of a tax treaty country that in good faith negotiated a tax treaty with Australia, you are subjected to the pain associated with this but, if you are operating out of a tax haven, you do not have that same application and you are subject only to division 13? It is an unusual policy outcome, isn't it? We call on the government to explain this anomaly. Then there is the issue raised by PricewaterhouseCoopers that would see taxpayers being tied up in complex discussions under the mutual agreements procedure in most treaties, which would be aimed at mitigating potential double taxation outcomes from the bill. As PwC said: We acknowledge that the risk of double taxation is present under the existing provisions and the ATO may contend that the MAP process has traditionally worked effectively â€¦ However, in our experience, the process can take years and there is no compulsion under Australia's treaties for the competent authorities to reach agreement. And so on. So the coalition will actively pursue the matters that I have raised in respect of this bill today through the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill. In the meantime, the coalition believes the government has failed to make a strong enough public justification for retrospectivity in this bill. Therefore, I am foreshadowing that the coalition will seek to move an amendment to give only prospective effect to this bill. If our amendment is unsuccessful, the coalition will not support the passage of this retrospective legislation. Enough is enough. You cannot continue trashing Australia's safe haven sovereign risk reputation. Enough is enough.",106
173,Mr HUSIC,BILLS," There were a number of things in that contribution, but it basically boiled down to this: in the course of over 20 minutes, the greatest weight was placed on the issue of retrospectivity, and the other issue was-you would almost believe that this has been an alien concept-tackling business profit shifting or transfer pricing. The reality is that it is something that, in 1982, then Treasurer and later Prime Minister John Howard was trying to deal with. Governments have been dealing with the concept itself. On the international level, guidelines established by the OECD to deal with this issue have been present for many years. On top of that, there is the issue of retrospectivity. If those opposite were on this side of the House and there were a threat or an issue potentially affecting taxation revenue, they would be here basically lecturing us and saying that protecting that government revenue is the most important thing and that every effort should be made to deal with it. What we have had is basically a railing against retrospectivity but not necessarily against the concept per se, because transfer pricing has been dealt with in one way, shape or form for decades. I want to remark on something else. The shadow Treasurer referred to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia. In fact, transfer pricing has attracted the attention of the Obama administration in the US as well, as far back as 2009. In particular, in my contribution on this issue I want to touch on a sector that I have a particular interest in, the tech sector, looking at transfer pricing amongst multinational technology companies. I refer to an article written by Julian Lee in the Sydney Morning Herald back in 2009, when the issue of the profits of, for example, companies such as Google and Yahoo was in the frame. For example, Google was billing out of Ireland; eBay was billing out of Switzerland; Yahoo's search marketing was billing out of Ireland, as was Facebook; and Microsoft was using an Irish subsidiary. The way in which they transfer price was attracting the attention of the US administration. In fact, US President Barack Obama was calling back in May of 2009 for an end to transfer pricing and had set a target as to when that would be dealt with. That was the US administration. The American Chamber of Commerce in Australia was quoted here today, but the US administration is taking this issue seriously. The Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012 is an important bill. Many would not appreciate that from reading the title of the bill, deals with an emerging reality potentially affecting revenues raised by governments here and the world over. It is not a new concept, as I have said, but acknowledging it and dealing with it becomes more important, particularly as the reach of the internet spreads, opening up business opportunity and acknowledging what almost seems to be the dissolution of borders as businesses are able to reach and operate across all corners of the globe. As the Assistant Treasurer indicated in his second reading speech, transfer pricing rules are critical to the integrity of the taxation system. This bill will help ensure that the Australian operations of a multinational group pay their fair share of taxation, because trade within multinational groups is a big deal. In fact, in 2009 cross-border trade within multinational groups was valued as $270 billion. To put that into perspective, that is about half of Australia's total trade flows. Our transfer pricing rules govern the prices at which related entities-companies within large multinational groups, for example, in different countries-buy and sell the goods and services to each other. These rules aim to clamp down on profit shifting where, for example, artificially excessive fees are levied for services rendered between entities, ultimately aiding in the transfer of money from one company to another within a group but with the ambition to reduce tax liability within Australia. Last November, as has already been referenced, the government launched a review of our transfer pricing rules, indicating that we would move to end the uncertainty around whether or not transfer pricing rules contained in our tax treaties could apply independently of unilateral rules in division 13 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. That is what this bill in part deals with. As the Assistant Treasurer told the House, the OECD work but it that covers this area reflects the best international thinking on transfer pricing and shaped pricing regimes across the world. Guidelines used across regimes and observed by multinational enterprises themselves also ensure there is a clear legal pathway to the use of the OECD guidance. While the issue of transfer pricing has been around for a while it has become more complex, particularly when you consider how it operates in the case of tech companies. When you step back and look at the overall issue, you will see the online economy itself is 'the biggest regulatory challenge in a generation'. That was not my observation but the words of ACCC Chairman Rod Sims, made following the decision of the ACCC to investigate arrangements by local retailers to deter overseas counterparts or wholesalers selling the same goods online at cheaper prices. While I can certainly appreciate the motivation of local retailers engaging in this, the corrosive nature of this practice is designed to weaken competition and work against consumer interests. It also betrays a double standard insofar as retailers are preventing the consumer from doing what they do themselves-that is, search for a preferred supplier at a cost commercially attractive to the retailer. If local consumers feel they are being disadvantaged or being denied an advantage accessed by companies then that is going to draw ire and understandably so. It is this sentiment which propelled a case for an investigation into price discrimination as it affects the IT sector. I wholeheartedly welcome Minister Conroy's decision to establish the pricing discrimination inquiry to be held by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure Communications. I mention the committee's work because of its relevance to the legislation currently being considered by the House. In particular, the inquiry will look pricing differentials as they exist and will also look at the pricing frameworks employed by major tech companies. I imagine through the inquiry it will be determined what impact transfer pricing has on the way these companies do business here in Australia. It is obvious that transfer pricing will be easier to identify in the pricing of physical product-in this case, hardware. But, with the transformative impact of technology, physical product morphs into something that is digital-in this case, software. Regulators and governments know that this intangible presents a massive challenge to global taxation regimes. I was surprised when I witnessed a few weeks ago the emergence of an unlikely taxation advocate who argued that tech companies should be paying their way more. I am talking of course about the member for Wentworth-and I note his presence here today-who, in late May, demonstrated that not only is technology accelerating business processes but it is also helping speed up the pace of backflips. On Monday, 21 May he argued in the Financial Review that tech companies should be paying more tax. By Wednesday he was arguing that he was not arguing that. He said: I am not proposing any specific change to the existing tax laws or flagging a shift in coalition policy. By the time we advised that this bill on transfer pricing would be around to help, in part, buttress taxation revenues from the impact of pricing intangibles he had sniffed that that was not good enough, without spelling out what he would actually do, which I am surprised about because he has, and in the past, been able to devise a range of alternative taxation measures. It got me thinking: what made the member for Wentworth rip open his shirt to reveal his at inner taxation avenger? It is worth bearing in mind that his comments were in response to the claim that Google had paid $74,176 in tax on search engine and directory revenue, equating to around $1 billion. Google said it had paid $781,000 and their accounts, ending 31 December, suggested they had made a $3.9 million loss on revenue of $201 million. Again, on 21 May the member for Wentworth remarked: Over time, the erosion of the tax base will become material. You've got X billion dollars of revenue . . . being earned by Google paying very little tax in Australia. So Google was placed right in the frame by the member for Wentworth. For a company to be singled out like that, to be put in the public space like that, attracting the ire of the member for Wentworth would have raised eyebrows. But it certainly did not with me because I recall some pretty sharp comments he directed towards Google back in September last year where he said: Let me tell you who the conspirators are. They are the vendors, who want to sell lots of kit for the NBN. They'll tell you privately they think it's bonkers, but they want to sell the kit. There are the over-the-top people like Google and Yahoo and media companies â€¦ He went on to say: Google has got a massive interest in building these networks and that's why of the NBN â€¦ If I was to build a 10-lane freeway all around my country and only allowed the trucking companies to use it. Then all the trucking operators would say to me, Malcolm, you are a visionary. What was their crime to make the member so animated? Google had the temerity to commission firms to establish the value of the internet to the Australian economy and community. They pointed out the bleeding obvious that investment in the NBN would ramp up the value of the net to the economy-outrageous. For the record and from my own perspective I have found Google's commissioned research, conducted by Deloitte Access Economics and Boston Consulting, to be valuable. They are doing the right thing advancing the interests of their sector-one that is vital to our future economic prospects. It is worth pointing out to decision-makers and the general public the relative worth of other sectors drawing attention to themselves, such as mining. By the way, while the member did not acknowledge the ICT sector's value, he was effusive about the mining sector. In May 2010, he said: I could recite a longer list of statistics on the importance of the industry, but suffice it to say the resources sector is of absolutely vital importance to our economic security. And any major changes to the way in which it is taxed need to be examined and considered with that in mind. So two years ago we needed to exercise due care when taxing a valuable sector of the economy but now that has gone out the window. After reading the spirited defence of the mining sector, I had the gall to suggest that maybe we could stand up for a sector that is doing a great deal for Australia and not undermine the work of the sector in rightly promoting its own benefit because we are seeing terrific investment by that sector they're a supporter in Australia. I had the pleasure last week of attending the opening of the HP Aurora data centre at Eastern Creek, a $200 million investment in the region and in our nation's ICT future, an investment that will facilitate the growth of cloud computing. That builds on investments by another firm, Macquarie Telecom, a local trailblazer which invested in its own data centre in Sydney and is a passionate advocate of cloud computing which is set within months to open another centre. These developments will help the construction and strengthening of our digital economy. It is the government's aim that by 2020 our country will be among the world's leading digital economies. Speaking favourably about the sector's value in Australia does not mean I am not interested in exploring ways of ensuring that the tech sector pays its fair share of tax and that is what this legislation is aiming to do. I would actually argue that it is in their own interests too. For example, I do not think it is right that you operate a firm within the sector, be concerned about, for instance, skills shortages, expect government to play a part in addressing these shortages and then argue against moves to ensure the sector is paying its fair share of taxation. It is fair to point out that you cannot champion the phenomenally important investment in renewing this nation's broadband infrastructure and then rail against moves to protect our revenue base that will, among other things, help fund this investment. Government action that will in part address issues adversely affecting business operations and provide a beneficial operating environment obviously need to be funded. General revenue is absolutely critical, which is why this legislation of itself is critical. As much as transfer pricing will deal in part with some of these issues that emerge as a result of the internet opening up trade across borders, the other thing that will obviously need to occur in time is for the OECD to take a greater role in necessarily advancing or reviewing and further examining this area. As I indicated earlier in this contribution, there is interest within the US to deal with the issue of transfer pricing but particularly the way in which multinational companies are operating such that they would be perceived to not necessarily be paying their fair share in taxation. As much as it has been around for many years, the area itself is exceptionally complex, but that does not necessarily mean it is something we can give up on. As the ACCC said, as much as this presents the biggest regulatory challenge of a generation, it is still something that will gain increasing interest as the years progress.",112
174,Mr TURNBULL,BILLS," As the House knows, the opposition opposes this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (CrossBorder Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012, on the basis that it is retrospective. I could not improve on nor add to the powerful arguments advanced by the shadow Treasurer on that score, although I endorse and adopt all of them. I want to turn to some matters that the member for Chifley touched on, including the question of transfer pricing in the digital age. Regrettably, this bill, whatever its merits, even having regard to its prospective merits, really does nothing about the critical problems faced in Australia and in many other countries as a consequence of globalisation of commerce and the way in which so many transactions nowadays are occurring in the cloud, the internet, in a way that, perfectly legitimately and without a hint of evasion or skulduggery or anything of that kind, is beyond the reach of the laws, including this law, for transfer-pricing arrangements that we have. A few years ago the OECD said in its report on transfer pricing-it is an apposite point: Not long ago, transfer pricing was a subject for tax administrators and one or two other specialists. But recently, politicians, economists and businesspeople, as well as NGOs, have been waking up to the importance of who pays tax on what in international business transactionswith more than 60 per cent of world trade taking place within multinational enterprises. The transfer-pricing regimes, globally and certainly within Australia, depend really on two possible circumstances. One is the multinational company having a subsidiary in Australia or having what is called a permanent establishment. The vice of transfer pricing that legislation has sought to address is the circumstance where the multinational, no doubt from a tax haven, is selling its products to its local subsidiary in Australia at a very high price so that there is very little profit made in Australia, perhaps just enough to pay the overheads here, and such profit is racked up in the tax haven. Of course, a similar arrangement can take place. You do not need to have a subsidiary corporation here; you could have a permanent establishment and, if that permanent establishment has under the tax treaties an effective connection with the transactions in Australia, similar principles can be brought to bear. The principle, of course, which is easy to state but very hard to define and assess is the arms-length principle. What is the arms-length price? There are plenty of simple examples one can imagine. If a subsidiary in Hong Kong is selling aluminium ingots to its associate in Australia at a price that is above the LME price, then obviously the ATO will say it is over the odds and look to apply the transferpricing rules. But none of this is really relevant to the transfer-pricing issue, or the issue that we are dealing with at the moment, which is not, strictly speaking, a transferpricing issue at all. The honourable member for Chifley mentioned Google and he suggested that I had been unfair to Google. Far be it from me to take on such a leviathan, but the fact remains that Google, a great multinational company and a very innovative one indeed which the government often quotes in its support for the NBN, pays virtually no tax in Australia. The Australian division of Google recently released accounts showing that in 2011 it paid $74,000 in tax. It is widely estimated to be generating somewhere between $1Â½ billion and $2 billion of revenue out of this market. And, if you look at its global accounts, it is a very, margin business. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of profit being accrued by Google on those sales in Australia, but there is no tax being paid in this country. There are some cynical souls, such as me, who just make the observation that it is all very well for Google, paying $74,000 of tax in Australia, to be encouraging the Australian taxpayer to spend $50 billion on an NBN, of which Google will be an enormous beneficiary, but it is not contributing anything to the tax base here to enable that investment to be made. Google would be more credible if it actually put its money where its mouth was. I am not suggesting that Google is breaking the law-far from it. But the fact is that what Google is able to do, and this applies to many other companies in the digital realm, is to sell advertising to Australians online from an entity-until very recently it was an entity located in Ireland which, I might say, was generating well over â‚¬11 billion of revenue out of Ireland, just in that entity alone; obviously, that plainly was not coming out of the Irish market. And it can transact directly with customers in Australia, from Ireland, over the web. It arranges its affairs so that its business in Australia, its permanent establishment in Australia, has no effective connection with that transaction and, therefore, there is no basis for the transfer-pricing rules to apply. Of course the same thing can be said about Amazon. You go onto the web, you order some books or whatever you want from Amazon or another online vendor, and again there is no local connection. What we are seeing is a very substantial diminution in and erosion of the Australian tax base. You can say, 'Taxes are bad; nobody should pay tax; we are all in favour of no taxes.' But, at the end of the day, somebody has to pay for the schools and the very highhospitals and the Army-the defence minister was here a moment ago-and the more that commerce is taken out of Australia and into the internet cloud, the less revenue is available in this country and the heavier the burden that has to be carried by those entities that cannot avoid paying tax in Australia. This is a very big challenge. I have raised this not in the sense of having an instant solution to it, because there is no instant solution. This is a problem that the United States faces. There are large multinational technology companies which have literally tens of billions of dollars of retained earnings stashed up in tax havens, or low-tax jurisdictions, around the world, which they do not want to repatriate to the United States because they would have to pay tax in the US, and they have had the chutzpah to go to the US Congress and say, 'If you give us a tax break we will bring the money back into the country.' So you can imagine how affronted the US legislators are. This is a very big issue. Senator Conroy, when I raised this, gave his usual flip, instant response and said that this legislation would deal with it. This legislation has got nothing to do with it. I wish it did. It does not. It is not pertinent. The transfer-pricing arrangements that we have, and other developed countries, other OECD countries, have, are really inadequate to deal with the globalisation of commerce. I just raise that as a very important matter for the House. There is one way, of course, that it can be addressed, to some extent, and that is through levying a VAT or, in Australia, a goods and services tax-a GST. There is no restriction on the jurisdiction whereby the Australian government could levy GST on these internet transactions if they result in a sale to an Australian customer, and the international online businesses have the perfect capacity to do that. In fact, if you go onto an online retailing site and order some goods and you nominate an address in Australia, you will see a price for the goods and a price for the freight and the total. If you then were to nominate an address in a state of the United States-take New Yorkyou would then have a price for the goods, a price for freight, and some New York taxes. So it is perfectly feasible for them to collect GST for Australia. This matter has been raised in the past by Australian retailers on the basis that the fact that these transactions are not paying GST exposes them to a competitive disadvantage. I suppose it does, though I think it is literally a rounding error in terms of the disadvantage that they face. But it is a very significant factor in terms of the erosion of our tax base. The point I want to make to the House tonight and to honourable members is that we have to take this issue seriously because there is a tendency to ignore these issues until it is too late, and to be a little bit like the frog in the kettle that does not realise he is in trouble until the water is boiling and he is dead. This issue is growing on us and we have to address the challenges of the erosion of the tax base. It is a huge issue within the United States, because they do not have a national goods and services tax; the various states and cities have different sales taxes and, of course, companies like Amazon are able to locate themselves in a way that effectively forumshops and can, in a very material way, pull retail activity, retail sales, out of one jurisdiction into another and deprive not only the local retailers of that business but the community of the tax revenues that they need to pay for all of their services. So, with respect to the member for Chifley: like him, I admire Google; nonetheless, I think that everybody should pay their tax. There is a real issue. This is notMr Husic interjecting",116
175,Mr TURNBULL,BILLS,"The honourable member mentions the miners. I am really glad he did that. I will tell you, in the few minutes left to me, about the counsel of despair. This is what the weak-minded and the gutless will do: put the taxation of international transactions into the too-hard basket and simply focus taxation on immovable property such as resources and real estate. Before too long you will have a Labor government wanting to have a national land tax so residential householders would have to pay tax. The honourable member opposite me here, the member for Oxley, shakes his head. He is very wise to shake his head. But I say to my honourable friend across the table that that is where you end up if you are not prepared to recognise that the nature of commerce is changing and that taxation and regulation has to change in line with it. Otherwise you end up with a situation where your tax base narrows to only those assets and activities that cannot move. They are real estate, resources and PAYE taxpayers. That is too narrow a tax base. This is a big challenge for this government. It has not addressed it. Instead of pretending that this law deals with the matter, they should come up with some responsible answers that deal with this very significant erosion of Australia's tax base.",118
176,Mr RIPOLL,BILLS," We are almost in fierce agreement across the chamber-almost. Certainly on a lot of matters there is a fair bit of agreement, such as wanting things like a fair taxation system; international companies and transfer pricing to interact in a proper way with the integrity of our tax system; a tax system that works effectively when people are paying tax; a wider taxation base; and ways to deal with the challenges that this and other countries face in terms of how international multinational organisations-such as Google and those that interact over the webactually pay a fair share of their tax in Australia. So I would say that on all those matters there is a fair bit of agreement. It was great listening to the member for Wentworth. He raises some really good issues. It was certainly more interesting than listening to the member for North Sydney. But, unfortunately, the issues that the member for Wentworth raised had very little or nothing to do with the bill that is before us, the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012. If the opposition were genuine about the matters raised in their contribution, they would accept that this bill actually takes us in right direction. It actually does make clear the intent of this parliament for many a decade and ensures the integrity of our taxation system. A number of other issues were raised. The member for Wentworth said that there was no instant solution. I would probably agree with him. He is right. There is no instant solution. There ought to be a broader debate in this place about what we do to make sure that we have proper transfer pricing arrangements for organisations such as Google and others and that they pay a fair share of tax. But this is no reason to oppose, as the opposition is doing, the cross-border transfer pricing bill that we have before us. If in fact the only reason, as they say, for not supporting this bill is that it is retrospective, it is a fairly weak and shallow argument. It does not go to the core of what this bill will do when passed by the parliament. Transfer pricing rules are an integral part of our tax system. This bill will make sure that is the case. When we look at what transfer pricing represents in terms of the Australian taxation system-as we have heard, it is valued at around $270 billion, around half of Australia's total trade flowswe see that it is important that we get this right. The government in November of last year announced that it would reform Australia's transfer pricing rules and that it would move to end the uncertainty that existed around whether or not the transfer pricing rules contained in our tax treaties could actually apply independently of the rules in division 13 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. That is exactly what this bill does. That on its own is worthy of support from the opposition. I find it strange and odd that clarifying a very important part of the integrity of our taxation system cannot possibly find support from the opposition. I that find that very odd and very strange indeed. These changes are extremely important and have been necessary for some time. They go back a long way. As we have heard from other speakers, there is a clear legislative intent by this parliament of how the law should be operating in this particular manner. This bill makes that clear. From time to time that necessity arises. When it does, this parliament-I believe as a whole-should be supporting that. This bill will ensure that the integrity of our tax system is not compromised by leaving some doubt as to how the system actually operates. What we are doing is absolutely consistent. It is consistent with what are internationally accepted as transfer pricing rules. In the absence of any other further contribution from the opposition, if they want to make a contribution in this area, they should support what we are doing. Again, the government is clarifying the operation of the law. The government has not come to this view on its own. This is not something that we have done without being mindful of a range of different views. It is certainly something that we have taken as an important step in formulating this amendment bill. In fact, Australia's current unilateral transfer pricing rules were first introduced in 1982 in the form of division 13, so they date back a long way. In fact, the explanatory memorandum circulated by the former Prime Minister and then Treasurer John Howard explained even back then that specific amendments would operate that way. That is consistent with what is being done today to clarify. The government has been absolutely clear in its intent. It is contained in the explanatory memorandum, which sets out multiple examples of parliaments where this is the case. The tax office has been abundantly clear on how this should work and on its intent. Even major accounting firms have supported this as well. This has been a matter, across different parliaments of different political persuasions, which has always had clear bipartisan support. It is interesting that something has changed now, which means that there is no longer support from the opposition. It begs the question: what has changed? I certainly do not believe that the change is to the integrity of systems of taxation in this county; perhaps the change is to the integrity of the opposition. Perhaps it is that the political imperative now has a higher priority than the national interest. I find that curious and strange in this particular case, as well. Certainly this amendment is entirely consistent with the commissioner's long-held and publicly expressed view of the current law. We need to be absolutely clear that these amendments constitute a mere confirmation of what the rules are, to the extent that there is any uncertainty. I think this is something that the opposition should support. If their only basis for not supporting this is some view about retrospectivity in terms of how the law applies then I think they should have a closer look at what the intent is-the clarification-and what this means in terms of Australia's taxation system. This is a good, sound amendment. It is an amendment that, if the parliament were constructed in a different manner, would perhaps have the support of the opposition. Perhaps in this case there is a different political imperative for the opposition. It is not a case of whether it is good policy or bad policy but whether it suits their agenda. I commend the bill to the House. I commend the minister for bringing these amendments forward. The House should support this bill as presented.",119
177,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS," I rise to associate myself with the comments of the shadow Treasurer and the member for Wentworth on their support for the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012. As with all tax law amendment bills that this government has tabled, this bill is one which the coalition will scrutinise for its intentions and for its consequences for businesses here in Australia. This bill will seek to provide consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997. The government seeks to legislate to clarify the transfer pricing rules after a decision in the Federal Court in 2011. The Commissioner of Taxation's understanding and application of treaty rules for transfer pricing adjustments was challenged in this case. Even though this piece of legislation seeks to clarify the transfer pricing rules in tax treaties, there is always a sting in the tail with this government when it comes to taxing business in Australia. Although it has been stated by the government that no impact will result to the budget with the passing of this bill, it is hard to believe that a taxing windfall for the government has not already been apportioned to the recently tabled budget. So let me revisit that. Here we have a comment from the so-called experts in Treasury. The Prime Minister in this House on many occasions has referred to the expert advice that we get from Treasury. We do not have to look too far back to find expert advice from Treasury in terms of its forecasts of this year's enormous deficit. In protecting the $1.5 billion surplus as we move forward, we see that this will have no impact on our budget! But why is it that the retrospectivity of this bill is so important that we have to go back to 2004 or 2006 and start taxing these bodies? It will be a liability that will be brought about by this bill. As an opposition we fundamentally oppose retrospectivity. It is the right of any business in this nation to do business, pay their tax bills in good faith and know that when they start trading in the next financial period they start with a clean slate. This bills refers to liability. It is a contingent liability and maybe those businesses have been applying for it. The Treasury is saying that this will have no impact on budget revenue but that can only mean one thing: that the tax office has already accumulated the contingent liability and brought it into their forward estimates to be expended and received in this financial year to help save a wafer-thin surplus. I refer to the retrospectivity of this bill, which goes back to 1 July 2004. The coalition opposes retrospective taxation in principle, and opposes the retrospectivity of this bill. The coalition will seek to amend this bill to give prospective effect to the bill, because that is fundamentally what we believe in. We reckon that if you pay your tax when it is due then that should be that it is imperative to the security and sovereign risk of our nation. The government should not be able to go back and have another crack. If the opposition amendment is unsuccessful we will oppose the bill. You would have contemplated the fact, Deputy Speaker Adams, that over the last eight years business taxpayers have operated on the existing tax laws of the day. In the current global economic uncertainty, business should not have to forecast or mitigate the financial imposts that expose them to penalties and retrospective charges from 1 July 2004. We are in a pretty difficult time from a manufacturing perspective, a tourism perspective and a construction perspective. Yet, with our two-speed economy, our mining sector is going gang busters and we do have a lot of things as a nation that we could celebrate. But, with the current global financial crisis and the lack of market confidence that exists, not only in this nation but also across a lot of our European partners who are suffering at the moment, you do not have to go too far-pick up any of the local papers-to know that jobs are at risk. Fairfax is putting off 1,900 staff, Macquarie Bank put off a heap the other day and Qantas are making announcements to that effect. The top end of town is doing it tough. Not all, but dollars. some, of those companies may be picked up in these retrospective clauses. Perhaps it is a position that this government, in its attempt to deliver a surplus next year, does not understand. Perhaps they do not understand what this new measure will do to foreign investment prospects for this nation-that changing a taxpayer's tax profile and obligations retrospectively may impact and result in financial and investment decisions being compromised or, worse, abandoned in Australia. At the end of the day we thrive, we rely, as a nation on foreign investment. That is how we have managed to maintain the quality of life that we have. It is fundamentally underpinned by foreign investment. This government, as we all probably well know, the other day-with no announcement or lead-in time-doubled the foreign investment trust tax bracket from seven per cent to 15 per cent. Admittedly, under the Howard regime, it was 30 per cent. But, when we started to drop that foreign investment trust tax bracket, we gave the market notice. This government did not. Foreign investment companies, making conscious decisions as to where they are going to park their funds-bang!-woke up on Tuesday morning to hear the government saying, 'Righto, your foreign investment trust tax bracket has been raised from seven per cent to 15 per cent, and you may even be up for a tax bill that goes as far back as 2004.' That is something that I do not think we as a nation can afford if any more of the industry and manufacturing sectors suffer further financial pressures within this country and from abroad. You can imagine some of Australia's largest companies getting a penalty notice adjusting tax obligations covering the last eight years. The figure could run into the hundreds of millions of When will this government learn that we cannot tax this nation into prosperity? I think we are now up to nearly 30 new taxes. We need to create a fiscal environment where we have businesses making profits, because, when they make profits, they pay taxes. I believe these measures in this bill are solely for the purpose of trying to secure and protect the wafer-thin surplus that this government so critically needs to hang on to political credibility. The transfer pricing rules exist to ensure that taxation is collected on the contribution of profits from Australian operations to multinational companies and to ensure that profits are not shifted between related parties across borders without appropriate taxation. I actually support that in principle. It is not in our nation's interest to have businesses making genuine profits from the resources, banking or financial sector here in Australia and then, through complex international holding bodies that they may have offshore, being able to offset expenditure to reduce their tax liability in Australia. I support in principle that we as a nation are duty bound to secure tax that is generated here in this country for the benefit of our nation. But, as a coalitionist, I cannot support the retrospectivity of this bill-going back nearly eight years. Transfer pricing rules are contained within division 13 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Australia has also incorporated international tax treaties into Australian law. During the Federal Court case in 2011, the Commissioner of Taxation considered these treaty transfer pricing rules contained in treaties as an alternative basis for transfer pricing adjustments in parallel with the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. In 2011 the full Federal Court cast doubt on the second basis for transfer pricing adjustments, in Commissioner for Taxation v SNF (Australia) Pty Ltd. While this case was argued only on the basis of division 13, the government believes that, as a result of this case, division 13 does not always adequately reflect the contributions of profits from Australian operations to multinational groups and, as such, in some cases treaty transfer pricing rules may produce a higher level of taxation. Whilst that may well be so, to retrospectively assess the tax liability through a change in playing field is hardly conducive to strengthening businesses positioning in global markets or the contribution they make to the employment of Australians and the tax they already contribute. The government has already stated during Senate estimates that it has no idea of the size of the retrospective tax impost and that it has no impact on the budget, but I beg to differ-of course they know. They will have brought it into account to assist in backing up their surplus claims for next year. Again I make the point that the government continually claims that we get expert advice from the taxation department and the Treasury, yet it beggars belief that in this particular case-with a court case that has been going since 2004, and hearings that went down in 2011-that we have no idea of the size of the retrospective tax impost it is going to have on business. I suggest that they do know because, I tell you what, the businesses who are lining up to pay that tax liability know to the very cent how much they are going to be in for. I suspect that government have already made provision for that, to protect their wafer-thin surplus. The coalition will not support an amendment that forces on taxpayers retrospective obligations that did not exist one year ago, let alone eight years ago. I do not believe for one moment that this government has given any thought to the perceived increase in the sovereign risk of this nation. That argument was quite diligently laid out earlier on by the shadow Treasurer in his opening remarks, in which he spoke extensively about the sovereign risk issues. Sovereign risk is one of the most critical measures of our position in global economics and the harm caused due to uncertainty to ongoing developments and investments in Australia. Certainty and confidence in the business marketplace are already at lows that we have not seen for years, outside of our resources sector, where we have a one in 140-year spike in capital investment. But when you take that sector out and you look at our manufacturing sector-for example, our car manufacturers and some of our financiers-it will be affected by this bill. Transfer-pricing arrangements in this bill do not adequately address the real issues facing the nation at the moment. The member for Wentworth spoke briefly about the impact of Amazon and Google trading substantial amounts of money and business through Australia and paying relatively low amounts of tax to the nation. The coalition will oppose the retrospective taxation in principle. The coalition will seek to amend the bill to give prospective effect to the bill. If the coalition amendment is unsuccessful then we will oppose this bill. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (19:39): Once again we stand here in this chamber to discuss a piece of legislation that sees the the government changing the playing field for corporates and business in this country at the very time when business confidence is at very low levels and business certainty about the direction this government is taking the country in is at heightened levels. While we might have a robust economy in certain sectors, in my electorate of Forde and in the greater area of South-East Queensland the economy is not that great. Tonight we are discussing the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012. This bill comes out of the 2011 full Federal Court case which cast doubt on the second basis for transfer-pricing adjustments, the Commissioner for Taxation v SNF Australia Pty Ltd. While this case was argued only on the basis of division 13 of the tax act, the government believes that as a result of this case division 13 does not always adequately reflect the contributions of profits from Australian operations to multinational groups and as such, in some cases, treaty transfer pricing rules may produce a high level of taxation. I have no issue with that. I fully support the notion that our multinational corporations international groups that operate in this country should pay their fair share of taxation. On 1 November 2011 the government announced a review into the relevant division of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and said it would legislate to clarify that the transfer-pricing rules in tax treaties are valid transfer-pricing adjustments independent of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The fly in the ointment for this bill is the fact that this change is retrospective from 1 July 2004. How on earth can our large companies, our multinationals, operate in an environment where the tax structure of the country is uncertain by virtue of the fact that the government decide to change tax lawswhich is fine; they are well within their rights to do that-but then make it retrospective? In this case, it is for up to eight years. This is essentially a large retrospective tax change and, as a matter of principle, we will oppose this bill in its current form for a number of reasons. Firstly, the proposed changes can change the substance of bargains struck between taxpayers who have made every effort to comply with the prevailing law as at the time the agreement was entered into. They can expose taxpayers to penalties in circumstances where taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps at the earlier time to mitigate the potential for penalties. They may change the taxpayer's tax profile, which in turn can materially impact the financial viability of investment decisions and the pricing of those decisions, and they can increase Australia's level of perceived foreign risk. I think that the perception of sovereign risk these days, with this government, is no longer perceived but real and actual. The coalition will seek to amend this bill and to give prospective effect to the bill or to provisions in the bill only. If this amendment is unsuccessful, the bill will be opposed by the coalition, as we do not believe the government has made a strong enough public justification for the retrospective component and application in this bill. By way of background, transfer-pricing rules exist to ensure that taxation is collected on the contribution of profits from Australian operations to multinational companies to ensure that profits are not shifted between related parties across borders without appropriate taxation. We have no issue with that, as I have already touched on, and the transfer-pricing rules contained in division 13 of the Income Tax Assessment Act deal with this. They are also incorporated in a number of international tax treaties which are incorporated into Australian law. The Commissioner of Taxation has considered these treaty transfer pricing rules contained in the treaties as an alternative basis for transfer-pricing adjustments in parallel with the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. In order to promote stability for business it is important that there be consistency of taxation and other regulatory impositions on business. In the bill the government provides no detail of the size of the retrospective tax impost, so how does business know what the impost on them is going to be? How would we like it if we had been paying our bills or our mortgage or our tax-let us focus on the tax here-and the government decided to change the tax laws and say: 'We're going back to 2004. We want to audit all of your tax returns for the last eight years, and, as a consequence, you might have a large tax bill.' That is exactly what is being proposed. Imagine the outcry if that was done to ordinary Australian mums and dads. But it seems that it is okay to do it to multinational companies, which, for the last eight years have tried to do the right thing by the Australian tax law-and nobody has proved that over the last eight years they have done anything outside the law. The government has just decided, on the basis of the decision in the court case, that it did not like the decision of the court so it will introduce a change to tax regulation to get the outcome it wants. As the member for Wright quite rightly pointed out, this change-which the government wants to make through this bill-will contribute to the government coffers, but the government cannot tell us what the amount will be. Maybe it is an attempt to achieve the mythical $1.5 billion surplus that I doubt we will see in September 2013. The government claims that the change will have no impact on the budget, as it is a revenue protection measure. If the change is not going to have any impact on the budget, why does it need to be retrospective? Why can't it just be prospective, as proposed in amendment put up by the coalition? The Assistant Treasurer's office is not even able to fully quantify the cost of not passing this bill, so it is another example of the government saying, 'We'll just put this out into the wind and see what happens.' The bill provides no certainty and no understanding of the difficulties faced by anyone who is affected by it. Unfortunately, that seems to be the mode of operation of this government: 'That's a good idea; let's float it out there and see what happens.' The question must be asked: why is the retrospectivity required when the government makes the claim that the bill will have no impact on the budget and that it is purely a revenue protection measure? Is it because of this government's prolific spending over the past 4Â½ years that it needs every little bit of revenue it can get from every corner of our economy to try to make ends meet and cover up its profligate waste of money? The coalition will be moving an amendment to make this bill prospective rather than retrospective. This amendment will ensure that taxpayers will not be forced to retrospectively comply with a tax regime that did not exist at the time they made business and investment decisions. We cannot expect our business community to have confidence in our tax system and our regulatory system if governments are just going to change things at their whim and make the changes not only prospective and for the future but also retrospective and for the past by saying, 'Now you have to go back and fix this, because we decided that that is what we want.' That does not engender confidence. In particular, in a global marketplace it does not create confidence for foreign investors who want to invest in this nation. The government talks readily about the $500 million pipeline of foreign investment that is supposedly coming over the the next few years, but, if you were a foreign investor looking at this bill and thinking of investing $100 million in a mining project, would you do it? You would not know what the position will be for your business in four or five years time and whether the government will make another decision in four or five years time which will affect what you have already done. This bill provides no confidence whatsoever to our business and trading community. I commend to the House the amendment which we will move.",120
178,Mr BRADBURY,BILLS,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (19:50): I thank those members who have contributed to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012. This bill ensures that Australia has effective and internationally consistent transfer-pricing models. It confirms that transfer-pricing rules contained in Australia's tax treaties incorporated into domestic law provide assessment authority in treaty cases. The changes in the bill will apply to income years commencing on or after 1 July 2004. That was the first income year which followed parliament's last statement demonstrating its long-held understanding that the law operates in this way. We have discussed the considerable evidence across the decades that parliament understood that treaty transfer-pricing rules have operated in addition to our unilateral transfer-pricing rules since at least 1982. The amendments contained in this bill are also entirely consistent with the Commissioner of Taxation's long-held and publicly expressed view of the law. I emphasise that the potential impact on taxpayers has been carefully considered. Importantly, the measures in the bill can only apply where a tax treaty is applicable, and therefore a party affected by the measures will be able to access the treaty mechanisms designed to relieve any double taxation that could arise. Settled cases will not be reopened as a result of the measures in the bill, and penalties will only apply in relation to prior years to the extent that they can arise under the current law. The government has engaged extensively with the business community on this bill. The measures in the bill are not wholly supported by multinationals and their advisers-and, given that they are robust integrity measures, this was not altogether unexpected. That said, the bill has greatly benefited from the inclusion of some important features following consultation. In particular, the bill clarifies the interaction between the transfer-pricing and the thin capitalisation rules. The bill also provides direct access to OECD guidance material in interpreting rules, avoiding the need to get costly expert advice on whether such guidance may be used. This reflects the and best international thinking on transfer pricing. Other provisions of the bill support these key features and ensure the provisions work and interact appropriately with the rest of the income tax law. I commend the bill to the House.",126

181,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (19:58): On indulgence, today I had the honour of representing the Prime Minister at the funeral of Frank Walker. It was an extraordinary occasion, with speeches from former High Court Judge Mary Gaudron about Frank's legal legacy; from Frank's brother Robert; from Michael Knight, who spoke about Frank Walker's early years; from Michael Deegan, who spoke about Frank's achievements as a state and federal minister; and Michael Gallagher, who represented the New South Wales government and who was also the candidate against Frank for the seat of Robertson in 1993. He gave a very generous and humorous speech. He indicated that Frank would understand the humour of a former police officer speaking at his funeral, given the opposition that was there from the police to reforms such as removal of the Summary Offences Act and to other important progressive legislation that was championed by Frank Walker. It was a great occasion. I thank the Premier of New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell, for his generosity in ensuring that it was a state funeral, particularly given that this was a great Labor event with Labor luminaries including the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. It was also attended by a number of former premiers, including Barry Unsworth, Nick Greiner, Nathan Rees and Kristina Kenneally. It was indeed a great occasion at the Sydney Conservatorium and there were outstanding musical presentations. Of course if there was an overriding theme to the event it was Frank Walker's record of being a champion of the marginalised, particularly his support for Indigenous rights. Tales were told, for example, about his being assaulted for daring to sit with the local Indigenous community QC on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales in a segregated theatre. It should be remembered that this happened in our lifetime. The police took him out of that theatre and he was assaulted for the crime of taking a stance on race relations in favour of equality. This was a great celebration of a great Australian. It was one in which there was a very positive spirit and it was an honour to be there today to represent the Prime Minister. In her absence, I thank her for bestowing that honour upon me.

183,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS," by leave-I move amendments (1) to (3) together: NOES (1) Schedule 1, page 13 (line 15), omit the heading. (2) Schedule 1, item 12, page 13 (line 16) to page 14 (line 29), omit the item. (3) Schedule 1, item 14, page 15 (lines 6 to 8), omit the item, substitute: 14 Application The amendments made by this Schedule apply to income years starting on or after the day Act commences. As I have previously outlined, the coalition are opposed to the retrospective application of this bill and we do not believe that the government has a strong enough justification for its implementation. The coalition are opposed to retrospective tax changes as a matter of principle. I would have thought that members such as the member for Kennedy and the member for New England would have been opposed to retrospective tax going back seven years. That sort of uncertainty just adds to the sovereign risk the nation is facing under a Treasurer that is addicted to sovereign risk. The coalition understand that it can change the substance of bargains struck between taxpayers who have made every effort to comply with the prevailing law as at the time the agreement was entered into. Retrospectivity can expose taxpayers to penalties in circumstances where taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps at the earlier time to mitigate the potential for penalties to be imposed. It may change a taxpayer's profile, which in turn can materially impact the financial viability of investment decisions and the pricing of those decisions. Most importantly, retrospective application of the change will heighten Australia's level of perceived sovereign risk. Therefore, the coalition will not support any attempt by the government to create further sovereign risk in this environment. We do not support going back seven years to obtain tax in agreements that people entered into in good faith at the time that they were entered into. Our amendments give the bill prospective effect from the date the act commences. The Commissioner for Taxation and the government have refused to identify how much revenue is going to be claimed by this this bill. I would like to know from the Assistant Treasurer how much revenue is at stake. The Commissioner for Taxation did not have the number before him and he said it was insignificant, but you tell us: how much revenue is at stake that would justify breaking a core element of policy principle, that is, that the law should be prospective, not retrospective?",128
184,Mr BRADBURY,PAIRS,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (20:14): The shadow Treasurer has come forward and said that as a matter of principle those opposite do not support retrospective laws. The first point to make is that these laws are not retrospective; they are about confirming the application of laws in the way in which they have been understood, in terms of both the way the law has been expounded and administrative practice. The second point that I would make and that I draw to the attention of the member for North Sydney is: so much for his suggestion that they do not support retrospective tax laws! I just want to name a handful of them: the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 3) Act 2006, the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 3) 2002 and the the Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Collection) Act 1997.

I simply make the point that in relation to the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 3) Act passed in 2006, the commencement of that act was 1 July 2000. So six years was okay on that occasion.

193,Mr KEENAN,BILLS," I am very pleased to rise in this House to support this piece of legislation, which is a direct result of the private member's bill put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. The Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011 is designed to support and assist Australian victims of overseas terrorist acts. These are people who have suffered because they have been deliberately targeted by terrorist groups by virtue of being Australian and by virtue of being Westerners. Merely by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, over 300 Australians have lost their lives in the past decade to acts of terrorism in New York, Washington, Bali, London, Jakarta and Mumbai. The word 'terrorism' has its roots in Latin and it means 'to frighten'. The aim of terrorists is to terrify us into submission. In this aim they have comprehensively failed. But this is what the perpetrators of the Bali I have bombings in 2002 and 2005 had in mind when they killed 202 people in the first Bali bombing, including 88 Australians, in what was the deadliest terrorist act in Indonesian history. A further 240 people were injured in the 2002 attacks. The 2005 Bali terrorist attack claimed the lives of a further 20 people and injured more than 100 others. It is a tragic reality that Australians are sometimes specifically targeted in overseas terrorist acts. The news last year that Osama bin Laden had been killed did bring a degree of comfort to some victims of terrorist attacks, including Paul Anicich, who was a survivor of the 2005 Bali bombing. Upon hearing the news, Paul said, 'I don't feel joyous about it but I am pleased it's eventuated.' I think that sums up the feeling very well: we do not celebrate the death of Osama bin Laden, but there is a sense that justice has been served by his demise. I hope that that news last year will bring a sense that justice has been served to families of the victims of these atrocities carried out by alQaeda and their extended terror network and allies. The death of bin Laden is a strike at the heart of international terrorism and a great achievement for America in particular, who led the raid, but also for those who have joined the Western allies in what is a long struggle to defeat al-Qaeda, including, of course, Australia and in particular the ADF-and the ADF still remains engaged in Afghanistan, fighting bravely to ensure that that country will not be used as a safe haven to launch terrorist attacks at any time in the future. The world is certainly a better place without Osama bin Laden commanding or inciting acts of terror around the world. While al-Qaeda suffered a serious blow when they lost their leader, they still remain a potent threat and we still need to continue to be vigilant against the atrocities that they commit. When we talk about victims of terrorism, it is important to remember that we are talking directly not just about those who were killed or severely injured but also about their families and the communities which they belonged to. A tragic example of the effects of terrorist attacks is the Western Australian football club based in Kingsley, just north of my electorate. They lost seven team members and had two other members severely burnt during the 2002 Bali bombings. The team had flown to Bali as an end-of-year celebration for making it into the grand final, and for some it was their first trip overseas. Of the 20 who went, only 13 returned. The Kingsley Amateur Football Club were left devastated at the loss of their sons, brothers, fathers, husbands, family and friends. What unfolded in the following weeks and months was an outpouring of grief and support from the wider Western Australian community. This bill will directly assist victims and their families, like those of the Kingsley football club, to rebuild their lives after the horrifying experience of a terrorist attack. Another victim of the 2002 bombings was Nicole MCLean, who was 24 years old at the time. Nicole was a retail manager from Montrose who had been in Bali for only six hours when the bomb went off. She told her story a year later. It makes for quite harrowing reading: Everyone else was around the bar area. I was on the dance floor and I was the only person there left alive. The bomb went off and I think it's done a big circle of the place-like the fireball just went round-then something heavy hit me on the arm. It was probably a plank of wood; who knows? It was hot, on fire, and damn heavy and it hit me on the arm. I went to try to shake it off but the force of it had just sent me flying. I thought â€˜what the hell is that?' I had no idea. â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ I've woken up and seen my arm on the ground. It was still attached-but only by skin-but it was lying in a strange position. I've picked it up and held it across me and tried to get up but my leg was damaged and I couldn't get up so I just had to lie down again. I just thought â€˜someone's going to come and get me'. I didn't know who it would be but I knew I wasn't going to die in there. â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ I got back to Melbourne on the Hercules and I was still dozing on and off and still very blase. I was okay for a week then my body just wanted to finish up, I think. The infection that was in my arm was going into my bloodstream and my temperature went up into the high 40s so they raced me down to ICU and I spent three days on life support. They told me that the arm would have to come off. I think when it comes to a limb on your body, it's your life or your arm, there's no question, got to be your life. â€¦ â€¦ â€¦ I went back to work after six months. I only work three days a week now. I don't want to work a full week. I get tired. I fought for my life for two months. That takes a lot out of you. I do get customers who ask about my arm. Sometimes I just say â€˜I was in Bali'. It is important that victims such as Nicole are able to rebuild their lives and will be eligible for assistance to do so. Terrorism is a crime that is tragically life changing for not only those who are directly attacked but also their families and the wider community. For Perth mother June Corteen, death struck twice. Her twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, were just outside the Sari Club when a terrorist detonated the bombs that killed those 202 people, including her two daughters, who were 39 years old. Ms Corteen said her daughters were always close. They had grown up together in a small Western Australian town and Jane had two children, Jack and Katie. Her partner, Steve, had taken the children to visit his parents while she and Jenny went to Bali. Ms Corteen said she would always remember the first moments when she heard a radio broadcast about the bombing. Somebody mentioned the hotel where her daughters were staying near the site and she feared the worse. Ms Corteen had to bring dental records and DNA to Bali, then came the emotion of taking her daughters home, knowing their bodies were in coffins in the plane's hull. Ms Corteen said: They were born together and they died together. If one of them had happened to survive â€¦ it would have been terrible for her and it would have been extremely hard for me. It's hard for me now but I'm pleased that they are together. The Bali attacks in 2002 and 2005 were not the attacks by al-Qaeda and their allies that claimed the most lives. I am sure every it's Australian and every member of this House remembers where they were when they heard about the attacks of September 11 in New York. Almost 3,000 people died immediately as a result of those attacks; 372 of them were foreign nationals. Ten Australians lost their lives in those attacks on the World Trade Centre. With their families and friends left devastated on the other side of the world, the opposition believes that this parliament should offer them financial support so they do not have to concern themselves with these matters whilst they are dealing with the burden of grieving. This funding will also assist victims in their rehabilitation process, for both physical and psychological injuries. Stuart Knox, an Adelaide man who was 29 years old at the time, has shared the story of the loss of his twin brother on September 11. His brother, Andrew Knox, was working as an environmental architect on the 103rd floor of the World Trade Centre's north tower when the first of the hijacked planes struck. The American Airlines jet smashed into the tower just below him, between floors 93 and 99. Stuart was alerted his brother was there and had him on speaker phone for a while as his brother huddled near a ledge saying he could not breathe. Andrew Knox's mobile dropped out after that, but his brother does live with some relief that he apparently died before the tower collapsed. Stuart said of his brother Andrew: â€¦ I guess that, over the 10 years, it has been one of the hardest things, because of the fact that you're looking at the fact that, if a loved one died in a car crash, nobody has filmed it, nobody plays it for you repeatedly. But, for something like September 11, you have images of the â€¦ time that your loved one was killed. September 11 and the Bali attacks were of course only two of several attacks that included the attacks in London in 2005, a series of coordinated attacks targeting civilians using public transport during the morning rush hour. On the morning of 7 July 2005, four Islamic home-grown terrorists detonated four bombs, three in quick succession aboard London Underground trains across the city and later a fourth on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square. Fifty-two people were killed in the attacks, including one Australian, and over 700 were injured. Sam Ly was the only Australian killed in those bombings. He was in the UK with his long-term girlfriend on a working holiday, and they were caught up in the bus blast in Tavistock Square. He was a 28-yearold computer worker. His father and nephew flew to London to be at his hospital bedside, but he died a week later on 14 July. Mandy Ha, his girlfriend of nine years, accompanied his body back to Australia. Other victims of the London bombing include Gillian Hicks from South Australia, who had both her legs amputated, and one can understand the profound effect and the difficult impact on her life, and the costly and ongoing medical treatment that would be required, having suffered an injury as horrific as that. It is vital as a nation that we do offer the victims of terrorism our support. As well as the few examples that I have mentioned above, 300 Australians have been killed in these atrocious attacks. But the attacks would have directly impacted on thousands of Australians who were the families of the people who were directly affected. Their scars, of course, will be both physical and mental. It is important to note that this bill is a direct result of the important work done by the Leader of the Opposition and, in debating this bill today, I am pleased that it includes the principles that were outlined by the Leader of the Opposition when he first raised this issue in his Assisting the Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2010. The opposition leader's private member's bill aimed to provide additional financial support of up to $75,000 to Australians who are affected by terrorism while they are overseas. The government's bill adopts this approach and will institute a mechanism through the social security system called the Australian victim of terrorism overseas payment. The payment will provide up to $75,000 to individuals who are injured or to a close family member of a person killed as a result of a terrorist act committed overseas. The payments are similar to those available under state victim-of-crime compensation legislation. As has been noted in the bill's explanatory memorandum, in particular this bill will enable Australians who are victims of a declared overseas terrorist incident to claim financial support of up to $75,000. It will enable the Prime Minister to declare that a relevant overseas terrorist incident is one to which the scheme applies. It will establish eligibility criteria so that payments can be made to either long-term Australian residents who are victims of a relevant overseas terrorist act or, in the event of the death of a victim, close family members. It will also ensure that victims are not required to repay or deduct Medicare or other benefits from any payment received under the scheme and it will enable the enactment of legislative instruments to provide further guidance on the amount of assistance that each victim or close family member should receive. Whilst, clearly, these measures will never ease the pain of losing a loved one or erase the memories of those who have been the victims of terrorism, they do go some way to providing real and tangible support for those victims. I want to foreshadow that the Leader of the Opposition will be moving amendments that address the fact that the bill before the parliament is not necessarily retrospective. could, potentially, leave victims of the Bali bombings and some of the other past terrorist attacks that I have outlined without any financial support. The opposition certainly does not seek to play politics with the issue, but the Leader of the Opposition has written to the Prime Minister and to the Attorney General to seek some clarity on this. They have, at this stage, refused to extend the application of the bill, and I would urge them to reconsider that decision. The Leader of the Opposition has consistently said in the past that Australians who were killed or severely injured in the second Bali bombing were the Australians who gave him the inspiration to craft this bill in the first place. So he, said, will be moving amendments to ensure that they, absolutely and definitely, have access to this compensation. I think that most members of the House would agree that it would be very disappointing if the victims of the two Bali bombings, the two Jakarta bombings, the London bombing and the attacks of September 11 were not able to access the compensation that will be shortly available. This is a very important issue and it is an important bill. As I said, the opposition does not seek to score political points or gain any political kudos over this. We simply wish that our parliament, our government and our nation acknowledge Australians who have suffered through terrorist acts and that we grant them additional appropriate measures of recognition. This bill is about providing support to our fellow Australians who, through no fault of their own, have suffered at the hands of merciless terrorists who hate us for who we are and what we are. The payments contained within this bill are not large, but they will appropriately recognise Australian victims of terrorism, who I think most would agree are worthy of our support.",131
194,Mr HAYES,BILLS," I, too, rise It to support the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011. The bill demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that Australian victims of terrorism overseas and their immediate families are entitled to the same amount of support as any victim of a terrorism act committed here on Australian soil. This bill makes the necessary amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to establish the Australian victim of terrorism overseas payment, and outlines the necessary circumstances under which individuals and their families are entitled to Commonwealth support. In order to be as I eligible for financial assistance of up to $75,000 in the aftermath of such a tragic incident overseas, the incident would need to be pronounced as a terrorist attack by the Prime Minister of the day, and the victim would need to satisfy specific criteria regarding physical or psychological effects. Currently, victims of domestic terrorism could be compensated here in Australia through state and territory criminal justice measures compensation schemes. Presently in Australia every state and territory has victims of crime provisions which include terrorism-because, as you are aware, terrorism is included as a crime-and are eligible for lump sum payments under the criminal justice regimes operating in those states and territories. This bill will ensure that there is an adequate compensation scheme available for Australian victims of terrorist acts where they occur overseas. It is also applicable to their immediate families. Over the years Australians, together with the rest of the world, have been touched by the threat and indeed the reality of the evil of terrorism. Clearly, when the September 11 attack occurred in the United States, it very much changed the world. The modern world has become far more aware of its own vulnerability and the high prospect of terrorism that lies ahead. It is something that moves all our security agencies to protect our communities against the ravages of such evil events. Recent terrorist attacks, including that on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001, the Bali bombing and the tragic incidents on the London subway, in Madrid, in Mumbai and in many other cities around the world have shown that the grief and suffering go in no way only to the immediate human loss of life. We have seen-and the shadow minister mentioned in a very moving way-the effect that these terrorist events have had on the immediate families back here at home. These devastating effects are left in place for years and years to come. Despite not having experienced a terrorist attack on Australian soil, Australians have been directly affected by a number of overseas attacks. In fact since September 11 more than 300 Australians have been killed or seriously injured in terrorist incidents overseas. In the past decades Australians have been killed or injured in terrorist in New York, Washington, Bali, London, Jakarta and Mumbai. It is our duty as a nation to protect our citizens from the threat of terrorism and provide assistance to the victims. In this we take that duty very seriously. Ensuring the threat of terrorism does not penetrate our national bordersantiterrorism-is a national priority. In this I compliment the efforts and commitment of the Australian Federal Police. I know the minister responsible for the AFP, the member for Blaxland, is in fact at the table at the moment. The Australian Federal Police is doing a fantastic job in all quarters of the globe but particularly in our region and in working very closely with our allies in counterpart jurisdictions. I would like to mention its Indonesian counterparts on counterterrorism measures. The AFP, for instance, through the government, established the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation and provides vital assistance in the aftermath of the Bali bombing in 2002 and other terrorist attacks that followed in Indonesia. I have had the honour of visiting that centre and seeing first hand the absolutely tremendous work that is being done by the Australian Federal Police in assisting police of the Indonesian policing jurisdictions. We should be very proud of the work the AFP are doing in that part of the world. They are not only protecting Australian citizens but also assisting the development of professional policing skills in our neighbouring police jurisdictions. As I say, the consequence of their actions is not just about protecting Australian citizens; they are providing a vital and integral part of policing development throughout our region. The Bali bombing was particularly devastating for Australians. It is the closest we have come to being directly attacked in attacks recent years. Bali was one of the most popular tourist destinations for Australians for decades. For years Australians have been probably the main driver of tourism in the Bali island. Retail and hospitality industries all flourished off Australian tourism to Bali. The Aussies were attracted by the surf and night-life there. But it is certainly an areaand having been to Bali, I know this-that is very spiritual, peaceful and tranquil, which is also an attraction for many. In October we will commemorate the 10th anniversary of the tragic incident that brought many Australians for the very first time face to face with terror. The attack by the militants of Jemaah Islamiah, a network linked with al-Qaeda, claimed the lives of 202 people from 22 different countries. Eighty-eight of those victims were our fellow Australian citizens. A further 209 people were injured during those attacks. The Bali bombing was one of the most horrific acts of terrorism, and obviously very close to our shore. It was an act that some would refer to as Australia's September 11. That is not only because a large number of Australians were attacked and killed on that night; it is really because Australians were the target of that terrorist attack. All terrorist activities are tragic but the tragedy goes beyond the number of lives lost. I think we have all been touched in some way by the effect on the immediate families and close friends of the horrific act of the Bali bombings. Personally, I will always remember the words of Brian Deegan, a lawyer and former magistrate from Adelaide who tragically lost his son, Josh, in the Bali bombing. I had a lot to do with Brian when I was involved with the Bali 9-a number of Australian citizens who, through activities in drug trafficking, were sentenced to death and were on death row in Kerobokan Prison. Over that period, Brian expressed to me his immeasurable grief over the loss of his son who was only 22 years old at the time. He actually reduced this to an essay and published it as Remembering Joshua. I was very moved by Brian's words of grief, but in my discussions with him I was particularly touched by his conviction not to seek revenge on the men responsible for his son's death. He was, and remains, against capital punishment. I certainly saw first hand the impact that the loss of his son had on his life. The Bali bombing is something that this country will never forget. The Howard government needs to be complimented on the way they handled the aftermath of the tragedy, providing vital assistance to the victims and their families affected by that tragedy. The 88 Australians who tragically lost their lives on that dreadful night died because they were Australian. It was an attack on the freedom and democracy that our nation stands for. Terrorism is a crime directed not at individuals but at the state, even though individuals are the immediate means of harming the state. Nevertheless, there are direct victims. Therefore in that context, the burden of the attack should not be borne just by the victims. They have suffered enough. It is the duty of a federal government on behalf of the Australian people to provide the necessary support to those affected. The federal government has assisted Australian victims of terrorism in the past, providing them with medical and evacuation support, consular assistance and assistance with funeral costs and other expenses on an ex gratia basis. As I understand it, the value of that assistance to date exceeds $12 million. There is, however, more that can be done to ease the suffering and to provide support to Australian victims. The financial payment of up to $75,000 is an acknowledgement that injuries sustained in terrorist attacks are often grave and have lasting physical or mental effects on individuals. The financial assistance for the families is an acknowledgement of the tremendous effect the death of a loved one during a terrorist attack has on the immediate family. Looking after the families of the victims of terrorism is also our responsibility and as such it is right that we provide the necessary assistance to families during what must be the most difficult time in their lives. Ex gratia payments to the victims of terrorism and assistance with funeral costs, travel and lost wages occurring as a result of the terrorist act are some of the basic forms of assistance and the least we, as a nation, can do to support families. Support for the substance of the bill is bipartisan. In fact it builds on the points expressed in the Leader of the Opposition's private member's bill from last year-I remember speaking on that bill as wellincluding ensuring that victims of terrorism are not required to repay Medicare, workers compensation or any other benefits received from the Commonwealth. The bill is also consistent with current victims of crime compensation schemes around the country. The payment will also be exempt from taxation. Despite our efforts to ensure the safety and security of all Australians at home and abroad, the ongoing threat of terrorism remains real. Australians should be assured that the Australian government is doing all it can to minimise the threat of terrorism and protect freedom and our way of life. It is what we do because we are Australian.",135
195,Mr BALDWIN,BILLS," I rise tonight to speak on the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill. It is a very worthwhile bill. It is a bill that has been a long time in coming. It originated because of the tenacity of the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. Tony Abbot had personal experience with the acts of terrorism when he was in Bali. By coincidence, when Tony Abbott was in Bali the people that he helped after the Bali bombings happened to be personal friends of mine. I commend the government for bringing this bill forward. It is a little late but it is well recognised. There is one fundamental flaw in this bill. That fundamental flaw is that it is not retrospective for those who have already suffered at the hands of terrorists. It does not matter whether those terrorist acts occurred in New York, Washington, Bali, London, Jakarta or Mumbai if the victims are our fellow Australians. During these acts people's lives were destroyed-they were ended-and family structures were torn apart. Communities were torn apart. I am not saying that the coalition government who was in power at the time of some of these acts and the current government have not provided medical or support services. But this is the payment of a compensatory amount of $75,000 that would enable people to get on with their lives. We are not talking a huge amount of money. Over the past decade about 300 Australians have been killed or injured in acts of terrorism overseas. That is an average of 30 a year. If we apply that average of 30 times $75,000, the estimated cost would be around $2Â¼ million per annum. It is not a lot of money, so what I cannot understand is why this government is not making it retrospective. I have made a number of speeches in this parliament on this issue and surrounding the acts of terrorism on Australians. I do get concerned and I would like to point to a couple of incidents. In November 2009, then Prime Minister Rudd gave a commitment to this House that he would push to have this incorporated as part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. In fact on that day in the parliament Prime Minister Rudd berated me for questioning the integrity of that scheme and how it would apply to people who had been affected by acts of terrorism such as the twin towers attack in September 11, the 12 October 2002 Bali bombings in which 88 Australians were killed, the London bombings in 2005 where one of my constituents, Louise Barry, was affected, and the October 2005 bombings at Jimbaran Beach where four Australians were killed, including three from the Hunter Valley, Jennifer Williamson, and Colin and Fiona Zwolinski. I have regular dialogue with one of the victims of these bombings, Paul Anicich. Paul Anicich was a leading light, a leading legal mind, one of the senior partners in Sparke Helmore. These events meant that he could no longer work. His capacity to apply his brilliant legal mind was taken away from him. His wife, Penny, also suffered from the explosions. Their path of recovery has taken a long time. Paul has been one of the strongest advocates for this victims of terrorism compensation fund. The Leader of the Opposition was fair in saying that Paul Anicich is one of the people who has driven our side of parliament into pushing this as an agenda. Paul quite rightly admits that it is not he that needs the money-it is people like Tony Purkiss, a great guy who had a good job but was blinded by the bomb blast and is now not able to work, and like the young boys Isaac and Ben Zwolinski who lost their parents. How do they get on? We are not talking a huge amount of money. I understand the coalition will be moving amendments through the Leader of the Opposition to make this retrospective, to pick up the tab and provide some compensatory funds for those who truly deserve it. On 13 May 2010, just over two years ago, in question time, then Prime Minister Rudd responded to a question that I asked him in relation to how the victims of terrorism bill was progressing. He said: â€¦ the honourable member for Paterson asked about compensation for victims of international terrorism. I am aware of the private member's bill that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition on this matter-and about which the member for Paterson has spoken. It proposes the establishment of a compensation scheme for victims of terrorism overseas. We appreciate the spirit in which this private member's bill has put forward. I am sure I speak on behalf of all members of the House when I say that we support victims of terrorism and appreciate the interest that any member of this House takes in their particular and individual circumstances. We are happy to examine the bill which has been put forward and see what practical things could be done to assist Australians in these circumstances. To that end I have asked the Attorney-General to speak further in the course of the next month with the member for Paterson on its details. We condemn, as I am sure all members of this place do, all acts of terrorism. We stand by all Australian victims of terrorism. This is the key point. Here was a Prime Minister saying, 'We stand by all Australian victims of terrorism'. That was on 13 May two years ago, and this bill is only coming to the floor of the parliament today. I think that the time this has taken to actually come to the floor paints in a bad light some of those who have expressed their concern for these victims. How do you say to someone who has suffered a family member's life ending from an act of terrorism, or to a person whose life has been rendered partially useless because of a senseless act of terrorism because of people attacking what we stand forfreedom and democracy not only in our country but across the world-that they deserve any less than what applies to any victim of crime across the states? If I am not correct someone will correct me, but the amount of money paid across the states to victims of crime is $75,000 a person. I am very disappointed that this bill is not retrospective. That was the crux of the bill moved by the Leader of the Opposition-to apply to those people who had already suffered. Creating a bill before any terrorist event occurred would have been something we would have all looked at and said, 'Well, this is never going to happen,' but these events occurred nearly seven years ago and it been is only today that we are here debating this bill on the floor. For seven years people have sat around wondering what the government would do given the promises and the commitments that were made. I sit and think regularly about Paul and Penny, and Tony Purkiss and how they are getting on with their lives. I think of the young boys Ben and Isaac and how they have grown into fine young men without their parents. As I say, we are not talking a large amount of money. We are talking about an amount of money which will make a difference to the lives of these people. This bill is in line with state and territory victims-of-crime regimes, and we support that. I ask the government, as I have on many occasions before, to actually have a heart. Have a heart; it is not a lot of money. If we compare it to other schemes and expenditure of government-and I am not going to get overtly political on this-the total quantum of money is very little in comparison. I urge the minister and I urge those local members who represent the families or the individuals that have been affected to have a heart and to make sure that they stand up for them in this time of need. I again congratulate the government for finally getting this bill to the floor of the House, we have been given so many commitments before. We need to see a final resolution of this so that people can get on with their and I look forward to joining in the debate on the amendments to be put forward by the Leader of the Opposition.",138
196,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I speak in support of the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011. In one of the letters in the New Testament from St Paul of Tarsus, he admonishes some believers in one of the group of churches he established by saying that when he was a child, he thought like a child and when he was a man, he thought like a man. What he meant was that when he was a child he had infantile beliefs and ideas but as he became a man he put away those, grew up and realised about responsibility, cooperation, love, affection and resolving issues without disputation, conflict and warfare. When we are children and things do not go our way, as toddlers, we lash out. It is juvenile, but that is what we do. We pull something away from our brother or sister. But we realise as we grow older that we resolve disputes cooperatively in a democratic, compassionate and understanding way. Our parents teach us that, our teachers teach us that and our friends teach us that. Most Western countries resolve those things in that way. But, lest we in the West pat ourselves on the back, the Great War from 1914 to 1919, the worse war in the history of humanity, was started by an act of terrorism. It was a war in which most of the Western powers engaged themselves, and we did as well. One wonders how that war started. It was an act of terrorism by a Serbian national who wanted to attack and get rid of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and killing a member of that royal family was how it happened. Many wars are started by but acts of terrorism. In the West we cannot understand it, because we believe in concepts like liberal democracy and resolving our lives, disputes. No matter what rancour and disputation we see across the chamber, noone picks up guns, bombs or knives and starts slashing one another. When governments are defeated in elections, the Prime Minister and the cabinet resign and leave, and a new government comes in. In the last 40 years in this country we have had 20 years of conservative rule and 20 years of Labor rule. Australians are used to changes of government. We accept the outcomes of elections. We accept that people can live their lives the way they want to. We find it hard to understand the fundamentalism and extremism of religions, of belief systems, that would result in the despair and the destruction of terrorism. But we know, from the last 10 years or so, about 300 Australians have died as victims of terrorism. They have died in the United States, they have died in Indonesia, they have died in the UK and they have died in India. They have died needlessly and unnecessarily. We find in our community of Australia, in our very civilised country where people resolve their disputes, that we are not without fault. There are criminal acts committed every day, sadly, across the country, but people generally can resolve their disputes in courts, in mediation, in arbitration and in a civilised and dignified way. It is indeed the case that, even when we go to court, 95 per cent of those cases are resolved without going to a final hearing. So we find it hard to accept what we see, and we struggle and strain about it. This legislation is important. It is important to provide financial assistance. As a politician I have had the benefit Jakarta and talking to the Australian Federal Police about terrorism in Indonesia and what happened in Bali, and talking with Indonesian police as well. I visited the Middle East and saw the hostility and enmity between Jew and Arab, and the viciousness with which their beliefs are held. We are very blessed in this country, but you can see Australians all throughout Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the United States, because Australians travel. You can see them in lifts in Tel Aviv. You can see them in markets in Jakarta. You can see them in shopping centres in Singapore. And whenever they travel they are at risk of terrorism. Fortunately in this country we have been blessed by not having those acts of terrorism that we have witnessed overseas amongst our friends in the UK, the US, Indonesia and India. The purpose of this legislation is to provide financial assistance to those Australians who have been injured or who have had close family members killed overseas as a result of these wanton acts of unnecessary violence we call terrorism. This bill was introduced a while ago and there are amendments. There are important amendments to our law and they provide a system of payment which we are familiar with in this country-that is, through the victims of crime type of legislation and compensation. This is very much based on the WorkCover type of legislation. We will take into consideration the nature, duration and impact of the injury or disease, the future loss of earnings, the kinds of special injury or damage that people suffer and the circumstances in which that injury occurred or that disease was picked up. So we are aware of those things. We also took into consideration in putting together this bill the nature of the relationships between the primary and secondary victims, and I will of being in talk about them shortly. There are important provisions in this bill to enhance people's financial capacity to get on with their lives. For example, the payment-which goes up to $75,000-will be exempt from GST. There are provisions in the bill to exempt from the Income Tax Assessment Act the moneys paid in assistance as well as other kinds of payments which are regularly brought back to the Commonwealth or to an insurance company under existing legislation. In the past there were ex gratia payments and, though they were paid, they were paid in a way that was inconsistent, and they were paid to past victims to assist them. The payments were complex and spontaneous. They were not always made with a sound basis, and they were not consistent with victims of crime or WorkCover types of compensation. So we are putting in place with this bill some legal rigour and a consistency of policy and assistance which is commensurate with the injuries suffered. Such concepts are familiar to lawyers and to many Australians around the country who are involved in workers compensation or victims of crime situations. It is hard: we will never be able to compensate Australians for the grief, the suffering, the agony and the loss that they go through, and my heart goes out to them. Many Australians will remember where they were when they saw what happened in Bali or on 9/11. We are also establishing through this bill some eligibility criteria, and we are making sure that Medicare payments do not have to be refunded. In the minutes I have remaining, I turn to the matter of who is going to get the compensation. As I said, the compensation is paid up to a maximum of $75,000, though nothing will compensate people in real terms for what they go through. The legislation makes plain in section 1061PAA the qualifications for an Australian victim of terrorism overseas payment. The person has to be a primary or secondary victim of a declared overseas terrorist act. The person or the person's close family members must not have been involved in the commission of the terrorist act-in other words, they must not have been involved in aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring in connection with the terrorist act or involved in it in any way, including the conspiracy. The person has to have been an Australian resident or a person resident in Australia on the day that the terrorist act occurred. There is a legal basis to determine whether a person is a resident of Australia-they have to be an Australian citizen or an Australian resident. Both categories are covered by the definition. A person is defined as a primary victim if they were in the place where the terrorist act occurred and were harmed, within the meaning of the Criminal Code, as a direct result of the terrorist act. The definition is pretty clear: the person had injured in a bomb explosion where they lost an arm or a leg or received lacerations or another injury. The eligibility for compensation of secondary victims is important because it is not just the person who is injured but also their close relatives who are often victims. Because they survive, it is the close relatives of the injured person who feel the pain. The definition says that a person is a secondary victim of a declared overseas terrorist act if they are a close member of the primary victim's family, and the primary victim must have been in the place where the terrorist act occurred and have died as a direct result of the terrorist act before the end of two years from the date that the terrorist act occurred. Close family members are defined-and I applaud the government for this definitionas the person's partner, the person's child, the person's parent, the person's sibling or the person's legal guardian. It is important to extend eligibility for compensation to make sure that the family of the person who died is given assistance. There are often expenses associated with a person's dying. Any person who has been involved in civil litigation involving the loss of a person in, say, a car accident or an accident at work knows that this is the case. The damages specified in the other bill make some reference to the Veterans' Entitlements Act. As I explained, there is also a definition of what it means to be involved in the commission of a declared overseas terrorist act. This bill is important. It is a just bill. It brings some legal rigour and some consistency of policy and administration to the subject. It is important that we provide the assistance specified by the bill, and it surprises me that Australian governments of both political persuasions did not think about introducing a bill such as this a long time ago. I am pleased to support this bill, whose to be provisions for assistance will-I hopenever have to be called on by any Australian family suffering as so many Australian families have suffered in the past.",140
197,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," It is a privilege again to rise in this House to speak on this matter as I did on 28 February 2011 in response to the Leader of the Opposition's fine private member's bill. It is very important to acknowledge the role of the Leader of the Opposition in bringing forward this legislation today because, without his inspiration in understanding that this gap was there in Australian society and in the legislative framework in dealing with the victims of terrorism, we would not be here in this chamber today. I do commend the government for finally moving on this but, as I remarked in February 2011, there are still some significant concerns with how this will apply to the existing victims of terrorism that have been so tragically affected by those awful and terrible acts we have seen in many parts of the world in the past few years. We know that 300 Australians have died and their families are still here in Australia suffering. The Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011 is designed to help those people who are victims of events that the member for Blair outlined in speaking on the provisions of this bill. One of the concerns that we have as a coalition is is not necessarily retrospective. That is of fundamental concern and ought to be of concern to the member for Blair, who indicated his surprise that no governmentof any flavour, as he put it-had brought forward this kind of legislation before. I am surprised that we have this legislation before us today and the government is still not understanding the fundamental proposition that this is about dealing with those victims of terrorism that already exist in our society today. This is what we have identified. The Leader of the Opposition identified the suffering of those people and put forward the idea that we arrange for their circumstances to be better after suffering, through no fault of their own, these terrible acts. I do think there is a disconnect here between the government and the opposition on what this means. We, of course, want to see future terrorist acts covered, and this legislation will be a big improvement on the situation. But we do need to consider very carefully that if we do not make it retrospective or we are not clear on the retrospectivity of this legislation then it will not cover the people who have been the impetus for this very legislation coming to the House. I am a proponent of, in general, not passing retrospective law in this place where it is to somebody's detriment. But this is not about detrimentally affecting any of these people; it is about ensuring they receive and access the benefits we are providing if we pass this legislation in the House. In February 2011 the Leader of the Opposition was very clear in highlighting all of the tragic circumstances-the people remaining after the Bali incident, the communities and families that were affected-and that this legislation was coming about and his private member's bill was in relation to these people's the fact that this circumstances. The disconnect goes a little further sometimes. The member for Blair understands the law very well and was speaking about legal eagles and lawyers. But I do not really accept that this bill is essentially the same as a workers compensation proposition. I do not think it is a helpful comparison. I know he did not intend to make it, but I do not feel that that sort of assertions, that this is somehow related to workers compensation matters, is useful in this debate. In a genuine fashion I am saying that to him. This is an extraordinary piece of legislation to cover an extraordinary gap arising from an era that most Australians would not have been able to predict and that we are unable to deal with very effectively. Even with all the instrumentalities of government and even with all of the absolute right of the state to use force, we still struggle in dealing with terrorism all around the world. While our soldiers are fighting a very brave fight overseas, terrorism is a very difficult problem to solve and dealing with its consequences is a very difficult problem for us to deal with. That is why the Leader of the Opposition proposed a private member's bill that was deliberately vague in its provisions to allow the government scope to ensure that there would be maximum flexibility in its design of legislation and maximum adaptability to ensure that the benefits were received by the victims without the rigmarole or the legal approach of government. I understand in the complex world that we live in, with all of the laws that we have passed-and there are too many of them covering too many topicsthat we do have to look into every provision of every different social security bill and other arrangements to ensure that people are not penalised. But, equally, the intention of our legislation must also be clear-and that is to avoid turning this into a style of workers compensation or other matter. It is just simply to assist those people and their families who are victims of terrorism. We have heard about the amounts of money that this bill deals with. They are negligible. There is really no substantial serious impact. And while I am never lenient with taxpayers' dollars, and I never ask this place to be, this topic and the reasons and the impetus for this legislation are such that we can, I think, excuse $75,000 payments. I think they are appropriate and go some way to assisting with the very serious situation that people find themselves in. We have seen the horrific impact that terrorism does have on our citizens abroad and the ongoing horrific effect on the lives of the families here. I spoke on 28 February 2011 about this legislation and the government has now got this bill before us. While at the time. I made a point about the government criticising the private member's bill for not being technically accurate, I am still not sure why it would take that period of time to make this bill technically accurate and yet still not cover the topic of retrospectivity to cover the very victims that we are all so concerned about and that we all on both sides of this chamber want to assist. I am speaking here tonight to urge the government to continue to improve the quality of what it is doing in relation to this as quickly as humanly possible. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition will be moving amendments to this legislation. They are considered amendments with a very positive intent to improve this legislation, to ensure that the very people that are the reason for this legislation are covered by it. The government in good faith should consider carefully its approach to amendments when an opposition does come up with good ideas. This is not the kind of topic where the opposition will say: 'We got one over you. We thought of something you didn't.' This is the kind of topic where we are genuine, where the Leader of the Opposition's intention is genuine, in trying to do something about a very serious gap and a capability gap. The member for Blair spoke about his surprise about any government not doing anything. It is surprising, given the fact that terrorism came up, that no government has moved to do this and it is time for us to do it. I would urge the government to think very carefully about their approach to the amendments to ensure that we do have a very bipartisan approach to these matters and to ensure that we do accept worthy ideas for improvement. We must clarify the retrospectivity concerns and we must look at what is going to happen to these very badly affected victims who have provided the impetus for this legislation. Without too much further ado I would simply say that the original design of this was vague to allow the government scope to do it. There is nothing wrong with getting the opposition's assistance in this case and ensuring that we have a high-quality bill. Debate interrupted. NA",143
198,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, Order! I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. British Pensions,145
199,Mr SIMPKINS,ADJOURNMENT," Today I wish to raise an issue of great injustice that affects a number of people who live in the electorate of Cowan. There are around 555,000 British pensioners worldwide, half of whom live in Australia, whose British pensions are frozen. Throughout their working lives these people paid into the compulsory national insurance pension scheme. They served in Britain's armed forces during World War II, risking their lives to protect and provide security for their government, for their country and for its citizens. In return they hoped only to be entitled to secure support in their retirement when they were no longer able to provide for themselves. The injustice of which I speak is of course the policy introduced in the mid1940s by the Attlee socialist government and continued by successive governments. These pensions are frozen and were not indexed when these Britons left the UK to spend their retirement elsewhere. Often the reason for their relocation was to join their children, grandchildren and other immediate family. Incredibly, the policy lacks equality; it is selective and it is discriminatory towards those living in countries such as Australia as opposed to those who moved to the EU, the United States and other nations where British pensions are indexed. In Australia 190,000 British pensioners who are permanent residents here receive a means-tested Australian age pension to top up their unindexed British pension at an additional cost of $100 million a year to Australian taxpayers. This would not be required if the British government applied the same indexation that it has in place for Europe and the United States. The British pension is permanently frozen at the date when a person retires, or arrives in Australia; it will never be increased by the British government. This means Australia is required to increase its own rates according to the cost of living, which is affected by not only domestic factors but also international factors. Of the approximately 250,000 British age pensioners in Australia, some 190,000 are permanent residents and therefore able to access Australian support. This means that more than 60,000 British citizens who are not permanent residents in Australia are not able to receive any support at all and are left with the feeling of belonging nowhere. The lower value of the pound and the constantly increasing cost of living, all without indexation, means that around 60,000 British pensioners are struggling, with many in dire straits. This was made clear to me when I met with British pensioner Shirley De Andrade, who talked of others whose British children in Australia are obliged to help pay for their medical and pharmaceutical costs. This represents the real human outcome that the British government's policy has on families in Australia and it is an absolute outrage. I also take this opportunity to thank Don and Erica Beach for raising this issue with me, as well as those other constituents who have brought this significant problem to my attention in the past. It is true to say that there is very broad, not unanimous, support in the Australian parliament for a change to the policy of the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, none of the comments or requests had positive outcomes in the past. Recently an argument was put forward stating that the United Kingdom cannot afford to fund a re-indexation of the frozen pensions. We know, however, that even in the past there was no attempt to do the right thing and compensate British seniors justly, which is why the current economic circumstances should not be the easy way out for the current British government. British Pensions in Australia group president, Jim Tilley, and Mrs Shirley De Andrade provided me with a copy of the group's Fair Play newsletter for autumn 2012. As stated in the newsletter, the British government benefits from not having to pay the support costs for those pensioners who leave the UK, including the costs of the National Health Service and other concessions. It has been estimated that the UK budget is some â‚¤3.1 billion better off in 2012 as a result of so many expatriate pensioners living elsewhere, which the British Pensions in Australia group lists as an offset to the cost of re-indexing their British pensions. The trouble is that the British Treasury already takes that benefit, resulting in their perception of re-indexation as being a cost to them. This is about justice and fairness. It is wrong that the level of the support that your homeland provides to you is influenced by where you live. It is unfair on the individual and it is unfair on Australian taxpayers who end up subsidising the UK's failure to carry out its responsibilities. I note that the British Pensions in Australia group has suggested the reindexation begin with those over the age of 85-those who have been hit hardest by this if terrible policy and were a part of the war effort in World War II. This suggestion really puts the situation into focus by showing the sorts of people who are affected by this policy. We are talking about people who faced the most difficult situation during the war years but nevertheless made a contribution to ensure that the following generations are not forced to endure the same. They suffered then and they are suffering now, which highlights the injustice of this policy. In the Fair Play newsletter Jim Tilley makes the point that, if the pensions had been unfrozen over the last 15 years, more pensioners would have left Britain or would not have been forced to return, saving the British government some â‚¤30 billion pounds. The situation is clear. The British government should acknowledge the contributions that these people made to their country and index their pensions rather than let the taxpayers of Australia and other countries pick up the load for its intransigence. The situation is not just. The UK government should right this wrong now. Education Funding",145
200,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT,"Blair) (21:35) With approximately a doubling of funding for education in this country, with new and improved school infrastructure, with new libraries and halls, with more computers in schools than ever before, with extra funding to assist national partnership arrangements and with numeracy and literacy and the like, this federal Labor government has done more to assist schools in this country and the lot of school children than any other government has ever done before. But we did ask Mr David Gonski AC and his group of experts to lead the first national review into school funding in almost 40 years. His report was very clear. He said funding in relation to our schools is illogical, lacks transparency and is not focused on achieving the best results. Recent results show that Australia has slipped from second to internationally in reading and from fifth to 13th in maths, and one in seven Australian students is at risk of not achieving the levels they need to participate in the 21st-century workforce. That is why the Minister for School Education, the Hon. Peter Garrett, has commissioned Mr Gonski to go ahead with further modelling. But what Mr Gonski has already come up with does assist schools in my electorate. The modelling he has come up with recommends the introduction of a schooling resource standard with a set investment per student and with additional top-up on a needs basis for disadvantaged students, low-SES students, students with disabilities and Indigenous school students. The government has said it wants to legislate a model that will assist in the future. I urge the government to implement Gonski lock, stock and barrel. Three-quarters of the underfunding in this country is in state schools. Recently I attended the combined meeting of the Queensland Teachers Union for the Moreton branch, covering from Brisbane through Ipswich and into the Lockyer and Brisbane valleys, at Brothers Leagues Club in Ipswich, at the request of Steve Leese, the Queensland Teachers Union organiser. I talked with the teachers about Gonski and the impact and what they can do to agitate and irritate government at all levels in relation to this particular issue. I urged the people of Ipswich and Somerset in March 2012, when the Parliamentary Secretary for Education, Senator Jacinta Collins, came to Ipswich, to get on board and made sure that parents, staff and teachers got behind the Gonski review. Senator Collins attended my old primary school, Ipswich East State School and Staines Memorial College, an independent Christian school in Redbank Plains. Information I have received from the seventh Queensland Teachers Union and the Australian Education Union indicates that my electorate would receive about $1,500 extra per student with enrolment figures taken from the 2011 MySchool website. Toogoolawah State School, in my electorate, would therefore receive an extra $269,000; Rosewood State High School, another $829,500; Ipswich State High, $1.6 million; my old high school, Bundamba State Secondary College, about $1.27 million; Bundamba State School, nearly $900,000; Redbank Plains State School, about $1.145 million; and Redbank Plains State High School-where the Ipswich and Western Corridor community cabinet will take place-about $1.85 million. I am not quite sure that those figures are exactly accurate, but that is what the Australian Education Union and the Queensland Teachers Union tell me in relation to the approach that Mr Gonski and his review committee of experts have taken. If that is the case, my electorate would receive considerable assistance via the implementation of the Gonski review. I have received information from Llew Paulger, the principal at Redbank Plains State High School, who said to me: The impact Gonski would have on our community would be truly transformational for our students, our local community and, if this was replicated across Australia, for our country in the world economy. The same thing is said by Mr Lee Gerchow, the principal of Leichhardt State School, who School made the point that the provision of continued additional funding under the Gonski recommendations would not only enable the continuation and sustainability of proven programs of improvement and success but also enable further things to develop. Both these respected school principals in this community are to be listened to. I urge the government to implement Gonski. (Time expired) Agriculture",146
201,Mr HAASE,ADJOURNMENT," I stand here this evening to bring some news to this House, and that is in relation to agriculture Western Australia. Many members of this House that are informed about the nature and wealth of agriculture in Australia would believe that the state of agriculture is dependent upon the weather and if it rains all will be well and agriculturalists, broadacre farmers in particular, will be well rewarded with a reduction of their indebtedness to banks. I rise this evening to squash that illusion. Especially in the seat of Durack in Western Australia-and I speak specifically about the broadacre farming area of the midwest and the Central Wheat Belt-as the seasons go by, currently we see a reduction of population, we see an increase of acreage owned by one entity and we see, because of pessimism about the outlook for agriculture in Western Australia, a reduction in value of hectare of agricultural land. Each year that goes by regardless of whether the seasons are average or good, because of the assessment of the value of properties, the encroachment of the entity on the indebtedness to the banks is reduced. For instance, from last year to this year we have had a reduction from about $900 per hectare in the Central Wheat Belt to a mere $600 per hectare. Farmers work hard, they plan well and they do the right thing, and yet their equity in their property is reduced because they cannot get ahead due to the pessimism in the agricultural industry. I do not know how we turn this around, but I bring to the attention of the House the fact that, even if seasons are good, agriculturalists and broadacre farmers in Western Australia are falling behind. It would be a surprise to the House, I believe, to know that the enrolments in UWA, the University of Western Australia, in agricultural science this year were a mere 15 bodies. In law, by contrast, there were 800. I put it to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that Australia-which survived on agriculture in and rode on the sheep's back-is heading for a fall if we keep believing that agriculture is going to continue to be our salvation. It is not. As properties amalgamate, as the population reduces, as children are forced to the city because of a lack of infrastructure in the bush, and as they decide to take up city jobs and not return to rural areas to become farmers and take over from their fathers, so the whole environment suffers. Sporting clubs suffer. The education system suffers, because schools are invariably closed as the population reduces and children have to travel more miles to get to a centre for a satisfactory education especially in secondary education. We have moved now to a year 7 start for secondary education. This is unacceptable. We have children now, authorised under the state government system, to travel an hour and a half each way each day for secondary education. It is unsatisfactory. We have reduction in the whole community environment. We have reduction in volunteerism-and, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, you would know full well that volunteers are the glue that keeps communities together. I bring to the attention of the House this evening that agriculture is not going to be sustained in this country unless central government realises that agriculture needs a lift. I do not want charity, but those in agriculture need to be recognised for the value that they have in looking after the land of this great nation and being the best rural land managers that we could ever have. We cannot afford to ignore them. I suggest that the government ought to be more considerate of- (Time expired) Housing Affordability",148
202,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to express my bitter disappointment in the New South Wales Liberal government's recent decision to raise the of public housing for local pensioners. New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell has used the federal government's decision to compensate pensioners for the predicted rise in the cost of living as an excuse to raise rents for public housing tenants. As a result, from March next year pensioners will be paying significantly more in public housing rents. We all know that pensioners are one of the groups in our community that need support and financial assistance the most. This is why we have implemented the historic increases in pensions, starting with the first pension increase in 12 years, in 2009. Since then, pensions have steadily increased, with pensioners receiving an extra $338 a year. In addition, more than 27,600 pensioners in my electorate alone recently received an advance payment of $250. This payment was intended to assist pensioners with the costs of living resulting from the Clean Energy Initiative and to ensure that pensioners are adequately compensated as we make the transition to a less carbon-reliant and more sustainable economy. With an expected $204 increase to the cost of living, Fowler pensioners would be $134 a year better off as a result of the recent cost-of-living pension supplement. Pensioners have the least room to move when it comes to managing their costs. These pension increases were intended to give pensioners a little extra breathing space. The federal government encouraged all state and territory governments not to include pension increases in public housing rent calculations. That is why we distributed the recent increase in the form of a separate supplement and wrote to each state premier asking them to leave pensioners alone. The O'Farrell government is now the only government in Australia that has decided to ignore the reasons for the adjustment and cost disregard the needs of its own pensioners living in public housing. Barry O'Farrell is simply trying to claw back money from pensioners into his state coffers, and this selfish move will certainly be felt by those in our community who are struggling to make ends meet. There are 3,500 pensioners in Fowler living in public housing, one of the highest numbers in New South Wales. My electorate will therefore be one of the most affected by the New South Wales Liberal government's decision to once again siphon off pension increases into the state government's revenue. This is not the first time the Liberal government has betrayed New South Wales pensioners living in public housing. When the federal government increased pensions for the first time in 12 years back in 2009, it took the incoming Liberal government only six months to renege on the agreement with the Commonwealth not to increase the public housing tenancy rents. As a result of the state government's decision, more than 20,000 pensioners in New South Wales, including more than 1,720 war veterans and war widows, are now paying an extra $618 per year. The most recent decision to raise public housing costs will add another $84.50 a year to the rents of people living in public housing. This is money our pensioners can least afford to pay. Pensioners in public housing in New South Wales already pay 25 per cent of their pensions as rent. Barry O'Farrell needs to explain himself. He needs to explain to the pensioners of New South Wales why he has decided it is necessary to take away extra money that they so desperately need-pensioners such as Mrs Eileen Strickland of Cabramatta, who spoke to me only last week, asking how this could happen, because the Commonwealth increase was a non-taxable cost-of-living supplement. They are important payments to support pensioners as part of our clean energy housing assistance package. These payments will support public housing tenants in their adjustments to the cost-of-living impact from a carbon price. The increased payments were intended to assist pensioners in New South Wales. They are not there to assist Barry O'Farrell in furthering the interests of his state Liberal government. Grandparents",149
203,Mr CROOK,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to speak about some very special people in Australia who deserve the respect, commitment and support of our government and community-people who I believe are being continually let down by the buckpassing of successive state and federal governments. The special people I am referring to are those grandparents who have assumed the role of primary caregiver for their grandchildren, also referred to as 'grandcarers'. Over the last year and a half, have met with many grandcarers in my electorate. These grandcarers have come to be primary caregivers for a range of complex family reasons, including death, mental illness, substance abuse, incarceration or neglect. Despite a varied family background, these grandparents have one thing in common: an unwavering dedication and commitment to and love for their grandchildren, which exists notwithstanding the lack of proper financial support from the government. One such inspirational family lives in Albany, in my electorate of O'Connor. This constituent is a proud grandmother of 23 grandchildren and great-grandmother of four great-grandchildren. Sadly, one of the constituent's daughters has a serious substance abuse problem and was no longer capable of looking after her son. When my constituent heard that her grandson was being left in a room with marijuana smoke and being fed painkillers to be kept quiet, she went directly to the house and rescued him. On the day she arrived, her eight-month-old grandson's nappy had not been changed for a lengthy period of time. The child was underweight and suffered from serious malnutrition. He is now four years old. My constituent, who is on a disability pension, lives in a one-bedroom house with her husband. In recent years, they have been forced to use their lounge room as the bedroom for their grandson. These grandparents manage the various behavioural difficulties which stem from his challenging childhood, which include a severe case of separation anxiety. Despite the grandfather being well due for retirement, he continues to work to financially provide for the young child. This income negatively affects my constituent's disability pension; however, they have no other option. These grandcarers point out that if their grandson was being I cared for by foster parents, those carers would receive regular payments. Family tax benefits A and B amount to $170 per week for this family, and this is simply not enough. Many other grandcarers are unable to get either legal guardianship, or formal consent orders from their children, leaving them without any Centrelink support at all. Since meeting with many other families who are part of the vibrant network of grandcarers in Western Australia, I have been lobbying both state and federal governments to improve support for grandcarers. I have written to state and federal ministers, as well as to the Premier of Western Australia. Sadly, all responses have been empty and have been indicative of the buck-passing that continues to leave grandcarers unsupported. For example, in response to my most recent letter to the responsible federal minister, the minister stated: Primary responsibility for supporting children, who cannot live with their birth parents, including grandparent care, lies with the state and territory governments. In response to my most recent letter to the responsible state minister, the minister referred to my request for proper financial support to grandcarers and said, 'Such decisions are the responsibility of the Commonwealth government.' responses showed warm words of concern but no commitment to policy change. I note the member for Canning's statement in this place on this topic in March last year. However, no progress has been made since that time. Government has done very little to address the significant financial as well as non-financial challenges grandcarers face, despite the federal minister calling this issue a 'national priority'. There are various aspects of the current system which should be improved. For example, the current framework distinguishes between informal and formal care arrangements, to the detriment of unique grandcaring roles. The current rules do not acknowledge the difficulties grandparents may face in establishing their eligibility for traditional benefit payments. Many grandparents are beyond working age and are simply unaware of the entitlements. I note that in late 2010 six grandparent advisers were established Centrelink. However, given there are 16,000 families identified by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as having grandcarers, this is unlikely to have any real impact. Thankfully, some community organisations, like the WA based Wanslea Grandcare program, work hard to fill the role that our government should be filling, and I thank them. I also wish to send my deepest thanks to the many grandcarers who have shared their personal stories with me. I believe these grandcarers should be held in at least the same financial category as foster carers. They should not have to spend their hard-earned retirement funds on raising their grandchildren. It must be a joint effort to ensure appropriate assistance to these grandcarers, and the funding models must be flexible enough to deliver these results. Our grandcarers must be supported. (Time expired) Child Beauty Pageants These",150
204,Ms HALL,ADJOURNMENT," Earlier this year I moved a private member's motion in relation to children's beauty pageants. I note, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, you also spoke on the motion and feel equally as passionate about this issue as I do. Universal Royalty Beauty Pageant is the organisation that has been holding these pageants both in Melbourne and, more recently, in Sydney. At the weekend, on Saturday, 16 June, Universal Royalty Beauty Pageant snuck into Sydney and held a children's beauty pageant. There was no advertising and it was held in the utmost secrecy. If this is such a wonderful thing, why would they sneak into town and why would they not tell anyone about it? The US based Universal Royalty Beauty Pageant featured on the US TV show Toddlers and Tiaras. I think most members are aware of it. When it was in Melbourne last year, there was much criticism from the through community. It led Darebin City Council to review their venue hire policy and refuse to host further child beauty pageants. That is what I would like to see throughout Australia: councils and organisations refusing to host these pageants. Despite the outrage last year, the pageant was again held last weekend, in Sydney. The pageants encourage and require children to make themselves up in a adult manner, requiring make-up and recommending fake tanning and hairpieces. There are two issues here. One is that these pageants teach children to value their appearance above all else from a very young age. Self-worth is intrinsically based on appearance. The pageants distort children's perceptions of themselves. They are celebrated and rewarded for creating a fake and highly stylised image of themselves, often with the photos being retouched. Emphasis on looks and physical attractiveness can lead to negative body image, anxiety, low self-esteem, depression and eating disorders. These effects can last throughout a young person's life. Secondly, these beauty pageants sexualise and objectify children as they conform to adult perceptions of beauty and behaviour. Fake tanning, waxing, fake eyelashes, hairpieces and make-up are beauty treatments and devices used by grown women and are inappropriate for little girls to use to achieve a narrow, adult, beauty standard. I think it verges on child abuse. It is totally unnatural for a young child. It is natural for young children to dress up in their mother's clothing, put make-up on-with lipstick all over their face-but it is not natural for a young child to be trained to perform in one of these beauty pageants. Glenn Cupit, senior lecturer in child development at the University of South Australia, believes the young pageant participants are instructed to dress and behave in an adult way. He said: The title is 'child beauty pageant' but if you look at the way the children are dressed and required to act, it's actually a child sexualisation pageant. The children are put into skimpy clothes, they are taught to do bumps and grinds. It's not looking at children's beauty. It's a particular idea of what beauty is, which is based on a highly sexualised understanding of female beauty. This is something that as a parliament we should condemn. What is being created here is a generation of young girls who are going to have a plethora of psychological and social problems. We have a chance to say that this is not good enough. There are so many myths around beauty pageants, such as they help young people to develop selfconfidence, when in actual fact they have the opposite effect. These beauty pageants stand condemned and all members of this parliament should join together in condemning them. (Time expired) Victorian Earthquake Dunkley Electorate: Centrelink Australian Paralympic Team",151
205,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT," A little over an hour ago a seismic event of 5.2 occurred some 160 kilometres south-east of Melbourne near the Moe community-a significant tremor lasting about 20 seconds and recorded at 10 kilometres below the earth's surface. I know it has been felt in Gippsland, in your community, Madam Deputy Speaker Anna Burke, and in mine, and all the way around to the western suburbs of Melbourne. There have been no reports of injury or damage at this stage but there are plenty of people with shaken nerves wondering what was going on. For the community I represent, with the Selwyn Fault running through South Frankston and part of the geological formation of Olivers Hill, it was certainly of particular interest. Our thoughts are with all those responding to anxious calls in the hope that there is no injury or substantial damage. Our thoughts are with our fellow citizens of Victoria. It reminded me of the flood events in Victoria. The response which the Commonwealth government provided was quite commendable. It saw a number of Centrelink staff redeployed from around various offices. At that time the Frankston Centrelink office, one of the busiest in the country, had to forgo its pensions, carers age services on the ground floor of the building with which I am a co-tenant, along with others. We were told that was a temporary measure but it has never come back. The age pension, carer and disability community relied heavily on that more convenient mode of access in that discreet designated area where the Centrelink staff was most attuned to their needs and able to respond to queries of variations in income and the like, and these, which could have been routinely provided in a simple way, have now been bundled in with Centrelink's heavy workload upstairs at the Davey Street Centrelink centre. I would like to see that service returned. I have inquired repeatedly about when it is likely to return but it is looking less temporary as the days go by. I know that the electorate that I represent and the clients that very much valued the team on the ground floor at Davey Street are very keen to see it returned, as am I. I hope I some answers shortly about the fate of that service. I also rise to take the opportunity to wish those Paralympians who are heading off to the London games all the very best. I would like to be able to say that all of the Paralympians know who they are, but many teams have not been selected yet and that is causing great distress for the families and those wishing to support their loved ones in what for many is the pinnacle of their success in dealing with the life challenges that disability has presented them with. I know, for instance, that the swimming team participated in the 2012 swimming trials. The Olympic and Paralympic event was held in Adelaide between 15 and 22 March, and by all accounts it was a fabulous occasion. Over 750 swimmers participated and more than 80 swimmers were those with a disability. There was a fitting tribute at the end of that meet where the Olympic team and was announced and paraded before the crowd that had assembled but, sadly, the Paralympian team was not afforded that same accommodation. That was emotionally difficult for the Paralympians; they were thrilled to be able to participate in a joint trial but then discouraged from full involvement at the end of that meet when those on the Olympic team were afforded a great deal of attention. The Paralympians just wished that the equality of treatment they had received throughout the meet had extended to the selection of the team. The team still has not been selected. The games are some four weeks away. They will be in a position of a short window of time in which to make their arrangements and for parents to secure tickets through an authorised ticketing agency which, for the Australian Paralympic team, involves a bundled package of accommodation as well. It seems a shame that the arrangements for get an orderly preparation for such a sporting event is quite different for the Olympic and Paralympic teams. I note that in that qualification meet there were quite a number of records achieved, and I want to put them on the record. They were from Matthew Cowdrey for the 50metre freestyle, Timothy Antalfy for the 100metre freestyle, Brenden Hall for the 400metre freestyle, Timothy Antalfy again for the 50-metre backstroke, Blake Cochrane in both the 50-metre and 100-metre breaststrokes, Timothy Antalfy again for the 50-metre and 100-metre butterflies, Jacqueline Freney for the 100-metre women's freestyle and Prue Watt for the 50metre backstroke. They deserve greater consideration. All of those events where world championship records were broken were undertaken before the broadcast time had commenced. I would like to think the preparations for the broadcasters for the Olympics and Paralympics have a greater balance of coverage. Mental Health",152
206,Ms RISHWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to talk about a very important issue that I think all governments need to make sure they are paying attention to: tackling mental health in our community. Before I came into this place I worked as a psychologist, and during that time. I saw some very sad stories about the impact that mental health issues have on individuals and their families. That is why I was extremely pleased to join the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing to open the new headspace site at Noarlunga, right in the heart of my electorate. This sits nestled in the middle of a GP superclinic which is providing excellent services to the local area, but the headspace is a new, special space that will be dedicated to helping those young people with a mental health issue. We know that for a lot of people mental health issues start very young, and I think it is very important that we recognise this and make sure that we have services in the community to tackle this. That is why I have been a very big fan of the headspace centres around the country; I think they provide a very youth-friendly environment for young people not to feel isolated and not to feel like they are walking into something that does not really meet their needs, does not suit them or is not somewhere they feel comfortable. That is why I was so pleased to see the Noarlunga headspace up and running and to see the wonderful, comfortable area that staff and all the consortium partners have done a great job in making very welcoming. I would like to take this opportunity to particularly thank the youth reference group. Headspace sites, one of the important parts of the model, are ensuring that young people are directly involved. This is not older people telling young people what they need; it is young people really driving the service and determining what they need. I was very pleased to meet some of the very enthusiastic members of the youth reference group in Adelaide and at Noarlunga, and I have to say they really were incredibly commendable. Many of these young people had been through mental health issues and they had got themselves in a position where they wanted to give back. This shows real, impressive courage on the part of these young people to ensure that they are a service that may not have been there for them but is now there for other people. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the consortium partners, because another model of headspace is not that it is just one organisation delivering services. This is about a number of services getting together because, of course, headspaces do not just look at mental illness in isolation. One of the things I certainly found while I was practising as a psychologist is that there are silos put up on services. That might be clinical services for mental health that will not take people with drug and alcohol issues or people with health issues. People are constantly referred around the place and not dealt with in a very holistic way. I think one of the great things about headspace is that they do deal with a range of different issues, including physical health, mental health and vocational training and education-helping young people find the right study path, the right education or the right job for them-as well as looking at a whole range of other issues that they might be facing. That is why these models are very exciting, because you have a number of different partners. I would like particularly congratulate the Southern Adelaide-FleurieuKangaroo Island Medicare Local which is the lead agency. It is joined by the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, known as CAMHS, the Women's and Children's Health Network, Southern Second Story Youth Health, CRS Australia, Mind Australia, the Southern Adelaide Local Health Network and Uniting Communities Streetlink Youth Health Service. A number of different organisations are coming together, and this service will be really welcomed in our local area. On the day I opened it there had already been many young people using the service. A lot of people walked into see what was there, because it is so inviting. I am very, very pleased to have committed this at the 2010 election, and now that it has been delivered in my community.

There will be morning tea and lunch, again, provided to the community free of charge as a community event to inform, to provide services and to send the message that we care about our seniors and that it is important to get information to them. This is an opportunity in a one-stop shop to come along and see, hear, learn, listen, engage and enjoy. I welcome all senior Australians in the northern Gold Coast community to come along on 1 August 2012 from 9 am to 2.30 pm to the Jupiter's Pavilion, Parkland Showground, on the corner of Smith Street and Parklands Drive, Parklands. At the very least, can I say that it is an amazing treat spending a day with the legendary Normie Rowe, having him sing the national anthem, MC the day and having him available to chat with. It is a real treat and experience. I look forward to welcoming all Gold Coasters there. MCEwen Electorate: Queen's Birthday Honours",155
208,Mr MITCHELL,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to congratulate Peter Weeks from Alexandra, who was awarded an OAM in the General Division for services to communities in the upper Goulburn region, particularly during the 2009 Victorian bushfires. Peter's long-term dedication and commitment to communities within the region is amply demonstrated by the many volunteer positions he has taken on, especially as a member of the Alexandra unit of the Victoria SES for more than 40 years, including 25 years as its communications officer and duty officer. He has brought extraordinary energy, expertise and effort to emergency service bodies across the municipalities of Murrindindi, Mansfield and Benalla through grassroots organisations such as the Acheron Fire Brigade through to regional bodies. In working to improve communications for residents and emergency service bodies in roles such as the regional coordinator for the Wireless Institute Civil Emergency Network for 22 years and as technical officer for Mansfield Community Radio for 10 years, combined with outstanding initiative as a founding committee member of Upper Golden Community Radio Incorporated, Peter has helped to provide fantastic new opportunities for information-sharing across many levels for the benefit of many communities. David MCGahy, the Arthurs Creek CFA captain, was awarded an OAM for his services in the 2009 Victorian bushfires. David 's deep-held commitment to his community is evident through his membership of the Arthurs Creek Fire Brigade since 1965-that was before I was born-which has included many executive positions, including captain for 12 years. David has served the wider region admirably through executive participation in the Whittlesea-Diamond Valley Fire Brigades Group and the Nillumbik Municipal Fire Prevention Committee. This is also recognised and greatly appreciated across the district. Small communities rely heavily on willing, dedicated volunteers such as David, who has given his time and efforts to a number of local organisations such as the Arthurs Creek Mechanics Institute hall for 20 years, including 10 years as president; the Strathewen Oval Committee for five years; the Arthurs Creek Primary School Council for 11 years; the Arthurs Creek Landcare Group; and the Strathewen Tennis Club. Roger Jones of Gisborne was awarded an OAM in the General Division. Roger's wideranging service to the community includes executive roles with many emergency service organisations and extraordinary commitment and dedication to the community. Roger has worked at a high level over many years, including at some extremely difficult times. His involvement has included the South Pacific Geoscience Commission High-Level Advocacy Team and the Royal Humane Society of Australasia, as well as local bodies such as the Macedon Ranges Further Education Centre, the Mount Macedon Memorial Cross Committee of Management and Macedon Ranges Shire Council. Jane Hayward from Kinglake was awarded an AM in the General Division of the Order of Australia for services to the community of the Strathewen area, particularly to the school kids and their families in the aftermath of the Victorian bushfires. As principal of Strathewen Primary School, which was destroyed in the Black Saturday bushfires-and the community totally devastated-Jane played a central role in all aspects of the relocation, rebuilding and reopening of the school. Jane showed extraordinary dedication, compassion and courage in assisting the highly traumatised community in its efforts to recover and rebuild from a seemingly impossible situation. From personal experience I know that the wider community is very pleased to have Jane working with them, and is also extremely proud of her and her work. Jane has made an enormous effort to help the Strathewen community through the most distressing times. I also want to congratulate Kevin and Rhonda Butler-they are husband and wife-who each received an OAM for their assistance as founders of BlazeAid in the aftermath of the 2009 bushfires. They got together 3,200 volunteers to do over 500 kilometres of fencing for farmers and shows landowners affected by the bushfires. Their contribution to communities across Victoria then extended to communities in Queensland and Western Australia during 2011-12 after the devastating floods. It was fantastic to see that the nature of assistance BlazeAid provided widened to match the community's needs including repair of structures and clearing debris and fallen trees. I also want to acknowledge Cameron Caine. He was the Liberal candidate for MCEwen at the last election. He received an OAM because of the work he had done in the Kinglake community during the bushfires. His courageous and selfless efforts to help residents find a path through the bushfires to a safe refuge were truly worthy of recognition. His continuing efforts to assist those in the most traumatic and difficult of tasks, including identifying many friends who had perished, showed an unfathomable fortitude. By helping to revive his beloved Kinglake Football Club and lift it to grand final level, Cameron helped provide his community with the opportunity for strong emotional bonds through healthy activity at a time when they needed it most. I also want to congratulate Russell Bate from Jamieson. He was awarded an OAM in the General Division. It is an honour to acknowledge the service Russell has given to the community through extensive roles in a range of sporting and arts organisations and to local government. (Time expired) Education",156
209,Mr TUDGE,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to speak on raising the bar in education. In this Olympic year as we see countries vie to be the best in sport I want say: why not in education? Our country has been prosperous, free and harmonious for such a long time that our children should be at the top. Unfortunately, while we excel in sport, in education we are one of only a few countries that has declined in standards in recent years both in an absolute sense as well as relative to other countries. We are no longer in the top band of performers but have been overtaken by our Asian neighbours, four of which are now in the top five of the world's best performing school systems: Hong Kong, Shanghai, Korea and Singapore. Students from those systems are considerably ahead in some key areas. For example, in Shanghai the average 15-year-old mathematics student performing at a level two to three years, on average, above his or her counterpart in Australia. In science the average 15-year-old is 15 months ahead of Australian students and in reading is about 13 months ahead. Similarly in Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea 15-year-old students are now a year in advance of Australian students in mathematics and about half a year in front in science and reading. As the Prime Minster reminds us, we are entering the Asian century yet we are not keeping up with their education standards. Australia is not alone in this regard, although this should not give us comfort. The UK and the US are in a similar position to us. The difference, however, is how these countries are approaching the challenge, particularly the United Kingdom. The UK has deliberately set out to match the best performing school systems, particularly in relation to curriculum standards. Through the draft curriculum the British Conservatives led by education secretary, Michael Gove, and Minister of State for Schools, Nick Gibb, have explicitly set the standards to be taught by reference to the best performing school to systems in the world. They also reintroduced back-to-basics principles such as learning times tables and a narrative approach to history. For example, in maths their draft curriculum document, which was released last week, states that pupils will be expected to add, subtract, multiply and divide fractions at a similar standard to what is expected in Singapore and Hong Kong. By the age of nine pupils should know their times tables up to 12 times 12. It is currently only to 10 times 10, but the higher level is in keeping with the high-performing jurisdiction in Massachusetts. In English, students will be taught to read is fluently through systemic phonics with a stronger emphasis on reading for pleasure. There will be a focus on spelling, which includes a list of words that all children should be able to spell by the end of primary school. There will be a stronger emphasis on grammar and the learning of poetry once again. The UK is changing the look of history classes as well. Children will be expected learn significant dates, events and the names of important historical figures. Instead of forcing cultural relativism on schools, teachers will also be expected to introduce children to the grand narrative that distinguishes the UK from other countries and cultures. Key institutions and the importance of Western civilisation and the nation's Judeo-Christian heritage are emphasised, as is the need to instil civic responsibility and to teach values like reciprocity and a commitment to the common good. These are all positive developments and indicate a strong desire to ensure that UK students can perform as well as students from other countries. We should be taking a similar approach in relation to our curriculum. Importantly, we should be benchmarking our national curriculum against the curriculum of our near neighbours to ensure that our standards are not falling behind. We should also be learning from what the UK is doing so that universities and employers can have confidence that grammar, spelling and basic maths concepts are well understood upon leaving school. I have written about our history curriculum in the past and about how earlier drafts failed to mention basic institutions which have made Australia prosperous and free or acknowledge our western JudaeoChristian heritage. Without glossing over past mistakes, our Westminster system of government affords us a proud tradition of democracy, individual freedom and human rights. A history curriculum should reflect this. The Rudd-Gillard government promised an education revolution but it has not delivered. Under ALP governments, state and federal, schools have often been forced to to adopt a curriculum based on lower standards and that ignores the basics and preaches a politically correct view of the world. We need to do better. Parents deserve to know that their children are learning at the highest standards. Employers want to know that students are graduating with solid literacy, numeracy and analytical skills, and higher education institutions do not want to have to provide remedial courses. The UK has set its sights to reach the top. We should be doing likewise. Melbourne Ports Electorate: Caulfield Village",158
210,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT," Today's Financial Review reports that the $1 billion Caulfield Racecourse development will take up to 10 years to complete. Approved by the Victorian state Liberal Minister for Planning, Matthew Guy, in June 2011, this development, a crass monstrosity, is in the very heart of my electorate. Caulfield, with its various delis, bakeries, schools, bars, restaurants and parks, will be completely engulfed by a skyline not unfamiliar to those venturing into the canyons of the city of Melbourne. These disruptive planning developments impinge on the nature and identity of the quiet residential streets of Caulfield. Frankly, this $1 billion so-called Caulfield Village is over the top, does not have enough open space and will eventually turn the area into a desolate slum like the overdeveloped parts of the Gold Coast. During the 2010 election, the Liberal candidate for Caulfield, David Southwick, told a Liberal rally at Caulfield Park Pavilion that the proposed development of Caulfield Racecourse and its surrounding areas-in developers' newspeak, the Caulfield Village with its 20-storey tower-was a 'monstrosity that would destroy Caulfield's amenities and identity'. But, after the election, Mr Southwick changed his tune, lauding the $1 billion Caulfield development. The member for Caulfield in the Baillieu government should be embarrassed by this reversal. Despite the concerns of local residents and the revelation today that the project will building site for 10 years, the state Liberals have approved this project. Many locals have spoken out against it, concerned that the ugly Caulfield Village will fundamentally change the nature of the suburb. This development will be built on a fivehectare car park adjacent to the racecourse and will attract 2,000 residents and burden the area with 35,000 square metres of office and retail space. Presumably, on race days, even more cars will be pushed onto residential streets due to the lack of the spaces they now use in that car park, which was gifted to the Melbourne Racing Club. This represents a huge loss of open space in the area adjacent to the Caulfield Racecourse. With plans by the Victorian government to cut the number of car spaces allocated to new apartment blocks, this development will cause further traffic chaos for an area already overcrowded with cars. Where will the race crowd park when the parking spaces that are already there are converted into a new precinct? This area is already known for traffic congestion due to the Caulfield train station being directly across from the racecourse and Monash University's Caulfield campus, which houses over 1,300 students, being located mainly on the other side of the train track but nonetheless causing lots of traffic congestion in the area. Caulfield Racecourse is already under construction with a $1.8 million revamp in its infield parking space. The proposed so called Caulfield Village, far from being like Elwood Village, which by contrast has lowrise residential buildings, will fundamentally change the suburb. Caulfield will be transformed with the active support of conservative state members and councillors aligned to them and approved by the man agitating to replace the comatose Mr Baillieu, Matthew Guy, the state Liberal be a Minister for Planning. Mr Guy, along with his offsider, Mr Southwick, in conjunction with the mysterious machinations of the Melbourne Racing Club, have greenlit a project that will be characterised by traffic gridlock and prolonged construction et cetera. Why the Victorian government and the Glen Eira council are continuing the privilege and sweetheart deal with the Melbourne Racing Club is beyond me. Do the quiet streets of Caulfield really need to have a virtual half-casino development with all of the traffic, drunkenness and loutish behaviour that will be attendant to such a development? The Liberal government has had the habit of giving the green light to various planning developments in my electorate, including several in St Kilda and Albert Park. As the state member for Albert Park, Martin Foley, has stated, the Victorian Liberal government is seeking to turn parts of our electorate into their version of the tawdry Surfers Paradise. The Liberal government has approved a massive 26-storey, 272-apartment building in St Kilda and took the decision away from the City of Port Phillip against the wishes of the local community. As Mr Foley has said, the Baillieu government has paved the way for developers to plan high-rise buildings in the heart of St Kilda's residential areas. Now Mr Guy, the man who would like to replace Mr Baillieu, and his friend Mr Southwick, who probably will be rewarded with a ministry for his support for Mr Guy, are paving the way for skyrises in Caulfield.",159

In response to at the end, around savings for the Tasmanian made it clear that we are going to have to find level of discussion I have been I want to deal in some more detail with though. The shadow minister has picked up on with a report that had some publicity over the background. Firstly, the government introduced which we think better reflected particularly those needs than the previous system did. RCS, which had been in place for some years. trials and engagement with the sector, the expectation that there would be significant years while people were moved from the old better reflection of high needs. I think the above indexation-in the years following ACFI more than six per cent per-resident growth historical trend of around two requested a one-month delay to the ACFI the Grant Thornton report of this month.

And, Minister, drawing you back to the to the question of whether or not you have regarding the requirement for the Department the $325 million committed to the Tasmanian Social Inclusion, Minister for Mental Health Minister on Mental Health Reform) (18:54): I in five minutes, and I can deal with some of them the first point that the shadow minister reiterated program, I think the Minister for Health has money for that. As to beyond that, that is the involved in about that issue. the changes to the aged-care funding instrument, some particular speculation by Grant Thornton last several days, and this requires a bit of a new aged-care funding instrument in 2008 high needs of residents but also better reflected That was the Resident Classification Scale, the When we did that, after significant clinical budget-the forward estimates-reflected our frailty growth per resident for a period of some RCS system to the ACFI system because of that per-resident growth in real terms-so over and was in the order of six per cent or a little bit over and above indexation. That compares to the per cent real growth under the RCS. There was always the expectation that after the growth in care subsidies per resident, in of around two per cent plus indexation, so in cent per-resident growth in subsidies. In knows, it became apparent that funding for started to taper off in the way that was expected clear in the MYEFO statement with an upward element of the program of around $2.3 billion billion over the five-year period that we have Living Better program. The government indicated that the frailty growth, or the growth in per-resident return to the historical trend of around two November or December or whenever MYEFO was, there was an expectation that frailty growth as being the case when ACFI was introduced monitoring group that included provider have engaged Grant Thornton in the recent to advise on what was happening out there in growth. That group has been working for some time. I want to be clear on this, because there impact of our changes. The forward estimates, about $3.2 billion in additional ACFI funding before the MYEFO in December, and $1.6 billion-so aged-care providers-has been redirected under But funding under ACFI will be higher by December. Now it is very clear on our modelling in real terms each year over the next five years, the introduction of the new ACFI. It will be 2.3 terms if you include the conditional adjustment ACFI redirection of $1.6 billion.

That was made revision of aged-care expenditure for this over the forward estimates, or around $3.2 been using in discussing the Living Longer, that that upward revision already assumed subsidies, from 2012-13 onward would per cent.
