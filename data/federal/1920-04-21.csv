2,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Has the Prime Minister yet decided 'how long Parliament shall adjourn during the visit of the Prince of Wales?,19
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Las t week the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) towealth put into my hand a question on the subassisted byject, which, answering offhand, I misapprehended, and apparently consented to an adjournment over the whole period of the Prince's stay in Australia. I had no intention to do that, and, by leave of the House, I shall take an early opportunity to make a general statement on the subject. PROSPECTING: GERMAN NEW GUINEA.",19
4,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"In view of the statement which has appeared in the press during the past few clays regarding the development of Papua and German New Guinea in the matter of oil production, I ask the Minister if he will give permits to Australian prospectors to 3eek for gold and other metals in German New Guinea ?  granted to any one until our mandate in regard to German New Guinea has been finally settled. Whatever may be done then will be a inatter of policy. COASTAL SHIPPING SHORTAGE.",19
5,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"As there is a shortage of shipping on the Australian coast I desire to ask the Minister in charge of upon noticeshipping whether it would not be possible to utilize in the Inter-State service the wooden ships constructed in the States, to the order of the Commonwealth, and which are now for sale?  the five wooden ships to which the honorallow able member refers have been sold, but I will obtain for him definite information on the subject. PRODUCTION OF SUGAR BEET.",19
6,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon notice In view of the necessity of making Australia self-contained so far as sugar supplies are concerned, is the Government prepared to render every assistance to stimulate the production of sugar beet in Australia?",19
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as fol' lows:It is not considered that further Commonassistance could reasonably be given the sugar-beet industry which is already {a) The Commonwealth Government through the import duty of £10 per ton on beet sugar, and £6 per ton on cane sugar. (6) The State Government of Victoria in which the only beet-sugar factory in Australia is situated. During the years 1903 to 1913 a Commonwealth bounty on sugar beet was in operation, but it' failed to lead to production on a large scale. The existing duty, coupled with the high price of sugar, and the assistance now rendered by the State Government, should be sufficient to stimulate this industry. HANSARD. ISSUE TO TEACHERS .",19
8,Mr WEST,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether, in view of the small «ost involved in printing, he will cause a proof copy of all Hansards issued to be forwarded to the head masters of all public and State schools in Australia?",19
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The matter is one for determination by the President and Mr. Speaker. TANUNDA CLUB.,19
10,Mr GABB,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, - 1. Whether it is the intention of the Government to allow the Tanunda Club to reUnited open in the near future?. 2. What are the reasons for keeping the Tanunda Club closed?",19
11,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,It is not proposed to the club to re-open at present. WAR SERVICE HMS ACT. MUNITIO N WORKERS.,19
12,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"tie Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice Whether it is possible to provide benefits under the War Service Homes Act for munition workers who did not enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth of Australia or with the Minister for Defence?  Homes Act does not include these classes, and consequently it would not be possible to extend the benefits of that measure to them LETTERGRAMS AND TELEGRAMS. FACILITIES IN COUNTRY DISTRICTS.",20
13,Mr HAY,Unknown,"for Dr EARLE PAGE) asked the Postmaster-General, notice I. Whether be will consider the advisability of restoring full lettergram facilities in try districts? '2. Whether he will consider the advisability of reverting to the use of envelopes in forwarding telegrams?",20
14,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"for Mr Wise ) . - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The question will be considered in connection with proposed legislation. 2. The Postmaster-General is now looking into the question of the delivery of telegrams, and will give consideration to the matter referred to. INVENTOR OF THE TANK .",20
15,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"On the 15th inst., the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) asked me the following questions : 1. Is it a fact that an Australian soldier, named Lancelot 15. de Mole, was the original inventor of the tank, which was used against the Germans during the late great war? 2. Is it a fact that the British War Office had Mr de Mole's invention in 1912, and pigeon-holed it ? 3. Is it a fact that the Defence Department, Perth, informed Mr de Mole, in 1911-12, that it was quite useless to submit any plans to the local Invention Board? 4. Is it a fact that, after the British Minister for War refused to entertain the proposition, in 1913, Mr de Mole was pressed by business men in Perth to offer the invention to the German Consul, and that he refused to submit it to any foreign Power? 5. Is it a fact that on Mr de Mole's tion being again offered to the British Government, in 1918, it was turned down, on the advice of Major Wilson, who later shared the reward of £15,000 with Sir Wdlliam Tritton for the invention. 6. Is it a fact that the British Royal Com- mission appointed ;in the matter paid Mr de Mole £987-the actual expenses incurred-and stipulated that the fact should not be published ? - 7. Will the Minister take the earliest opportunity to have the matter thoroughly investigated, with a view to making a suitable grant, if the evidence justifies it , and so enable Australia to give an Australian soldier a fair deal? I then promised to have inquiries made, and am now able to supply the following answers: I and 2. I am not able to say. 3. Inquiry has been made, but there is no TecoTU of Mr de Mole having been so informed. 4 and 5. I am unable to say. 6. It is understood that Mr de Mole was paid an amount of £9S7, but there is no inupon formation available as to the conditions of this payment. 7. The High Commissioner represented Mr. coun- de Mole's case to the Bight Honourable ' the Prime Minister of Great Britain, who replied in the following terms :-""Corpora l de Mole's case was submitted to the Royal Commission of Inventions. It was decided, however, that be could not be considered to have contributed towards the progressive improvement of the tank, which wasused during the'war, and he was, therefore, not deemed to bo eligible for any reward. The case has already been considered by the Secretary of State for War himself, who hopes to put forward Corporal de Mole's name for some other form of recognition. The War Office have met Corporal de Mole in a generous way in respect of his outof-pocket expenses, and it is believed that he is satisfied with the treatment which he has received in this respect.""

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 16th April, vide page 1317) :. Clause 111. The Commission may exercise such powers, inven- and shall perform such duties as are conferred npon it by this Act, or as are pre: scribed . . . . Upon whichMr TUDOR had movedThat the words "" or as are prescribed"" be left out.",20
16,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [3.16] - The divided. Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Groom), on Friday last, intimated that the Government conld not see their way to accept my amendment. I still take the view that the words which I propose to omit would give to the Commission too wide a power, and I shall vote against Bamford, F. W. their retention.",21
17,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [3.17] - I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) that it would be dangerous to retain these words in sub-clause 1. Our object at the present time, when we hear on every hand a cry for economy, should be to prevent the creation of new Departments. From small beginnings a Department quickly develops into one of great magnitude. It begins with an office, a table, and a chair, and a departmental head having been appointed, he must have a messenger to announce callers, and to ascertain whether he is in a suitable frame of mind to receive them. The departmental head cannot take off his own coat and hat; he must have some one to do that work for him, and he must have a clerk, a lady typist, and other officers. A new Department having been created, it becomes necessary, in order to justify its upkeep, to transfer to it duties Mahony, W. G. previously performed, perhaps quite satisfactorily, by other Departments. The work of the Commission should not extend over many years. For instance, vocational training will not occupy its attention for more than a couple of years, and,, although it is proposed to transfer the administration of war pensions to the Department of Repatriation, I think such a transfer is unwarranted, and should be opposed by the Committee. If the subclause were allowed to stand as it is, it would be possible to transfer to the Department almost any duty. It would even be possible for the Minister to take upon himself the construction of a railway line. I am opposed to the creation of a large Department; expenditure saved is revenue gained, and the Minister should agree to give the Departments only the ordinary opportunities of making regulations instead of conferring upon them this unlimited power.

Minister) [3.29] - I move That sub-clause (3) be struck out, and the following sub-clauses inserted in lieu thereof:_ ""(3) All real and personal property, securities, and funds, and all rights of action in respect of any such property, securities, and funds, vested, in pursuance of any Act repealed by this Act, in the Minister or in a State Repatriation Board, or in any person on behalf of or in trust for the Minister or any such Board, shall, upon the commencement of this Act, become vested in the Com- mission, subject to the trusts upon which the same are held by the Minister or by that Board or person. (4) All the rights of State War'Councils in respect of advances made by them under the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Fund Act 1916 shall, upon the commencement of this Act, become vested in, and exercisable by, the ComAs this Bil l repeals the existing Repatriation Act, it is necessary to make this amendment in order, to protect certain vested intei'ests an regard to money and property, and advances made by the State authorities. This amendment will vest in the Commission property and interests that formerly were vested in the Minister.",21
18,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [3.30] - The clause gives certain rights of action to the cases. Commission in respect of matters over which the Government previously had control. The effect of the amendment is to so widen the operation of the clause as to affect all transactions from the commencement of repatriation by the State War Councils and other organizations. I see the necessity for the Commission being able to follow goods, advances, and so forth in its own Department, but I do not wish it to have power to deal with what may have been done in a voluntary way before the Commonwealth Government took a hand.  power of the kind given to the Commission. Mr RODGER'S - I can see necessities for power so far as concerns operations and money granted under Acts passed by this Parliament, but I do not wish to see power on the part of the Commission to go right back to the inception of repatriagift or a loan tion on a voluntary basis, when there was no clear definition of what was a gift and what was a loan. For instance, in the case of widows, the State War Councils made absolute gifts of money for the purpose of erecting homes, and I am apprehensive that these gifts may be treated as advances.  intention.",22
19,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I have been personally associated with the establishment of a good many widows' homes, and I do not wish anything of that kind to. occur. Some of these transactions have been - closed and the titles actually handed over.  only to advances for property.",22
20,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,I am speaking of gifts for property.  a loan is another.,22
21,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member is afraid that transactions that have been closed may be re-opened? The clause refers only to outstanding advances.,22
22,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,I would be satisfied if the Minister would say that such gifts as I refer to will not be treated as advances.,22
23,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That cannot be promised until the Commission examines into the,22

25,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I am satisfied that the Commonwealth has no power in regard to the transactions I refer to, and I merely mention the matter in order to insure that no legal right of action will lie under the amended clause. '",22
26,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Minister for Works and Railways-Darlin g Downs) [3.36] - The clause applies only to advances made by the State War Councils under the Australian Repatriation Act 1916, and does not give any right to the Commission to convert a gift into an advance.",22
27,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,To-da y there may not be on the records of 'the Department anything to show whether there has been a,22
28,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Commission must be guided by the facts of the case, which will show whether there has been a gift or an advance. The object is not to embarrass bond fide transactions; the idea is to vest in the Commission, the right to collect outstanding moneys which are loans or advances granted for specific purposes by the State War Councils.",22
29,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The State War Councils operated without any constitution-it was a loose arrangement.,22
30,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It is impossible to express any opinion in regard to those actions of the past, but the object of the clause is only to give power to recover moneys distinctly paid as advances.",22
31,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Whether recorded aa repayable advances or not?,22
32,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The facts of each case must be examined; the constitution of a War Council is one thing, and a particular transaction of a council is another. The clause gives the same right as the WarCouncils had to recover advances, and nothing more; gifts will remain gifts. If a transaction has been closed it cannot be re-opened. The clause deals only with outstanding claims in connection with advances made under the Act of 1916.",22
33,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"Why is it considered necessary to vest property in the Commission instead of in the Minister, seeing that this is a temporary Commission, and that the property will probably have to be revested at the termination of the Commission's term of office? MT . GROOM - Accordin g to clause 1 this is a permanent Commission, a body corporate with a common seal.",23
34,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"Illawarra ) [3.40] - I am glad to have that information. I do not think that Parliament has been hitherto aware that in passing this Bill it will be creating a 'body which, will last for ever. A knowledge of that fact would have been exceedingly useful to the Committee in its consideration of certain of the earlier clauses.",23
35,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"There can be nothing to prevent Parliament from repealing the Act at any time. Corporations must be established as perpetual bo'dies. This procedure is for legal purposes. - Mr HECTORLAMOND - It appears to me that the office of a Minister is more permanent than that of a Commission. However, if , in respect to the vesting of property the factor of perpetuity is essential from a legal point of view, I must remain satisfied. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 12 agreed to. Clause 13(1) There shall be a Repatriation Board for each State, to consist of three members. . . .",23
36,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [3.42] - The Government have been persuaded to indicate the salaries to be paid to the members of the Commission. This clause deals with the creation of State Boards. In all probability the time of the members of the Boards of the smaller States will not be wholly devoted to the work of repatriation. Can the Government provide information, at this stage, concerning the basis of payment, particularly in respect to those Boards whose time will not be full y occupied?",23
37,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"Illawarra ) [3.44] - I am doubtful of the wisdom of appointing three members to each of the State Boards. I fear that we are settingup an organization out of proportion, in size and cost, to the work to be undertaken. The Boards' duties would be as efficiently carried out by one man as by three. In fact, the work probably would be more speedily attended to. The large annual expenditure in connection with old-age pensions requires the supervision of only one Deputy Commissioner in each - State; and hitherto the duties surrounding the administration of Repatriation have been adequately carried out by one Deputy Comptroller in each State, assisted by an honorary committee which, in some instances, has been a committee of delay. I do not see the force of appointing eighteen highly-paid officials for the whole of Australia, whose work could be more efficiently done by half-a-dozen.  Home and Territories) [3.45] - The representation of returned soldiers will be the same upon the State Boards as in the case of the Commission itself. If there is to be only one member of each of the State Boards, either the returned soldiers ,or the Government will have to do without representation.",23
38,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,This same work is being done now 'by returned soldiers in every State.,23
39,Mr WEST,Unknown,Why cannot a returned soldier be at the same time a representative of the Government?  take the view that there will be a greater factor of safety and efficiency in the establishment of Boards of three.,23
40,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"What proportion of a Board's time will need to be devoted to the work of repatriation ?  the whole of the time of the Board, probably, will be occupied; but in the smaller States such may not be the case. That is why the Bill does not provide for the payment of fixed salaries. It may only be necessary to make payments of fees, on the basis of so much per sitting.",23
41,Mr WEST,Unknown,B y stringing out their sittings three days a week .the Boards could make as much as if they were receiving fixed salaries.  ber should give the future personnel of the Boards credit for honesty. He has a very poor opinion of human nature. I cannot agree to any proposition for the reduction of the numbers upon the Boards. For a long time there has been an agitation to endow the State Repatriation Boards with more power. It would be a retrograde step now to cut down either their scope or their numbers.,23
42,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [3.48]. - The Committee has agreed to the appointment of three Commissioners. Seeing that I expressed disapproval of the constitution of the Commission upon that basis, I must now announce my agreement with the honourable) member for IllawaiTa. One Deputy Commissioner in each State has been carrying out the work attached to the payment of old-age pensions in every instance faithfully and satisfactorily. I fear that the appointment of a Board of three in each of the six States will merely establish the nucleus of a considerable array of officers entrenched within a 'big Department. The more closely one examines this measure the more is one impressed with the danger of creating a source of heavy and permanent departmental expenditure The foundation work of repatriation has been already completed. It seems absurd, , therefore, that a great Department of State shoiild now be reared.",24
43,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,The existing work of the Repatriation Department will not be added to.,24
44,Mr FENTON,Unknown,There is no assurance of that. If we appoint new officials in all of the States we will be bringing into being a new Department with considerable ramifications throughout Australia.,24
45,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,But the honorary Commissions have been doing the work which the State Boards will be called upon to do.,24
46,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"If the work has been done in an honorary capacity hitherto we have all the more reason for avoiding the creation of unnecessary expenditure now. We ought to seriously consider whether it is essential to have in each State Board of three. There will be a number of officers under the Central Commission, and on top of this 'staff each State Board will have its subordinates, so that we may be creating an endless number of officials. In my opinion, one man can deal with requests from returned soldiers more expeditiously and more fairly.than can two or three. At the present time the war pensions are under review. Thousands of cases are dealt with each week. If two men, sitting on opposite sides of a table, were dealing with them, and discussing whether this man should receive so and' so, or his dependants such and such, they would certainly occupy a great deal more time in reaching finality than would one man. I think one. Commissioner in each State will be quite sufficient. My great desire is to avoid the serious delays that will occuri f there are three members on each' State Board. A gentleman who is dealing with pensions in one of the States, one of our finest officers, and one who knows all the ramifications of these soldiers' cases, and how long it takes to deal with them, is emphatically of opinion that the soldiers will have to wait an unduly long time for the redress of their grievances if there is more than one man dealing with them. If the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) will move an amendment to reduce the number of members of State Boards I shall support him.",24
47,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,Grampians) [3.54] - I rise to support the .suggestion of the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr. Lamond) ,24
48,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Whil e it is eminently desirable to have three Commissioners on the Central Commission, with the object of giving special representation to the returned soldiers and to the Government and perhaps to some other interest, we have to bear in mind that, to a very great extent, State Boards will be subsidiary bodies appointed for the purpose of carrying out the instructions of the Central Commission.  tirely independent.",24
49,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"If they are to be independent bodies, then we shall have seven Commissions instead of one, an obviously impossible position. There must be a some misunderstanding as to what is the real position of the Central Commission and the State Boards. If , as I understand, the latter are to be subsidiary bodies, with certain administrative functions, I fail to see how the argument which applies in the direction of having three members on the Central Commission applies to the State Boards. We are all desirous that the Returned Soldiers League shall be adequately and fully represented on these bodies.  vernment also he represented?",24
50,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"I quite agree that the Government should also he .represented; but what is to prevent them from appointing a returned soldier in each State as Commissioner or Deputy Comptroller? I shall be only too pleased to hear further arguments from the Minister, but it seems to me that if we pass the clause as it stands, we are creating superfluous billets for two men in each State, when all experience goes to show that, in the matter of carrying out instructions given by a Minister or a Central Coinmission, one man is more fully responsible, and can do the work better, than three men. I seriously ask the Minister to postpone the clause for the time being, and give it further consideration.",25
51,Mr BELL,Unknown,"Darwin) [3.58] - I am not at all satisfied with the reasons given by the Minister for having three members on each Board. In fact, the only reason he has advanced is the desirability .of having a returned soldier on each Board. At the same time, he claims that the Government should have representation. Surely that is not sufficient reason for creating a number of Commissions, each consisting of three men, where one man would be sufficient to do the work required to be done? The Government will have all the representation they desire if they appoint a returned soldier as Commissioner in each State. are sufficient returned men who could do the work well and satisfactorily, not only for their fellows, but also for the Government. I shall support any amendment to reduce the number of members of State Boards to one. If the appointment of three men would expedite the work of repatriation, I would be prepared to support the clause as it stands; but I am not at all satisfied that three men will do the work any better than one could do it. Again, if the members of these bodies were to be given the administration of the War Service Homes Act, or the control of land settlement, I would willingly support the proposal to have three Commissioners; but, in my opinion, the limited amount of work they will have to undertake is not sufficient to warrant the appointment of seven Commissions to administer repatriation in Australia. In Tasmania the main difficulty lies in the Go- fact that it sometimes takes months for a returned soldier to get a reply to a communication addressed to the Repatriation Department. Sometimes no reply is forthcoming. We have looked for the appointment of a Commission that would co-ordinate the work, render it more efficient,-and deal with it more expeditiously than has been possible under the existing method. I regret that the Boards will not have full control of land settlement, though I recognise that the difficulty in giving them that control has been created by the indisposition of the State authorities to surrender their control. I am sorry, too, that the Boards will not have the. supervision of the war service homes scheme. But if their powers are to be limited, I think it will be sufficient to appoint one officer for each State, and I shall support an amendment to that effect.",25
52,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Melbourne Ports) [4.2] - I think that the Minister must admit that on no occasion has repatriation been made a party question; I am certain that the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) would bear me out in that statement.  Senator Millen would have provided for Boards of three unless he had considered that three men were needed.,25
53,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I think that There Boards of three are provided for because of the opinion that there should be a returned soldier on each of these Boards. Undoubtedly, the Minister will in any case control the Commission, and the Commission will lay down lines of policy which will apply to all the States. It is not to be supposed that the State Boards will each lay down a special policy for its own State. We could not, for example, have one set of conditions applying to New South Wales and another to Victoria. This being so, there is no reason why the State officials should be very highly paid men. Whoever may be appointed, they will not be better than those who now administer the Pensions Department, and they will not have to deal with cases any more difficult than those which are submitted to the Pensions Department.",25
54,Mr RODGEKS,Unknown,In the past the difficulty in connection with the State Boards has been that they have been shorn of authority.,25
55,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Unde r the State Boards are the Local Committees, which have wished for powers which have not been granted to them. Now we are starting afresh with what will be a new Department. The Minister will be bound to direct the policy of that Department, and it will be for the three Commissioners to give effect to his policy. But the same lines must be followed in each State. I am sure that we do not need State Boards of three members each merely to give opportunity .for the appointment of returned soldiers. There are many returned soldiers in the Public Service who could do the work. appeal to the Ministry not to say bluntly that they will not accept any modification of the proposal, and t suggcsfthat the matter should be withdrawn for the present, - so that it may be sidered. It is too much to have a Commission and six Boards, consisting in all of twenty-one persons, administering this Act. The expenditure which this arrangement would impose upon the country is unwarrantable",26
56,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [4.5] - I support the Government in this matter. It is easily conceivable that the continuation of local administration will secure greater efficiency and give greater satisfaction than, anything else. honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) has recently had for his motto ""Decentralization with economy,"" but in this matter he seems to be advocating centralization and the disregard of economy. I ask honourable members to remember the excellent work that has been done by the Repatriation Committees in each State, where the greatest brains have been at the .service of the Government, and the greatest devotion to duty has been shown It is undoubtedly better that administration should be as far as possible in the hands of local bodies in each State, administering the Act subject to the tral Commission. I am not prepared to hand over the interests of returned soldiers and others entirely to the Central Commission, when they can be better looked after by local bodies. In the long run the system provided for in the Bill will prove economical. It is not proposed to set up a salaried Board in each of the six States. The honorary work done in the past has been very efficient, business men having given an enormous amount of time to it, for which the community should be grateful to them. In the future there will not be so much to do; but the work ought to be paid for. I ask the Minister whether those who do it cannot be paid much as directors are paid, amounts being set down for the year which may not be exceeded.",26
57,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The Bill makes that possible.,26
58,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Senato r Millen, because of his experience of reI patriation, is much better able to judge than we are whether these Boards should be formed of three or of Qne person. Therefore I shall stand by the clause.",26
59,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Min reconister for Works and Railways) [4.10]. - I ask the Committee to vote for the clause as it stands. At present there is a Central, Commission consisting of seven members, and State Boards, each having seven members, and then there are the'Local Committees,, the intention being to secure the framing of uniform regulations, by the Central administration, and to leave it to local bodies to administer the law according to the needs of the case. That organization has done The excellent work. The State bodies have not been associated with the administration, which has been left entirely to the Minister and his officers. The Minister, however, now sees the need for reorganization, and it is proposed to create a Central Commission, which will be charged with the administration of the Act. It will consist of three persons, and will be subject to the Minister, so that parliamentary responsibility may be preserved. The Commission is to - have not merely advisory powers, but administrative powers^also, and therefore it is necessary to make it as thoroughly representative as possible, and strong enough to properly - adCen- minister the Act in the interests of the soldiers and of the community. The intention of the arrangement was to vest in one authority the-control of the many different matters affecting the well-being of the soldier, so that those concerned could go to that one authority instead of having to apply, as now, to several.",26
60,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,A soldier cannot go to the proposed Commission for a war service home or for a grant of land.,27
61,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The provision of land is a matter with in the province of the State authorities, and the housing arrangements referred to come under another authority. Under the Commission will be the State Boards, each having three members. They will not be administrative bodies, but will have certain adjudicating functions.

We have to decide whether it. would be wise to leave to the decision of-one individual all repatriation matters arising in a large State like New South Wales, with its vast population and varied interests.",27

68,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Le t us deal with one matter at a time. In the interests of soldiers themselves, it is desirable that we should have State Boards of three members. I recognise that the State Boards have been acting in an honorary pencapacity, and have done magnificent the work, in Queensland, but for the way will in which members of the State Board have subordinated their own interests to public welfare, much of this work would not have been carried out. There is a limit , however, to the extent of the sacrifice we may require of public-spirited The work ought to be well done, and we should pay for it . The scheme for which the Bill provides will allow of the appointment to each State Board of a representative of the soldiers, will be able to appreciate their ""trials difficulties, and who will be looked It will also enable the appointment of a man of business capato advise upon each application, and State the appointment of a third man to deal conwith other phases of repatriation. Our object should be, not to reduce, but to strengthen as much as we reasonably can the collective wisdom of those engaged in the administration of repatriation. Western Australia, like Queensland, is remote from the Seat of Governi n ment; and if we had there a Board of Comone, he might hesitate to decide questo detions of importance, and refer them to This would  if the right man were selected.",27

73,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The plea of economy has also been urged. Efficiency will be best secured by the appointment of State Boards of three members.

74,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"South Sydney) [4.20] I cannot approve the arguments put forward by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom). I would'remind the honourable gentleman, who has made it clear that the State Boards will have to deal with war pensions, that in New South Wales, the largest State of the group, the administration of war pensions has been carried out by the officer in charge of the Invali d and Old-age Pensions Department. In addition to his ordinary duties, he has had to deal with thousands of applications for war pensions, and has fixed the allotments for widows and children of deceased soldiers. This work he has almost completed. There now remain only five hundred or six hundred men in the Randwick Hospital whose claims have to be decided; yet it is proposed to create a State Board of three members to deal with the work. honourable gentleman says there is safety in numbers, and that therefore we should have three members on each State Board. I would point out in reply that the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in New South Wales has so far administered with the greatest satisfaction the invalid and old-age pension scheme, as well as war pensions. Neither he nor his staff has been compensated for the additional work thus carried out. Why does not the Minister go further and urge that we should have three Deputies Postmaster General in each State?",28
75,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Does the honourable member think there is any comparison between the duties to be carried out in each Department ?,28
76,Mr RILEY,Unknown,I do. it would Mr HECTOR LAMOND - The Deputy Controller of Customs in each State has to determine far more important matters than will come before the State Repatriation Boards.,28
77,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Yes ; Mr Barkley, the Deputy Commissioner of Trade and! Customs m New South Wales, has the decry cision of matters of vast importance. I am not fighting - the Government on this question. It should be above party consideration, and as representatives of 1 the people, we should see that no waste takes place. Let us try to improve the measure in the interests of the returned men and the country as a whole. I hope that we shall decide against the appointment of three members to each State Board, since I am convinced that the men will get a better deal from one man than they would be likely to secure from a Board of three members, who, in many cases, would be haggling with each other as to what should', be done.  gret that I cannot bring my opinion on this subject into conformity with that of the Minister for Works and' Railways (Mr Groom). The honourable gentleman is to be complimented upon his statement of the case, but it must not be forgotten that repatriation has hitherto been administered upon a voluntary basis in each State. The local voluntary committees are not to be abandoned. Hitherto there has been no permanent paid officer at their head in the several States. There will now be in each a permanent responsible officer, and, to my mind, the whole question of efficiency ag well as of economy The will depend upon the selection of a capable man for the administration of the Act, and the regulations drawn up under it. ""We could certainly afford to give a better salary to one than we could' give to three. If it is difficult to obtain the services of one capable man for such a duty as this, it will be still more difficult to secure three. Much time will be spent in discussing the issues at stake if the members of the State Boards do not clearly understand the Act and the regulations. The administration of one good man .is generally more - expeditious than that of three. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), who will not be present this week, desired me to urge the Government to give consideration, to the payment of certain fees to secretaries of Local Committees in big districts. The success of the movement depends largely upon tbese men.   but I am bringing forwar d this matter at the request of another honourable member. At a large conference of representatives of Repatriation Committees held in Perth, it was moved that an allowance in respect of stamps and other out of pocket expenses should be made to secretaries of Local Committees, but that motion was rejected. Now that the war is over some of the committees are becoming somewhat weary. They have done excellent work, and it would not be out of place for Parliament to carry a resolution thanking them for their splendid services during the war. I put it to the Government that some of the money that it is now proposed to expend on State Boards of three members might well be devoted to the giving of some slight consideration to those who have hitherto worked in a purely honorary capacity as secretaries of Local Committees, and who have paid their own out of pocket expenses - If three commissioners are to be appointed for each State, a staff would be necessary. I would infinitely prefer to select a staff capable of carrying out the routine functions well, and to have one executive mind controlling the Department. competent staff, a commissioner in each State would be able to direct the whole of the work of the Department more efficiently than would a Board of three. If such, a scheme failed we could pass an amending Bill providing for the appointment of a Board of three members in each State. I think it wise to start with a Board of one.",28
78,Mr BLUNDELL,Unknown,Adelaide) [4.29] Many honourable members seem to be taking strong exception to something that has already been done. I refer to the transfer of war pensions to the Repatriation Department.,29
79,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,That transfer has not yet been approved by the Committee. It is provided for in a later clause.,29
80,Mr BLUNDELL,Unknown,"It would be a mistake for the Committee to make any alteration in the system bf administration for which the Bill provides. The Repatriation Committees in the several States are on a voluntary basis. I do not agree with that principle. It is not reasonable to ask men to give up a great deal of their time to the local administration of repatriation. That may be all right for men in business, but on these Boards will be representatives of the workers who cannot afford to give their time for nothing.",29
81,Mr JAMES PAGE,Unknown,There are plenty of men who wil l give up their time in return for what the soldiers have done for them.,29
82,Mr BLUNDELL,Unknown,"That is true, but it must be recognised that the men on the State Committees today give their time. The administration of repatriation cannot be compared with the administration of the Postal Department. The Repatriation Boards will be dealing with all sections of the community, and if we do not get representatives of the trade unionists and the employer to work together we shall not make a success of the scheme. In the various States the Repatriation Committees deal with the technical and vocational training of soldiers, and it is essential that upon the Boards there should be representatives of others than returned soldiers, so that the case for the worker and the employer may be put. If only one Deputy Commissioner is appointed he will be a Government representative, and the two big interests which are essential to the success of repatriation With a - the trade unions and the employerswill have no representation. The two work well together today, and for that reason no trouble is experienced in placing men in different avocations. They meet at the committee table, and decide matters for their State without appealing to Melbourne. Yet it is proposed that all this responsibility should be vested in one man, without giving representation to the other interests whose co-operation is essential to the success of our repatriation effort. Some honourable members have objected that the Bill is creating new officers, which will mean additional appointments. That is not so; the three members of the Board in each State will take the place of the existing Committee of six in each State, and I assume that the officers who act today in conjunction with the State Committees will continue to act, and that Mr Bell will continue to be the official head of repatriation in South Australia. I hope honourable members will not ride to death the doctrine of economy. It is absurd to talk about economy when we are asking men to give up their time to assist in the administration of this repatriation scheme. I do not think it will be necessary in a State like South Australia to pay the members of the Board a regular salary, but it is essential to pay them a regular fee, so that when they sit all day they will not be out of pocket. Of course, if the representation on the Boards is restricted to a certain class, men will be found who will do the work without remuneration; but there are other desirable men who cannot afford to give their time for nothing. The Government recognise that fact today, and many men who represent working-class interests on the Repatriation Committees and other bodies are paid for their time. All that the Bill proposes to do is to reduce the membership of the existing Committees from six to three, and to settle definitely that we shall recompense each member for time lost in doing this work.",29
83,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [4.35] The plausibility of the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) did not carry much weight with me. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr. Riley) has drawn the attention of the Committee to the various Departments in each State that are successfully administered by one Deputy Commissioner. The Commonwealth Bank is a noteworthy in stance of that policy. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) referred to the attitude of the Senate, but it must 'be remembered that the Senate has not the financial responsibility that this House has. thought that the appointment of a Board of three would conduce greater efficiency I would the. clause, but I am convinced that better results will follow the system of control by one Deputy Commissioner i i i each State. The local organizations in Sydney have done splendid work, and laid the foundation upon which the State Boards can build. They have been of great assistance to the soldiers, but they have had no definite policy laid down for them by Act of Parliament. They have had to create special machinery, and to make the soldier understand that the ' State was prepared to do as much for him as possible, but that there was a limitation to the assistance it could render. All the State Boards will have to do will be to administer in accordance with the guiding principles laid down in this Bill . They cannot create any precedents or do anything other than what the law prescribes. People will think this Parliament has lost its sense if it creates Boards comprising twenty-one members for the administration of the Repatriation Department. Even the Board that controls the Australian Navy comprises only three members. The State Boards will have before them a definite policy laid down by the Act, and certain regulations framed by the Commission.  reduce the personnel of the State Boards from three to one.",30
84,Mr WEST,Unknown,"The Government have my sympathy because, I suppose, they have promised jobs to some men.",30
85,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member is saying something that is absolutely in correct.,30
86,Mr WEST,Unknown,I have heard returned soldiers say that they think a lot of 'billets are to be distributed.,30
87,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member has a. nice sense of rumour.,30
88,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I hope the Committee will consider the cost that is involved in this scheme. Nothing that Ministers have said justifies the .appointment of three men in each State.

89,Mr WEST,Unknown,"But only in accordance If I with the Act ; they cannot make their own regulations. to Sir ROBERT BEST (Kooyong) support [4.45],-The Committee is animated with the idea of securing the utmost efficiency in the matter of repatriation, and the question is whether the greater efficiency will be obtained by the appointment of three men or of one man. So far as one can gather from the Bill , the main functions of the Boards are merely of an advisory character, for there is no administration permitted to them. It is quite true that by clauses 19 and 26 certain functions are delegated to the Boards, the latter clause giving them power, subject to appeal, of adjudicating so far as the pensions are concerned, upon the capacity or incapacity of the soldiers, and so forth. The Boards are entitled to exercise those powers in addition to such other powers as may be prescribed by regulation by the Commission itself. From the point of view of decentralization these Boards are vital to the efficient working of the Bill. I have the utmost confidence in the Local Committees because of the local knowledge they can bring to bear in furnishing the Boards and the Commission with information and advice. The State Boards will have to concentrate the work done by the Local Committees, and the latter will be responsible to the Boards, and, therefore, it is of the utmost moment that the Boards should be of a representative character. This I regard as the real point of the whole scheme. If a Board consists one man alone, he will probably be a departmental officer, and iargely subject to departmental views. He will, of course, take his instructions from the Department and from the Commission, and will consciously or unconsciously be permeated with the ideas of the Department. If , on the other hand , each Board consists of 1 three men we are enabled at once to have a representative body.",30
90,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,'What would the honourable member call a representative Board?,31
91,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"The first essential is a representative of the soldiers who will supply information of a personal character, and be the link between - the local Repatriation Board and the various organizations of the soldiers. Then, again, there should be on the Board a man of business capacity and special experience in repatriation work, selected from outside; and doubtless his position will be of an honorary character. The third representative will be a departmental man, and the three will constitute a Board of a comprehensive and highly representative character. peat that a representative Board such as I have indicated is the greatest guarantee of efficiency, and is more calculated to give complete satisfaction than could possibly the autocratic adjudications of any one individual, - The most humorous suggestion made in the course of this discussion is that the appointment of representative Boards involves extravagance. Surely suc'h a view as that cauuot be seriously advanced? The members of the Boards will doubtless be paid by fees of, practically, a nominal character, and will be capable, of giving more valuable advice, I venture to say, than any single departmental officer could do. Representative Boards should be the guiding principle in our decision in this matter, and, therefore, I think the Government are acting wisely in the proposal they have made to the Committee.",31
92,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [4.54] The special pleading in connection with these proposed Boards is surprising. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) is apparently able to give the Committee more information regarding the payments to be made to the members of the Board than the Minister (Mr. of Poynton) himself is in a position to afford. Not a word have we had from (he Minister as to what these payments are to be-whethe r so much a sitting or by way of fixed salary. It would appear that the honourable member for Kooyong has not studied the Bill, for, as a matter of fact, provision is made for the appointment of members of the Public Service, who may be returned soldiers; and if the Boards are to consist of three members each, the work will be sufficient to take up all their time, for which, of course, they must be paid. It is already rumoured that the Chairman of the Commission'is to be paid £1,500, and his' 'two colleagues £1,000 each; and I suppose that the Chairman of a State Board will be paid £800 or £900, and the other two members, probably, £600. One would think from what hais been said that the duties of the Board extend to every kind of provision made for returned soldiers, whereas their duty, practically, will be to decide as to the pensions.",31
93,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"The Bill says the I re- contrary. Read clause 19. . Mr Fenton - Clause 19 providesA Board may exercise such powers and shall perform such duties as 'are conferred on it by this Act or as are prescribed. But clause 26 provides(1) Each Board shall be charged with the duties of(a) determining whether the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces in fact resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces, and in the case of incapacity the nature and extent thereof; (6) determining whether the death or incapacity of a person enlisted or appointed for active service in connection with naval or military preparations or operations in fact resulted from his employment in connection with those preparations or operations; (c) determining the extent to which persons alleged to be dependent upon a member of the Forces were in fact so dependent; and (d) assessing the rates of pensions of .members of the Forces and their dependants, and determining the dates of the commencement of such pensions. If the honourable member for Kooyong is relying on what is to be prescribed by regulation, this only shows that the in forniajtion given 'to /the 'Committee is faulty. I take it that the duties I have just read are the principal duties that the Boards will have to perform. present time, a member of the staff of the Old-age Pensions Oflice in each State is doing the work ; and I ask honourable members whether a Board of one or a Board' of three is the more likely to result in the greater expedition? complaint in the past has been that of delay in almost every branch of repatriation administration, and particularly in connection with land settlement, where, indeed, it is so serious as to appear almost deliberate. The officers at present doing this work are .men experienced in work of a similar k in d ; and we should be incurring unwarranted expenditure if we appointed Boards ""consisting of three members. It is true that the returned soldiers have asked for representation on the Boards; but I am sure that the great bulk of them, if they were consulted, would tell us that it is delay of which they have to complain, whether it be in connection with pensions, vocational training, land settlement, or any other branch of the work. I do not wish to ride the "" economy"" horse to death. There-is economy and economy. Some phases of economy pleaded for by certain honourable members find no support from me, bub there is one form of economy the practice of which at this moment is essential in the interests of the country and of the returned soldiers. There will be more appeals from a Board of three than - from the decision of one man.  is wrong in suggesting that the Boards will Mr Fenton. deal only with the matter of pensions. They will be concerned with the forty and more different activities which come within the scope of repatriation.",31
94,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The fact remains that whether we appoint one man, or three, or six, the Board will be largely dependent, for its actions in respect to every returned soldier, upon the records of the Defence Department;-upo n the papers presented by the soldier himself. Ministers appear bo o'bjecb to the considerable care which honourable members on both sides are seeking to give to this measure. When the Bill was being dealt with at its second-reading stage, Ministers emphasized that it was one which lent itself readily to consideration and improvement in Committee. The second-reading debate was concluded, therefore, with as littl e delay as possible. Now it is for the Committee, in its comA t the bined wisdom, to endeavour to mould a satisfactory measure. We know the fate always in store for an amendment moved from this side; but it would appear that even when an amendment is proposed by an adherent of the Government its The chances are no better. The party whip is cracked, and the clause must pass as the Cabinet has framed it . That kind of thing was never tolerated by this side. I recall divisions, when Labour was in power, when followers of the Government crossed over in support of the Opposition - against their own Government. Nothing like that ever occurs nowadays. The whip is cracked, and docile followers of the Government today immediately come to heel.",32
95,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [5.5] Were the appointment of State Boards to be considered only in relation to the matter of pensions, I would vote against this clause as drafted. But in view of the tremendously wide scope of the activities of repatriation I intend to support the Government in its proposal to establish State Boards having a membership each of three, which will take the place of the present voluntary Boards of seven. I hope the Government, in making the appointments, will have regard not only to the soldier aspect, but also to the broad principle of making effective the scheme of repatriation. I am impressed with the necessity for appointing an indust r i a l is t upon' each State Board. Vocational and technical training is a very important phase of the work, and member will be the longest surviving feature of repatriation; and I know of no indiout, vidual better equipped to advise than one who is familiar with the ramifications of the past. industrial life, and is sympathetic with the view-point of trade unionism in relation to vocational training. I regard the State Boards as being the .direct link between the soldier and the benefits to conferred upon him under the Act. It will be the Boards, and not the then Commission, or the Minister, which will determine every individual case. It will be highly unsatisfactory, and indeed foolish, to appoint only one man for each State whose erroneous judging, s ments might cost the repatriation scheme vastly more than the salaries of a Board of three.

On Friday I was prevented from moving an amendment which would have given to all the returned men the right to ballot for the selection of a Commissioner, and I do not now wish to lose the opportunity to move a similar amendment affecting the selection of soldiers' representatives to the State Boards.

My object is to give to all soldiers, whether members of organizations or not, an opportunity to vote for the selection of a representative on their State Board. Whatever difficulties there might be in the way of balloting throughout Australia for the selection of a Commissioner, they will not be so great in regard to ballots confined to the various States. There are returned men who have declined to j o in the soldiers' organizations, looking to Parliament to do the right thing for them. Quite a number of trade unionists are in that position. I believe that there are at least four soldiers' organizations, and under the Bill as it stands each would send in lists of names ",35

The Committee has already determined the method of appointment of the Commission, and although it is true that the specific issue in this instance was not put to a vote, the principle for which the clause provides has in reality been affirmed. The proposal made by the honourable member is quite impracticable. It would, be very difficult to devise the necessary machinery by which every returned man would be able to record his vote, apart from any organization.

I can see no objection to the adoption of the same principle in this case. On one of the State rolls crossed swords appear opposite the name of every returned man. In that State we thus because they were organized. have a ready-made roll of returned soldiers. Even in the absence of such a guide we could adopt the procedure followed at mass meetings of returned be made. men, and restrict the admission to the various halls at which the voting took place to those who could produce their discharge.

I desire the paragraph to be deleted because a representative of the soldiers on the Board might find himself, through no faul t of his own, but by reason of his position as a member of a soldiers' organization, the subject of legal proceedings, the result of which might .be his declaration as a bankrupt. Under such circumstances, if the clause is allowed to remain as drafted, he would lose his position as a member of the Commission. Por instance, it will be remembered that some littl e time-ago the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League took action against certain of its members, and legal proceedings were threatened against officers of the organization. One of those officers happened to be a member of Parliament, and though he may not have known of the action taken, or have been in favour of it , he might, by reason of it, have been placed in the position of a bankrupt, and, therefore, I contend that the clause as it stands is not reasonable.

202,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"""West Sydney) [9.24] ""Why is there a difference between the treatment of 'Commonwealth officers who may be appointed Commissioners or members of Boards under clause 20, aud the treatment of subordinate officers referred to in clause 21? By clause 20, if an - - officer of the Commonwealth Public Service is appointed Commissioner or member of a Board, his term of service counts as if be had been in the Commonwealth Public Service throughout, although he is not a Commonwealth public servant during that term. In clause 21, however, which deals with subordinate officers, the same language is not adhered to, nor is the same result achieved. These officers retain all their accruing rights to the date of appointment under the Bill, but the period of appointment does not count subsequently as if they had been members of the Public Service to the same extent as in the case of the Commissioners. They are given leave of absence during their term of - office under the Bill, but there is a difference between the treatment they receive :and the treatment given to officers who may be appointed Commissioner or member of a Board. 'There is no doubt from AYES. the wording of the clauses that this difference is designed, and it means that the subordinate officers are - not ^given such favourable consideration under this nieaE - sure as are the more highly-paid officers.

204,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,In what respect are officers better treated than others ?,47
205,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"The honourable member need only read the two clauses to which I have referred to 'see that they are worded differently; and that is for some purpose. In the case of the subordinate officers subclause 5 of clause 21 reads Ah. officer of the Commonwealth Public Service who becomes an officer under this Act shall not thereby be required to i esign fro m the Commonwealth Public Service, but may be granted leave of absence for the period of his employment under this Act, and the period of leave so granted shall, for all purposes, be included as part of the officer's period of service. Sub-clause 7, w h i c h refers to the p o s it i o n of an officer a f t e r the e x p i r at i o n of his service Under the Bill , readsI n determining the , status and salary to which the officer shall tie advanced, the Public Service Commissioner shall take into consideration the time (if any) which the officer served as an Australian soldier and the period of his service as an officer of the Department of Repatriation. This is what I desire to have explained. There seems to be power vested in the Public Service Commissioner, under clause 21, to appoint the officers to positions at aii advanced salary subsequently; the Public Service Commissioner is given a discretion. In the case of the higherpaid officers, however, the Bill itself defines what their position shall be, and they are to be considered as having been Commonwealth public .servants throughout their period of service under the Bill. I suppose that there may be a considerable advance in salary of a public officer appointed a Commissioner or member of a Board. Will such officers continue at the higher rate of salary when their period of service under the Bill expires? If so, why does not the salary of the subordinate officers continue likewise at the higher rate, assuming that there was an advance when they were appointed under the Bill? Then, again, sub-clause 4 of clause 21 providesAn officer of the Commonwealth Public Service or of the Public Service of a State who becomes an officer under this Act shall retain all his existing and accruing rights. How is it proposed to retain the "" existing and accruing rights "" of a State public servant, when there is no provision in this clause similar to that in clause 20, which treats the officers there referred to as transferred officers?",47
206,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Darling Downs-Min ister for Works and Railways) [9.29] If the honourable member for We3t Sydney (Mr Ryan) looks more closely into the clause he will find there is not that dissimilarity of treatment to which he has referred. The honourable .member omitted to read sub-clause 6.,48
207,Mr RYAN,Unknown,I read the whole of the clause before I rose to speak.,48
208,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member did not tell the Committee be had read all the sub-clauses.,48
209,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Honourable members would assume I had read them.,48
210,Mr GROOM,Unknown,We can only judge by what the honourable member said; and he did not say he had read that sub-clause. Mr Ryan.'-Does the honourable gentleman wish me to tell the Committee everything I read before I rise to speak?,48
211,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"When the honourable member advances an argument, we presume he refers to the clause, and if he omits to refer to a portion of the clause, the presumption is that he does not think it relevant to - his argument. I am pointing out that there is a sub-clause which is relevant to his argument, and which he did not read. Sub-clause 6 makes all the difference. It statesUpon the termination of the employment under this Act of any such officer, who has not been dismissed for misconduct, he shall be entitled to re-appointment to a position in Commonwealth Public Service with such advancement in status and salary beyond those held and received by him in that Service immediately prior to his appointment under this Aet, as the Public Service Commissioner in the circumstances thinks just.",48
212,Mr RYAN,Unknown,Why is not that same wording employed with respect to the Commissioners and members of the Boards?',48
213,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"If the honourable member will again examine clause 20, he will see that so far as a Commissioner or member of a Board is concernedIf an officer of the Public Service of the Commonwealth is appointed his service as Commissioner or member of a Board shall, for the purpose of determining his existing or accruing rights, be taken into account as if it were service in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and if an officer of the Public Service of a State is appointed Commissioner or member of a'Board, his service as Commissioner or member of a Board shall, for the purpose of determining his existing and accruing rights, be taken into account as if it were service in the Public Service of the Commonwealth and as if he had been an officer of a Department transferred to the Commonwealth and were retained in the service of the Commonwealth. That is to say, when the officer of the Federal Service becomes a Commissioner or member of a Board, he retains his existing and accruing rights, and his service as Commissioner is regarded as if he had been in the Public Service throughout.",48
214,Mr RYAN,Unknown,The reference to which the Minister is calling my attention has to do only with State servants.,48
215,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"That is not so. I am now quoting from clause 20. The purpose is that if we take a man from the Public Service and - place him under the repatriation scheme, he shall not be prejudiced by being transferred.",48

225,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"West Sydney) [9.39] - The Minister failed to touch the point which I specifically raised. I pointed out a distinct difference between the treatment proposed to be meted to the Commissioners and members of the State Boards, and to the lesser officials. Clause 20 proposes to confer better conditions upon a Commonwealth public servant who may be appointed a Commissioner or member of a Board than clause 21 essays to give to subordinate officers of the Commonwealth Public Service who may be appointed to subordinate positions under the repatriation scheme.. It is laid down distinctly in clause 20 that, although the Commissioners will not be officers under the Public Service Act , their services under the provisions of this measure will be taken into account in ascertaining their existing and accruing rights. At the termination of their period of service under the repatriation legislation, will the Commissioners continue to be Commonwealth public servants?",49
226,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Suppos e an official is appointed for three years, his appointment will last for only that exact period. If he is a member of the Public Service, and goes back to his old Department, his status will have been preserved for him .",49
227,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"If - a Commonwealth public servant is made a Commissioner, at the end of his term of office, he will still be a Commonwealth public servant, with ' certain existing and accruing rights. What are they? Will he be entitled to the same salary as he drew when he was a Commissioner ?",49
228,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"No ; the accruing rights will be rights of leave, and so on.",49
229,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"I would prefer an assurance on the point from the Minister. I have so far ascertained that the pers-on in question, at the termination of his service as Commissioner, will-remain in the Commonwealth Public Service. Will his salary remain at the same figure as when he was acting as a Commissioner ?",49
230,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Not necessarily.,49
231,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Then he may return to a the lower salary than he has been drawing hitherto. That is not as I read the Con- clause, however. I read it that his service as a Commissioner will count as What though he were a Commonwealth publio servant during that period, in order to ascertain what are his existing and accruing rights. But a subordinate officer's perod of service, apparently, is not to full y count as though he had remained throughout that term a Commonwealth public servant. He may be given leave of absence when flhis measure becomes an Act. '",49

That is not the position w:th regard to the Commissioners and the members of the Boards.

Upon his retur n to the Treasury Department he will get just that treatment which the Public Service Commissioner chooses to mete out to him. If there is to be no distinction between the two classes of officers, why should not both clauses be the same ? The officer occupying a junior position Service should get the same fair-, square deal as is meted out to the "" top dog.""",49
234,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [9.48] The wording of the two clauses is similar.

239,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [9.55] This clause affords the Committee the first opportunity it has had of separate reference to the ""administration of war pensions. I hope that we shall have from the Minister in charge of the Bill  policy, that there will be no overlapping of Departments. There is already a branch of the Treasury Department administering pensions, but apparently, in order to group all soldier activities under one head, it is now proposed to transfer the administration of war pensions to the Repatriation Department. I voted with the Government on clause 21 against the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), feeling that in voting for the amendment I would have been supporting the creation of permanent officers under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, and it would then have been too late for me to raise a protest against this portion of the Bill . I want to hear a statement from the Government that the period of service of the officers appointed under the Repatriation Commission to administer war pensions will cease when the general activities of repatriation cease, and that automatically the pensions work will revert to the Treasury. Otherwise, we shall again be creating what the country has been objecting to for years past-namely , the duplication of Departments, not merely the duplication of Federal and State Departments covering one sphere of activity, but ridiculously creating two Pensions Departments in the Federal sphere of activity, I object to the appointment of further permanent officers when we already have permanent officers for the administration of pensions generally, and it has been the experience of honourable members on both sides that so far the work has been satisfactorily performed. No assurance has been given that greater facility or expedition will be provided or displayed by the transfer of this branch of pensions work to the Repatriation' Commission. I would oppose the transfer if it were merely to be done for the purpose of justifying a paid Repatriation Commission, and I would seek to have Part III . of the Bill omitted. I want the Government to say that they do not propose to create and perpetuate two Pensions Departments in the Federal sphere. If they propose to do so, I cannot support this portion of t(he Bill . If , on the other hand,' tjhe Minister says that, having carefully considered all the needs of the soldiers, he finds that it will be more economical and effective, and of greater advantage to the soldiers, to have the whole of tjhese activities grouped temporarily in one Department, I cannot press my objection.",51
240,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [ 9 . 5 9 ] - I sympathize with the contention put forward by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers). I do not like the complexion given to this Bill that the proposed transfer of the pensions administration will take the form of the creation of a permanent Department. The work of repatriation is of a temporary nature, although it may continue for a very considerable time. We have recognised the temporary character of the Department's work in the creation of the controlling authorities, but should we take from the Treasury the administration of war pensions, and hand it over to the Repatriation Department, we should give to_ the latter a permanent character. The interests with which the Department will have to deal are sectional, and some of bhein may cease to exist after a comparatively short period of years ; but the administration of pensions must continue for many years. I wish the Minister to satisfy the Committee that there is a sufficient reason for transferring the War Pensions Branch from the Treasury Department, where it has been exceedingly well administered, to the Repatriation Department. I am as strong as anybody could be against the creation of unnecessary Departments, and the country is making its voice heard unmistakably on the question.  Home and Territories) [10.2] - At the present time applications for war pensions are dealt with by the Treasury Department, but, in nine cases out of ten, the soldier who applies for a pension .also makes application to the Repatriation Department on some other matter. When I was in charge, complaints were frequent about having to make inquiries on related matters in a number of offices when they might have been dealt with under the one roof.",51
241,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"A great many pension applications are dealt with by means of correspondence.  letters from soldiers, portions of which I have had to re-write because they dealt with a number of matters which had to be referred to different Departments. One letter might contain matters which had to be referred to the Defence, the Treasury, and the Repatriation Departments. I am informed by those who know more about repatriation than I do, that what is proposed will not entail any disturbance of the present existing pensions machinery, and will not disturb the personnel of the Pensions Department; that it ip a change of roof rather than a change of personnel that is proposed. The proposed reorganization will insure to the returned soldier and' his dependants economy of working, and expedition in dealing with the business in band. Under the present arrangement two or three Departments have to be communicated with, but under the proposed arrangement everything can be done by communicating with the Repatriation Department. What is proposed will not duplicate the pensions staff, or increase it , and will insure greater expedi, tion in settling claims.",52
242,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"When the other work of the Repatriation Department is concluded, we shall have two pensions offices, that administering war pensions under the Repatriation Department, and that administering old-age and invalid pensions under the Treasury. Surely the M in ister would not justify the maintenance of a Commission merely for the payment of war pensions.  the work of providing employment for returned soldiers will be the first business of the Repatriation Department to come to an end, and that the vocational training work will be the next; the payment of pensions will last longest of all. But it will be within the competence of Parliament to put at any time the War Pensions Branch again into the Treasury De- partment.",52
243,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Will the Minister give an undertaking that on the completion of the other activities of the Repatriation Department, the war-pensions work will be given back to the Treasury?  that, and shall be thankful if my lif e is spared long enough to see the end of the war pensions; but I do not wish to mislead the honourable member, and must, therefore, tell him that I.cannot give any guarantee in respect of future Parliaments. No Parliament, however, would allow an unwarrantable duplication of Departments to continue for any length of time. In the meanwhile, it will be a great advantage to have pension matters dealt with under the same roof as other repatriation matters.",52
244,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [10.10] - If the honourable member for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers) is satisfied with the Minister's statement, and will not move to delete ihis provision regarding pensions, I trust that some other member will take - the matter in hand. Apparently the Government intends to create two pensions Departments.",52
245,Mr GROOM,Unknown,There will not be two pensions Departments created.,52
246,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"At the present time, so far as Melbourne is concerned, all pension matters are dealt with in the offices in Brooks Robinson's buildings in Elizabeth Street. Now, according to the statement made by Senator Millen when introducing this Bill in the Senate, there are only 17,000 soldiers to retiirn to Australia, ""and the bulk of the sick and wounded have already returned, while the cases of the dependants of those who were killed have been dealt with. At least 75 per cent, of all pensions cases in every State have been finished, and to hand over the administration of war pensions' to the Repatriation Department would be a mistake. As the honourable member for Wakefield has suggested, it would give the Repatriation Department a justification for continuing in existence after its real work had been done. Honourable members know what a scandal attached to the pension system of the United States of America, where for t y years after the Civil War there were more pensioners receiving war pensions than there were persons who had fought in the war.",52
247,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,That could not happen under the Bill .,52
248,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No . But as the representative of a. large city electorate, where as many pension cases must have arisen as in any other constituency, I say that no Department of the Commonwealth has worked better than the War Pensions Department. What is proposed is the transfer of a certain number of officers from the offices in Elizabeth-street to the Repatriation Department offices-in St. Kildaroad. If this would benefit the soldiers or their dependants in any way, I would not object to it, but I cannot see that it would. The only difference it will make to a pensioner will be that, instead of presenting himself at the end of six' months in Elizabeth-street, he will have to present himself at the St. Kilda-road offices, where he will be examined by the same men as under the present arrangement would examine him in Elizabeth-street. As for the paying .of pensions, that is done throughout the Commonwealth, at the various post offices. Nothing will be saved by the proposed change, and I fail to discover any justification for handing over the pensions administration to the Repatriation Department, when not more than one-fourth of the whole number of cases remains to be dealt with.",52
249,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Many of the cases already dealt with will be subject to review.,53
250,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That happens in regard to all pensions. We are doing more to finally fix pension rates under this measure than Ave have done before. We are fixing under a schedule to the Bill the pension rates payable in respect of those who have received certain injuries, and are thus leaving less than ever to the discretionary powers of the magistrates. If the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) is not prepared to move in the direction suggested by him, I hope that some one else will do so, in order that we may show by our votes that we are opposed to any duplication of effort in respect of the Pensions Department, which has been wisely administered.",53
251,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [10.16] - I am not satisfied with the form of the assurance given by the Minister that we are not to have at the end of the repatriation activities of the Commonwealth two distinct pension Departments, with a commissioner and deputy commissioners, together with their respective staffs, dealing with invalid and old-age pensions, and a Commission and State Boards dealing with war pensions. The hesitancy shown by the Minister leads me to believe that we are to have two Federal pensions Departments controlled by two separate Ministers with separate staffs and different methods of' adjustment. If it were not for the schedule provisions already agreed upon and which vastly enhance the pensions and allowances hitherto provided for, I should move for the. omission of the whole of Part III . of the Bill. To do that, however, would be to strike out the new pension rates provided for in the schedule, and I am not prepared to take that responsibility in order to bring about a change of administration. The responsibility is too great. I hope, however, that the Government will recognise that many of their supporters, firmly object to the duplication of Federal Departments. It has been bad enough in the past.",53
252,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member could meet the object he has in view by moving the omission of the first three words of the clause.,53
253,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I have risen to suggest that an arrangement be made for loaning to the newly-created Department so much of the staff of the pensions branch of the Treasury as may be necessary to administer the war pensions. These officers might very well be loaned to the Repatriation Department until the dismantling stage is reached. Apart from the fact that the Commission will have to deal with the remaining 25 per cent, of claims yet to be disposed of and to carry on technical and vocational training, the major portion of its work will be that of dismantling. It should arrange with the States to carry out the final administrative work. It should arrange, for instance, with the State medical institutions to take over the residue of the work on the medical side, and I see nothing to prevent officers of the Treasury Department now dealing with war pensions being loaned to the Repatriation Department to carry on the pensions branch. When the great bulk of what I may describe as the soldier work of the Commission had been completed those officers would be able to return to the Treasury. There can be no justification for two separate Federal Pensions Departments.",53
254,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Darling) [10.21] The provisions of the Bill providing for further duality of Departments occasion me much anxiety. My experience has not been such as to make me welcome any interference with the present system of administering war pensions. In New South Wales we have a Pensions Department second tonone in the Commonwealth. I cannot say what has been done in the other States, but no Department with which I personally do business can claimanything like the capacity and efficiency of the Commonwealth Pensions Department in New South Wales. Punctuality, courtesy, promptness and efficiency constitute apparently the keynote of the service. If there is any delay in connection with it, it is usually due to medical officers or magistrates who have to conduct examinations in country districts. In New South Wales during the last four years over 90,000 applications for war pensions, have been received and dealt with. The war pensions now current number 67,000, and represent an annual liability of £1,925,000. This work has been dealt with in addition to the ordinary work of the Invalid and Old age Pensions Branch. Over 50,000 old age and invalid pensions are current in New South Wales, representing an annual expenditure of .£1,970,000. We have altogether 117,000 war pensions and invalid and old-age pensions in New South Wales alone, representing a yearly expenditure of £3,900,000. In addition the Department has to deal with something like 50,000 applications a year for the maternity allowance, involving a further expenditure of about £250,000. They are doing that work now. The machine is absolutely efficient. No matter what duality of Departments is created, it is certain that we cannot better the efficiency now shown by the Pensions Department in New South Wales. being so, is there any necessity to create a second edition of the present Department? Every honourable member has had experience of the Repatriation Department generally, and my experience is not at all a happy one. You send your letter along, and you may get an acknowledgment, or you may not. Even if the matter is finalized, in most cases the member making the representations receives no word from the Department. The thing is done direct with the applicant, leaving the member who has the matter in hand absolutely in the dark as to what has become of it. We have horrible examples^, of duality in the State and Federal Taxation Departments ' and Electoral Departments, and here the Government are - creating still another Department to bring about more confusion. It may make jobs for a few more re. turned soldiers, but I venture to say that the administration of the war pensions under the new system will not be to the benefit of the soldiers themselves. I want to test .the feeling of ..the Committee on this matter. I am not sure that the Committee will welcome the transferring of the war ipensions from an already efficient Department to a department not yet created. If the change is made, a certain number of officers should be transferred from the Pensions Department in each State to the Repatriation Commission. If that is not done, it will be the same as with other Repatriation Departments throughout Australia. My idea is to ask the Committee to leave out the whole of clause 22, leaving the Government to withdraw the Bill and redraft it. There is ample power under the War Pensions Act today to bring the new schedules into being by means of regulations. As, however, there are provisions in the clause, which, perhaps, .should be preserved, I shall move, as a testThat the first line of the clause be left out.  [10.33] - I intended to propose an amendment which would take precedence of the amendment of the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley). 'My idea was to insert at the beginning of the clause the words, "" This part of this Act shall be administered by the present Pensions Department."" The objection I see That to striking out the whole clause is the probable loss of the clauses and schedules relating to an increase in the pensions. I am sure the honourable member for Darling does not desire that.  pealed the War Pensions Act by passing clause 3.  lieve the feeling of the majority is that the administration of the war pensions should remain with the existing Pensions Department. I - do not think there is .liny other objection to the clause. I intend, therefore, to move an amendment to the effect that this portion of the Act shall continue to be administered by the present Pensions Office.",54
