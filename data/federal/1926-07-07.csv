8,Mr MCGRATH,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES,"I wish to make a personal explanation. Yesterday I asked a question in this House, and this morning the following paragraph in relation to it appears in today's A.ge:As a rule when members of Parliament ask pointed and embarrassing questions of Ministers while the House is sitting they possess some information, apparently reliable, on which their questions are based. It might be interesting to know what prompted Mr. MCGRATH (V.) to ask the Assistant Minister (Mr Marr) a question in the House of Kepresentatives yesterday in regard to certain building operations at the Federal Capital. Mr . MCGRATH asked if the Assistant Minister would take care to ensure that in the erection of further buildings at Canberra the Government would not fall into the blunder which it had made in building the secretariat. The architect of that building, he said, had been .paid a commission of £33,000. He hoped that in future the erection of all Government buildings would be carried out by the department's own public officers. The Assistant Minister replied briefly that the first secretariat built at Canberra had been erected by departmental officers, and the second secretariat, which was in course of construction,, was being wholly supervised and built by the Department of Works and Railways. In neither instance had any money been - paid to architects. H a n s a r d report of m y question and",15

10,Mr MARR,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES,"The secretariat was erected by the officers of the Works and Railways Department. A second secretariat which is now being built is also being carried out by the officers of the same department. No architectural fees have been paid in connection with either building. The building to which I referred, and which has been termed the secretariat, was referred to today by the Chairman of the Public Works Committee as the permanent administrative offices. I asked the question knowing that, under the agreement in regard to that work, about £38,000 is to be paid to Mr Jones, the architect of the permanent administrative building. I complain that I did not receive a proper answer to my question. I asked if the Government would take care not to make any further foolish blunders when erecting buildings at Canberra.",15
11,Mr MARR,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES,"I understood the honourable member yesterday to say that in the erection of the second secretariat building he hoped the Government would not make the blunders that had been made in regard to the first secretariat. word "" secretariat"" was specifically used. I said that no fees were being paid connection with either of the secretariat buildings, and I still stand by ment. Competitive designs were called for the building known as the permanent administrative offices.",15
12,Mr MCGRATH,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES,Bu s design has been accepted.,16

21,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES,"I have seen several about action that might be taken by the Commonwealth Parliament on vacating this building, which we have occupied since the commencement of Federation. That is a matter for determination by the Parliament itself. The Government has come to no decision Later",16
22,Mr FENTON,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES,"Will the Prime Minister say whether the Government contemplates the appointment of a committee representative of all parties in this Parliament to consider what recompense should be made to the Victorian Parliament for having allowed the Federal legislature to occupy this building for the last 25 years. If such a committee is to be appointed, when will it commence to function?",16
23,Mr BRUCE,PERMANENT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES,"Eve n the completion of this building, by the erection of a dome in accordance with *the original design, as has been suggested, would be a matter of policy, and it is not customary for a government to indicate its policy in reply to questions.  should consider the matter of compensating Victoria for the great advantage of having the Eederal Parliament in Melbourne for many years, by providing a dome for this building, will it take into consideration also the claims of other States, including South Australia, which have not had the same advantage, for assistance in the completion of their Parliament Houses?",17

25,Mr GREGORY,PRICE OE SUGAR IN WESTERN,"I have received a number of letters indicating that the conditions imposed by the Government in connection with the distribution of sugar in Western Australia are not being observed. Will the Minister state the position in that State?  of the existing sugar agreement, the Government was asked by those interested in Western Australia to grant certain concessions on freight, and in other directions, to enable sugar to be retailed in that State at the price at which it is retailed in the capital cities of the other States, namely, 4£d. per lb. That price would allow a reasonable profit to the retailer, but in Perth and Fremantle the retail price of sugar has remained at 5d. Special concessions were given . to the grocers of Western Australia, so that they could retail sugar with a reasonable profit to themselves at 4^d. a lb., but as they have not sold it at that price the Sugar Board has withdrawn the concession. The action of the board has been confirmed by the Government, because it believes that concessions given for a certain purpose should not be continued unless that purpose is fulfilled. BOUNTY ON RAW COTTON.",17
26,Mr FORDE,PRICE OE SUGAR IN WESTERN,"Yesterday afternoon, I received a telegram from the representatives of the cotton-growers in Central Queensland asking me to endeavour to have the Tariff Board's report on the cotton bounty tabled, and a decision registered by the Parliament as to whether the board's recommendation that a bounty of 2d. per lb. be paid, should be adopted, instead of the bounty of $d. and l^d. per lb. announced by the Government. Will the Minister inform me when the report will be printed aud made available to honourable members, and whether honourable members will be given an opportunity to register their views on the matter, and decide what tha bounty will be?  referred to by the honourable member yesterday, which was the first available opportunity for doing so, and I shall endeavour to expedite the printing of it.

ATTITUDE OF ATTOBNEY-GENEBAL.",17
27,Mr BRENNAN,PRICE OE SUGAR IN WESTERN,"My attention has been called to the fact that Sir Arthur Robinson, at one time a member of this House, having emerged from the peaceful seclusion of private life, and plunged again into the troubled waters of public controversy, has stated that the honourable the Attorney-General has retreated from the position previously taken up by him on some vital parts of the referendum proposals, I wish to ask the honourable the Attorney-General whether he has so retreated, and, if so, where he is now?",17
28,Mr LATHAM,PRICE OE SUGAR IN WESTERN,"It is inaccurate to say that I have retreated from any position I have taken up on the referendum proposals. The criticism of Sir Arthur Robinson, as published in this morning's press, is based upon a completely mis„ '- taken idea of what I said in the speech which he has criticized. I find it difficult to account for that mistake, as the reports of my speech which I have read do not contain any statement even resembling that which Sir Arthur Eobinson apparently believes I made. IMPERI AL CONFERENCE.",17

Was the leave actually granted to a certain postmaster in January, 1924, confirmed in May of the same year, and cancelled in May, 1925, by the Public Service Board of Commissioners prior to that postmaster's retirement from the service in Juno, 192i>? If so, on what grounds was the leave cancelled; did l'lis case materially differ from the of other officers who had previously enthe benefit of their accumulated leave? 4. As keen disappointment exists among a of good service record officers of many years' standing at the decision of the Comto discontinue the granting of acleave, will the Prime Minister look into the cases of those adversely affected a view to remedying any legitimate grievances they may suffer under as a result of deof what they have always regarded, apparently witlil reason, as a .privilege to in which they were justly entitled?",18

41,Mr GIBSON,EMPLOYEES UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes, so far as official offices are concerned. 2. The decision to adopt the system was given some two years ago as a result of a trial of the system which was made by the department. 3. Firstly, because funds were not available at the time the decision was reached, and, secondly, owing to the failure of the successful tenderer to produce an Australian-made seal satisfnetory for the purposes of the department. 4.

No other firm has been entrusted by the Air Ministry with the development of this type. The makers of the Seagull were the producers of the fastest seaplane the British Umpire has ever possessed. 3. The type of machine required amphibian, and the Seagull was considered by the British A i r Ministry as the best amphibian yet produced. It was developed the A i r Ministry for fleet spotting, work deck landing aircraft carriers. It is a type, and no other amphibian has ever been taken into service units in the Royal A i r Tho A i r Ministry advised that they were continuing the use of amphibians from carriers. The Seagull has since been in use at the Naval Co-operation School. It was - further stated that, although other amphibian types were in the experimental stage, no suitable alternative type could be recommended. As amphibians were wrgently required for training personnel for the seaplane carrier now under construction, and for use this season the Barrier Reef survey, Seagulls, being the best amphibian type available, were ordered. The numbers, however (six), were limited to those which would definitely training, it being anticipated that improved types w i ll he available when the time arrives to order aircraft for the seaplane carrier. 4.

Debate resumed from 25th June (vide page 3570), on motion by Mr HILL That the bill be now read a second time.",22
66,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I desire to make a personal explanation. When moving the second reading of this bill, I said that, upon the first portion of the line, that between Grafton and Kyogle, of 85 miles, approximately £675,000 had been expended to date. What I should have said was that the estimated cost of the work, if carried out on the day labour system, between Grafton and Kyogle was approximately £670,000, and that up to the end of last month, about £320,000 had been expended on the work actually done.",22
67,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Capricornia) [ 3 . 8 ] - I do not intend to oppose the bill, since its chief object is to approve of au additional expenditure of £500,000 on the necessary to date work of constructing a railway of the standard gauge from Grafton to South Brisbane. The main provision is in . clause 4, which substitutes £4,000,000 for £3,500,000. The Grafton to South Brisbane Railway Act 1924 made the necessary financial provision for the Commonwealth Treasurer to borrow a sum not exceeding £3,500,000, together with such further sum as might be necessary to meet discount and flotation charges. We are told that the sum of £3,500,000 was only a rough estimate of the cost of connecting Kyogle with South Brisbane by a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line. I understand that the estimate was' made on data supplied by New South Wales and. Queensland, and that no detailed survey and estimate were prepared at the time, in fact, had not been prepared up to the time of the passing of the act of 1924. In .1921, a royal commission, on information received PAPERS. from the States concerned, estimatedthat the line would cost £3,500,000. No detailed surveys or-estimates were prepared until after the Grafton to South Brisbane Railway Act was passed in and 1924, and the Railway Council, under Act the provisions contained in it , had them The rough estimate prepared in 1921 was the basis on which the Government proposed the expenditure of £3,500,000 on the line, but the estimate prepared by the Railway Council shows that thei expenditure of an additional .£500,000 will be necessary to. complete the work. It seems to me that the Government made a grave error in not having a detailed survey and estimate prepared in 1924, long before the bill was submitted to Parliament.",22
68,Mr DUNCAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,HUGHES - That is what a distance we said at the time.,22
69,Dr EARLE PAGE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,Does the honourable member for Capricornia suggest that the building of the line should have been delayed ?,23

The Governadditional ment, in this case, could have instructed its railway experts to go over the proposed route and make a careful estimate. Petty-minded, party politicians may try ceeded ? to throw the blame for the introduction of this bill on other shoulders, but the sponsibility undoubtedly rests with this Government. I feel sure that some honland orable members will take the opportunity that the introduction of the bill affords to enter upon a general discussion the whole question of the merits of the Grafton to South Brisbane railway; and, in my opinion, the Government should have been sufficiently far-sighted and business-like to avoid that. I do not wish to lay any blame for this bill at door of those who prepared the 1921 mate, for it was made five years ago, conditions have changed a great deal since then. My point is that it was the duty of the Government to obtain a liable estimate for submission to Parliashould ment in 1924. It has a Railway Departunification ment, and an able commissioner with good engineering staff under him. and could have had a sound and reliable estif mate prepared.

The tender submitted by the Queensland Railways Constructional Engineer for that portion of the line which will pass through Queensland territory was mem- £1,130,142, which included supervision while the public tender for the work was £1,333,941, or £203,799 more In these circumstances it is no wonder that time the Government adopted the proposal that the Queensland Railway Department It build the line by day labour.

78,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I could point the honreorable member for Fawkner ("" Mr Maxwell) to many instances in which QueensGovernment departments have submitted prices for work for which public tenders have been called, and have been on able to do the work by day labour with a substantial saving to the country, for there has been no contractor's "" rake off."" It is highly desirable that the Kyogle to South Brisbane railway' should be built as speedily as possible, having the due regard to the stability of the line. estiThe Commonwealth entered into an honand orable compact to complete the work, and it must now be carried out. A conference of State and Federal Ministers, in reJuly, 1920, decided that a commission be appointed to report upon the of railway gauges, and in order a to avoid parochial prejudices the comi t mission was constituted of two experts i o m outside Australia, and one Auson tralian engineer. The Commonwealth and agreed to abide by the decision of be Ihe commission, the Commonwealth to pay one-fifth of the total cost of unification, and the five mainland States to pay the The commission recommended that 4 f t . 8-£ in . should be the standard gauge. Considerable difficulty was experienced in getting al] the States to agree to a policy for the benefit of Australia generally, but finally an agreement was made between the governments of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, ana Queensland that the portion of the route between Grafton and South Brisbane should be converted to the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. That agreement was ratified by their respective Parliaments in 1924. Unfortunately, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia took a rather parochial view of the project, and refused to meet their share of the expenditure. The line was commenced; but now it is necessary, in accordance with the advice of the Railway Council, to provide a sum of £500,000 in excess of the original rough estimate. Under the amended agreement embodied in this bill the Commonwealth has to provide £800,000; Queensland. £ 4 6 8 , 0 0 0; and New South Wales, £1,288,088, whilst the Commonwealth will also £935,439 in behalf of Victoria, £305,073 in behalf of South Australia, and £202,783 in behalf of Western Australia, making the total cost to the Commonwealth, £2,243,299. This House should not hesitate to approve of the bill, but I hope that the Minister in his reply will state definitely whether any alteration in the proposed route is contemplated. read a statement in Smith's Weekly that the route is to be varied to serve certain interests. I hope the Minister will definitely contradict that assertion.",23
79,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I have not read Smith's Weekly, but I can say definitely that there has been no alteration of the route.",24
80,Mr FORUE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"An important consideration is that when this line is completed the railway journey between Brisbane and Sydney will be reduced by six hours, namely, from 26 to 20 hours. The route will be 100 miles shorter than at present.",24
81,Mr MAXWELL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,Does it take six hours to do 100 miles?,24
82,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"At present the railway has to cross the Toowoomba Range, but vvhen the new line is completed there will be a direct and fairly level line along the coast.",24
83,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,The 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge will permit of faster travelling than is possible on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge.,24
84,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,That will be another advantage to travellers.,24
85,Mr LISTER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,It does not take the train six hours to travel 100 miles even crossing the Toowoomba Range.,24
86,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"No , not on fairly level country; but the railway experts have said that the journey from Brisbane to Sydney will be reduced by six hours. This is the first instalment of the unification of railway gauges, the need for which must be recognized by all members of this Parliament. For 25 years the standardization of gauges has been discussed at conferences of railway commissioners and engineers. Australia is not singular in having to deal with a break of gauge problem. Both England and the United States of America experienced the disability to travellers and the handling of freights caused by a succession of breaks in the railway gauges. The unification of gauges in England became a subject of find public agitation as far back as 1846, and it was not until 1872 that this most desirable reform was brought about. One fact that should commend the line to honourable members is that it . will pass through some of the richest land in Australia, which is occupied, not by wealthy pastoralists, but by thousands of small primary producers who are engaged in I dairying, and the growing of sugar cane, bananas, and other fruits. It will serve the smaller men who have established themselves upon the land, and will bring them into direct contact with the Brisbane market. If honourable members will consider this proposal from an Australian standpoint, they will not hesitate to vote for the bill . I hope that the other recommendations made by the royal commission in 1921 will soon be submitted to this Parliament with a view to connecting all the Australian capitals by a line of uniform gauge. For the reasons I have mentioned, I hope that the bill will have a speedy passage.",24
87,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Richmond) [3.301 A fortnight ago I had the pleasure of witnessing the turning of the first sod of this railway by the Attorney-Genera] of the Commonwealth (Mr Latham). That historic ceremony seemed to anticipate that this proposed additional expenditure, will bo sanctioned by this Parliament. I do not intend to discuss generally the desirability of standardizing the railway gauges, because that principle has already been affirmed by the Commonwealth Parliament. I have studied the report of the Minister's second-reading speech in order to ascertain why this extra £500,000 is required. The reasons furnished by the honourable gentleman do not seem adequate. Possibly, he could furnish sonie further information which would ease the minds of honourable members. The principal excuse advanced by him was that the estimate made in 1921 was approximate only, and based upon incomplete information. I notice that in the agreement made between the Commonwealth and the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, a standard working week of 44 hours is mentioned. In 1921, the 44-hour week was not in operation, and possibly the original estimate was based on a 48-hour week. The Minister seemed to skim over this delicate point, but the increase of 14 per cent, in the expenditure almost corresponds with the percentage of extra cost that a reduction of working hours from 48 to 44 would mean. Possibly the 44 hours week is the real reason for the extra cost. The amount to be paid by the Commonwealth was, under the original agreement, £1,962,887, but under the amended agreement that has been increased to £2,243,299, a difference of £280,412. The Commonwealth is to pay more than half the total increase merely because two partner States have agreed to adopt the 44 hours week.",24
88,Mr FOSTEK,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"And the Commonwealth is binding other States.  the time being it is paying the shares of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. I am sorry that South Australia did not take a broad national view, and subscribe to the agreement as it should have done, because even now the Commonwealth is incurring expenditure in standardizing the #;auge of one railway in that State. I wish to know from the Minister whether the in creased cost to the Commonwealth of £280,000 is due solely to the operation of the 44-hour week?",25
89,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Not solely, but partly.",25
90,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,And to a large extent?,25
91,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,I do not say that.,25
92,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"The agreement provides that the amount shall be increased or decreased as the cost of the work is affected by arbitration awards of State and Eederal courts. I understand that this clause is common in contracts. Some time ago a contract for the Nort h Shore bridge was let by the New South Wales Government to Dorman, Long and Company. Recentlythe crane drivers employed on that work went on strike, and, without parliamentary sanction, an arrangement was made to pay them a higher wage. As a result, the original estimate of the cost of the bridge has been considerably increased. If similar occurrences are possible under this agreement, 1 suggest that the South Grafton to Brisbane railway is likely to cost considerably more than £4,000,000. In that event we shall have another amending bill brought down to this House as the work progresses to meet the additional expenditure. I have no objection to the building of the line, but we should enter into a fair and reasonable contract for the proper carrying out of the work. The expenditure must be safeguarded.",25
93,Mr FOSTER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,The trouble is that contractors will not tender for work if the conditions of contract are stringent.,25
94,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Exactly ; but under the agreement any additional expenditure has to be approved by the council. Parliament is finding the bulk of the money, and, therefore, it should control the expenditure. The agreement requires revision, and I suggest that any additional expenditure in connection with the line should be approved, not by the council, but by the Minister. If he acts wrongly we can draw attention to it in this House, but if the council acts wrongly we have no redress. I regret that in this bill, as well as in the original bill, no mention has been made of the construction of the bridge over the Clarence River at Grafton. That bridge is very necessary if the line is to be a success. At present the train from Sydney ruus as far as South Grafton. The passengers are then transported by motor lorry and punt across the river, and the mail and luggage vans are taken across by ferry. The New South Wales Wovemment gave an undertaking that the bridge would be constructed at the time the railway was opened. The tenders for the construction of the bridge closed on the 15th of June last; two tenders were received, one from Dorman, Long and Company, whose price was £16,000 below the departmental estimate, and the other tender from Jno. Grant and Sons, L i m i ted, whose price was £750 below the departmental estimate. Yet the New couth Wales Government ' jected both tenders, because it considers them to be excessive, and has decided to carry out the work departmentally. suggest that there is something sinister in that action. When the 1924 bill was under discussion, I drew attention to the fact that no mention was made in it of the Grafton bridge, which was a very necessary part of the scheme for the unification of gauges. The through train journey will not be possible u n t i l the bridge has been built. At that time it was stated that we Could accept the bona fides of the New South Wales Government. I then expressed my fears that it would not honour its obligations. In view of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the construction of the Grafton bridge, it is now apparent that that government does not intend to honour its promise. I suggest to the Minister that he should approach that government to see whether it intends to carry out its undertaking that the bridge will be opened when the railway is completed. The Queensland Minister for Works stated at Kyogle that he expected that the State's portion of the line from South Brisbane to the border would be completed in March, 1929, nearly three years hence. The conditions of contract applying to the erection of the Grafton bridge provided for its completion within three years of the acceptance of the tender. As no tender was accepted, and as the New South Wales Government intends to carry out the work departmentally, apparently no time l i m it is to be imposed. I suggest that the State Government's deficit of over £1,250,000 last year is prompting it to shelve its undertaking to the Commonwealth to complete the bridge within three years - I regret that there has been such a",25
95,Mr WEST,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"The honourable member should know that the cost of that bridge would come, not out of revenue, but out of the loan account.",26
96,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,I know that the honourable member becomes very embarrassed when the deficits of Labour Governments are mentioned. I suggest to the Minister that he ask the New South Wales Government whether it intends to go on with the work.,26
97,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That government/ proposes to go on with the work at once, it would has re- have begun if the tenders had not been regarded as excessive. They were considerably higher than the departmental I estimate.",26
98,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I am not breaking any confidence when I say that in discussing these tenders with Mr Flannery, the Minister for Railways in New South Wales, before their consideration by Cabinet, he told me that he was very pleased indeed that they were both below the departmental estimate. One tender was for £499,250, and the other for £483,100. We cannot get away from those figures.",26

I am referring to the Grafton bridge, and not to the figures given by the Minister respecting the construction of the railway.

I shall not at this stage repeat all f said last year in support of the construction of the line,, but I rise to urge that the line be constructed with the utmost expedition. I . was privileged to be present at the histender. toric ceremony, at Kyogle, of turning the first sod in connection with the constructhe tion of the line. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) was also present, and the Attorney-General (Mr. Latham) performed the ceremony. It was then stated to me by representatives of the Railway Council that, if the posals of the council were given effect, tender to do the work, on a 44-hours the first train would run over the line from Brisbane to Sydney in March, 1929. I understand that there is some anxiety but it was not accepted. at the present time as to whether that prophecy will be fulfilled, as there is doubt whether the Loan Council will make the necessary money available. The council's requirements for the first year amount to about £1,000,000, and it suggested that the amount to be made available will be considerably less than that. In that event, the programme not be adhered to; and the completion the line will be delayed. ""Withholding the financial requirements of the council will not only delay the completion of line, but will also add to its cost. Men will have to be dismissed, and purchases of material restricted. I hope the Miniswhich ter will give the House an assurance that he will do all he can to provide the council with the money it requires within the limits of the amounts approved to struct the line expeditiously. The need unifying the railway gauges between the capital cities, and the national importvision ance of this line, I stressed when support- £1,091,868. ing the proposal for the construction the line last year. I take this opportunity of thanking the Minister for acceding my request that preference should given to returned soldiers in the construcis tion of this line. I hope that he will make sure that the policy will be concontractors tinued.",26
103,Mr SEABROOK,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Franklin) [3.53] I am surprised that this bill has been brought forward by the Government. Tenders were called for the work in April, 1924, and the closing date for mitting them was the 1st September, 1925: In the advertisement calling for tenders it was not stated that "" the or any other tender will not necessarily be accepted."" It is usual, when governdoing ments call for tenders, to include such stipulation, so that there may be no or legal obligation to accept the lowest It was not until the tenders for the No. 1 and No. 2 sections were before Tender Board that the board decided that the New South Wales and Queensland Governments should do the work. That was a wrong procedure, and it will lead to contractors refusing to tender in the future. The Tasmauian firm of proCheverton aud Company submitted a ; basis, for £1,011,975 15s. That tender was below the departmental estimate, The firm spent £5,250 in preparing the tender, it some paid 25 guineas for .the form on which to tender, and it lodged £10,000 deposit with the tender. That tender was rejected simply because the New South Wales and is Queensland Labour Governments wish to do the work by day labour, so that no one will know the cost. In this country canwe have surely had enough experience of of the day-labour system. The board acted unfairly and unreasonably. The Government, on the recommendation of Mr Bell, the who is a member of the board, now asks for a further £500,000 - Why should such a request be made after the tenders, were lower than the departmental estimate, have closed ? The Minister distinctly stated that, if the cost was more than the estimates, the difference would conbe met by the State Governments. The for No. 1 contract in New South Wales was for £1,059,868, plus departmental superof £32,000, making a total of The No. 2 tender was of £1,011,975, with departmental supervision of £32,000. The total of those two tenders to was £2,135,843. The original bill provided be for £3,500,000, and yet the Government now asking for a further £500,000 to complete the job. It is a scandal to put to the expense of tendering, and then to turn them, down without reimbursing them for their expense. The Minister will have to satisfy me as to the necessity for this £500,000, as to the amount of the tenders submitted by contractors, and as to what the cost will be subto the New South Wales and Queensland Governments; and, if he cannot do that, I shall vote against the bill. The peonle lowest of New South Wales and Queensland will haye to pay the difference in cost between the work by contract and by day a labour. The procedure does not reflect moral credit either on the Government or the council. Contractors look to a government-particularl y the Commonwealth Government-to treat them fair l y . The firm I have mentioned tendered in the belief that it would receive a fair deal. The Government has not paid a peni>> of interest on the £10,000 deposited by the firm, although it held the money for several months; and it has not repaid any part of the 25 guineas paid by the firm for the tender-form. The firm should have been allowed to do the work. If the Government can show that the firm is not competent to do the work, its refusal to accept the tender will be justified, but it has not attempted to do that. Having had experience as a contractor, I know what it means to be put to the expense of preparing tenders, and then, although the lowest, to have them rejected without reason. The Government should not hesitate to compensate the f i r m to which I have referred for the time and expense to which it has been put. A request to this effect has been made and refused. The bill should be rejected, because it' will impose a further burden on the people of New South Wales and Queensland.",27
104,Mr MACKAY,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Lilley) [4.6] - Most honourable members will regret the necessity for the bill. The public will be astonished to learn that reasonably correct estimates of the cost of the work were not submitted in the first instance. It is unnecessary to traverse the whole ground covered by the Minister in moving the second reading of the bill, but the Minister might well furnish additional .particulars showing who was responsible for the faulty estimates supplied. We understand that in this matter the Commohwealibh Government is acting in co-operation with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, and that a railway council has been formed. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) endeavoured, I was going to say deliberately, to mislead the House.",28
105,Mr SPEAKER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE, The honourable member may not suggest that another honourable member deliberately attempted to mislead the House.,28
106,Mr MACKAY,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,May I say that he intended to mislead the House?,28
107,Mr SPEAKER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,There must be no suggestion of such an intention.,28

110,Mr MACKAY,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"In any case the State Governments had no right to say that the work could be done for a certain sum of money, and to ask later on for an additional £500,000.",28
111,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"The Commonwealth Government should have provided reliable estimates at the outset, and it must take full responsibility for the present position.",28
112,Mr MACKAY,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"It should have been decided in the first instance that £4,000,000 was required. The Ministry naturally accepted the estimate of £3,500,000 when the railway council asked for that sum. I have no doubt that a number of honourable members scrutinized the original bill very carefully, and hesitated to commit the country even to the expenditure, of £3,500,000. The position is entirely unsatisfactory now that a further sum of £500,000 is sought. I hope that the Minister will apportion the blame among those responsible for the discrepancy, because the people have a right to know whether the faul t lies with the Commonwealth or the State officials. Another wrong impression conveyed by the honourable member for Capricornia was that this was to be a day-labour job. I point out that the schedule to the new bill distinctly refers to the States of New South Wales and Queensland as contractors. I have a great deal of sympathy with the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) in his complaint regarding the way in which private contractors have been treated in this matter. It appears to me that Queensland and New South Wales intended from the first that the work should not be let to privatecontractors. The history of the negotiations shows that those States determined from the beginning that the work should o n be done departmentally on the day laboursystem, no matter by what subterfuge. In such circumstances tenders should not have been invited.",28
113,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,What if the private con-' tractors' price was higher than the departmental estimate?,28

116,Mr MACKAY,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"But , taking work as a whole, the price of the lowest private tender was below the Government estimate. I am sure that the public will welcome this measure as a step towards the unification of our railway gauges, and I hope that the scheme will be continued with the hearty cooperation of the various States. The absurd position has arisen, however, that while we are asked to vote £4,000,000 in connecting New South Wale3 and Queensland by means of the standard gauge of 4 f t . 84 in . , South Australia is spending tens of thousands of pounds in converting 3-ft. 6-in. gauge lines to the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge; I refer to a branch line which will connect with the proposed new railway between Port Augusta and Adelaide. It is a criminal waste"" of public money to convert existing narrowgauge lines to the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge when there is a proposal to complete the 4 - f t. 8^-in. gauge from Fremantle to Adelaide. I hope that the Minister will take note of the statements of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R.

In this case there is uo obstacle in the way of unification, and it will be possible to travel, at any rate, from Albur y to Brisbane without a change of trains. But the position in South Australia is quite different. In my opinion, it is immoral f o i any government or railway department to call for tenders for a big work such as the construction of the line from Kyogle to South Brisbane, and to reject the lowest tender. It is a most unbusinesslike proceeding, and would not be tolerated by high-minded mpn unless there was an excel ent reason for it . 1",29
118,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Would not a saving of £200,000 on the job be a sufficient justification for rejecting the lowest tender !",29
119,Mr FOSTER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Yes , if there is no doubt that such a saving could be effected; but I have seen many hundred thousands of pounds lost by carrying out large works of this character on the day labour system. If , as the Minister suggests, a saving of that magnitude could be made, all I have to say is that he did the not instruct the House as he should have done in moving the second reading of the bill. Mr HILL.I-Does not the honourable member realise that the secret estimates of the Queensland and New South Wales Governments are now regarded as firm tenders 1",29
120,Mr FOSTER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,That has nothing whatever to do with the matter.,29
121,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,It has everything to do with it .,29
122,Mr FOSTER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"In carrying out a large number of works in New South Wales and Queensland, the State Governments, instead of saving money, have doubled their estimates in the end. I have received first-hand information concerning the losses sustained there. It may be possible to make out a good case for the granting of an additional £500,000 in the present case;-but the House is entitled to full particulars. I know that the first estimate was necessarily an approximate one, and that when a complete survey is made there may be a big discrepancy between the first and second estimates; but when an engineer submits approximate figures he generally makes allowance for unforeseen expenditure. It is possible that the additional cost of £500,000 , which, at pre- I sent, seems excessive may be satisfactorily explained; but I have a shrewd idea that the introduction of a 44-hour week in New South Wales is largely responsible. As the Commonwealth Government has one representative on the Railway Council, and the States of New South Wales and Queensland have each one representative, it will be difficult for the Commonwealth to avoid the extra expense which will necessarily be involved by the introduction of a shorter working week. It is not surprising to find that a tender for this work has not been accepted, particularly as the Governments of the two States concerned favour the day-labour system. It is very difficult for persons other than railway engineering experts to thoroughly understand all the technicalities of the agreement, but having 1 given it my closest attention I think the Commonwealth is adeauately protected. I understand that the agreement was entered into, before a 44-hour week was introduced in New South Wales.",29
123,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Yes , but the New South Wales tender was based on a 44-hour week.",30
124,Mr FOSTER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Yes , and that is, doubtless, largely responsible for the additional expenditure to be incurred. The Workmen's Compensation Act of the New South Wales Government is one of the wildest and most outrageous measures ever passed in a civilized community, and, from the public viewpoint, is almost criminal. It is specifically provided in the agreement that the contracting parties shall observe the arbitration court awards of the States concerned, but I do not know if the agreement is in tended to cover the extra cost that may have to be incurred by the Railway Council in consequence of the passing of the amended Workmen's Compensation A ct of New South Wales. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) referred to the conversion work now being undertaken in South Australia, which he said was involving that State in unnecessary expenditure; but I do not think South Australia will be willing to participate in a general scheme of unification for the next twenty years. In view of all the circumstances such a scheme is at the present moment impracticable, as the money required for such an important work, particularly in South Australia, can be spent on more urgent developmental works.",30
125,Mr DUNCAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"HUGHES (Boothby) [4.33] - It appears to me that any"" discussion on .this measure - is practically valueless, except so far as it may be a guide to the House in the future. I wish to remind honourable members of what transpired when the bill which it is now desired to amend, and under which these difficulties have arisen, was before the House in 1924. At that time many honourable members on this side of the chamber believed that there were insufficient data, and that the plans and details submifted were altogether inadequate to enable a proper decision to be reached. When the measure now being amended was before the House, I said I am inclined to the view that the proposal should be recommended by the Public Works Committee before it is carried out. I further statedOn reading the Public Works Committee Act one wonders how a Government could bring down a proposal for such an enormous expenditure as £3,500,000, without first submitting it to the body which has been specially appointed by Parliament to consider such matters. Later I statedMore details than have been provided as to the cost of the undertaking should be supplied. I expressed the same opinion as a number of honourable members on this side of the House, who maintained that the details supplied were insufficient, and that the matter should be referred to the Public Works Committee before the House was asked to come to a decision. In fact, an amendment was moved by an honourable member on this side of the chamber, which I supported, to the effect that the question should be referred to the Public Works Committee.",30
126,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,The honourable member might say who moved the amendment.,30
127,Mr DUNCAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,HUGHE S - I will leave that to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) who will have an opportunity of speaking.,30
128,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,The honourable member might as well pillory a member of the Government.,30
129,Mr DUNCAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"HUGHE S - Seeing that I am not prepared to pillory myself, I am not prepared to pillory others. In introducing this bill, the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Hill ) explained that the estimate of £3,500,000 upon which the agreement was based, was prepared on data submitted by the States and checked by the royal commissioners; but that no proper survey of the sections had been undertaken either i u New South Wales or Queensland, so that it could be regarded only as an approximation. This came as a something of a shock, even after the lapse of two years, to those who tried to delay the beginning of the work u n t i l full information could be obtained; and it was a further shock to hear the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) criticize the Government for rushing into the commitments. I think it should be said on behalf of even those members who advocated delay, that whilst in theory they agreed to the proposal as a step towards the unification of our gauges, they wished that the project, being a practical proposition, should be dealt with in a practical way. I thought that, if my memory serves me right, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) was one of those who were most insistent that the Government should begin operations without delay. I have taken the opportunity to refer to the speech that he delivered on that occasion, and I find that he appears to have changed his views remarkably since then. But, apart from his speech, J find that he voted against the proposal that the work should be referred to the Public Works Committee for in quiry and report. The honourable member began his speech well by sayingI do not intend to lecture honourable members on this subject, as did the honourable member who has just spoken, because I believe that they are endowed with just as much intelligence as I have myself. Subsequently the honourable said I appeal to honourable members to put aside party politics and State rights, and to support the agreement. But it was still later that he became enthusiastic on the matter, and urged that the work should be immediately pushed forward.",30
130,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"My statement today was that the Government, long before it in troduced the bill in 1924, should have had a proper survey made. I was not prepared, in 1924, to go so far as to have the work hung up for that purpose. The detailed survey should have been made long before the bill was introduced.",31
131,Mr DUNCAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"HUGHE S - If the honourable member desired more definite details as to plans and costs, he should have voted to have the matter referred to the Public Works Committee",31
132,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,The assurance we had front the Minister in 1924 was very different fro m his remarks today.,31
133,Mr DUNCAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"HUGHES - My point is that as the honourable member followed the Government in 1924 he should be content to follow it today. If a mistake was made then, and I submit that one was made, the honourable member and the Government, and not the Government alone, made it . If the Government was wrong then, the honourable memher was wrong with it .",31
134,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,I wish to put the honourable member right on the statement that . I made today. Mr ACTI NG DEPUTYSPEAKER (Sir Granville R y r i e ) - I ask the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Forde) not to interject.,31
135,Mr DUNCAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"HUGHES - In his speech two years ago the honourable member also said I , first as an Australian, and secondly as a Queenslander, have very much pleasure in supporting the bill. I urge the Government to instruct the Railway Council, as soon ns the agreement is ratified, to proceed with the work as speedily as possible.",31
136,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I did not desire any delay to occur. My contention today was that the Government, long before the in troduction of that bill , should have had the detailed surveys made.",31
137,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE, - I ask the honourable member for Capricornia not to interrupt again.,31
138,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I wished to put that b it member in, sir.",31
139,Mr DUNCAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"HUG HE SI - Now let me put in this b it that the honourable member said in 1924The railway will take approximately three years to construct, and will give employment for that period to at least 1,000 workmen. A railway should not be built specially for the purpose of relieving unemployment, but the construction of this railway will relieve unemployment in both New South Wales and Queensland. For some time past, the Queensland Government has been constructing a number of railways, some of which are nearing completion. Some of the men employed on them will shortly be out of work, and, as they are accustomed to railway construction, they could be re-employed on the Kyogle-Brisbane line. From the point of view of the honourable member, that was a very good reason for pushing on with the work.",31
140,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,I wish to say Mr ACTI NG DEPUTYSPEAKER . - I must warn the honourable member not to interject again. He knows perfectly well that he is out of order. He is really defying the Chair by repeatedly interjecting.,31
141,Mr DUNCAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"HUGHES - The honourable member concluded his speech as follows: I appeal to all honourable members to vote in favour of the bill, which, as it sanctions a big national project, is above party, and is worthy of the support of all honourable members of this Chamber. Having fortified my recollection of what transpired in 1924, I think I am entitled to say that if the honourable member had been fair to the Government he would have withheld his criticism. I do not wish to repeat the remarks made by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Maok""v) a""d the honrsr.ablp. member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook), though 1I have a good deal of sympathy with what they said in regard to tenders. It certainly appears that the private contractors have not been fairly treated. I trust that the Minister for Works and Railways, in replying to the debate, will give honourable members a clearer statement of the position, so that they may judge for themselves as to the fairness of accepting certain tenders and rejecting others.",31
142,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Maribyrnong) [4.45]. - I understood from the statement made by the Minister of Works and Railways (Mr HiU) that by accepting the tenders they did the authorities were able to save about £200,000. That should be considered a sufficient justification for their acceptance; if it is not, I do_ not know what would be. While, in the past, some mistakes' may have been made in administering the day-labour policy. I wish to inform the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) that for 30 or 35 years all the railways constructed in Victoria have beeu built by day labour.",32
143,Mr FOSTER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,This State has an excellent man in charge.,32
144,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,Victori a has had several railway commissioners in that period.,32
145,Mr FOSTER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,I am talking about her chief engineer.,32
146,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,Sh e has also had several different gentlemen in that office. The policy does not depend upon one man. It has been adopted for the reason that it results in big savings to the Government.,32
147,Mr FOSTER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,It is a policy of labour plus piece-work.,32
148,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"It is a day-labour policy, and I am safe in saying that it has saved the State of Victoria hundreds of thousands of pounds which, under the contract, system, would have gone into the pockets of private contractors. In these circumstances, I am surprised to hear honourable members barracking in this chamber for the restoration of the contract system. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr. Seabrook) appeared to have a grievance because the lowest tender was not accepted, but surely he knows, as I and every other honourable member does, who has had anything to do with public works, that a clause appears in every form of tender, which' reads, "" The lowest or any tender not necessarily accepted."" That is inserted for the reason that otherwise persons quite incompetent to do the work, might submit a low tender for it, and consequently get it. In some cases, it is economical not to accept the lowest tender; it might even be desirable to accept the highest; but to suggest that in every case the lowest tender should be accepted, is foolish in the extreme. I know that, from my experience in municipal work; and every honourable member who has had any similar experience, or has been connected with shire councils, must also know it. In spite of all we hear about workmen slowing down, I am sure that no Victorian Government, irrespective of its political complexion, would revert to the iniquitous contract system of railway construction. In the light of the experience of the Victorian Government, surely no honourable member could think of going back to it. If , by constructing this line with day labour, we can save £200,000, by all means let us save it. The honourable member for Franklin is really not up to date with his facts respecting much of the work that is carried out by day labour in this and other States. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Mackay) should know that considerable savings were effected by the day-labour system on railway construction in Queensland.",32
149,Mr MACKAY,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,But we are not debating that point.,32
150,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I have been referring to the remarks made by day the honourable member for Franklin, who specially directed his criticism against the day-labour system, even under proper supervision. I have nothing to say against the ability of the firms whose names have been mentioned. There is no doubt about their financial standing and their organization. The States of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia will not make any direct contribution to the costof this section of the 4-ft. 8^-in. line.",32
151,Mr MACKAY,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,All the States will pay eventually.,32
152,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I suppose they will. The honourable member for Lilley was not 50 querulous in regard to the details of the "" scratch"" agreement when it came before the House some time ago. I am satisfied that if the Prime Minister had been putting his own money into a business venture of that nature be would have been mere careful about details. honourable member for Lilley, who is thirsting for information accepted the assurance of the Prime Minister that the first agreement was sound, although it involved the expenditure of £3.500,000. I can only conclude that "" the whirligi g of time brings in its own revenges."" I have in my mind's eye the picture of the present Attorney-General (Mr Latham) standing where the honourable member for Maranoa now sits, severely criticizing the bill and moving an amendment that the proposal be referred to the Public ""Works Committee for consideration and report. I presume that, since he is now a member of the Cabinet, he will support the measure. At all events, he turned the first sod a few weeks ago. When the bill was being discussed in 1924, the majority of honourable members asked for further in formation. The Government relied on the report of a commission of experts appointed to inquire and report upon the unification of the Australiau railway There was no detailed survey of the route, although, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) pointed out, the approximate estimate allowed a fair margin to come and go upon. I submit, however, that for that length of railway construction, it is difficult, in the absence of a detailed survey, to give anything like an accurate estimate of cost. I am not blaming the Governments of either New South Wales or Queensland. They have a right, as partners i i i the agreement, to be considered. I am not greatly concerned about a deficit of £1,500,000 for a great State like New South Wales. For several, years, heavy expenditure has been in curred in the regrading of the New South Wales railways, and it is possible that, before many years have elapsed, that expenditure will result in the saving of many millions of pounds which otherwise would have been incurred in operating the system in that State. I take the view that where savings can be made ultimately, there is justification for the expenditure of even loan money on work of that nature. Credit is due in this matter to the MACGowan Government, which in it i ated a comprehensive programme of regrading work. I rose chiefly to combat the statements made by the honorThe able member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook). I do not care whether a man is today, a big contractor or not. I believe in justice. I think I know what is in the Minister's mind, because I heard him say, by way of interjection, that one reason why the public tenders were turned down was that they were £200,000 above the departmental estimate. It is only right that the Queensland and New South Wales Governments, which are so vitally concerned in this undertaking, should desire to save unnecessary expenditure, and I believe that, as a contribution to the unification scheme, the work now being undertaken will be carried out under the day-labour system well within the margin stated by the Minister.",32
153,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Echuca-Minister for Works and Eailways) [5-.0] - I thought that, in my second-reading speech, I had made the position abundantly clear to all honourable members, and that there was no room for doubt. I had gone to a good into deal of trouble to get all the. information available, and did not overload my systems. remarks with an undue amount of verbiage, which does not count for anythings. I endeavoured to put the case in a nutshell. The honourable member for Eichmond (Mr E . Green) asked to be supplied with information as to how much of this proposed increase of£500,000 in cost is due to an increase in wages and the adoption of the shorter working week in New South Wales and Queensland. We can only say approximately that the increase in wages and the shorter hours are responsible for £150,000 of that amount. We must also take into consideration the increased cost of material in 1925-26 as compared with 1921. I was surprised at the remarks made by the honourable member for Franklin. He said that the tenders were opened before the sealed estimates were lodged. That statement was unworthy of the honourable member, and it was in correct. The sealed estimates and the public tenders were lodged at the same time, and were opened at the same time. I can assure honourable members that there was nothing questionable about the' action of either the New South Wales or the Queensland Governments or the Railway Council in connection with the opening of the tenders and the sealed estimates. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes) also expressed concern about the increase in the estimate of the cost of the undertaking. Perhaps it will clear up all misapprehensions if I state how the £4,000,000 is made up. The contract let to the New South Wales Government amounts to £1,045,806, and the contract to the Queensland Government £1,130,142, making a total of £2,175,94S. To the amount to be paid for work in Queensland we have to add £75,000, representing the altered basic wage rate in that State. I may add that a similar charge would also have had to be added to the amount of the public tender. The total amount for the tenders, and the amount to cover the increase in the basic wage, would be £2,250,948. Honourable members may be - interested to know how the balance is made up. Provision for the survey of the line, the acquisition of lands, for rails and fastenings, signalling and interlocking, railway station at South Brisbane, also for locomotive depot and transhipment station at South Brisbane, railway and watering stations en route, construction work from South Brisbane station outside that for which the contract has been let, accounts for a total extra expenditure in New South Wales of £112,000, which also includes extra expenditure for a 44-hour week; and in Queensland of £967,000, or a total of £1,079.000. Eor re-laying and strengthening the existing railway between Grafton and Kyogle the amount provided is £670.000. All these amounts, added together, make up the £4,000,000. Had a public' tender been accepted instead of the sealed estimates, which became a firm tender on behalf of the States, the additional amount for which we should be asking would be, not £500,000, but over £700,000. The sealed estimates and public tenders were lodged and opened simultaneously. The acceptance of the sealed estimates will mean a saving of over £200,000, in comparison with the lowest public tender. Mr J. FRANCIS --Will £500,000 present the final additional commitment for the construction of the line?",33
154,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I cannot say that, but of I can foresee no probable additional liability, provided that wages and hours remain for the work as they are now. The sealed estimates submitted by the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland constitute a firm tender. They will have to meet any losses that are made in the carrying out of the work, and, of course, they will have the benefit of any saving that is made on the estimated cost. We anticipate that the amount mentioned in this bill will cover the whole of the Commonwealth's liability in connection with this line - The Government was shocked when the estimates were opened and found to be larger than we had anticipated, but, as custodians of the public purse, Ave had no option but to accept the estimates of the State Governments.",34
155,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,What about the Grafton bridge?,34
156,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I have pointed out to the Government of NeAv South Wales the desirability of the bridge being completed simultaneously Will the completion of the railway. The NeAv South Wales Government fully appreciates the position; plans and specifications haA^e been prepared, and tenders have been obtained. I am informed on reliable authority that the tenders are considered too high, and that the Government proposes to proceed with the Avork by day labour. Mr J. FRANOTS - Are the monetary requirements of the Railway Council supplied through the Minister or the Treasurer ?",34

158,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,I assume that the Treasurer makes available such moneys as are required.,34

161,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Capricornia) [5.16].,- During the second reading debate the honourable member for Boothby (Mr . Duncan-Hughes) quoted remarks I made on the principal act of 1924, and suggested that I had changed my views.",35
162,Mr DUNCAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,HUGHES - The honourable member has changed his view of the Government.,35
163,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That is quite wrong. The honourable member pointed out that .1 did not support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham), that the bill be withdrawn, and the proposal referred to the Public Works Committee. He is quite right there, and I would again oppose any step to delay the building of the line. I opposed the attitude of the honourable member in 1924 because I considered that his attitude, and that of the honourable member for Boothby, was dictated by parochial opposition in their own States to the construction of a line that would benefit mainly New South Wales and Queensland. The withdrawal of the bill, and the reference of the proposal to the Public Works Committee at that time, would have in volved considerable delay in the commencement of construction, at a time when many railway works in Queensland were nearing completion, and hundreds of workers vvere likely to be seeking employment. Furthermore, I regarded the line as urgently necessary, and as having been too long delayed already. My statement this afternoon was that the Government was culpable in not having had the proposal full y investigated between the date when the agreement was reached with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, and the introduction of the authorizing bill in 1924. The Prime Minister, in his speech in that year, indicated that Queensland had not passed a r at if y in g act, and that an agreement had been reached with the two State Governments twelve months before. Thatperiod should have been ample to allow of the preparation of a detailed estimate, so that the House could have been supplied with reliable information as to the cost of the line. The Prime Minister did uot indicate to the House that the estimate he was then submitting was not reliable.",35
164,Mr DUNCAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,HUGHES - Some «f us said at that time that the figures supplied were doubtful.,35
165,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"All estimates are mere approximations, and many are exceeded.",35
166,Mr RODGERS,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,It is about time we fixed the responsibility on some one for exceeding estimated costs.,35
167,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I do not intend to touch on that matter at the present time, but I may say, in passing, that although estimates are frequently exceeded, there are many cases in which the expenditure on works is less than their estimated cost. I merely rose to say that I opposed the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Kooyong, twelve months ago,, on the ground that to refer the work to the Public Works Committee for investigation would have held it up for for some months. My criticism today is levelled against the Government on the fact that during the twelve months that intervened between the signing of the agreement between the Commonwealth Government, and the Governments of the States of New South Wales and Queensland and the passing of the bill in 1924, more reliable estimates of what the line would cost were not prepared. There has been absolutely no change of attitude on my part. The onus is on the Commonwealth Government, and it is useless now to blame the States. Clause agreed to. Clause 5 agreed to. Clause 6 (Second schedule).",35
168,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Richmond) [5.25] On the second reading I drew attention to a peculiarity in the second and third schedules which this clause proposes to add to the principal act. Sub-clause <l of clause 4 of both schedules reads as followsCouncil - The amount of all additions and deductions to be made or allowed to or by the contractor under sub-clause (a) or (b) shall be determined by agreement between a person appointed by the contractor and a person appointed by the council, and in default of such agreement by the council. There appears to be nothing wrong with that sub-clause, but it has to be read in conjunction with the interpretation clause which proposes to amend the definition of "" council"" to read as follows: The Railway Council, constituted by the Grafton-Kyogle to South Brisbane Railway agreement or (except in clauses 44 and 45 hereof) any person duly authorized by the unanimous decision of the council on its behalf. Thus one individual, appointed unanimous decision of the council, may confer with the contractor and come to aii agreement with him as to there shall be an increase or a decrease in the amount to be paid to him. in this case, the contractor is either the New South Wales Government Queensland Government. Although Commonwealth Parliament will be finding more than half the money for the building of this railway it will have no say whatever in regard to any increases or decreases that may be agreed upon by the Railway Council or some person acting on its behalf. If occasion should arise to censure any increased expenditure connection with this work, this ment will be robbed of its power to hold any Minister responsible. I suggest that the Commonwealth Minister for and Railways should retain the power of . veto, and be held responsible to this Parliament for any increased or decreased expenditure which may be about as the result of an agreement arrived at under sub-clause d of clause 4 of either schedule. Because of laxity in the drawing up of the agreement the New South Wales Government Messrs. Dorman, Long and the contractors for the construction the North Shore bridge, the State Government has recently been called upon to incur an additional cost to meet the claims of certain crane-drivers for wages exceeding the award rates. skilled trades it is impossible get men to work at award and the contractors for the Afr. ii. Green. Shore Bridge, behind - the back of the New South Wales Government, entered into an agreement with the crane-drivers to pay them increased wages. It meant that the Government had to find the extra money, and it is - luite possible that the same thing may occur in connection with the building of this ra jway. I u order to protect the ; Commonwealth, I suggest an addition to sub-clause d of clause 4 ' in both schedules, as follows :Any such additions or deductions to be made or allowed to or by the contractors shall be referred to the Commonwealth Minister for Works and Railways for approval or otherwise. In my opinion, the addition of these words would enable Parliament to place the responsibility on any Minister who by the did something which might not be within the scope of the agreement. I should like to hear the views of the Attorneywhether General on the matter.",35
169,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Kooyong-Attorney But, General) [5.29] - The honourable member will recognize that there are obvious or the difficulties in the way of amending an the agreement which has already been made, and which this Parliament, is now asked to r at if y. At the same time, of course, before ratifying .any such agreement, honourable members should be perfectly satisfied that it is in a proper form. The honourable member is afraid of the risk of further sums being' required from in the Commonwealth because of additions Parlia- which may be agreed to by the council. In contracts for works of considerable magnitude, the most common method of dealing with additions or deductions on Works account of changes made during the course of construction because of deviations from the specifications, alterations of the conditions or changes in wages, is brought for the engineer in charge, who is supposed to exercise an impartial discretion, to give a certificate that the additions or deductions have been made for the between various reasons I have mentioned. In and this case, however, the Commonwealth is Company, afforded an additional ' protection. No of sum can be claimed or paid by way of addition on account of the matters referred to in sub-clauses a and b of clause 4 of the schedule unless it is' agreed to by a person representing the constructIn many ing authority, wlvjch is in this case a to railwav council, representing not merely rates, tVip. Cr>mrnriinwp''Hh but al°o thp States of New South Wales and Queensland. It North is therefore difficult to introduce into the schedule a provislion which would give the Commonwealth alone a veto in relation to the operation of the agreement. The fact that nothing can be claimed by way of addition by the contractor unless there is an actual agreement between some one representing the contractor and some one representing the Railway Council, affords sufficient protection for the public in terest which, in this case, is not only the interest of the Commonwealth, but also that of either of the States concerned. It would be rather embarrassing to insert an amendment on the lines suggested by the honourable member. It would not be in line with the general trend of the agreement, and at the same time it would not increase to any considerable extent the protection afforded by the agreement as it stands. In any case the words suggested by the honourable member would not strictly meet the situation. In order to make his amendment properly effective, he would need to add words to the effect that no additions or deductions should be made or allowed unless the Commonwealth Minister approved. Otherwise the sub-clause - would, as it were, be left in the air. Furthermore, the amendment would set up a most complicated procedure. A claim made by the Railway Council for a deduction, or by the contractor for an addition would be considered and agreed upon by the representatives of both parties, and over and above their agreement the Commonwealth Minister would have the power of veto. The suggested amendment is inconsistent with the general idea of an agreement for a joint enterprise uetween the three Governments. The honourable member could safely leave the agreement in its present form, because, in the case of a joint enterprise between three Governments, it is the only effective protection that can be devised against a contingency such as that referred to by the honourable member. Mr R. .GREEN (Richmond) [5.34] I referred to this matter because this agreement is different from any other which has come under my notice. this case three Governments for m a railway council, which is charged with the work of constructing two lines of railway. ""When two of those governments [149] are acting as contractors under the author it y of the Commonwealth, there is always the possibility of the public in terests not being sufficiently safeguarded. I am not, in any way detrimentally, referring to .those governments. The Railway Council representing the three governments concerned will decide on in creases and decreases in costs incurred by the contractors, who w i ll be two of the governments concerned.",36
170,Mr RODGERS,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,The State Governments may be placed in the position of being judges in their own case.,37
171,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"For that reason I am suspicions of the agreement. ""We may have a repetition of the result of the strike for higher wages which occurred in connection with the contract let by the New South Wales Government to Dorman, Long, and Company for the construction of the No r t h Shore bridge. I suggest to the Attorney-General that, under this schedule, public interests will not be properly safeguarded, the contractors and the Railway Council being, in effect, identical. This Parliament should have some say in the approval or otherwise of increased costs.",37
172,Mr HILL,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,Does not the honourable member realise that if there is any in creased cost each Statewill bear its share.,37
173,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"The Commonwealth is to pay more than 50 per cent, of the actual cost of construction, and will , therefore, bear a greater portion of any increased cost than will either of the States. I therefore suggest that the committee should amend the bill to safeguard public interests.",37
174,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [5.38] - The point that the honourable member has made respecting the identity of the contractors and the members of the RailwayCouncil is perfectly fair, but that circumstance is incidental to the particular method of carrying out' the enterprise. It is a joint enterprise, for which funds are being found by the States concerned and the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) has argued that the ComIn monwealth should have the last say, but that argument could be used equally well on behalf of the two States.",37
175,Mr R GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"The Commonwealth has to meet 50 per cent, of the cost, and yet will be in a minority on the council* and might be outvoted by the other two parties to the agreement.",37
176,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,That position exists respecting the other aspects of the construction of this line.,38
177,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"The States, if they carry out this work departmentally, must be regarded as ordinary contractors.",38
178,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That is so, subject to variations under the agreement. But it would be introducing an entirely new element into the agreement to place the Commonwealth in a superior position as suggested. The whole of the enterprise is based upon the assumption that those who are to spend the money are desirous of obtaining the best value for it . The suggested alteration would, of course, make it necessary to cover the whole of the ground again, and to make a fresh agreement with a new clause, because one party cannot alter an agreement. Other matters might be reopened during the discussion, and I suggest to the honourable member that as three parties are finding the money it must be assumed that each of them will do its best to obtain full value for its share of the expenditure. The clause should be allowed to stand as it is. - Mr Rodgers - Why not let monwealth have one voice and the States one voice?",38
179,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That might have been urged when the Railway Council was originally being constituted. But the original agreement which has been approved by this House provides for the constitution of the Railway Council, consisting of the Railways Commissioners of the Commonwealth and of the two States concerned. Paragraph 10 of that agreement provides council shall have the entire control of (1) the works contemplated by this agreement; and (2) the expenditure thereon; and, in effect, control of every other matter involved in the construction of the work. I suggest, however, that it is too late to review the constitution of the Railway Council.",38
180,Mr RODGERS,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,That is a novel provision.,38
181,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"It was made in 1924. The work has begun, and any attempt to review the agreement, would, I suggest, give ground for serious complaint on the part of the other parties. Clause agreed to. Title agreed to. Bil l reported with .amendments; report, by leave, adopted. Motion (by Mr HILL ) proposed - That the bill be now read a third time.",38
182,Mr A GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Kalgoorlie) [5.45] At this stage the Government might see fit to accept 'a few suggestions from me respecting its future policy. It is absolutely essential that the trans-Australian railway should be ballasted throughout. That work has been progressing slowly, with the result that the time taken in the journey from Western Australia to the eastern States is unduly prolonged. If ' this work were now put in hand, it would give employment to men, particularly in the district around Kalgoorlie. Recently the Golden Horseshoe mine was closed down, and from 300 to 400 men were thrown out of employment. B y utilizing their services we could reduce the cost of ballasting considerably. There is also the unification of the gauge of that line from Kalgoorlie to Fremanble to be Undertaken. I know that that work was to have been carried out by the Western Australian Government, but, unfortunately, it is not in a position to do it , the Com- and while the Commonwealth Government is cot-ordinating with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland to continue the trans-Australian line on a uniform gauge to Brisbane, it might consider the unification of the gauge of the line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, a work which must eventually be done.",38
183,Mr SPEAKER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE," The honourable member is dealing with matters of future policy. He must confine hia remarks to the bill . that the Mr A . GREEN - I agree with your ruling, sir, but I am glad to have been able to offer these suggestions to the Government. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read at h i r d time. JTJDICIARY BILL . SECOND READING . Debate resumed from the 21st May (vide page 2241), on motion by Mr . LATHAMThat the bill be now read a second time.",38
184,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Maribyrnong) [5.48]. - Not being a member of the legal profession, I am unable to deal adequately with the legal technicalities of the bill. The Attorney-General (Mr Latham) whispered to me that the bill is formal, and might readily pass the House without opposition. I should like to oblige him, but, after all, I believe that a big principle is involved in the bill, short as it is. The honourable gentleman may consider it proper to give pensions to those who are to occupy seats on the High Court bench. Although, in many respects, those who occupy judicial postions are different from ordinary members of the Public Service, there are yet quite a number of public servants filling distinguished posts who are contributors to the superannuation fund. No doubt the legal knowledge and' other qualifications that are possessed by judges are a justification for paying them very high salaries. But admitting that, it appears to me that we propose to make very substantial provision for the years that follow their retirement. Many public servants are performing, perhaps, as important work as that which falls to the lot of those who occupy judicial positions on the High Court bench. In a democracy, the distinction between public officials should not be drawn so sharply as is proposed by this bill. I have not had the time, perhaps not the inclination, to ascertain whether such a provision as this is in operation in Germany, France, the United States of America, Canada, or even Great Britain. It would be reasonable to ask the judges to contribute to the superannuation fund. A number of public servants are at present making substantial contributions to that fund in order that they may, upon retirement, have the benefit of an adequate allowance. They will look askance at this proposal, and they will be justified in seeking a reason for being treated differently from others after they have devoted the best years of their lives to the Public Service. I have nothing to say against our judges; but can it not reasonably be contended that they are merely members of the higher grades of the Service? I understand that the Attorney General (Mr Latham) argued that we might not obtain the services of the very best legal talent unless we made some provision for pensions. I think I can safely say that judicial positions under the States have been filled by men who have been splendid ornaments to the bench. Sir Leo Cussen is a notable example. When he was appointed, pensions were not provided for Supreme Court judges in Victoria.",39
185,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,They were. I did not say that it would be impossible to obtain suitable men for judicial positions under the Commonwealth; my point was that the States offered more attractive termsthan were offered to High Court judges today.,39
186,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,Thei r salaries are not greater.,39
187,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,The provision of pensions makes the conditions more attractive.,39
188,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,Has not the Commonwealth Parliament previously made a general pensions provision for judges of the High Court?,39
189,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Onl y in the case of the late Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Griffith. In his case, special provision was made. It is the desire of the Government to avoid the necessity for taking similar action in future.",39
190,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I voted against that provision being made. When the late Sir Samuel Griffith, Mr Justice O'Connor, and Mr Justice Barton were about to be appointed, the opinion expressed in this House in opposition to the establishment of any system for the payment of pensions upon their retirement was most pronounced. I admit that we have since made great strides, not only in the legal sphere, but also in every other walk of life, and that the services of an expert cannot now be procured for the remuneration that was given when federation was established. Mr Chris. Watson, and other honourable members who were thorough believers in the principle of maintaining the independence of the judiciary and removing the fear of financial embarrassment upon, retirement, opposed the granting of pensions to judges. It was believed that the salary fixed was sufficiently high to allow of an adequate personal provision being made. Mr M . CAMEBON - That is au inducement to "" hang on "" to their positions.",39
191,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That was another reason which the Attorney-General advanced in favour of this provision. He hinted that he had knowledge of a judge who had "" lagged superfluous"" on the bench. Why should not those who are receiving large salaries to the Commonwealth superannuation fund? Rather than make provision for the payment of pensions, I would make the salary so attractive that the best men would be induced to accept judicial positions from the Commonwealth.",39
192,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,That would not meet the. difficulty which arises from the appointment of judges with a l if e tenure.,40
193,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"E v e n if a pension is available, can - the retirement of judges at a certain age be demanded?",40
194,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,No ; but this proposal will make it possible for them to retire.,40
195,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"The same considerations that now impel them to remain upon the bench will operate even if provision is made for pensions. A man who receives £3,000 or £4,000 a year may continue to hold his office even though he has lost some of the mental alertness that characterized him at the date of his appointment, because it may not suit him to retire upon half his salary. I believe that in ' some countries, judges are not appointed with a l if e tenure. The Constitution contains a provision, under .which judges may be retired if a resolution to that effect is passed by both Houses of the Parliament. I wish to speak plainly without 'beiug cruel to those who may occupy seats on the Bench. It would be the bounden duty of any government that believed that a judge had lingered too long on the Bench to ask Parliament to pass such a resolution. If it became known that the House contemplated the passing of such a resolution, the judge concerned would no doubt readily accept the inevitable and retire gracefully. If such a step were in the interests of justice and of litigants before the court, and would make for the better administration of the law, a government that did not take the necessary action would be recreant to its duty. I believe that there are in the legal profession in all the States young and rising men who would accept a position on the High Court Bench for the honour rather than the emoluments attached to it . The Attorney-General must know many men in his profession who regard a seat on the High Court Bench as one of the highest judicial appointments in the Commonwealth. Some of our High Court judges have travelled to other parts of the world, and it only contribute needs to be mentioned in legal circles that they are members of the High Court of Australia for them to be received with honour wherever they go. A parallel position is that of Governor General of the Commonwealth. Our Governor General as a rule draw incomes from sources in the Old Country, and they come here for the honour of the position offered them, not for the salary paid to them. On their return to the Old Country they enjoy greater distinction for having been Governor General of Australia. These positions give a man an opportunity to establish a' reputation he might not otherwise, enjoy. I do not wish to be personal to the Attorney General, but I believe that, financially, he would be better off if he were not Attorney-General. He is first legal counsellor in the community, and I have no doubt that, in his heart, he enjoys the distinction. In accepting the position he must have considered, not the salary, b ut the honour of it , and the opportunity it afforded to him to render service to his fellow-countrymen. I do not think the judges regard their positions primarily from the monetary point of view. I do not know that there has been a request from the members of the High Court Bench for pensions ",40
196,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,I said in my second reading speech that this bill was not in troduced because of a request from the judges. No request has been made to me.,40
197,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That supports what' I have been saying. Many of our judges abandoned lucrative practices in order to take positions on the Bench, and it is safe to say that some of them are receiving thousands of pounds a year less than they would be receiving if they had continued to practice as barristers. They have for years, without any hint of pensions being paid to them, carried out theonerous duties of their office, and I believe that in the future equally gifted men will be ready to serve their country in the same capacity. The payment of pensions to judges without requiring them to contribute towards those pensions makes an undesirable distinction in the Public Service, i have no hesitation in comparing with the judges the men who administer the public departments. It is true that we place a Minister at the head of a department, and say that he controls it , and although he may do so from a ministerial point of view, by placing his signature to documents, the live factor is the administrative head. A Minister must be exceptionally well informed, and have more than the average backbone, to oppose the views of the head of a department and insist on his own views being carried out. Those officers contribute large sums to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, and they are carrying out duties not less important than those of judges of the High Court. I believe that I am expressing the general opinion of the community. While we do not accept the advice of the man in the street on every subject, we should accept it on this. Lf he is consulted he will say, "" It is true that a position on the High Court Bench is one of the highest positions that can be given to a member of the legal profession, but the occupant of it ought not to be specially favoured by receiving a pension on his retirement. No provision should be made for him which is not made .for other members of the Public Service."" I could go to my. constituency and convince any class of audience that it is not right to make distinctions between members of the legal profession and others in the Public Service. After a judge has held office for not less than fifteen years, he will be entitled to a pension equal to one-half of his annual salary. Should he retire because of a permanent disability or infirmity, ""he will, if he has served in the office for not less than five years, be entitled to an annual pension at the rate of 21-100ths of his salary. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) has indicated certain amendments to be moved when the bill reaches the committee stage.",40
198,Mr SPEAKER,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE, The honourable member may not discuss them now.,41
199,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,I understand these pensions will apply also to judges of the Arbitration Court.,41
200,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Parliamen t has already agreed to a bill providing for pensions for judges of that court. Those pensions will be payable to them, irrespective of the fate of this bill.",41
201,Mr FENTON,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That is unfortunate. I repeat that, in my opinion, no distinction should be made between the treatment meted out to different members of the Public Service.",41
202,Mr A GREEN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Kalgoorlie) [6.22] I trust that the arguments which have been advanced by-the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) will cause the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) to recommend to Cabinet that the clause dealing with pensions be deleted from the bill. Surely the Attorney-General will agree that, if a scheme of superannuation is good enough for the ordinary public servant, it should apply also to justices of the High Court, who are in' a far better position to contribute towards a superannuation fund than is the average public servant. The granting of pensions to one section of the Public Service only sets a bad example. We on this side stand for equal opportunities for all. We do not desire that in Australia there shall be a privileged class; but that undoubtedly will be the result of legislation of this kind. The Attorney-General does not approve of trade union secretaries advocating special privileges for members of their unions; yet he must admit that those secretaries are acting in the interests of a group of workers whose remuneration is only an infinitesimal part of that which it is proposed shall be paid to these judges. I trust that he will not persist in advocating the payment of pensions to men receiving as much as £3,500 per annum. What special work is performed by a judge that entitles him to greater consideration than that accorded to the ordinary toiler in some useful occupation ? Judges are usually sons of wealthy parents, and, by attaining to judgeships, they are enabled to rise higher in the social scale than are ordinary manual workers. We have not yet arrived at the stage in which a superannuation scheme is provided for every worker in the country, but this bill proposes to pay large pensions to men already receiving high salaries without their being asked to make any contribution, towards those pensions. I submit that that is wrong, notwithstanding the example set by some other countries. It may be urged that, unless pensions are offered, the most suitable men will not be induced to apply for these positions. I admit that the Attorney-General has a greater knowledge of the legal profession than I have, but I feel sure that there are men in that profession who would accept office without a pension in order to render a public service. So soon as special privileges are proposed, the bargaining element enters. That is undesirable. If a superannuation scheme were substituted for this system of pensions, we on this side should offer.n o objection. ""We believe that it would not prevent men of ability, integrity, and broad outlook from applying for the positions. Should the Chief Justice remain in office for fifteen years, he receive, by way of salary, a total of £52,500, and each of the other judges £40,500. No retiring age is provided in the bill for these judges, so that, should they be still hale and hearty at the end of fifteen years' service, they may continue in office and draw their salaries. Sitting suspended from, 6.S0 to 8 p.m. Mr A . GREEN - This proposal is, in its way, just as objectionable to me as would be a proposal to set up in Australia an established church similar to the Church of England in the Old Country. Both this and that are relics of bygone ages which should not be introduced into Australia. While I yield to no one in my admiration for the work of the Anglican Church in England, I should object to its establishment in Australia as an institution of the State. As a matter of fact, that has not been attempted in any British colony or dominion except the West Indies, and establishment was abolished there in 1868. Some of the bishops of the Church if England in England are - entitled to a seat in the House of Lords. That privilege, in my opinion, should be discontinued. Just as we would not think of establishing a church on those lines in Australia, so we should not think of following the English custom of providing pensions for judges. The provision of a pension is not likely to influence gentlemen of high standing in the legal profession to accept judicial positions. I should be quite willing to provide a contributory scheme of superannuation for judges similar to ihat which applies to ordinary civil servants, and I trust that the Government will consider providing one in lieu of this proposal.",41
203,Mr MCGRATH,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Ballarat) [ 8 . 5 ] - I hope' the bill will be withdrawn. I am astonished that a government that assured the people of its desire to economize should seek to provide big pensions for a chief justice, who will be in receipt of £3,500 a year, and other judges, who will be receiving £3,000 a year.",42
204,Mr SEABROOK,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,Surely the honourable member is not preaching economy!,42
205,Mr MCGRATH,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I shall never preach economy of the kind that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) will advocates. . H is idea of economy is to cut Is. a day off the workers' wages. He lives in the spirit of the times in his own State described in Marcus Clark's book, For the Term of his Natura l L if e . We should effect many necessary social reforms before thinking of providing pensions for highly-paid judges. For in stance, we should provide a pension for widows. Under present conditions if a family breadwinner is cut off his widow is obliged to go out and work for her children, when she should be able to remain at home and care for them. We should say to her, "" Your place is at home looking after your children; you ought not to be doing other people's washing for a l i v in g . "" What happens now is cruel in the extreme. But although proposals for the expenditure of £34,000,000 on migration, and for the payment of substantial pensions to judges in receipt of £3,500 a year, come before us we hear nothing from the M in is try about the introduction of a bill to provide pensions for widows. We should also liberalize the conditions governing the granting of invalid pensions before giving any attention to this proposal. Under present conditions it is not possible for even a totally-incapacitated person to obtain the invalid pension unless a medical practitioner will certify that he is permanently totally incapacitated. There are always hundreds, if hot thousands, of men and women in the community totally incapacitated for months at a time, and actually destitute, who cannot obtain a pension because they are not permanently totally incapacitated. They cannot earn a shilling, and yet we are prepared to leave them to starve by the wayside. A man who breaks his leg is surely totally in capacitated 1oi a time, yet he cannot obtain a pension, though judges who may have been receiving a salary of £3,000 or more a year for 20 or 30 years are to have a pension of £1,500 a year. I am not opposed to the principle of paying pensions. I believe that every person, on reaching the age of 60 years, should be entitled to a pension - without the stigma of charity attached to it .",42
206,Mr MAKIN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,Pensio n by right.,43
207,Mr MCGRATH,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That is so. Every man who works produces sufficient to proride his wages and also a pension on reaching the age of 60. To-day the minority is living in luxury on the profits gained from the work of the majority, who have to struggle to make ends meet, and may not even accept pensions in their old age without the stigma of charity attached to them. Salaried judges should be placed in the same position as salaried civil servants. I Government desires to provide pensions to needy classes in the community, I suggest that it should give some attention to the claims of members of Parliament, and treat thera, from the pension standpoint, in the same way that it treats civil servants.  tenure ?",43
208,Mr MCGRATH,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"If the honourable  his work honestly, and guards the interests of his constituents well, he may have a life tenure of office, but at present he is only an apprentice. If he tears up any more Australian cloth in this House he is most unlikely to have a life tenure. Members of Parliament are not likely to get rich on their salary. At the moment I am not advocating the increasing of it,"" but I sec the possibility of that being necessary after the transfer is made to Canberra. An honourable member who does his honest duty to his constituents is unable at the same time to engage successfully in any line of ordinary business, I know that, for I have tried to build up both a grocery and a fruit and greengrocery business, and have failed in both cases. It is impossible to devote the necessary attention to business detiils. And after ten or twenty years in Parliament, it is very difficult for an honourable member successfully to take up outside occupations, or to pick up the tools that he left so many years before. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes) can afford to smile, for I understand that he has an income of £20,000 a year. I do not complaiu of that, but I must say I envy him. No proposition has been made by the Government to provide a pension for members of Parliament. You, Mr. Speaker, know how difficult it is for even honourable members who hold Ministerial rank to make ends meet. I suggest to the Government that before it gives any further consideration to the provision of pensions for judges, or to the spending of millions of money in bringing migrants here, it should do its duty to our own people. It should say to widows with young families "" If it were necesbary for you to be at home with your children before their father died, it is a thousand times more necessary for you f the to be home with them afterwards."" We should not force them to go out into the world to earn a living for themselves and their families^ The Government should also give ""more consideration to those who fall by the wayside, and who, while not permanently totally incapacitated, are temporarily totally incapacitated. The invalid pension should be available to them. I am strongly opposed to the bill, and I trust that, even at this eleventh hour, the Government will with-' draw it.",43
209,Mr BEENNAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Batman) [8.15] - I cannot claim the honour of representing the Leader of the Opposition on this occasion, but I remind honourable members that he had secured the adjournment of the debate and proposed to speak on the bill, and to oppose, on principle, its passage. I do not think that anybody will very strongly object to that portion of the bill which is designed to prevent the too early translation of the High Court to the airy and healthy, but somewhat bleak, plains of our new country residence at Canberra. It seems to me an act of mercy on the part of the Government to propose that, by the easy method of proclamation, the High Court shall be enabled to function a little longer in more comfortable circumstances than would obtain if the head-quarters of the court were almost immediately, in accordance with the Constitution, transferred with the Seat of Government to the Federal Capital. In regard to the general question of pensions for judges of the High Court, it is a little. invidious to have to discuss the monetary of those gentlemen while they are still in the flesh; indeed, it is at all times to discuss anybody's wages publicly. But the principle involved in this bill makes it necessary for members .of the Opposition to be articulate, and to express fearlessly and firmly the views they hold. Members of the Labour party have a very definite mandate in regard tf questions such as that raised by this bill, and unquestionably that mandate not include large grants out of the public revenues to those who are most ably situated while so much remains to be done for those who are in real need of assistance. The judiciary constitutes a very important part of the scheme, and theHigh Court itself occupies an honoured place in the Constitution. I do not propose to use my position in this Parliament to give expression to anything which would derogate in the least degree from the honour which is due to the gentlemen who have the distinction of occupying seats in the highest court of the land. I am prepared to admit that their duties, although genial, and well within their and power, are fairly exacting, have been rendered more the peculiarities of the under which they work. They have been appointed the umpires to determine disputed cases just what this has endeavoured to say, what is the will of the people as expressed through liament, and what was the intention when they approved of the written Constitution. Sometimes judges of the High Court have been subjected to somewhat unfair criticism. one occasion I listened in this chamber to strictures passed upon the judiciary the honourable member for Richmond R. Green), who asked whether the High Court or this Parliament was to rule in Australia. An inquiry of that kind could arise only from a misunderstanding the position of the High Court in tha constitutional scheme. If the position of the judges is clearly understood, one may quarrel with their judgments on particular matters, one must, in fairness, acknowledge that they are endeavouring to do honestly-and for the most part are Mr Brennan. doing ably-the job for which they were appointed, and which, under the Constirewards tution, either they or some other jurists must do, namely, as umpires, to interpret embarrassing the meaning of the written laws we pass and the Constitution under which we work. They have, of course, other powers .and duties with which I am not at present concerned. It is true that judges are recruited from a class of society in which I , as a legislator of the Labour party, am not at least primarily in terested but those on the High Court does bench have maintained a high . standard of rectitude and . ability that comfort- bears favourable comparison with that of the judiciary of any . other country. Although it might not be seemly to discuss the judges individually, Eederal I feel bound to say that the High Court, as at present constituted, is more liberal and Federal in its outlook, and more courageous in its federalism, than was the High Court of the earlier days of federation.",43
210,Mr GREGORY,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That is arguable. Mr BRENNAN. - The statement may be open to argument, but it is indisputable that the High Court as constituted con- fco-day interprets in a wider sense the grasp powers of this Parliament, which, inciand dental to the broader and more Federal so by outlook of the court, ' has been in a Constitution measure enfranchised.",44
211,Mr GREGORY,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,But the High Court in has a duty to the States .as well as to Parliament this Parliament.,44
212,Mr BRENNAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That duty remains. Par- The fact is that the late Chief Justice people's Sir Samuel Griffith, great law-giver and eminent jurist as he undoubtedly was, the took a view which in the clash between Federal and State authorities was usually On favourable to the pre-eminence of the State. I have already admitted that the by views of the judges were in each case (Mr honestly held and quite free from any conscious political or other bias, although, unfortunately, it is quite impossible to get r i d of that unconscious bias of which is caused by environment, training, and the sphere in which one is educated and developed. It is undoubted that in however a number of ways recent decisions of the High Court have, in effect, reconstructed the ambit of the powers of this Parliament. I need only instance the recent decision regarding State instrumentalities, and that other judgment in the Engineers case by which the doctrine of implied prohibitisn was Bet aside. Both those decisions enlarged, in effect, the powers of this Parliament. Even in the more recent Cinema case, in which the High Court again overruled in part an earlier decision of that t r i bunal, the powers of the Federal A r b i tration Court were incidentally widened. Of course the H i gh Court does not, and cannot in fact, deliberately enlarge or diminish the powers of this Parliament. All it can do is interpret what Parliament has enacted, but the views of the learned judges are very important in their effect upon the Commonwealth Parliament's constitutional power to legislate. For that reason, their decisions are of vital coucern to us who labour, sometimes so ineffectually, under constitutional limitations, some of which we are even now endeavouring, as the Labour, party on previous occasions endeavoured, to remove, by means of a referendum. So I submit that the exacting and responsible duties of the H i gh Court are rendered more difficult by the limitations which we have imposed upon ourselves, in a measure to our own undoing, and by the resultant complications which the H i gh Court must unravel as best it can. I have endeavoured to put on record my view as to the eminence of the justices of the High Court in the judicial world, and as to their f a it h f u l discharge of the very ouerous duties resting upon them. But I cannot find any principle upon which this Parliament should agree to the payment of substantial pensions to these members of the Public Service any more than to any other members of the Public Service, or to those persons referred to by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH), who, by virtue of their special and peculiar necessities, have claims ipon the government in any civilized society. The Attorney-General said that our judges were the only persons in the Commonwealth Public Service not drawing pensions, and he contended that they should be the first to whom pensions should be given. I presume the honourable member was referring to the fact that by virtue of recent legislation a superannuation scheme is applicable to the various grades of the Commonwealth Public Service. That is a scheme to which I lent and would lend again my full support, because I think it sound in principle; and I should be quite agreeable if it were proposed that our judiciary should participate in such a scheme. But surely the Attorney-General knows that in the early days of this Parliament the propriety of granting pensions merely for length of service, and for which members of the Public Service would qualify after ceasing to belong to it was hotly debated and decided against for very good reasons. At a later date, on the 19th December, 1918, we were discussing a proposal to give a special pension to the then Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, Sir Samuel Griffith, I ventured some remarks which I think are applicable to the present circumstances. I said-Bearing in mind the question of pensions to the aged and the invalid, I contend that the only ground on which pensions of any kind are justifiable in a civifized and progressive comimunity is to make provision for those exceptional cases of sickness, invalidity, and weakness which cannot be provided for by any just system of distribution of the world's good things. I say this, quite recognizing the fact that it may be'suggested for a moment that I am giving only half-hearted support to old-age and invalid pensions. I give these pensions a full measure of support, because they represent just those exceptional cases for which any civilized community must make provision, even though the wealth of the community were distributed with ideal fairness. The cases I referred to. include, of course, by implication, widows and infants not otherwise provided for ; in a word, they include all persons who through no fault of their own find themselves unable to make adequate or, perhaps, any provision for themselves. I claim that it is t h t first duty of a properly ordered nation t"" take such cases to itself. This may be described as socialism, but if any test, humanitarian or christian, is applied to it , it will be admitted that any society which pretends to be ordered and decent cannot overlook the claims of such persons upon it . In the course of the Fame debate in 1918 the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) made a very usef u l contribution from which I shall quote. He said' A distinct and definite offer was made to him of the highest legal .position in the Commonwealth. There was no monetary inducement for him to accept the offer-indeed , the acceptance of it meant a financial loss to him. But one remembers that the position he was offered was one of very great honour, such as no man would lightly set aside. I , for one, have no doubt that Sir Samuel Griffith, conscious as he was of his mature powers, and keenly alive to the important duties that would attach to his new position, felt that in accepting it he would be able to render very valuable service to the Commonwealth. That conviction, 1 believe, was largely the determining factor in inducing him to accept the position. Tho terms of the offer that was then made to him-'becaus e it was a distinct and definite olFer - were very specific. ' Sir Samuel Griffith was offered the position of Chief Justice of the Commonwealth at a salary of £3,500 a year, and no pension. On those terms Sir Samuel Griffith accepted the position, and the same remark applies to the present occupants of the High Court bench. A further quotation from the speech of the honourable member for Fawkner is more applicable to my present argument, because he went on to sayThe fact that the Chief Justice occupies a high and responsible position entitles him to no more credit for faithfully doing his duty than is due to the humblest servant of the State who renders honest, conscientious service. If that be so, I should like to know on what ground this proposal of the Government can be justified. That is-my difficulty. It is such a proposal as this that brings us hard up .against a painful fact- a fact that, to my mind, is a standing reproach to our social system. I mean the fact that there are in our community men and women who are engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle with poverty, and who are living continually within measurable distanceof actual want. I use that quotation in support of the policy adopted by the Labour party in regard to matters of this kind, that pensions should be payable only to those who are unable through no f a u l t of their own to make provision for themselves, and that it is the duty of society to see that such persons are maintained out of the common purse.  will recognize that the value of the salaries received by the justices of the High Court has greatly depreciated in recent years.",44
213,Mr BRENNAN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I quite recognize that, but the honourable member's interjection, while it might fair l y be used in favour of an increase in salary, cannot be used in favour of setting _ up . the entirely new principle of granting pensions, not as a reward for .services rendered, in the sense that a salary is, but as compensation given at the public expense for an indefinite period after the services have ceased. The two things are quite different. I have never moved in this House for a reduction of salaries, nor have I ever, to my recollection, supported any proposal to reduce a salary. The Labour party, of which I am a member, has always taken the stand that it is sound economy to pay good salaries and good wages to workers. The honourable member will see that the proposal before the House is to resuscitate a system which found great favour in older and more unregenerate days than the present, but which, with the coming of the new Commonwealth, and the birth of new ideals, was properly discarded by our earlier statesmen, including Labourstatesmen. Referring to the first portion of the quotation I have made from the speech of the honourable member for Fawkner, the present judiciary has undoubtedly entered into a contract with the people. It is no doubt true that all the justices, in accepting positions on the High Court bench, made certain financial sacrifices, but after all they are not the only persons who have made financial sacrifices to serve the publio. It is to the credit of the British race that the allurements of public office have always been sufficiently strong to induce men to make sacrifices in order to serve the public. As the honourable member for Ballarat has indicated, many men have made personalsacrifices upon entering this Parliament; others who came into this Parliament and - gave promise of distinguished public service to the Commonwealth, have had to relinquish their seats because of the financial sacrifices involved in retaining them. Though some may have listened to the observations of the honourable member with a cynical smile on their lips, I venture to say that when those who today are giving their whole lives to their political activities are called hence- I hope that it will be a long time before they are-ther e will be little for the collector of taxation to gather from many of their estates in the way of probate duties. The Attorney-General himself is a standing example. He has made substantial monetary sacrifices hy coming into this House, fired by ambition, no doubt, and the feeling that he can do something for his country according to his view. For this he will certainly receive no thanks from the members of the Opposition, and nothing in the way of a pension should anything unforeseen happen to him. I am not free at present to refer fo amendments which have been foreshadowed for consideration in committee, but for the present, at all events, I am opposed on principle to second reading of the bill . It is wrong crepit. to apply to one small section of the Public Service, a new principle of ward that is not applied to other memdrastic bers of it . That is quite out harmony witli the policy of this party, which stands for pensions and State tain age. aid for those in need. I should bo quite prepared to join in with of superannuation similar to that applying to the Commonwealth Service, but am not prepared to revive a system which was condemned many years ago by the have Labour party for reasons which still for m . hold, and by men of other schools thought, and which has ceased to operate in the Commonwealth Public Service. Therefore, I am opposed to the second reading of the bill.  - I admit without hesitation that I am loath to support the bill. not at all enthusiastic in supporting this measure. I am sorry that we are practically forced to support the bill owing to the position in which the Gothey vernment is placed. It would have been better if the Government had placed the whole position before Parliament, and allowed honourable members to reconstruct the arrangements for the payment and retirement of judges. We know that i is difficult to persuade capable legal to give up private practice to take a posisupporting them. tion on the High Court Bench, because they realise that by so doing they have to make considerable financial, sacrifices. The judges should be paid a commenmy surate salary. I am not at all averse from paying a high salary so long as efficient service is rendered for it . age of retirement should be fixed, as most other cases, at 65 years.",46

I know that the judges of the High Court, if practising in the ordinary way, would be able to obtain enormous are fees.

Unless we fix a retiring age, it is possible that the judges of the High Court may continue to the occupy the Bench until they become deThe Attorney-General should have introduced a measure giving honorreable members an opportunity to make alterations in the present system of of appointing High Court judges, and to provide for their retirement at a cer",47
215,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That cannot be done any scheme under the Constitution.  I Government must be faced with considerable difficulty, otherwise it would not introduced the bill in its present A few months ago the New of South Wales Parliament went through the same procedure, and although the majority of its members supported the Government, yet individually they had no likin g for the principle of pensions I am The High Court has acquitted itself with honour. No one will question the ability of the judges, nor the efficient manner in which carry out their duties. I am sorry,, indeed, that Ave have to support a measure of this kind, particularly as I have not hesitated to express my opinions outside. I do ""not wish to be inconsistent, and if honourable members opposite can t show me in what way the bill can be men improved, I shall have no hesitation in",47
216,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Capricornia) [ 8 . 5 3 ] - I have listened with interest to the speeches on the bill, and I should be lacking in duty as a representative of the people of Australia if I did not say definitely that I am opposed to it . The honourable  in stated that he was loath to support the bill. I feel sure that he is totally opposed to the principle of paying . pensions to highly-paid public servants like the justices r f the High Court. I have When the no wish to say one word against personally, because fortunate in having a judiciary' that is above reproach. The judges of the High Court undoubtedly in the front rank in their to profession. They are men of high in tegrity, and, therefore, it is very unpleasant for any honourable member to discuss .their financial position in this House. But the Government's proposal to pay huge pensions to - High Court judges, men who are in receipt of in comes of f r o u £3,000 to £3,500 a year, shows that Ministers do not view, this matter from a true perspective. The judges cf the High Court have undoubtedly done good work for the country; but, in cricket phraseology, "" they have been on a good wicket."" They have trodden the primrose path in life. They have not experienced th°, trials and tribulations of the working man, trying to keep a wife and family on a small wage. It is reasonable to assume that the judges of the High Court, prior to their elevation to that position, practised at the bar as first class barristers. Such men, between the ages of 30 and 70 years, would make an average income of about £3,000 a year, and over the 40-years' period would have earned about £120,000. A man earning £6 a week during the same period would have received only £12,000. There is no talk of a general pension f u n d for the worker when he retires from his occupation, or for his widow.",47
217,Dr MAXONEY,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,They have the old-age pensiou only.,48
218,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"That is so; and before they get it , they have to prove that they are destitute. The High Court justice is not asked, under this b i l j, to do that. There is no government proposal about a widow and orphans' f u n d , or a motherhood endowment scheme, to assist those who are in dire distress. The members of the judiciir y have had the opportunity of attending universities to receive the legal training necessary to enable them to become barristers and judges of the High Court. They have had a particularly rosy existence compared with that of the average man, who has to battle for a livin g without the opportunity of getting the higher education and a profession. I object to the policy of ""greasing the fat pig,"" and helping those who are comparatively affluent. A man can devote himself to no more noble work than the service of his country; but I do not fch nk that he is deserving of a large pension just because he has accepted a position on the High Court Bench. No doubt the judges of the High Court consider that they occupy a - high and distinguished position, and they accepbed it knowing what it entailed. The Attorney-General in formed us that no member of the High Court Bench has suggested that they should receive a pension, yet the Government intends to give huge pensions to the judges who have been fortunate enough to receive large emoluments for a great number of years. A man who devotes himself to the public service of his country performs a noble work, whether he occupies the position of shire councillor, municipal councillor, member of a State or member of the Federal Par? liament. He willingly abandons his previous income in most instances, whatever it may have been prior to entering public life. There have been in stances of, men sacrificing business and other interests in order to enter Parliament. The Attorney-General himself is an instance. No doubt he could earn considerably more if he were practising his profession outside. I know that a great many men who have been prepared to serve their country in that way have not asked for a pension. They have been prepared to undertake public duties because they recognized that they were receiving one of the highest honours which the people could confer upon them. ""When the late Sir Edmund Barton was Prime Minister of Australia, the proposal was advanced to pay pensions to High Court judges. What was its fate? H a nsard, at page 1245, Vol. XIII . , shows that the proposal was supported by twenty honourable members, and opposed by 29. A division upon the same matter, taken in the Senate on the 6th August, 1903, resulted in its being defeated by fourteen votes to three. I feel sure that if the question were now decided on non-party lines a majorit y of honourable members would vote against it . Unfortunately, judges in several States of Australia are appointed for life. That is the position of the. judges of the High Court of Australia. Many men retain their mental faculties unimpaired up to a late age, but others are not fit for the onerous duties that they are called upon to perform after they have reached the age of 70 years. A public servant is forced to retire at the ago of 60 years or not later than 65 years. Why, then, should judges of the H i gh Court not be compelled to retire at the age of 70 years at least) I have read with interest some remarks that were made many years ago in this House iby a gentleman who has since earned very great distinction; I refer to Major General MCCay. Speaking on the question of pensions, he voiced the followingopinionI do not see why a judge, with a salary of £3,000, should get a pension, any more than a post-office messenger, with a salary of .{100 or '£200. A judge has a better chance of providing for his old age than the average working .man. I bring those remarks under notice because some honourable members are greatly inclined to study the interests of persons who occupy high places, yet they are loth to consider the needs of tliose who are more lowly placed. On the 10th September, 1924,1 moved in this House that the old-age and invalid pensions be increased from 17s. 6d. to £1 a week. That proposal received very short s h r if t from the Government. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes) will remember that he hotly opposed the increase, stating that the finances of the country were not in a sufficiently strong position to warrant it . I have no doubt that to-night he will record his vote in favour of giving pensions to judges who are in receipt of salaries from £3,000 to £3,500 per annum, so that when they desire to retire they may receive an annual pension of £1,500 to £1,750. We must treat all classes equitably. ' Barristers and judges have less difficulty in earning a competence than had those unfortunate people who, in the evening of their lives, are granted only £ 1 a week, when they prove they are destitute. The following honourable members voted against motion that I moved in 1924:- Mr . Atkinson, Mr Bruce, Mr D . Cameron, Mr Cook, Mr Corser, Mr Duncan Hughes, Mr F . Francis, Mr J . Francis, Mr Gardner, Mr Gregory, Mr H u r r y , Mr Jackson, Mr Lister, Mr Mackay, Mr Mann, Mr Manning, Dr Earle  Seabrook, Mr Stewart, Mr Whitsitt, Mr Hunter, and Mr Marr . Only the members of the Labour party, who sit on this side of the House, supported my proposal. On the present occasion, I have not the slightest doubt that every honourable member opposite will vote to give pensions to highly paid judges, although at that time they would not agree to in crease the old-age and invalid pensions The view of the Government was expressed in the following statement:In view of the state of the finances, an increase in the rate of old-age pensions is at the present time not considered justifiable. That was cold sympathy for the aged and infir m people who were anxiously desirous of obtaining an increase. The same Government now admits, through the mouth of the Attorney-General (Mr . Latham) , that judges of the High Oourt have not asked' for a pension; but that it thinks it a fair thing to give it to them. Major-General MCCay spoke correctly when he said that a High Court judge had no more right to expect a pension than a telegraph messenger. Sir Will i a m Irvine is a very distinguished member of the legal profession, and a man for whom I have a high regard. Some years ago, when the Labour party urged that a pension should be paid to ""women on attaining the age of 60 years, and to men on attaining the age of 65 years, Sir William-the n a member of this House-sai d that the granting of such a pension was calculated to sap the fibre and independence of the people. Yet he accepted the position of Chief J ustice of Yictoria, which carries pension rights. Evidently, he did not think that his fibre and independence would be sapped. The Chief Justice of the United States of America receives a salary of £3,125 per annum.",48
219,Mr LATHAM,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,No . His salary was raised this year.,49
220,Mr FORDE,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"He does not receive a pension; nor do the assistant judges the in the United States of America, who are in receipt of a salary of £3,020 per annum. The Attorney-General, in his second-reading speech, said that permanent officers of the Commonwealth Public Service, - with the exception of their Honours the justices of the High Court, were entitled to pensions. I remind him that those pensions are payable in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act, under which public servants are compelled to contribute to a superannuation f u n d . Those contributions, in many cases, i m pose a . heavy burden upon the officers concerned. I should have no objection ,to High Court judges receiving the benefits of a superannuation f u n d ito whioh they had contributed. The At torney-General further saidTo secure the. impartiality and independence of the judges, fixed tenure, not necessarily life tenure, is essential. I agree that the tenure should be fixed, say, ending at the age of 70 years. I do not think that the Attorney-General will seriously contend that it is necessary to offer pensions to members of the Bar to induce men of integrity to accept positions on the High Court Bench. Those are very coveted positions. Numbers of lawyers in Australia, who for many years have been earning from £4,000 to £5,000 annually, and are deriving a further income from investments, would gladly sacrifice their . incomes as barristers to be elevated to the very distinguished position of judge of the High Court of Australia. The present justices have chosen the primrose,' not the thorny path of life. is cast in congenial surroundings compared with that of the great mass of the people. I read interestedly the remarks of the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Maxwell) upon this matter in 1918, and I should like to know what his present views are. I do not think that he would take up the attitude that has been adopted by the honourable member for  poses to vote for the bill, although he is opposed to pensions for judges. 1918, the honourable member for Fawkner strenuously opposed the granting of a pension to the late Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Griffith, the then retiring Chief Justice of the High Court. The honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan) has quoted an appropriate extract from the speech of that honourable member, and I could make a number of other quotations from it , but suffice it for me to repeat his remarks on soldier men who ought to get higher pensions! On that subject he saidThere is another class in our communityour soldier men, who have been fighting other kind of battle in the great world To them we have incurred a deep debt of obligation. I have the honour to be president of a pathetic little association composed men who lost their sight in the Tbey are on the very threshhold of life, and will have to face many years of darkness, as they are fine, healthy young Mr Forde. Many of them have just married, and yet they will never have the pleasure of looking into the face of wife or child. They are handicapped to the end of their lives as wage earners. Some of us have been trying to have their position improved, and we have maae a proposal that they shall receive a pension of £4 a week; but we are practically tpld that the country cannot afford this. The honourable member for Fawkner is a member of the learned legal profession, and he opposed the payment of pensions to judges. The Government is deserving of the severest censure of the people for coming forward with this proposal at a time when we are told that the condition of the finances is not good, when the Commonwealth is asking the States to make great financial sacrifices, and when the Government says it can do nothing more to assist the States because of its own obligations. Such a proposal is the negation of the democratic spirit of Australia.  did not intend to speak on this subject, Their - lot because I felt that the speech of the At torney-General in presenting the bill made quite clear the reasons for it , and I thought the House would be satisfied with his explanation; but the invidious comparisons made by honourable members of the Opposition have impelled me to rise. Socialism is very nice u n t i l it is applied to oneself. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) stated that a judge with a salary of £3,000 a year would draw £120,000 in 40 years; and he then spoke of the poor wretch In who received only £ 6 a week, or a total of £12,000 in the same period. He should bear in mind, however, that if he continues a member of this House for 40 years he will receive £40,000, or £28,000 more than the "" poor wretch "" who is paid £ 6 a week. Will he divide the extra amount he receives with that man ? It is clear that he was speaking only to the gallery. Twenty-three years ago Parliament assessed the value of the judges at £3,000 a year, and of the Chief Justice at £ 3 , 5 0 0 ; but today those salaries are not worth more than half what they were worth in 1903. The awards of industrial tribunals, presided anover, sometimes, by the judges themwar. selves, have been a factor in decreasing the value of money. But the working man of who received £ 3 a week in 1903 is now trenches. receiving £ 6 a week, because of the in creased cost of living. The judges have fellows. a lot of back pay due to them, for if their value was properly assessed in 1903, they are under-paid now. Every increase in the cost of living has affected their income as it has the income of other citizens, and an increase of pay is long overdue to them. I agree with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr . Perkins) that . this matter should have been considered, and the salaries of the judges increased, long ago. The speeches delivered when the salaries of the judges were fixed would probably be applicable today if those salaries were £6,000 or £7,000 a year. To obtain men of the right age and the requisite qualifications, the country must pay salaries. I do not think the people of this country desire that men of high standing, to whom tribute has been paid by honourable members on both sides of the House, should be compelled to leave the bench in want or remain there when afflicted with old age and infirmities. Honourable members have admitted that the judges give a high standard of service, and we have laid it down as a principle, which we have observed in practice, that outstanding merit should be paid for. That princinle recognized, even in the Tanks of labour., for the general president of a union is paid much more than the man who uses a pick and shovel. We have selected from our midst men to fill these high and honourable positions in which strict impartiality is expected of them, and we cannot be niggardly in our payment of them. It is inappropriate to drag "" m y s e l f "" or "" y o u r s e l f "" into the consideration of this matter, much less to make comparisons with the man who works merely with a pick and shovel. This country has provided as well as any country for old age; we have established arbitration courts to . ensure proper remuneration to the workers; we have recently passed a Superannuation Act for the benefit of civil servants; and we have appointed a commission to inquire into national insurance. The judges stand on a plane by themselves, but from the mere stand-point of justice, the House must recognize that the salaries paid to them have depreciated in value during the past 23 years.",49
221,Mr MAKIN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,Hindmarsh) \9.2«] The speech of the honourable member for  more convincing if he wpre more conthis sistent in his utterances and his behaviour. and if we felt that he spoke from his heart. He based a claim for increasing the salaries of members of the High Court bench on the fact that the cost of living has materially increased since their salaries were fixed 23 years ago.  member deny that the value of the judges' salaries has decreased ?,51
222,Mr MAKIN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"I do not deny it , but the honourable member denied it by his actions and utterances in a matter that directly concerned honourable members, a few years ago; I refer to the occasion when we sought to improve our salaries, substantial and pointed out that the conditions of life had changed materially since the amounts then paid were determined upon. The honourable member bitterly opposed the proposal and voted against it . Although he denounced honourable members for seeking to improve their status and make their salaries commensurate with the circumstances of the time, although he accepted the doubtful honour and glory for the self-righteous refusal to dip his hand into the public treasury, and is although he received all the limelight and advantage that accrued to him thereby, vet he accepted the extra payment. On other grounds also I challenge the right of the honourable member honestly to advocate the views that he has ju3t expressed. The honourable member loses no opportunity to display his antagonism to setting up tribunals to consider the wages and conditions of the working classes. ",51
223,Mr MAKIN,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Whateve r attitude the honourable member may adopt, I am sure that other . honourable members will confess that my statement is substantially true. I do not join issup with the honourable member as to the desirableness of reviewing the salaries paid to judges on the High Court bench; but fonsideration of that matter, which, by the way, is not before us. and also the question of providing pensions for judges, which is the matter before the Chair, should be deferred u n t i l after the proDosed constitutional session has been held. It would be much more fitting for us to cons'der the application of a pension scheme to the nidge* after we have detprmi'T'ed the advisableness or otherwise of fixing a retiring age for them. If bill is agreed to a most unwarrantpd discrimination will be sbown in favour of the judiciary against many worthy citizens of the Commonwealth who are receiving the old-age pension. Before, a person can obtain the old-age pension he must submit to an inquisition into the most private affairs of his life. He is asked to state, not only his own financial position, but also that of all the members of his family. He must disclose every minute detail of his financial position, including any amount that he may have to his credit in a banking account, and also whether, at any period in his life, he has made gifts to other people. It is proposed in this bill to entitle judges pension equal to half their salary, without inquisition, whereas the poorer classes of the community are obliged to submit to a humiliating examination to obtain the pension of a mere £1 a week. The whole situation recalls to my mind the text in the Good Old Book, ""Unto every one that hath shall be given, and lie shall have abundance; but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath."" No honourable member could justify voting for this bill while the aged and infirm in our community, many of whom have rendered faithful service to the country for many years, are treated in the present niggardly manner. an indictment of the Government that it should have introduced the bill under present conditions. Even most estimable and thrifty persons in the community who at great sacrifice over a period of many years have made their homes their own, and in the eventide of their life go to live with a son or daughter, have deducted from their pension an amount equal to the rental value of their home. That is absolutely unfair in my opinion; and in comparison with this proposal for pensions for the judiciary, it is intolerably unjust. ""We should place our pensioners in a more congenial and comfortable position before giving any consideration to pension schemes for judges. after we have righted the wrongs that exist may we justly provide a superannuation scheme of universal application. Bu.t, apart altogether from that consideration, our first business in relation to the judiciary is to consider the fixing of the retiring age. Before my election to this Parliament, I was a Government servant, and, as an ordinary Mr Makin. workman, I should have been obliged to retire on reaching the age of 65 years, and so would all my fellow workmen. The Government was of opinion that, when we reached that age, we would cease to give a fair return for our wages. If it is equitable to fix a retiring age for the lower grades in the Public Service, it is equitable to fix one for the judiciary. We should deal equitably with every class in the Commonwealth employment, and give as careful consideration to the humblest as to those the highest in the service.",51
224,Mr WEST,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"East Sydney) [9.43] - I to u should not have participated in this debate but for the remarks made by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse). He is in much more favoured circumstances than the great majority of our people, for he has an income larger than the salary received by the Chief Justice of the High Court. Unfortunately, his success seems to have robbed him of whatever humanitarian ideals he may have possessed. I have been trying for many years to get the Government to liberalize the conditions governing our invalid and old-age pensions, and to.make women who have been resident in Australia for 20 years eligible for a penIt is sion when they reach the age of 60 years>. and men when they reach the age of 65' years without any restrictions; but the honourable member for Forrest has resisted every effort that I have mad^. in that direction. The last three persons that I opened my door to before leaving Sydney this week urged me to endeavour to obtain some consideration for them from the pensions administration. The first of those three cases was a man who, prior to and during the war, was employed by the New South Wales Railway Department at Darling Harbour; but after the war he, being only a . temporary employee, was dismissed to make room for a returned soldier. Only He next obtained a position as steward on a boat travelling between Australia and New Zealand, and after several trips developed lung trouble. He applied for an invalid pension, and the medical officer certified that he was eligible, but the Pensions Department declared that his illness had not originated in Australia, and therefore he was not entitled to a pension. Yet I am informed that that man never even went ashore in New Zealand; his borne was in Sydney, and there is little doubt that his sickness was due entirely to his earlier emthe ployment in Darling Harbour. Another men in the legal profession. case is that of a returned soldier who today is totally incapacitated. have written repeatedly to the Repatriashall tion Department to explain his circumbank stances, but he can get no pension because his sickness is said not to be due to war-like operation's. It is unquestionreturns. able that prior to the war he enjoyed perfect health. The Minister patriation has promised to investigate the case personally, but I am afraid that their earnings. this man has little prospect of receiving a pension. Another claimant with whom I have dealt during the last few days is in the Labour movement. a man over 70 years of age. He is living with his wife, but because she received from her son a sum of £ 3 0 0 pensions of husband and wife have been halved. Instead of worrying Parliament to give pensions to men receiving salaries of £3,500 a year, the Government should exert itself to remove the injustices fered by the aged and invalid who are really in need. I esteem the members the High Court Bench, and I am sure that as men of high principle they not thank the Government for this gratuitous pension scheme. High Court was established less than third of the members of this House longed to the Labour party. At that time Parliament was opposed to the payi ment of pensions to either judges or lic servants, but the party to which belong has at all times maintained that all persons in the> employment of the should receive payment commensurate with the work they perform. I am sure the judges of the High Court have much business capacity as I possess, I am sure that if I had been appointed to the Bench at a younger age I could have taken out an endowment policy which would provide me with sufficient w to live upon when I retired. The judges into paupers' graves. were appointed on a definite contract, and I cannot understand why. the vernment should, without having received any request from them, propose to vary I am not one of those who believe hurrying men off the Bench merely cause they have attained a certain age. If they still enjoy good health, and are in full possession of their mental ties; their accumulated knowledge experience must be of immense value them in the performance of their duties. We have heard amazing statements about enormous salaries earned by gentleBefore I can be satisfied that those salaries are I as high as they are represented to be, I want an opportunity to peruse the books of some leading lawyers.",52

Perhaps to that is the reason why I am still in doubt as to whether this debate relates to the judiciary, old-age pensions, or the working conditions of seafaring men. I trust, sir, that if my remarks should wander a little from the bill, you will extend to me the same leniency as has been shown to other honourable members. Mr ACTINGDEPUTYSPEAKER (Sir Granville Ryrie) - The honourable member must not reflect upon the Chair.  to do so, and if I erred unwittingly, I apologize. Honourable members have discussed old-age, invalid, and war pensions, all of which they seem to regard as relevant to this bill. In 1908, the first old age pensions bill was introduced by the honourable gentleman who is now Speaker (Sir Littleton Groom) ; but the government of which he was a member went out of office before the scheme was put into operation. During the succeeding six months, a Labour Government controlled the affairs of the Commonwealth, and had an opportunity to inaugurate the pensions scheme; but did not pay out one shilling. The Deakin Ministry, in which Sir Willia m Lyne was Treasurer, came into office early in 1909, and the first old-age pension was paid on the 1st July following. Labour was returned to office in 1910, and although the conditions of which the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr M a k in ) spoke with such fervour and, I concede, sinceritya concession he is not prepared to make to his opponents-existe d then, the Labour party, quite consistent with its earlier records, did nothing to remedy them. It was once more returned to power in 1914. and held office for five years, but did nothing to increase the pensions u n t i l two months before an election. The in crease it granted was based on the in creased cost of living. In 1919, when a Nationalist Government came into office with the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) as Treasurer, the old-age pension was increased by 2s. 6d. per week, making it 15s. In 1923 the present Government raised it by another 2s. 6d. a week, and in 1925 again raised it by 2s. 6d. a week, bringing the pension to its present rate of £ 1 a week. The position summed up is that the first pension was paid by an anti-Labour government, and all the increases, with the exception of two, have been given by anti-Labour governments. Erom the remarks of honourable members opposite one would imagine that they are the only persons here who have any thought for those in our community who are unfortunately circumstanced. I should raise no objection whatever to the claim of honourable members opposite that they are sympathetic with such persons, if they would only back up their sympathy with works; but when, unlike us, they do not back up their sympathy with works, I think it is time the boot was put on the right foot. In 1909 the amount involved in the payment of invalid and old-age pensions was £2,900,000; in 1919 it was £4,037,000; this year it will probably be £8,000,000. Nearly every increase has been given by "" dreadful "" National governments, which, we are told, would let men and women who have met with misfortune, starve rather than help them. It is regrettable that such accusations should be made by honourable members opposite, even in ignorance, but the record of honourable members on this side of the House easily disproves them. A good deal has also been said about the manner in which this "" d r e a d f u l "" Government has treated returned soldiers, but that is another accusation which cannot be sustained. The personnel of the Ministry itself disproves it . The Prime Minister is a returned soldier, and there ar« other returned soldiers in the Cabinet, including the Minister for Defence, who has earned the Victoria Cross, and has a long record of distinguished service. I am not at all surprised that honourable members are going out.of their way to curry favour with the soldiers, for undoubtedly the returned soldier votes for us. The history of Australia teaches us that our judiciary has maintained the high traditions of British courts of justice. It is undoubtedly a fact that every man who has taken a seat on the bench has not only made a monetary sacrifice, but has given up many social activities previously enjoyed by him. A judge is, as it were, cut off from the rest of society. He is obliged to abandon many social pastimes in which he indulged with pleasure to himself and with profit to the community. An honourable member opposite has intelligently interjected, "" What rot! "" but if he takes the trouble to in quire he will find that every judge on taking a position on the bench has given up some social activities in which he previously took a part.",53

Many members younger than I may live to see what I venture to prophesy, that when the people have the real power of the referendum, initiative and recall-the power to initiate laws and to recall a member of this House if he breaks his word-suc h a bill as this will be impossible. If the people had that power no government would dare to bring in a bill to provide huge pensions for men who are being paid large salaries, particularly if it was at the same time neglecting to provide for ihose whose faces are made thin by want, compelling them to live on £ 1 a week, and allowing combines and profiteers to grab a portion of even their little needs of food and clothing.

240,Mr LATHA M,GRAETO N TO SOUT HBRISBA NE,"Kooyong-Attorney General) riO.411 - This bill is founded npon general considerations of a publio character. It is not supported by the argument that the present members of the High Court have the Tight to pensions. I agree entirely with honourable members qf the 'Opposition., wlho have said that the present members of the High Court accepted their positions subject to well-understood terms, and have no right to claim anything more from the Commonwealth than the terms of their contract give. Accordingly, it is not on any contractual grounds, or on grounds affecting the individual right of members of the High Court, that the bill is supported, but, as I have said, on general considerations of a public character. Under the Constitution the judges of the High Court must hold office for life. It is important that honourable members should understand that the present judges did not, by their own decision, confer upon themselves a tenure for life as some persons in the community appear to think. They were is fact appointed to their positions without any limitation as to time, and, according to well-known legal principles, were thus appointed for life. The decision of the H i gh Court given in 1918 that High Court justices must be so appointed, only affects future members of the Bench. Accepting, as we must, the position that justices of the High Court under the present Constitution are necessarily appointed for life, Parliament must face the position that the efficiency of the court may require that it should be possible for judges to retire from their positions with dignity and a relative amount of ease; that the provision of pensions is desirable from this point of view is so obvious that it hardly requires to be pointed out. I spoke of these matters in introducing this bill, and I do not propose to repeat now what I said then. While I do not suggest that members of the legal profession who accept positions on the Bench are actuated solely by pecuniary considerations-for I know, in fact, that that is not the caseyet it must be recognized that the judicial positions available under the Commonwealth Government, should be at least as attractive as those which are available under the State Governments. Unfortunately, at present that is hardly the case.
