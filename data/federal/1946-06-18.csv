2,Mr CHIFLEY,HONORABLE RICHARD,"Macquarie - Prime in charge of lend-lease threw all and ability into the service of associated with the winding of America. There is little the strain under which he was for so long, contributed in no resulted in his sudden death. The late senator was elected as the representative for the Division of Bendigo in the House of Representatives in 1929. He was Temporary Chairman of Committees from July, 1930, to November, 1931, but was defeated at the general elections in that year. In 1937 he was elected to the Senate for Victoria, and remained a senator until the time of his death. He was Temporary Chairman of Committees from 193S to 1940, and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in 1938 and in 1941; Vice-President of the Executive Council from 1941 Minister for Trade and Customs from the 7th October, 1941; Acting Minister for Health and Social Services in 1945; Leader of the Government in the Senate from September, 1943; a member of the Joint Committee on Social Security in 1941; a member of the Production Executive of . Cabinet fro m September, 1943; and a member of the Joint Committee on Income Tax on Current Income, in 194.4. He visited the United States of America and Canada in 1944 on a mission for the Commonwealth Government. Senator Keane was a grand party man, and an indefatigable worker for union principles. Prior to entering Parliament he was general secretary of the Australian Railways Union, and he had previously held all leading executive positions in that organization. He was also vice-president of the Commonwealth Council of Federated Unions until that body was absorbed by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. The tributes that were paid to Senator Keane at the time of his death were indicative of the esteem in which he was held by all sections of the' community. He was a great Australian, and his death is a very real loss to the people of this country. Dick Keane, like his former leader, John Curtin, died "" on the job "". I recall his words in the Senate on the occasion of the death of the late Prime Minister.Tolin Curtin is as one today with those tijiliti11jr men of our race who have given their lives that we might live. We in this Parliament here and in another place have los.t a colleague; we have lost too a guide and a friend. The sentiments that he then expressed apply with equal force to himself. I personally mourn the lose of a sincere friend and a much valued colleague.' It is now my sad duty to m o v e That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of the Honourable Richard Valentine Keane, member of the House of Representatives for .the-'Vivisinii f Brndigo from 1929 to 11)31, senator for Victoria from 1937 - ito l!)4(i, Vlce-Pres.ido.nt of the Executive Council from 1941 to 1943, Minister for Trade and Customs from 1943 to .1.940, and Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1943 to 194(1; places on record its appreciation of his distinguished public service, and tenders to his widow, his children, and all relatives its profound sympathy in theirbereavement. .... Mr MENZIES (Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) - I associate the Opposition with the motion, and with the words that have fallen frbm the Hps of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley). Senator Keane, when I first had the pleasure of knowing him, was, as we have been reminded, a prominent official of the Australian Railways Union. At that time, I saw a good deal of his work on behalf of his members in and about the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. In my experience of him, he was always a. shrewd and a wise man. He earned a very well deserved reputation as a champion of unremitting but constitutional action on behalf of all - those who depended upon his services. When be entered Parliament he revealed uncommon parliamentary gifts. These, I believe, were particularly disclosed during the time of his ministerial office. He was an uncommonly good parliamentarian, not only because he knew the business of Parliament 'thoroughly, but also because, whilst being a constant fighter for what he believed in, he was always fair and, indeed, generous to his opponents. As a Minister, of course, he sustained what, perhaps, is not as yet very widely recogniz-ed-the extraordinary burden which office has imposed upon its holders during the last few years. I can speak of that with some little knowledge, gained from my own experience in the first two years of the war, as well as some knowledge of what my colleagues also sustained during that time. Within the la3t few years that burden has certainly not, been lighter. A very great burden fell upon the late honourable gentleman, and I believe that, the sustaining of it .undoubtedly shortened his life. Personally, as we are all prompt, to recognize, he was n. most companionable man, who succeeded in maintaining great personal friendships while at 'the same time maintaining active political opposition. He was, indeed, the most admirable of 0 opponents in the political field, and a good friend. We shall all miss him.",11
3,Mr FADDEN,HONORABLE RICHARD,"Darling DownsLeader of the. Australian Country party). - On behalf of the Australian Country party, I associate myself very sincerely with the motion expressing regret at the death of Senator Keane. To know Senator Keane was to like him. He was a big Australian who possessed ,the breadth of'vision and tolerance which are characteristic of those who are familiar with the wide open spaces of Australia. He was a lovable character, humorous to the last degree yet conscientious in the performance of any task that he undertook. His conscientiousness was one of the factors that contributed to his death. He was another of the great Australians who have sacrificed themselves in the service of Australia. The Australian County party joins with all others who mourn his loss. They have the consolation of knowing that he advanced the interests of Australia and performed his duties with the utmost credit to himself and those associated with him, as well as with complete satisfaction to those who were politically opposed to him. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. ADJOURNMENT.",12

Has his attention been drawn to statements by the former Administrator of the Northern Territory, Mr Abbott, that wharf labourers in the Northern Territory were constantly on strike, that the few ships which did cotne in were held up, and that lie doubted very much whether men employed by the Government did more than three hours work a day? 2.

Is it a fact, as stated by Mr Abbott, that the charge for meals in camps is so low that there is a loss of at least 30s. a week which, with about 1,000 employees of the Department of Works and Housing on the Darwin pay-roll, means a charge to the taxpayer of Â£80,000 a year? 4. If so, does the Government intend to take any action to remedy that position?",13

9,Mr WARD,HONORABLE RICHARD,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The general policy of the Government in relation to the Territories of Papua and New Guinea was announced when the Papua-New Guinea Provisional Administration Act 1940 was introduced into this House in July, 1945. Since then decisions taken on various subjects have been announced and other announcements will he made from time to time as decisions are taken 2. There have been n few isolated complaints which have been promptly investigated, but there is no justification for any claim that general discontent exists. A number of matters brought to notice by the Public Service Association arc at present being considered. 3. A legislative Council has not been established for the Territory of Papua-New Guinea owing to the temporary nature of theProvisional Administration for the Territory and absence of normal conditions and a settled population. As soon as it is practicable to do so legislative powers will be restored to the Territories. - t. The whole of the facts associated with the occupation of the Rabaul area arc known to the Government which considers that a further inquiry is therefore unnecessary.",14

Minister for Mr Francis asked the Minister for notice. Works and Housing, upon notice I. Will he inform the House why there were allowed to develop deficiencies, inaccuraciesand inefficiency in relation to the workshops and canteen accounts of the Allied Works Council and the Civil Constructional Corps in Queensland, inaccuracies and arrears in stores and plant records, over-purchases of stores and the unauthorized use of motor transport in the Northern Territory! 2. What explanation can be given to the House for this state of affairs as disclosed in the Auditor-General's report?",14
12,Mr LAZZARINI,HONORABLE RICHARD,"The answers to the honourable member's - questions are as follows:1. The workshops were established for the purpose of maintaining and servicing plant throughout the wide area of Queensland during abnormal and emergent conditions - It is mentioned that the discrepancies disclosed in the workshop records showed that surpluses were revealed at the latest stocktaking, not deficiencies. Due to the engagement of many thousands of workmen for urgent war work, it was necessary to establish the workshops quickly, and many difficulties, due to shipping and man-power conditions, were met. Owing to the conditions obtaining at the time, it was necessary to call on untrained staff to undertake workshop duties. As the threat of .invasion became ever more serious, so the needs of the workshops rapidly extended, and continual shortages occurred in all types of materials, whilst frequent miscarriages ofconsignments occurred. In addition, materials ordered for specific works were frequently used for other approved projects of high priority, without proper record as affecting the stores accounts. Action wns taken to correct the position, the stores have been overhauled, including their layout and general facilities, and such additional routine installed to correct the position. Canteens in Queensland - The particular canteens referred to in the Auditor-General's report relate, it is thought, to the 0|jerations in the Torro= Strait, area, and on the eastwest road (Teniiaut Creck-Cloncurry). In POTATOES. the Torres Strait area it was necessary to send bulk supplies to Thursday Island, as the central distributing point to that area. The transport and wharves were under Army control, and consignments were not covered by ordinary shipping documents, such as a bill of lading. Confusion naturally' resulted in allocating the correct portions of consignments to the several canteens, and owing, to the isolated situation of the, canteens there were certain delays in reporting shortages on receipt with the result that it was not possible to make immediate investigation. When canteen officers' reports were received, inquiries both by departmental officers and the police proved negative. On the east-west road .it was sary to serve numerous camps spread over distance of 400 miles, and this was carried by a mobile unit, working from a central store. Difficulties arose as the result of the organizagaged tion, and it was impossible to definitely lish responsibility. It is mentioned that, in respect of trading operations of canteens in Queensland, involving over Â£500,000, the losses from fires, pillaging and other causes amounted to less than 1 per cent. Northern Territory - Inaccuracie s arrears in stores and plant records, over-purthe chases of stores and the unauthorized use of motor transport in the Northern Territory. In the Northern Territory many difficulties were met, due to the threatened invasions and dislocation caused by bombing. tion had to develop quickly to meet urgent war-time demands, and due to shortage of suitable clerical staff and the transport difficulties over many hundreds of miles, certain inaccuracies in issue and receipt of stores and I (ant records occurred. Shipping and transport difficulties also caused much duplication in delivery of certain stores, which bad to lie obtained to carry out works of an urgent operational nature for all services. In regard to the motor transport control, the very nature of the country' over which works were carried out raised many difficulties in control of motor transport, and every effort has been made to establish departmental control with the staff available: Due to the fact that nÂ«:ad-quartcrs of the Northern Territory Branch of the Department of Works and Housing has returned to Darwin from Alice Springs, much more rigid control of transport is being effected. 2. See reply to question No. 1.",14
13,Mr FAIIDKN,HONORABLE RICHARD,"the Minister for Works and Housing, upon notice I. Has the Allied Works Council ceased to ""function ? 2. If so, (Â«) when did it cease to function - and (b).what happened to the administrative - staff? 3. If not, is there at present in Queensland - and in the Northern Territory a staff of Allied Works Council officials? 4. What is the total strength of the staff in each place, and what is the nature of the - work upon which they arc employed ? 5. If - such a staff is still in existence, what is - the justification for it?",15
14,Mr LAZZARINI,HONORABLE RICHARD,"The answers to the right honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Allied Works Council is no longer functioning as a council, but certain matters relating to the finalization of the Civil Construction Corps, such as compensation matters, arc still being finalized. 2. (a) See reply to question No. 1. The last meeting of the Allied Works Council was held on the 17th December, 15)45. (o) The Allied Works Council is an integral part of the necesDepartment of Works and Housing. The a strength of the administrative staff employed out by the Allied Works Council has been greatly reduced, and the remaining personnel are enon works activities associated with the estabDepartment of Works and Housing. 3. Yes. 4. The Allied Works Council officers in Queensland mid the Northern Territory arc carrying out duties mainly in relation to the ^isposal of stores, plant and equipment, &c. and It is not possible to segregate the activities of staffs engaged solely on Allied Works Council matters in these centres as, the Allied Works Council being an integral part of the Department of Works and Housing, these officers carry out activities in connection with The organizathe department as a whole. 5. See reply to question .No. 4. ICE CREAM.",15
15,Mr DEDMAN,HONORABLE RICHARD,"On the 21st March, .1946, the honourable member for Rass (Mr Barnard) referred to the price of 1 ice cream and reviewed the balance-sheets of Peters American Delicacy Company Limited - This matter has been, brought to the notice of the Prices Branch on many occasions by the honourable member and he was informed of the position. An increase of profits was shown in 1943 and .1944 as a. result of increased turnover occasioned by the presence of Allied servicemen. Later there was some restriction of the production of ice cream because of the shortage of materials. There has been only one increase of the price of.ice cream during the war year.* and that was , an amount of Â£d. on packeted lines only, granted solely because of an increase of sales tax. The greater quantity of ice cream is consumed in cones' and the price of this has not. been increased. Inaddition substantial reductions have been made in the price of ice cream sold under contract to the services. A recent review of the increased sales tax showed that it would be impossible for this to be absorbed by ice cream manufacturers, and because of the money unit it would not be possible to reduce the permitted increase of Â£d. The war-time company tax has been a heavy impost on companies making large profits, and the benefit obtained by the Government through the incidence of war-time taxation and a reduction of the prices of ice cream supplied to the services cannot be overlooked.",15
