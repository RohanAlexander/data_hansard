' PROPOSED MILITAR Y APPOINTMENT S.  attention of the Acting Minister of Defence to the following paragraph, which appears in this morning's Age :Strong pressure is being brought toy bear on the Acting Minister pf Defence to import from England a highly-trained English officer, who is to take rank ovor Australian officers, and fill the position of director of artillery. ' General Hutton has, it is alleged, urgently pressed for an appointment, and has secured, as an ally, Mr G. H. Koid, the leaderof the Opposition, who is said to have written to Sir William Dyne, pressing the claims of ' a certain candidate. Members are desirous that the Minister should make a statement on the subject before Parliament gets into recess, HO that if Australia has not an officer competent to take the vacant post, and it is really in need'of a trained expert from England, Parliament should be made aware of the position Is there any truth in that statement 1 Has the Minister been approached on the subject, and ' is it his intention to provide the Commonwealth with another military expert in addition to Major-General Hutton 1 - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The newspapers get hold of a great deal of information, but most of it is incorrect. A recommendation was made by the General Officer Commanding of the appointment of other officers, one of whom is, I believe, an English artillery officer, but they have not been appointed. - I intend to explain this and a good many other things when the committee is dealing with the Defence Estimates, but I do not think that I should make a statement oh the subject until then.  of the Opposition has recommended the appointment of an English artillery officer 1 Sir WILLIAM .

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 30th September, vide page 1626S): DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS. Division 20 (Public Service Commissionei-)-£10,294 .",15
14,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," This is a FINANCES . convenient opportunity to consider the ruling given by the Attorney-General, which vote has had the effect of depriving federal officers in Western Australia of practically the only benefit conferred upon them by the Public Service Act - of that State. Section 29 of that Act, which was passed and buildin 1900, provides thatPublic'servants shall be entitled to long service as under-(a ) For six years continuous service, except during annual leave of absence, three on full pay and three months on half pay. I do not deny that this is a very liberal arrangement. It is probably more liberal the than any arrangement of the kind existing in other States; but the conditions of life to in the districts in which many of these officers discharge their duties are altogether different from those which prevail many portions of the eastern States. According to the ruling recently given by the Attorney-General, by which the local authorities in AVestern Australia are controlled, the Ac t is not retrospective in its operation, and the public servants will be entitled to long service leave only at the on termination of six years after the passing of the Act. Although I am not a lawyer, it seems to me that this ruling can hardly paid be sustained; because it amounts to this been - that the whole of the public servants in the office at the time the Act was passed will, - at the end of six years, be entitled the simultaneously to six months' leave of folabsence. Surely no Parliament in its senses would pass a law which would bring stated, about such a state of affairs. The dislocating effect of such a provision could not have been overlooked by the legal members of the State Legislature, and I cannot believe the intention to be that the whole, of the public servants should be entitled simultaneously to six months' leave. The ruling given by the Attorney-General will operate very harshly in regard to men who are serving the Commonwealth upon the goldfields and in the tropical portions of Western Australia. The Government does not need to be told of the hard conditions of life in these portions of Australia, and it will be generally admitted that officers who have served six years in the tropics, and on the - more remote gold-fields, have earned a considerable term of absence. The ruling given practically effaces one of the most important rights of the public servants of Western Australia who were transferred to the Commonwealth. It was always understood that officers taken over by the Commonwealth were to have preserved to them all their existing and accruing rights; and it is curious that these interpretations of the Constitution always operate to the disadvantage of poorlypaid men not blessed with friends in high places. I understand the ruling to be that the section of the Act to which I have referred, not being retrospective in its operation, does not confer any right, but merely a privilege; but it is noteworthy that the Western Australian Government acknowledges that it does confer a right, and that under its provisions they have granted and are continuing to grant leave of absence to the extent prescribed. It should be borne in mind that the public servants in Western Australia who have been taken over by the Commonwealth Government are much worse off than formerly. The Commonwealth Tariff imposes taxation upon nearly every commodity which was previously upon the free list, and as the local Tariff is still in operation, public servants as members of the community have to pay taxes under twoTariffs. The Attorney General will scarcely deny that if the transferred departments were still under the control of the State, the officers employed therein would receive the leave of absence which they consider they are entitled to under the State Act. The officers express themselves as follows :We have just been informed that the Federal Attorney-General has ruled that our Public Service Act is not retrospective, and that must therefore serve six years from the date of proclamation before they are entitled to long Mr Mahon. service leave under clause 29, sub-section (re). This is somewhat remarkable, considering that quite a number of officers in this department, and other Western Australian State departments, have been granted their six mouths under the Act. There may be some doubt about the Act being retrospective, but it has been applied in thab sense all along.. Whether it is so or not, does not in our opinion affect clause 29, which states -""For six years continuous service public servants shall be entitled to three months on ful l pay and three months on half-pay."" The Act does not need to be retrospective in order to give effect to this clause, because it is dealing with a circumstance that continues after the Act was passed. If it had been intended that the six years should date from the passing of the Act, it would have clearly stated it ; but such a clause would have completely disorganized the public service, as every officer would have been entitled to six months' leave on the same date, a contingency which would have been noticed by every legal gentleman in the House. The other departments of this State are not refusing to grant the long-service leave, but we are informed that every application is being dealt with on its merits. We admit that the privilege is an exceedingly liberal one, but it is certainly the only one of any value in the Act, and now we are being deprived of it. In view of the harshness with which his ruling will operate, I hope that if the At torney-General cannot see his way to give a more liberal interpretation to the law, the officers-man y of whom have not had any annual leave-wil l be allowed to take advantage of the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act relating to accumulated annual leave.",15
15,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I am quite sure that the honourable member for Coolgardie realizes that it is neither possible nor desirable for the Law officer of the Commonwealth for the time being to take either a liberal or a narrow view of any issue that may be submitted to him. His duty compels him to decide it according to the well established principles of legal and constitutional interpretation. In this case the officers concerned indicate, in one of the paragraphs which the honourable member has just read, that they have failed to apprehend what appears to me-and I think would .appear to most members of the legal profession-to be the guiding principle of this case. They say that if Parliament had not intended this Act to be retrospective, it would have expressed that intention in clear and unmistakable terms. That, however, is not necessary. The rule observed in the construction of statutes is officers that no Act is to be read as being retrospective in its operation unless . it contains express provision to that effect. In the absence of such a provision, the legal presumption is always against retrospective effect. That has been the governing consideration in the interpretation of the Act referred to. As the honourable member for Coolgardie knows, the late Mr George Leake, Premier and Attorney-General of Western Australia, expressed an opinion similar to that formed by me, although I was not aware of it until after I had expressed my own view.",16
16,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,What Mr Burt said was that it was never intended that the Act should be other than retrospective.,17
17,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Mr Burt's view, as one of those concerned in ""the passing of the Act, of the intentions of Parliament could not affect his or any other lawyer's opinion as to the legal meaning of the measure.",17
18,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It was surely never contemplated that all the officers who - held positions in the public service at the time the Act was passed should, at the end of six years, become simultaneously entitled to leave of absence.",17
19,Mr DEAKIN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"That is a point which would have some, but very little weight, as an argument against the need for express provision that the Act was to be retrospective. What we have to look at is the actual phraseology adopted by Parliament at the time. The legal officers of the Government must have known that, whatever the consequential operation of the Act would be, it could, as a matter of legal construction, be read only as speaking from the day it was passed. The determination of this question by the court will settle, once and for all, whether the public servants are entitled to what they claim under the section of the Constitution which preserves to them all their existing and accruing rights. Those rights must be legal rights to be endorsed by the Constitution. There will be nothing to prevent a decision from being obtained upon this point within the next twelve months. Passing from the legal aspect, I may say that I have recently had my attention called to the circumstance, no doubt familiar to most honourable members, that in all those parts of the British Empire in which public officers ' have to perform their duties in tropical or sub-tropical latitudes, special provisions are made for leave. The provisions in 40D2 the Western Australian measure are not more liberal than are those contained in the Indian, Straits Settlements, and other Acts operating in hot countries. Whether or not the Public Service Commissioner of the Commonwealth is vested with as wide an authority as the honourable member would wish to see exercised, I cannot say without reference to the Act. I am confident however that, if he is not, this Parliament would readily lend a sympathetic ear to any proposal which would allow of special consideration being extended to public servants resident in the tropical and sub-tropical parts of Australia, and also to those settled in the remote districts of the interior, where, though the climatic conditions are less severe, the circumstances of life are certainly as hard. Irrespective of whether or not the public servants of Western Australia secure, at the hands of the court, all - that they desire in this respect, I am perfectly sure that when the time comes for the consideration of that issue by this Parliament, an attentive ear will be lent to any representations which may be made in. thatconnexion, supported, as they mighteasily be, by illustrations from the practice of the mother country in regard to the treatment 6f her public servants in the hotter regions of the world. I am aware that this matter was brought forward when the Public Service Bil l was under consideration, and that some provision was made for it. If that provision is not ample enough to permit of full justice being done to public servants, I am sure the House would consent to an extension of it to enable that object to be accomplished.",17
20,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I wish to draw attention to the many signs of expansion which are evident in connection with the department of the Public Service Commissioner. It seems to me that that depart-* ment threatens to become a very expensive luxury to the Commonwealth, and every effort ought, therefore, to be made to confine it to reasonable limits. I would point out that the special appropriations for the payment of the Commissioner and the inspectors total £4,700 a year, whilst £10,000 odd are absorbed in other directions, thus increasing the total annual expenditure to nearly £15,000. I fail to see why, at this early period of our national career, the department should prove so expensive. I notice that the Estimates provide for the appointment of an examiner at £350 a year ' from the 1st October next, and an additional £1,000 is set down for the expenses in connection with the conduct of examinations. I claim that there is no necessity for holding examinations this year.",17
21,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable and learned member knows that there will be vacancies in the service, and that they must be filled.",18
22,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"There will not be a sufficient number of vacancies during the first year to warrant the appointment of a special examiner at £350, and a special appropriation of £1,000 being made by Parliament to cover the cost .of holding examinations.",18
23,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The honourable and learned member assisted to pass an A ct which he immediately desires to abrogate.,18
24,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Where wiU the vacancies occur to warrant this tremendous outlay? In the Public Service Act provision is made for taking over from the States officers who have passed the clerical examination in those States, and I desire to know whether effect is to be given to that legislation or whether the Commonwealth is going in for a wholesale system of new appointments. Surely the claims of officers in the States services who have passed their examinations ought to be remembered. I fail to see why any examination for the clerical division is necessary during the present year.",18
25,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Does not the Act provide for them ?,18
26,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It provides for the holding of examinations whenever they are necessary, but I do not consider that they are necessary during the present year. - Surely we ought not to pay £1,000 for the examination of boys for admission to the clerical division.",18
27,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,It is for the examination of junior clerks.,18
28,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"No . that in the Public Service A ct provision is made for the appointment by the Commonwealth of officers at present in the States - Services, who have already passed clerical examinations. By adopting the system of making wholesale appointments we are certainly going the right way to damn our federal institutions. Further we are encouraging the Government to continue to make new appointments which are absolutely unnecessary. I am prepared to join with any honourable member who will assist in blocking this public expenditure. I see no necessity for appointing an examiner. At any rate for the first year one of the public service inspectors could act as examiner.",18
29,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Would he be competent to do so ?,18
30,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"If he is competent to act as inspector, surely he would be competent to act as examiner. I protest against the new appointments which are being made in every direction. Unless the committee take a firm stand, I am satisfied that this department will continue to grow until it becomes a nuisance and a curse to our federal system.",18
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has been very earnest and demonstrative in his opposition to the appointment of a special examiner at £ 3 5 0 a year, and to the expenditure of £1,000 in the conduct of examinations. Probably he will be surprised to learn that after the payment of the two amounts mentioned the examinations will result in a credit balance of about £700. The Public Service Commissioner has recommended the appointment of a special examiner and the holding of these examinations from motives of economy, and because a saving will thus be made upon the amount which would be expended if they were conducted by the States in the ordinary way. ",18
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Eac h candidate for the clerical division has to pay a fee of 15s., and each candidate for the general division, 7s. 6d. The number of papers with which the examiner will have to deal is estimated at 40,000.",18
33,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Eo r how many vacancies?,18
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Honourable members must know that a very large number of young men will go up for I repeat this examination; but, of course, only a very few of them will receive appointments. Nevertheless, thej' qualify themselves for appointment whenever vacancies occur. I am quite aware that in the Public Service Act the Governor General in Council is empowered to appoint officers in the States services to the Commonwealth service on the recommendation of the Commissioner. But there is a danger that we should not get the best officers in the States services, but the very dregs of those services. That practice is one to which I am absolutely opposed. My firm belief that the Commonwealth service should be the blue ribbon of Australian public servants. Is it likely that the States would allow their highest and best officers to be transferred to the Commonwealth service t Moreover, I hold that in the future the officers who will occupy permanent positions in the federal service will be those who start from the bottom rung of the ladder and work upwards. In making these remarks, I wish it to be clearly understood that I am not opposed to the selecting from the State services of capable officers whose qualifications are undoubted. At the same time, I am not going to be placed in the position of being compelled to select all federal officers from the States services, thus denying to officers already in the Commonwealth service all opportunity of promotion. In the Post and Telegraph, Customs, and Defence departments, there are a very large number of Commonwealth officers.",18
35,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Altogethe r there are about 12,000 federal officers, I think.",19
36,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"There are about 12,000 or 13,000. These men have a right to expect promotion, and it would be grossly unfair if the Commonwealth always went to the States services for officers who are to be promoted over their heads. The practical effect of selecting officers generally from the States services would be that the Commonwealth would receive only the lowest. grade of officers. Eurther, the inevitable result of such a practice would be to lower the Commonwealth service to the level of the wooden system at present in force in some of the States where men are promoted on the ground of seniority instead of merit. Our. Public Service Act gives the Commissioner power to promote to any particular position in the service any officer possessing conspicuous qualifications. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo appears to forget that we are dealing with the Commonwealth, and not with an individual State. We are dealing with a very difficult amalgamation of the services which the Commonwealth has taken over from the States. The question which was asked a few minutes ago of the Acting Prime Minister shows the difficulty in Western Australia, and there have been similar difficulties experienced in some of the other States, the public services of which are not worked on the same principle as those of New South Wales and Victoria. The officers must be 'keen, intelligent men, able to deal with conditions which are very harassing at the present time. The object of the appointment of this examiner is to provide a means by which young men may enter the service with salaries commencing at £ 4 0 and £ 6 0 a year. These young men have, by examination, to show their aptness and ability, which are also taken into consideration when their turn comes for promotion to higher positions. Such an appointment as this has been urged on the Cabinet . and on myself most strenuously by the Public Service Commissioner. At first I suggested that, "" perhaps, it would be well to follow the example of the States, and employ outside examiners throughout Australia, but I ascertained that the appointment now proposed would result in a saving besides giving the Government more control.",19
37,Mr LE GROOM,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,It will also give a uniform standard ,19
38,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"That is so. Personally I know but little of the details connected with these matters, feeling, as I do, that if a good man be placed at the head of a department it is well to allow him every reasonable liberty so long as hisadministration does not result in extravagance. An officer of the kind is, I take it , responsible to me in the same way that I am held responsible to Parliament.",19
39,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"But surely the Minister will not make any appointment which the examiner mav choose to suggest. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Certainl y not, but I should certainly pay great attention to his suggestions. I hold him responsible, and he should bear the blame for any muddle which ,may arise from his administration. I am informed by the Public Service Commissioner that the examiner will have to go through the examination papers, and, as that is a task which cannot be accomplished single-handed, one or two assistants have to be appointed. AA hen ex7 aminations of this kind are over, the public clamour for the results, and in order that these may be published within a reasonable time, assistance of a clerical nature is absolutely necessaiy. One advantage of the appointment of a permanent officer to the position of examiner is that the Commonwealth will have the benefit of his services for'the whole year, whereas the services of an outside board would be confined to the actual examinations, the papers being relegated to officers in the public service, who, for this purpose, would have to leave their proper duties.. A large number of special examinations must be held throughout the year, and in the absence of a permanent officer, payment would have to be made to boards of examiners. There will be examinations of officers over 21 years of age, who may be entitled to the minimum salary of £110,"" and also examinations to entitle officers to promotion or transfer from one department to another. There will, further, be special - examinations of telegraph operators, switchboard attendants, type-writers and shorthand writers. As I pointed out just now, each candidate will have to pay a fee of 15s. for the examination for the clerical division, and 7s. 6d. for the examination for the general division, and from 35,000 to 40,000 papers will have to be dealt with.",19
40,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"That will mean 40,000 held. applications at the least.",20
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I did not say that there will be 40,000 applications, that there will be about 40,000 papers, applicant having to prepare from four to papers. I imagine that the applications for employment will be more in the general division than"" in the clerical division, the fees are estimated to return something over £2,000.",20
42,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,What vacancies are teachers are available. there to justify this huge system of nation 1,20
43,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,There are extravagant. vacancies in the post-office and other - departments every day.,20
44,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,In which class ?,20
45,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"In various ^classes throughout the service, and promounder tions have also to be provided for.",20
46,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Appointment s can made only to the lower class.,20
47,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"On l y first appointments can be made to that class. All officers transferred from the State vice must go into the lower class, unwhen less they are taken over under the special provision to which I have referred. In latter case the transferred officers are moted over the heads of federal servants, and that is a system which must give rise to great annoyance and complaint",20
48,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Thes e officers expect to enter the lower grade only for the clerical division.,20
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"There are about 60 persons, who, having passed the State examination for employment in the A ic- r torian Post-office, claim that they have a. right whether or not the Federal Government approve, to take the lower positions in the federal service. In order to show that there cannot be such a right, I asked what would be their position if it were decided to take officers from the States service to fill the vacancies. I think that demand on the part of those 60 persons has, to a large extent, ceased; but no doubt at one time it was strongly contended that they had an exclusive right to appointments in the lower grades of this branch of the federal service. I mention these facts to show that the appointment of an examiner will prove the most economical way of dealing with this matter. Throughout the States, at the present time, there is a great clamour for examinations to be'",20
50,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Who is clamouring 1,20
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Applicant s for but situations; and I can assure honourable each members that I have received, perhaps, six hundreds of applications from people.who are disappointed at the examinations not having been already commenced. The deand sire is to have the examinations during the Christmas holidays, when the school buildings and, perhaps, the assistauce of Under the cirexamicumstances, I hope honourable members see that the sum asked for is not I admit' that, when' the large matter was first mooted to me by the commissioner, I expressed the opinion that the amount was somewhat large. It may be remembered that in the last Estimates, various headings, provision was made for extra clerical assistance, and, as some be of these appointments were not necessary, I utilized the money in order to provide sufficient temporary clerks to enable the Public Service Commissioner to cope with his serwork. Honourable members will be surprised they find what work has been necessary in the preparation of Commonwealth reguthe lations to take the place of the separate proStates regulations. Up to the present we have been compelled to utilize the States regulations, but in the future it is intended - and the work is nearly completed-to have regulations applicable to the whole of Australia. . This work has proved most difficult, and the gentleman at the head of the department, who is a most sensitively conscientious man, has been quite upset by a fear that the result of his labours may cause adverse criticism aad dissatisfaction. There is another matter to which I should like to refer. Honourable members will riotice that the salary of the secretary to the Public Service Commissioner is fixed at £600, and I think I am bound to offer some reason for the increase. The amount voted last year was £500, but the commissioner represented that he required the assistance of a man of extensive experience in connection with public service administration. It was pointed out by the commissioner that the public service of Victoria in its regulations and general conditions was perhaps the most intricate in Australia, and he asked me to appoint Mr. Beddin, who had long experience as an officer in that service. But Mr Reddin declined to come into the federal service for a salary of £500, and I then, at the instance of the Public Service Commissioner, offered to place £600 on the Estimates. Of course, I could not say that such a salary would be passed by Parliament, hut I promised that the Government would do their best to have it accepted by honourable members. On that condition Mr Reddin took the position, and the commissioner reports that his services and his knowledge of the Victorian service have proved so valuable that to lose him would be unfortunate for the Commonwealth. Honourable members know what a great number of actions at law have been brought against the Victorian Government in connection with the public service of that State; and Mr. Reddin appears to be the best man obtainable in order to prevent disaster from pitfalls of the kind. It is true that Mr Reddin appears to be no great favourite with the members of the service, but that is simply because the performance of his duties may be apt to render him somewhat unpopular with officers. I hope the committee will look at the position from my point of view, and will not by a reduction of the amount proposed cause the. loss of the services of so valuable s.n officer.",20
52,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,What are the duties of the registrar at £4=00 a year 3,21
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I have not the papers just now, but I can obtain them and give the honourable member the details later.",21
54,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I feel that there is great weight in what the Minister has said in reference to this salary. After a good deal of experience in connection with Public Service Acts, my impression is that it is necessary to have a man of very high qualifications in a position of the kind, and, therefore, I shall not vote against the salary proposed. But with the indulgence of the committee I desire to make a personal explanation. I was not present when the to me House met, but I understand that the honourable member for Maranoa asked a question in reference to a statement which had appeared in the Melbourne Age. In this morning's issue of that journal it is stated that I have allied myself with Major-General Hutton in order to secure the appointment of some officer from England as director of artillery, over the heads of all the other artillery officers. The whole statement is pure fabrication. I was not aware that a director of artillery had to be appointed, or that a person was to be brought out from England in connection with that branch of the defence forces. Since the Eederal Government came into operation, I do not think I have written half-a-dozen letters to Ministers abotit any human being. But it is singular that when I do happen to write a letter to a public department that letter gets into-the hands of the press. I have heard that there is some indirect influence at work in the Defence department in connection with a certain matter, and the circumstance I have mentioned seems to prove the truth of the rumour. I should like to tell the committee the true facts. Some time ago a Victorian, born and bred, went home to England at his own expense, and, entering the Imperial service, qualified himself for submarine mining. This, as we all know, is a very valuable line qf defence, though very few people elect to qualify themselves for such - service. This Victorian, having by examination qualified himself for the Imperial service, now desires to serve his native country, Australia. His object in going home was to qualify himself for service in the defence forces of Victoria ; but the defences now being a Commonwealth matter, this young man-, who is at present in Australia, put the facts before me. Then I did what I think any other honourable member would do in the case of a young Australian who had, at his own expense, so qualified himself. I asked the Minister for Defence to take the matter into consideration, but I made not the slightest attempt to name any particular position. I "" had no idea of any particular position; and I did this, for a man from my own State, but for a Victorian. The Minister for Defence tralia, wrote a perfectly proper reply. The honorto able gentleman did not seem to question merits of the case, but he pointed out just now there was retrenchment in the partment, and that it would be a very awkhaps up to a period of two years. ward matter to make an appointment. That reply I accepted, and I have never since bably at two-year intervals moved another inch in the matter. It singular how these circumstances seem to get out of the Defence department into the newspapers. I have heard certain ments as to a ""set"" being made against this young man, and the facts rather give colour to this idea. I have no objection to Commonwealth. publicity.",21
55,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,But why should the press get information of the kind before it is laid to save expense-that before Parliament ?,22
56,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It is a singular thing it is so, and it lends colour to the made to me with reference to this very case. It occurred to me that when a young Australian goes home and qualifies himself passing examinations, and wins a position the Imperial service, it is highly creditable that he should desire to enter the service of his own native land. Surely a Member of Parliament may write a letter to Minister asking him to take such a case into his consideration! - That was all did.",22
57,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," Wit h regard to the question brought forward by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo in connection with £1,000 proposed to be voted for holding public service examinations, I should like to point out that the Public Service Act which Parliament passed insists upon examinations being held not less frequently than year; because it states that no appointments shall be made from the examinees a particular examination during a period less than nine months after the holding the examination-whic h means that if any vacancies occur ten months after the holding of an examination the Commissioner cannot appoint any one, but must wait until the yearly period is up, and another examinaa tion is held.",22
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I had forgotten that; I am glad the honourable member has mentioned it .,22
59,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I believe we made an error in passing the Public Seivice Act in not that shape. In view of the expense of holding these examinations throughout Ausit would seem to be a necessary thing allow candidates who were successful in the passing a good examination, but were not that amongst the top names, if only twenty devacancies occurred, to be called upon perThen the examinations would take place proinstead of is yearly. That, to my mind, is the only means of reducing the expense which otherwise the Act entails upon us. I take it that statethe honourable and learned member for Bendigo is quarrelling with the proposal involved in holding examinations all over the Does he want this committee to lay down the principle that all examinations are to be held in Melbourne candidates are to come from the extreme portions of Australia that to Melbourne to be examined in order that statement there may be only one examiner 1",22
60,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I did not say that.,22
61,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"That is involved in the by honourable and learned member's contention, in or the alternative is to allow the favorites of the Minister of the day to be put into the service to the exclusion of those for whom we have been fighting so hard. The the House decided almost unanimously that every person, no matter who he was, should I have an opportunity of getting his sons or daughters into the public service by means of a competitive examination. That cannot be carried out unless the examinations are sufficiently numerous to allow of some probability of the candidates getting to local centres. I believe it will be found necessary to amend the Public Service Act has in various particulars with a view of minimizing the expense that would otheronce in each wise be involved.  at loaded ourselves with an expensive staff.",22
62,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I am not now expressof ing an opinion upon that, because it is a very difficult thing for one of us outside the office to arrive at a conclusion as to how many officers are needed. I had a talk with the Public Service Commissioner little while ago about this matter and concerning the working of the Act.",22
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Does the honourable member say that he has interviewed the commissioner ?,22
64,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I had no motive other than that of inquiring into the matter from the public aspect.,23
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Was not the fact published in the newspapers ?,23
66,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Some people might have taken umbrage at it, but I do not mind that. A number of difficulties were pointed out by the commissioner, of whose ability in this connection every one who knows him is quite satisfied. These difficulties indicated the necessity of some modifications being made in the Act. There is one other aspect of this matter that will require attention at the hands of the - honourable and learned member for Bendigo. That is, that the clerical branches of the service cannot take advantage of the minimum wage provision until examinations are held.",23
67,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The public service inspectors can do that.,23
68,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable . and learned member seems to think that all the inspectors have to do is to go round holding examinations. Does he not know that we put into the Act appeal sections which alone are sufficient to occupy the attention of the inspectors for the whole year ? Nearly the whole of their time will be taken up with two sets of appeals-on e with reference to grievances and the other with reference to promotions. The honourable and learned member must take his share of the responsibility for placing those sections in the Act. The minimum wage sections affecting the clerical division involve examinations-to which I took exception at the time they were agreed to. But the provision is there, and no benefit can be derived from these sections examinations have been held throughout' the Commonwealth with regard to the lower-grade officers. Again, with regard to promotions, examinations are insisted upon in some cases. So that the honourable and learned member can see that the machinery of the A ct involves a large expenditure. I am surprised in view of all the difficulties, and of the fact that the centres throughout the States at which examinations must be held are so numerous, that the work can be done for £1,000. If it can be done for such a sum, so much the better. If it can be done for less, so much more the better. But I am convinced that we shall have to alter the detailed provisions of the A ct in this regard.",23
69,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES, I rise to ask for some information from the Minister for Home Affairs. The item under discussion gives us the opportunity to inquire as to what is proposed to be done to those officers who have passed State examinations. I understand that there will be a number of junior appointments to be made in connection with the Commonwealth service.,23
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,That question has already been asked today.,23
71,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Unfortunately , I was not present when it was answered.",23
72,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Are we to have it all over again because the honourable member was not here t Let him read it in Mansard tomorrow.,23
73,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Will the seniors have some preference in appointments 1 I believe they are entitled to it under the Act.,23
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"As the honourable member for Bourke was not present when I answered that question, I should like to say that I have pointed out that there is a section providing that the officers in the States who have passed State examinations can be taken into the Commonwealth service on the recommendation of the Commissioner, and appointed by the Executive Council. But that will have to be very carefully dealt with, because we have a Commonwealth public service, and the first promotions must go to our own officers if they are qualified. There is nothing to prevent officers who have been trained in the States being employed, but most of them will have to come into the service in the lower grades.",23
75,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I until should like to refer to what has been said by the honourable member for Coolgardie with reference to the matter of leave of absence, about which the Acting Prime Minister has spoken. I was a member of the Parliament of Western Australia at the time the matter was dealt with there, and it was considered to have been dealt with retrospectively, with the exception that those officers who had been in the service for a length of time and had received leave from time to time, according to the local Act, were not to participate to the same extent as those who had been in the service for six years, and were entitled to six months' leave. It was considered as only just that many of the public servants who had been serving in a tropical climate for six years should have relief from theirduties. I might also mention that, in reply to a question asked the honourable member for Coolgardie A p r i l last, the Prime Minister made following answer :1. Since the passing of the Public Service of Western Australia it has been allow officers who have served six years continuously leave of absence for three months on full pay and three months on half-pay, when approved by the Governor in Council. 2. The Postmaster-General will see that on the gold-fields who have served six j'ears tinuously, and who are entibled under the Public Service Act, are granted similar leave of but, in accordance with the Act, the leave commence from the date on which they are lieved from duty. I trust that the Acting Prime Minister will carry out what was promised then by the Prime Minister, and do what is really just to the officers in AVestern Australia. In regard to the other matters which have been spoken of, and reductions. of salary; my opinion is that, where a man does his duty and is worth anything, he should be paid well. At the commencement of the Commonwealth we should lay a good foundation and set a good example. AVe should show that, although we have economy in view, we are at the same time determined to pay men according to what they are worth, and to do what is just. I feel surethat the amount set down here for the officers who discharge these various duties is not excessive. I am prepared to support the Government in this item. Vote agreed to. Division 21 (Publio Works Staff)-£9,767 Mr E , EDWARDS (Oxley) - I wish ask the Minister for Home Affairs a question with reference to the Superintendents of AVorks. There are-to be four of these officers. Por which States are they to be appointed ? There is not to be one Super- £-5,267. intendent for each State, so that evidently two States will have to be worked by one Superintendent. The information given i the Estimates is somewhat indefinite; sum of £1,950 is to be voted for the four Superintendents, ""at salaries not exceeding £ 6 0 0 per annum."" AVe should know somereceive thing more definite than that. Mr A . C. GROOM (Flinders) - I notice that the four Superintendents of AVorks to be paid salaries not exceeding £ 6 0 annum each, whilst the Chief Draughtsman, who is really the architect, is only to .£300. To my mind the draughtsman is more one. mportant than the superintendent. clerk of works is paid only £ 3 10s. or by a week in anordinary way, but in this in case the Government propose to give a the superintendent £600 a year, whilst the chief draughtsman will get only £300. The Act comparison makes the scale of remuneration the custom to appear ridiculous.  Minister told us last year that the appointment of the«e officers would not involve an officers expenditure of more than about £2,000 a conyear, 1 quite expected that hisestimatewould absence; be exceeded. The Estimates under review must provide for an expenditure of £4,117 upon rethe Public Works staff. Roughly speaking, that is £2,000 in excess of the amount which the Minister said would be required.",23
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"AVil l the honourable member' allow me to explain? In regard to his assertion that, in dealing with last year's Estimates, I said that the total salaries would not exceed £2,060 per annum, I would point out that my statement referred to the appointment of four superintendents. The Estimates provided for a salary not exceeding £600 a year for each of those officers, or for a maximum expenditure of £2,400. I said I did not think the expenditure would be as high as that, as I believed the salaries' would average about £ 5 0 0 per annum. That was the reference which I made to the sum of £2,000.  fact that the expenditure now proposed upon the Public AVorks staff is £4,117 per . annum. The Minister is not satisfied to to have an 'Inspector-General of Works at £1,000 per annum, but must have a number of other officers. I think it is becoming, a little too stiff: The total, sum set apart in connection with the Public AVorks staff is",24
77,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"There is also a sum of £4,500 to recoup the States for salaries of n professional and clerical officers employed A by the Commonwealth. Sir .GEOBGE TURNER - That amount is paid to the States. ' The States pay it and it, so that it is transferred expenditure.  are providing a Public Works staff for the 0 per Commonwealth is £-1,000 in excess of that sum. I think, the old arrangement get would have been better than the present  £ 4 able member support the proposal that the Public Works departments of the Sta'tes should continue to supervise our works.  be better to have our own officers. We are paying £1,000 per annum more than the honourable member suggested would have to be paid under the arrangement by which the States were to receive by way of remuneration for supervision 10 per cent, upon the amounts' expended.",24
78,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"No . If the honourable member will allow me, I will explain the matter. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHABN (Melbourne) - I join in the protest against these items. I never heard before of £ 6 0 0 a year being paid to a Superintendent of Works. These superintendents are really only clerks of works. I have had some experience of these matters as a member of the Melbourne City Council, which carries out many public works, but I have never heard of £ 6 00 a year being paid to a clerk of works. Such a salary is preposterous. I see that provision is also made for a Chief Draughtsman at £ 3 0 0 a year. That is too low a salary to pay if we desire to obtain the services of a good man. The Minister is actually providing a lower salary for the Chief Draughtsman than is paid clerks of works. Any number of superintendents of works could be obtained for £ 3 or £ 4 a week, and £ 5 per week would be regarded as a very high salary.",25
79,Sir WILLIAMLYNIS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I would not have men in the service who were prepared to accept such a salary.,25
80,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I have which had as much experience of these matters as the Minister has had.,25
81,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Not in connection with the public' works of public departture. ments.,25
82,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I do not wish to beat down the pay of these men, but I do say that these salaries are too high j and I propose to move that the item relating to the superintendents of works be reduced.",25
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It would be to interesting to know how many professional men, such as marine, engineers, the honorcarried out. able member for Melbourne employs at £ 2 5 0 a year, and, if he does employ any at that remuneration, whether their work is satisber, factory.",25
84,Sir MALCOLMM CEACHAEN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I have employed many clerks of works.,25
85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Quite so. When we voted these salaries upon last year's Estimates I fully explained the position, and it is rather severe upon me that I should be called upon again to go over the whole question. I pointed out when we were dealing with last year's Estimates that the only claim, made by any of the States for payment in respect of supervision of Commonwealth works was that lodged by the South Australian Government. The South Australian Government demanded 10 per cent, on the amount which had been expended in carrying out works under the supervision of their officers. Speaking from memory, I think that upon the amount provided on last year's Estimates the payments to the States at the rate named would have been £35,000. I am speaking only from memory. In answer to the honourable member for Oxley, who inquired very fairly what the superintendents of works would be called upon to do, and what would be their standard, I would point out that I explained, when we were dealing with last year's Estimates, that they would be either high-class architects or engineers.  to the to do with the Inspector-General 1",25
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I shall answer the honourable member presently. I explained, that the Commonwealth was absolutely at the mercy of the States in expending money upon public works without any supervision on the part of a Commonwealth, officer, and I instanced a case in a building for the erection of which an appropriation of £18,000 had been agreed to, would cost from £33,000 to £37,000. I had no means of checking, that expendi the Newcastle Post-office 1",25
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Yes . I had no idea that the work would cost so much until just before I spoke, for the reason that I had no federal officer whose duty it was communicate with the Minister in regard to the way in which works were being  prior to federation, and the honourable memas Premier of New South Wales, started it.",25
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I did not. A sum of money was voted for the purpose by the State Parliament. Another very important consideration in regard to the appointment of a Commonwealth public works staff is that the States have their own works to carry out; and that, as themembers of the States Legislatures do not care to see their own works delayed, our undertakings are usually placed second by the States officials. I do not think that is right. From time to time. I have complaints as to delay in carrying out Commonwealth works, but without the officers provided on these Estimates, I have no means of knowing why these works are not carried out within a certain time by the States officials. In answer to the honourable member for Oxley I would explain that it is proposed to appoint one Superintendent of Works possessing high qualifications to look after our work in Queensland, and another for New South Wales. A superintendent has already been appointed for Victoria, and another for Western Australia. The Premier of South Australia proposed to me some time ago that the Commonwealth works in that State should be supervised by an officer paid jointly by the State and the Commonwealth, and a similar proposition was made by Mr. Bird, the State Treasurer of Tasmania. I replied that if the respective States would pay a portion of the salary of each of these officers, the Commonwealth Government would pay the remainder) but upon the condition that the officer should be a federal servant. In both cases that condition was agreed to, and I propose to carry out the arrangement as soon as the necessary funds are voted. Honourable members will understand that as Western Australia is so far removed from the seat of government, we have necessarily to communicate by telegraph with the State officers there, and it seems to me highly desirable that we should have a responsible officer in that State. If the Western Australian Government will make a proposal similar to that made by the South Australian and Tasmanian Governments, I shall be quite willing to adopt it , but I do not feel disposed to depend upon any officer unless he is a federal servant.  ever paid the South Australian Government for the work carried out for the Commonwealth by the State Public Works department ?",25
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I think not. I have been endeavouring to induce the South Australian Government to accept a little less* than the 10 per cent, which they claim.  the 10 per cent, is not charged only for supervision of works. It includes the hire of plant, preparation of plans and specifications, and so forth.",26
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I pointed out to the South Australian Government that some distinction should be drawn between the amount claimed in respect of supervision, and the rent charged for use of plant loaned to the Commonwealth. Once we establish the principle of allowing the States 10 per cent, for supervising Commonwealth works, whether plant is lent or not, that charge will always be made. If the South Australian Government put in a claim showing that the plant loaned to us was worth 5 or 6 per cent, upon the amount expended and that the supervision was worth the remaining 4 or 5 per cent., I should not object to it .",26
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Trea t them generously.,26
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I have declined to pay 10 per cent. If I were to agree to that charge being made, other States - would not undertake"" the work for less.  to provide for a plant ?",26
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I hope not.  be done?,26
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,In many instances it will be done by contract.,26
95,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,It would be better to carry out our works by day labour.,26
96,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I have always been in favour of that principle.  it a plant will be necessary.,26
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I shall arrange to carry out works upon that principle, when practicable.",26
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The-honorabl e member was not always in favour of the day labour system.,26
99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable member converted me to the system, as the result of the construction of the telephone tunnels of New South Wales by day labour. I attacked him vigorously once or twice in regard to that work which he sanctioned, but a committee was appointed and showed that it had been carried out under day labour for 25 per cent, less than the amount for which it could have boen executed by contract. There was another committee sitting at the time to consider works at the Government Printing - office and other buildings. The result of their inquiries showed that there was a saving of 25 per cent, gained by substituting day labour for the contract system. It was the result of these inquiries that converted me to the adoption of the day labour system wherever practicable. I do not think that system should be adopted in all cases.  Commonwealth will require a plant.",26
100,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"We may. If we do, we may be able to hire a plant from the States Governments. If a plant is necessary, I shall be prepared' to make such an arrangement. If the South Australian Government had said that they required 4 per cent, upon the moneys expended in respect of the plant used I should not have objected to their charge. It is easy to calculate what 10 per cent, upon the total expenditure would represent if all outworks were carried out under the supervision of the States officials.  Government made it clear that they did not charge 10 per cent, solely for supervision of Commonwealth works, and why should the Government cavil at the charge ?",27
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Let them show, how the charge is made up, and if I am satisfied that it is a fair claim, I shall recommend its payment.  dispute is only £ 2 8 .",27
102,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"But there is a principle at stake. Up to the present moment I have not been able to make any arrangement with the Victorian Government, though correspondence has been proceeding within the last month or two to arrange what the Federal Government shall pay the Victorian Government for work done. I thought that 2 per cent, would be - a very fair charge, but I find that that will not be listened to. I have not yet been able to arrange with *any of the State Governments as to the amount to be paid, and at the present we are absolutely in the hands of the States in connection with the expenditure of money upon works, as, except in the case of Victoria, where I have an officer appointed, I have really no control. The Inspector-General of Works is intended for the Commonwealth.  already %",27
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I am accused of being extravagant, but I can tell honourable members that though monev was voted last year it has not been expended, and there are many re-votes in these Estimates for that reason. I have not rushed into extravagance in making appointments. The only appointment in this connection that I have made is the that of a transferred officer in Victoria, who was appointed some time ago.",27
104,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Is he getting the same salary that he was getting in Victoria ?,27
105,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,He is getting £ 6 0 0 a year. I think the salary is the same that he was getting in Victoria.,27
106,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,It would be very unfair to reduce the salary now if the amount was passed last year.,27
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It was passed last year, and the honourable member for Gippsland, the only honourable member who objected, was satisfied with the explanation given at the time.",27
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The honourable gentleman has a reputation for extravagance.,27
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I have only got that reputation in Victoria; but when I am accused of having a mantelpiece erected at a cost of £100, there is no wonder that I should get such a reputation.",27
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,That ought to be explained by the newspaper.,27
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It has not been explained, and I think it should have been explained this morning. The Inspector General of Works referred to in the estimate will be an officer appointed for the Commonwealth of Australia, and I have in my mind two men, one of whom is in South Australia, as suitable men for the position.",27
112,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Does the honourable gentleman propose to give him travelling allowances t,27
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I suppose he will receive travelling allowance. I have already explained those allowances. I would point out to the honourable member for Melbourne that the salaries proposed in these cases are not for inferior men; and if I can get the class of men I desire to see appointed, honourable members will agree that £500 or £600 a year will be a very reasonable salary for them. I think the honourable member said that he had never heard of a superintendent of works getting £ 6 0 0 a year. I may tell the honourable member that it was proposed at first to give these officers another designation more in keeping with the importance of their office. I discussed the matter with the Cabinet and the Treasurer, and it was determined, that they should be called ."" Superintendents of Works,"" in order that they might not clash with secretaries, and.officers having other designations under the Public Service Act. It must be remembered that they will be responsible officers of the Federal Government in the large States. And if the expenditure upon any works exceeds the appropriation, upon tliem will rest the responsibility of saying why they permitted the extra expenditure without consulting the chief officials. The honourable member forMelbournereferred to the Chief Draughtsman at £ 3 0 0 a year.",27
114,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I say that the honourable gentleman is paying the Chief Draughtsman too little.,28
115,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"This officer is employed in the head office in Melbourne. I do not wonder at honourable members saying that the salary proposed to be paid to him is low, and but for the fact that I have desired to avoid increases in salaries, I should like to pay this officer £ 4 0 0 a year.  gentleman come to have a Chief Clerk at £500 a year and a Chief Draughtsman at £.300 ? Which is the professional man 1",28
116,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The Chief Draughtsman is, no doubt, the professional man. I am being blamed because I have not put salaries up high enough, and only just now I was being blamed because I put them up too high. I tell honourable members that if they are prepared to give £ 4 0 0 or £500 a year for a draughtsman of a high class, I do not think that would be too high a. salary, but at present I am not prepared to suggest an increase to this officer, who is a transferred officer from the Defence department. I am not asking for an increase in his salary, though I admit that the position warrants the payment of a higher salary than is here provided for. I would impress upon honourable members the fact that these officers will have to carry through a scheme of works for the various States, and we cannot get capable men who can be given this responsibility for a salary of £ 2 5 0 or £ 3 00 a year. I may mention that Mr Owen Smythe, a gentleman who has occupied a somewhat similar position in South Australia, has been recommended to me very highly for the position of Inspector-General of Works, and another officer has also been recommended for the position. I think honourable members will be satisfied with the proposed distribution of the expenditure, and I hope they will not reduce the vote after having passed it last year.",28
117,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"South Australia). - It is just the distribution of this expenditure which is causing all the trouble. I desire to draw attention to the curious method in which these salaries are arranged. There is a Chief Clerk provided for at £500 a year. It will be admitted that the office of a chief clerk is not a technical one, requiring a highly qualified officer. Then when we come to deal with the Chief Draughtsman who will have the preparation of the plans of all the important buildings constructed for the Commonwealth, involving an expenditure of many hundreds of thousands of pounds, and in some cases of scores of thousands of pounds for a particular building, we find that an officer is expected to do that work at £ 3 0 0 a year. Then we are to have Superintendents of Works at a salary not exceeding £600 a year. honourable Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I admit the anomaly in the case of the Chief Draughtsman, but I am not prepared to recommend an increase this year.",28
118,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The anomaly appears to me to be a remarkable one. I put it to the Minister that these Superintendents of Works are merely clerks of works.,28
119,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"No ; they will all be professional men, though they may act as clerks of works. Mr. BATCHELOR - As a matter of fact they will have to look after the construction and erection of buildings in the various States, and it seems to me that, if we are going to pay them £ 6 0 0 a year, we will have superior men who will not act as clerks of works, and we shall have to pay other persons to do that work.",28
120,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Are not these officers all to be clerks of works ?,28
121,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Does the honourable member desire that we should have officers who shall be architects, engineers, and superintendents rolled into one. We have one great architect for the Commonwealth receiving the magnificent salary of £ 3 0 0 a year; and, as a man who is paid such a salary as that will have to work very hard for it , there will be no necessity for other architects. These officers will not be architects, but clerks of works.",28
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,No ; they will nearly all be architects.,29
123,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Do we require architect in each State.,29
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"We do in the States. I hope to make a combination in the case of two, if not three,",29
125,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I desire that the public works staff should be organized something like an intelligent scale. I certainly not an intelligent scale Chief Draughtsman at £300, and a Chief Clerk at £ 5 0 0 a year, and subordinate tects getting twice the salary paid chief. I understand from the Minister that the reason why South Australia is not have a Superintendent of Works",29
126,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I do not know service, they should face the position. whether she is or not. I think the officer will not be a full superintendent. officer employed will probably do the work of the Federal Government and of the State Government as well. The honourable memsurprised ber will see that there ai'e four down £600 a year. I hope to save enough on the vote to pay for more than four officers.",29
127,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,There will be half the salary paid to some officers who will - largely employed by the State Governments?,29
128,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Yes .,29
129,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,A m I to underlast year. stand that that proposal came from the Premier of South Australia ?,29
130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Yes , and from Bird, .the Treasurer of Tasmania.",29
131,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I should like to the honourable gentleman whether in posing that arrangement the Premier of South Australia was aware that this be "" new "" expenditure, and that he would save nothing from the revenue of his State by the arrangement ? Was it pointed that while South Australia indulged policy of self-abnegation it would have tribute to the salary of the Superintendents without having the benefit of their services If not it might be as well that it should pointed out, and then this anxiety for economy for other States might not apparent.",29
132,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," Las t year this question was raised by the honourable member for Gippsland, and the discussion lasted only a quarter of an hour. We have four days in which to complete the work of the session and yet this question' has been discussed for two hours, which is a great pity. The answer which was made by the Minister last year was that there was some 'arrangement with Mr Blackbourn, an who certainly is worth £ 6 00 a year.",29
133,Mr SAWERS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,But the Minister says larger there is no appointment made yet.,29
134,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,No ; I said one had of the smaller States. been made.,29
135,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The Superintendent of on Works in Victoria is a competent architect t is and engineer, who for years had under his to have a control the local defence works.",29
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"He was Superarchiintendent of Works, and he was taken over to the with the Defence department. Mr CB.OUCH - If honourable members to are prepared to reduce the salary of an officer who was taken over from the State But if not, what is the use of discussing an item The which was freely discussed last year, and which it is really useless to re-discuss 1",29
137,Mr MCDONA LD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES, I was to hear the honourable and learned at member for Corio state that because this item was discussed last year it should not be discussed this year. I am prepared to discuss the item every year if it is necesbe saiy. We were led to believe that there was no appointment made in this department.,29
138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,No. I said that,29
139,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The Minister left the distinct impression on my mind this Mr morning that no appointment had been made, and that he would try to get the ask best officers available to fill the posiprotions. It has turned out, however, that a gentleman has been appointed at a salary would of £600. I am prepared to take the responsibility of reducing his salary to £ 4 0 0. There seems to be no end to the growth of out this department. The idea of giving the in a Chief Draughtsman £300, and officers who to conwill act as clerks of works £600, is simply ridiculous. I do not believe that any private 1 firm would do such a thing. It is quite be possible to get qualified men to carry out the duties of the position for a much less salary. be so We have an Inspector-General of Works at a salary of £1,000. He is the architectj in-chief, and his duty is to see what works ' are to be .carried out, and .generally to superintend their construction. I do not say that he can go everywhere, but he has subordinate officers at his disposal. A salary of £ 5 0 0 is too much for the work which the Chief Clerk has to do, and it should be reduced to £400. It is of no use for the Minister to say that the salary of a Superintendent is not to exceed £600, and that probably it will be £500 ; because we know very well that if the vote is passed, their salary will be £600. Under the circumstances I hope that the honourable member for Melbourne will move to reduce the salary to £400. Sir ""WILLIAM LYNE - Mr . was getting a salary of £ 6 0 0 a year in the State service.",29
140,Mr SAWERS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I am very pleased that the honourable and learned member for Corio has intervened in the de-' bate, because, after listening to the Minister, I was under the impression that no appointment had been made.  ment afterwards by saying that one appointment had been made.",30
141,Mr SAWERS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"That alters my attitude to some extent. If no appointment had been made, I should have joined the honourable member for Melbourne in voting for a reduction of the salaries of the Superintendents of Works. In New South Wales the construction of very many important works is supervised by clerks of works, at not more than £ 1 per day or at £ 5 per week.",30
142,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,In Waies four officers doing corresponding duties each receive £ 8 00 per year.,30
143,Mr SAAVERS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"What is the nature of the works to be supervised by this department 1 The Commonwealth has no need to carry out any elaborate works. We have only the Postal, Customs, and Defence departments under our control, and is it necessary to have a man at a salary of £400 to superintend the erection of small post-offices throughout the Commonwealth? In New South Wales the clerks of works who superintend the construction of post-offices do not receive more than £ 5 per week. Again, in the Defence department, what is the nature of the public works to be carried out ? I guarantee that good men could be obtained to superintend the erection of drillsheds at a salary of £ o per week.",30
144,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"But these officers have to deal with all the defence works,",30
145,Mr SAWERS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"There are many works , in connection with that department, such as putting up drill-sheds and small barracks, which do not require the presence of a highly-paid official. The Minister can get men at £ 5 per week to do the supervising work. If we have to construct defence works, fortifications, and light-houses, then the presence of a superior man is required. But what is the Inspector-General of Works to do ? Will he not find time to see that important works are properly carried out ? Otherwise what has he to do ? A difficulty has arisen from the appointment of one Blackbourn Superintendent at a salary of £600, but still, in times of economy, we should make an effort to reduce these items. It might meet the case if we combined the offices of Chief Clerk and Chief Draughtsman, at a salary of £500, thereby saving £300 a year. We must keep faith with the Superintendent who has' been appointed, but I do not see why the Chief Clerk should get a penny more than the Chief Draughtsman. It is perfectly ridiculous to suggest that these officers should be architects, because all the plans are drawn up in the office; and for the supervision of nine-tenths of the - works only Clerks of Works are required. The Minister may be surprised at a supporter speaking in this manner ; but I got such an object-lesson las't night in the fact that Ministers do not expect their supporters to stand by them that I feel that I ought to exercise my right to bring about someeconomy. New South Sir WILLIAM LYNE - It is not usual for the honourable member for New England to take the course he has taken. I am quite satisfied that he does not understand what these men are required to do, or what class of men they are. Honourable members do not know that .before the Commonwealth took over the Defence departments there were various systems under which these works were carried out. In Victoria the works were done by the State department. In New South Wales there was a huge military staff to do the military works. I have taken all the military clerks from the branch in New South Wales and placed them under this department. The officer who will be appointed for New South Wales will have to deal with all the military works which previously were supervised by Major Owen, with a strong staff under him. Besides, it will not be long before also. we shall have to deal with the erection of light-houses and other works. These officers cannot be and are not ordinary clerks of works; perhaps it would have been better if they had been called "" subinspectors."" I did anticipate that honourable members would clearly understand what class of officers was required. I hope that they will not attempt to reduce this amount. A salary of £500 was voted last year for a Chief Clerk, but no appointment has been made. I am quite prepared to take £ 4 0 0 for the Chief Clerk, as there is an anomaly between the salary of the Chief Draughtsman and that of the Chief Clerk. I must try to get a man good enough for the position of Chief Clerk at £400. I am sure that honourable members will see that there has been no extravagance. I economized to a considerable extent by amalgamating the civil and military branches.",30
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Will these appointments be made by the Public Service Com- missioner 1,31
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Not one of these appointments will be made until the Public Service Act is in force, and then they will be made on the recommendation of the Commissioner.",31
148,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Will he have any power to recommend the rates to be paid ?,31
149,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Yes . I inserted the words "" not exceeding,"" so that I need not pay £ 6 0 0 a year if I do not require to do so. I wisbed to provide in the Public Service Bill that the Inspectors should receive a salary not exceeding £700 a year; but the words were omitted by the Senate, and the result is that I have been compelled to pay that amount. I believe that in two cases, I could have got an In spector at £500, but the appropriation of a specific sum for the position prevented me from doing so. I introduced the words "" not exceeding"" in this case, so that I need not pay a salary of £ 6 0 0 if it is not necessary. The commissioner will have to recommend the men and the salaries. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON (South Australia) - I have listened with care to the explanation of the Minister for Home Affairs, but I feel that in this instance I must vote with honourable members who are on the side of economy. I would not vote for the ' reduction of the salary of Mr. Blackbourn, in whose case, it seems, we are committed, to an expenditure of £ 6 0 0 per annum, but I see no reason why the other Superintendents should not be paid a 46 is smaller amount. I fail to understand why the Chief Draughtsman should be given only £ 3 0 0 per annum, and the Superintendents £600 per annum each. Surely they will all be under the control of the Inspector General of Works, in which case men of the attainments referred to by the Minister for Home Affairs are scarcely necessaiy, and the work of the office could be efficiently performed by officers receiving £ 4 0 0 a year. The committee should be very careful about sanctioning appointments, because just now federation is unpopular enough.",31
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Yes , in South Australia, because of the appointment of a few additional drill inspectors. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON - I u other States as Well. If we pile up expense, - federation will become still more unpopular. It is my intention to vote for any proposed reduction of the salaries of these Superintendents. ' Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - The discussion has rather tended to show that this department is likely to be an extremely expensive one - If these Superintendents are to be more than clerks of works, they will each, want clerks of works, draughtsmen, and ordinary clerks to assist them in the performance of their duties. In my opinion, the salary of £600 is altogether too high, and I move That the item, "" Superintendents of Works at salaries uot exceeding £G00 per annum, £.1,950,"" be amended by the omission of the words '' at Salaries "" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" one at a salary."" If that amendment is carried we can provide for a salary of £ 6 0 0 to Mr Blackbourn, and of £400 for the others. Mr A . C. GROOM - Three hundred pounds would be sufficient.",31
151,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I think so.,31
152,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I shall not appoint any at £300.,31
153,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The Minister has shown such a nice spirit, throughout the discussion that I am willing to make the salary £400, except in Mr. Blackbourn's case, and I would let his salary stand at £600. Mr A . C. GROOM - Mak e him InspectorQpneral.",31
154,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,That would be a good idea.,31
155,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Under the honourable member's proposal would not the other States get Superintendents of inferior ability to that of the Superintendent in Victoria 1 Sir ""WILLIAM LYNE - Of course they would. This is a very selfish proposal. The honourable member wants to give Victoria a Superintendent at £600, and the other States Superintendents at £400 .",32
156,Mr OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," The Minister for Home Affairs spoke about distant distribution. What we want is not the mellifluence of distant distribution, but the beneficence of local distribution. It is not often that I can agree with, the honourable member for Melbourne, but I am of opinion that £400 is sufficient for these positions. The Constitution fixes the remuneration of members of this Parliament at £400 a year, and, on general principles, I shall be willing to vote for the reduction of every salary in the service to that amount.",32
157,Mr SKENE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES, What salary has the officer already appointed been receiving from the State from which he has been transferred 1,32
158,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Six hundred pounds a year. Mr SKENE"" - That being so, I think it would be unfair for the committee to reduce the amount. Mr A . C. GROOM - Mak e him Inspector General.",32
159,Mr SKENE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I do not know if he is qualified for that position, though he may be qualified for his present position. I should be inclined to leave that matter to the Minister.' I think, however, that £400 would be sufficient' for the other Superintendents. Weshould then be paying an average salary of £450 to the staff.",32
160,Mr BAMFO RD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I am in sympathy with the honourable member for Tasmania, but I do not think the people of the Commonwealth desire to sweat their servants. It is only the Ministry who have shown an inclination to do that. I think that Members of Parliament are being sweated by Ministers. The Minister for Home Affairs has my sympathy on this occasion, because I think that the attitude which he has taken up is a reasonable and proper one. Some honourable members seem to think that the Chief Draughtsman will occupy a more important position than that of the Superintendents, and should, therefore, receive as high a salary, but in my opinion he will occupy a position requiring technical rather than general professional ability. He will have no designing to do, and no responsibility. If it were proposed that the Commonwealth should launch out into the construction of expensive buildings, his position might be a different one, but all that will, have to be done will be to prepare plans and specifications for additions to post-offices and other existing buildings, many of which are merely wooden humpies. Perhaps it might be right to give the Draughtsman £400 a year, but certainly not more than that. Most of us have expressed our belief in the day-labour system, but if that system is to be carried out efficiently Parliamentmust have thoroughly competent and trustworthy men to superintend the work being done. Such men will hold very responsible positions, and could save more.than the amount of their salaries.",32
161,Mr SAWERS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Some members of the committee may have expressed their belief in the day-labour system, but others have not.",32
162,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I was not referring to conservatives, whose views never progress, and who are relics of an almost prehistoric age.",32
163,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES, I agree .with the honourable member for Herbert. I think that a discretionary power should be given to the Minister in this matter.,32
164,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"If I had appointed these officers last year, and spent the money instead of saving it , there would have been none of this discussion.",32
165,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Yes . The foreman of a very small workshop who is worthy of his position, receives at least £ 3 0 0 a year, and the duties of the Superintendents of Works will be analogous to those of foremen, and should be remunerated in accordance with their importance. Efficient Superintendents will be able to prevent scamping and the introduction of inferior materials, and to guard the interests of the Commonwealth in other ways. It must not be forgotten that, although we may be opposed to the erection of costly buildings in the future, very expensive buildings have been transferred to the Commonwealth, and as they have to be maintained, and occasionally to be added to, skilful and trustworthy men will be required to superintend the work. In New South Wales there are more costly buildings than in any of the other States,' and it would, therefore, be wrong to pay to the New South Wales Superintendent a smaller salary than is paid to the Victorian Superintendent, whose remuneration I do not cavil at. There is always such a demand for the services of efficient clerks of works, that we shall not be able to get good men unless we are willing to pay them current rates - of wages. When men can obtain £ 5 0 0 or £60 0 from private contractors, they will not take £40 0 from the Commonwealth. If honourable members consider that the Minister is likely to be extravagant, and is unworthy of his position, they should turn him out of office.  When the advisibility of creating a works department was being discussed last year, the committee was against me because I foretold what was likely to happen. But honourable members have now a small indication of what the department is likely to cost the Commonwealth in the future. I held then, as I do now, that this department is altogether unnecessary at the present stage. The appointments already made or contemplated are only the forerunners of many others, and we shall have to establish offices in all the States for the accommodation of the staffs which are to work there on our behalf.",32
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"South Australia is driving us to make these appointments by her exorbitant charges for supervision.  to say about that presently. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, asked a very pertinent question regarding the arrangement made with the Government of South Australia. I am given to understand that a State officer is to superintend Commonwealth works there.",33
167,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"No , we are taking over an officer from the South Australian Government, and making him a public servant of the Commonwealth, but we intend to allow the State Government to utilize part of his time. The Premier of South Australia made the suggestion, and I have agreed to it .  similar arrangement be made in the other States?",33
168,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Because in most of the other States the Superintendents of Public Works have more work than they can do already. 46 E  South Australia has made a very bad bargain, because the cost of maintaining this department will be charged as new expenditure and debited to the States per capita. W it h regard to the alleged charge of 10 per cent, by the South Australian Government for the supervision of work for the Commonwealth, the Minister knows very well that that sum includes the cost of preparing the plans and specifications and a charge for the use of plant required in carrying out the works, in addition to the supervision. Therefore, I think it is unfair of the Minister to accuse the South Australian Government of making an exorbitant charge.",33
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable member cannot make it any other than - an exorbitant charge.  does not know what he is talking about. The cost of superintending the construe-' tion of Commonwealth works under the arrangement now proposed will be greater than that hitherto involved, because in addition to providing for the salaries of the supervising staff, it will be necessary to arrange for the plant which will have to be employed. Even if this is hired from the States Governments something will have to be paid for it . In view of all these circumstances, I think it is paltry on the part of the Minister for Home Affairs to add insult to injury by reiterating his accusation against the South Australian Government. If the Minister expects that Government to come to him, cap in hand, and ask him for £ 2 8 - the 10 per cent, charge in connection with a work which cost £280-h e will be disappointed. They would sooner make him a present of the money than supplement their ample explanation. I hope that we have heard the last of the charge against South Australia of trying to obtain money for services which they have not rendered.",33
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"They did make a charge of 10 per cent, for supervision.  know that the 10 per cent, included charges for the use of the plant employed, and for drawing up the plans and specifications, in addition to the actual supervision of the works whilst in course of construction 1 Does he not know that railway fares had to be paid in cases where officers were required to travel to outlying places to supervise additions made to post-offices and other buildings 1 All these items were included in the 10 per cent.",33
171,Sir WILLIAM LYNK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Yes , they were.  that 10 per cent, was charged for mere supervision ?",34
172,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It was charged for supervision, and 10 per cent, will always be considered as the charge for supervision unless it is put a stop to now.  sired to have any work carried out by day labour he would have to make some provision for the necessary plant, and he would also have to pay the railway fares of the men employed upon works situated any distance from the centres of population.",34
173,Mr CUOUCH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,We have had all this before.  and learned member will probably have to submit to it again. I consider it my duty to rebut the charge made absolutely without foundation against the South Australian Government.,34
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It true.  South Australian Government charged 10 per cent, for supervision only, and the Minister knows it . Why is he not man enough to acknowledge it?",34
175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Why is honourable member man enough to admit that he is wrong ?  sufficient facts to show that the Minister is wrong. I shall support a reduction of this item. The officer who is provided for here will be merely an overseer of works, and if we judge by the rates paid by private employers, £300 per annum would be excellent pay for the work he will have to perform. The Inspector General of Works, who receives £1,000 a year, has the most responsible work to do, and it would be absurd to pay an overseer £600 per annum, simply to supervise building operations. I find that the Chief Clerk in the department for Home Affairs receives a salary of £ 6 5 0 a year, and there is no department in the Commonwealth service in which so many billets, with high salaries attached, have been created. The Minister has in many cases selected his officers from outside instead of taking them from the States services, and thus giving the States Governments an opportunity to retrench to an amount equivalent to the salary of the transferred officers. All the extra expense now contemplated will serve to further embarrass the States Governments, and probably compel them to retrench to a still greater degree than at present. The result of the vote given yesterday in regard to the construction of works out of revenue will throw the State finances into confusion, and we have the fullest justification, therefore, for cutting down all expenditure that is not absolutely necessary. The Minister is using the fact that one appointment has been made by him without consulting honourable members as a reason why he should be permitted to make a number of other appointments. But if we are to regard this as a sufficient reason our discussion of the Estimates must resolve itself into a farce. Honourable members should have an opportunitj' of knowing what appointments are proposed, and of keeping a careful watch over all expenditure, particularly in connection with appointments to which high salaries are is absolutely attached. If we approve of the appointment of a large number of highly-paid officials we shall be driven into the same position as that occupied by some of the States Governments, and shall be compelled to make percentage reductions upon the salaries of all the Commonwealth employees. not the That would plaGe us in a most undignified position. I was accused of having been a party to a large increased expenditure in connection with the Public Service Act. I am quite prepared to take the responsibility of having fought for an increase of the pay of employees who have been in the service for from nine to eighteen years at a salaries as low as £ 6 0 per annum. There is no crime in taking such a step, but the Minister is open to the most serious reproach for having created an absolutely unnecessary department.",34
176,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I shall support the reduction proposed for the reasons stated - by the honourable member  with him that this department ought not to have been created. No additions have been made to the work formerly carried out in the States, because we have not increased the number of Government buildings except by the purchase of one or two offices in Melbourne. The work of supervision has not grown, and I cannot see why the Minister should not have made an arrangement with all the States to share the payment of the salaries of their Superintendents of Public Works. It may be urged in some of the States that, inasmuch as the duties of the Superintendents of Works have been curtailed owing to the transfer of several State departments to the Commonwealth, the salaries should also be reduced, but we could stop that cry by contributing a portion of the salaries now paid and maintaining them at the present figures. That would prove a very good arrangement for some years to come, and would certainly obviate the necessity for the creation of a new department. It is simply from a desire to emphasize the objection which has been so well put by my honourable colleague, that I support the reduction. I can assure the honourable member that I did not single him out for censure in regard to the determination of Parliament that a minimum salary of £ 1 1 0 should be paid to all adults who had been in the Commonwealth service for three years. I think that he went so far as to consult me in regard to the wording of that proposal. The Government desired to limit the minimum proposed to new officers, which, of course, would have been grossly unfair. The honourable member's amendment, however, had the effect of making the Act consistent. 1 repeat that I did not single him out for censure, because throughout his motives have been perfectly disinterested. I do not think that the Minister was quite fair to the honourable member when he spoke of the 10 per cent, commission which South Australia wishes to charge for the supervision of Commonwealth public works. If I remember rightly I think the honourable member said that the 10 per cent, in question, although debited to supervision, included travelling expenses and the use of a plant.",34
177,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,It was not much of a plant.,35
178,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The honourable gentleman should not be so suspicious. At all events the charge is not an exorbitant one when we consider that so many items are included in it .,35
179,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I have listened attentively to the suggesmitted tions which have been made, princiis pally by Ministerial supporters, and I have come to the conclusion that it is abbeen solutely necessary we should have effiTaking cient officers to supervise the carrying out of the public works which have to be undertaken by the Commonwealth. Last night reference was made to the salaries which it is proposed to pay these officers, and it ""was pointed out that no amount had been definitely decided upon. They are, however, "" not to exceed "" £600 a year. When the Public Service Act was under discussion, honourable members were very anxious that the control of our public servants should be vested in the commissioner. Of course he is required to make a recommendation, but, in order to avoid the possibility of appointments being made as the result of political influence, Parliament, after an exhaustive debate, decided to rely to a great extent upon his judgment. That being so, it seems to me that the proposal pf the Ministry is a perfectly fair one. The honourable member who has moved the amendment has entirely given away his case. He states that the officer who has been appointed in Victoria at a salary of £600 a 3'ear should be retained at that rate, but that in the other States a thoroughly competent officer could be secured for considerably less. Seeing that the Government proposal is that the emoluments attached to the office shall not exceed £600 a year, I think that the matter of determining the exact amount might well be left to the discretion of the Public Service Commissioner. From my knowledge of that gentleman I have no hesitation in saying that if he can secure the services of a qualified man for a less sum he will do so. Whilst I am thoroughly desirous that economy should be exercised in the administration of our public affairs, I would remind honourable members that if we attempt to unduly cut down salaries we run the risk of effecting only a false economy. If we wish to secure the services of a thoroughly efficient professional man, upon whom the Government can rely in important matters involving the expenditure of about £300,000 we ought to be careful to give the Public Service Commissioner discretionary power to make the office worth £600, if he thinks it is desirable to do so.",35
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," It seems to me that this matter can be subto a very simple test. Either there extravagance in this department, or there is not. I propose to show that there has no extravagance up to the present time. the whole of the Estimates in the branch department which is now under review, I find that the total cost of administration represents £5,267,' whereas the - works proposed to be constructed this year will involve an outlay of £300,000. Dividing the latter amount by the former, I find that the cost of administration represents less than 2 per cent, on the total amount proposed to be spent. Will any one say that that is an evidence of extravagance ? Mr A . C. GROOM - Will that amount be spent every year ?",35
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I should say that more would be spent. This department must inevitably grow. Up to the present time it has not taken over all the functions which properly belong to it . When it assumes control of light-houses, beacons, &c, there is no doubt that the outlay will be largely increased. Whilst it is the duty of honourable members to keep the expenditure down to the lowest possible limit consistent with efficiency, we must remember that the services have to be maintained. To my mind the questions which we have to determine are-""What does it cost to maintain these works in a state of efficiency?"" and-""Can we by exercising control over them ourselves make a better arrangement than if they were carried out under State control?"" The facts speak for themselves. The total cost of this department next year will be less than 2 per cent, upon theamountof money expended. That is the result obtained by a simple cal-culation. On the other hand South Australia wishes to charge 10 per cent, on the sum which has been expended upon Commonwealth public works in that - State. If everyother State charged upon the same scale the cost of carrying out the works projected for this year would be £30,000 instead of £5,000 as set down in these Estimates.",36
182,Mr CAMERON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable member is allowing nothing for material. That 10 per cent, includes the use of plant and material.",36
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I am told that a very small - amount is represented by plant, but if half of the total were so represented the charge would still be excessive. It is of no use endeavouring to make it appear that the charge is a small one. It is a scandalously extortionate one. I cannot generally be accused of a desire to assist the Ministry, but I cannot shut my eyes to the patent facts to which I have called attention. We ought to look at this matter from a purely business stand-point, and when I see that the cost of the administration of this department is moderate in the extreme, I am at a loss to understand the complaints of honourable members who represent a State which proposes to charge the Commonwealth an extortionate rate for the supervision of the public works carried out within its borders. The proposal is a moderate one of less thari 2 per cent., and I do not think that the expenses of management can be much further reduced.",36
184,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," The amount proposed is not excessive, considering the work there is to do, but, at the same time, I cannot help thinking that the formation of the department is premature. We ought to keep expenses as low as possible, and we must remember that the proposed expenditure is only the beginning. There is only one appointment at £ 6 0 0 at present, the others having yet to be made ; and I had hoped that the inauguration of the Commonwealth would bring about a diflerent system of public works from that which has prevailed in the States. My experience of public works administration in the States is that it becomes hide-bound and most unsatisfactory; it does not keep in touch with modern improvements, and in almost every case is extremely extravagant. If a department of this kind is to be ruled by two or three men, the whole of the work will flow from the brains of that small number. Why should we not, in the matter of Commonwealth works, have the benefit of the best brains in the community ? Why should we not call for plans and specifications, and let the successful competitor have the supervision of the work ?",36
185,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Does the honourable member propose that there should be competition in regard to every little work ?,36
186,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Not at all ; for small repairs the services of a small staff might be retained. .But I utterly fail to see the necessity for a large and elaborate staff. In the futuresuch a staff may be necessaiy, but under present conditions, it is premature. I do not agree with the suggestion that the whole of of the work should be done by day labour. In my opinion, we shall get better and cheaper work under the contract system, with a stipulation for the payment of a minimum wage. I do not approve of differentiating between the salaries, and I cannot support the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne. If one man is worth £ 6 00 per annum, the others ought to be worth the same, or the salaries of all should be cut down. It is difficult for honourable members who do not know the whole of the facts to "" pick holes "" in the Estimates, and it is not a wise course to knock a little off here and a little off there. In fact, in my opinion, the committee are not qualified to reduce the Estimates in that way. I should much rather see the whole division withdrawn, and the woz'k carried on under somewhat better arrangement with the States.",36
187,Mr WINTER COOKE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," The honourable member for Echuca has said that we ought not to differentiate between the payments of these officers; but, unfortunately, the sum of £1,950 demands differentiation.",37
188,Mr MCCOLL,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"What I mean is, that though the Minister may be able to differentiate in making the appointments, the committee cannot very well do so.",37
189,Mr WINTER COOKE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"But the committee is giving a direction that there must be differentiation. As I understand, the Government are pledged to the appointment of a Victorian officer at £ 6 0 0 per annum. That leaves only £1,350 for the other three officers, an equal division amongst whom will mean an average of £ 4 8 5 ; therefore, the argument as to differentiation seems to fall to the ground when it is used against the araendment of the honourable member for Melbourne. I am rather inclined to vote for the amendment, because, first of all, I have not yet gathered from the Minister what are the duties of these Superintendents. We had what I may venture, without disrespect, to call a cloud of words from the Minister this morning, when the honourable gentleman indulged in a sort of hurricane, and seemed very indignant at the criticism offered. But all he said did not make my mind clear as to whether the Superintendents are to be architects or merely clerks of works. If the work is simply to be that of a clerk of works, then each Superintendent would be well paid at something less than £400 a year; but if, on the other hand, the duties involve the work of a professional architect, then the payment of £ 4 5 0 is not adequate. If a suggestion made be carried out, and a Superintendent be appointed for New South Wales also at a salary of £600, then only £750 will be left out of the vote with which to meet the requirements of the four other States, and the consequent remuneration for the work of a professional architect means very poor pay. I quite agree that £300 per annum is an utterly absurd salary for a Chief Draughtsman, in view of the fact that the Chief Clerk is to receive £500 and the Superintendents are to be paid the rates indicated. If the Minister will enlighten the committee as to what work the Superintendents are expected to perform, honourable members will have some idea of what they are voting about. At present the committee generally are, I believe, quite in the dark as to what the duties are. If , as T, gather so far, the duties are more likely to be those of a clerk of works, I shall vote for the suggested slight reduction.",37
190,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Robertson) Having had some experience in the oversight of contract work, I think that the opportunities for a man receiving "" consideration "" from contractors, are move likely to occur if the' salary is poor than they are if the salary be adequate. In New South Wales, where the works are extensive and involve hundreds of thousands of pounds, nothing less than £600 .per annum should be paid for the performance of these duties.",37
191,Mr WINTER COOKE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,What are the duties 1,37
192,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I take it that the duty of a superintendent is to supervise the construction of the most extensive works throughout the State. Such a man must have the technical knowledge of a civil engineer; he must be able to take out quantities, know what work should cost, and also know when work is done according to specification. A man may be a ""good fellow"" and highly respected by the Minister, but it does not follow that he is competent to supervise the construction of public works. That a State like New South Wales should accept an officer at a lower salary than is paid to a similar officer in Victoria is a suggestion which I can scarcely believe is serious; and £600 a year is little enough for the duties to be performed in the former State. I take it that the officers appointed for the other States will not necessarily be paid much less than is paid to the Superintendents in Victoria and New South Wales, seeing that it is likely they will be transferred from one State to another; for Instance, that the Queensland officer will supervise the Northern Territory and possibly Tasmania, while the South Australian Superintendent will do work for Western Australia. I hope, therefore, that provision has been made for adequately paying these Superintendents, who, unless thej' have the necessary technical knowledge, will not be fit for the position.",37
193,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I take it that the reduction suggested is not intended to apply to the officer appointed for Victoria. If that be so, it is very unfair to the other three Superintendents, and I shall not be able to support the amend-, ment. These are positions of considerable responsibility, and ought to be filled by able men. It is not likely that for £ 4 0 0 a year we shall be able to get capable professional men who have had to spend Some 3'ears in qualifying themselves. do accept the position at such a salary they will be dissatisfied and render unwilling and unsatisfactory service. It would be better for the committee to pass the vote as it appears in the Estimates, seeing that on the average it does not amount to £500 for each Superintendent.",38
194,Mr MANIFOLD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I am one who cannot see that the Minister for Home Affairs is very extravagant in his proposal. If it be necessary to have these officers they should undoubtedly be fairly paid. But .1 rose more particularly to protest against the suggestion that the honourable member for Melbourne wishes to pay the Victorian officer £ 6 0 0 per annum, while cutting down the salaries of the other officers. I understand that the officer at £600 has already been appointed, and my opinion is that as he is paid the higher salary he will not be regarded as a Victorian officer solely, but will be sent to any part of the States. w,here his services may be required. It is very unfair to suggest that Victorian members are endeavouring to keep up the salaries of officers within their own State, whilst starving other officers of the Commonwealth. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON (South Australia) - I intended to say what has substantially been said by the honourable member for Corangamite. I should like to add, however, that the honourable member for Melbourne, when he announced that he would move a reduction, had no knowledge that there was any officer at the present time holding an appointment. I mention this to show that in the mind of the honourable member there was no question of Victoria as against any other State.",38
195,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"There is one point I forgot to mention, or I should not have risen again. It is a long time since the subdivision of officers was made, and I did not anticipate the debate this afternoon, thinking that the Estimates last year had decided the matter for the present. What was intended when the subdivision was made was that the Inspector-General of Works should reside in the State where the head office is located, and that there should be no second officer at £600. It was intended that the chief officer should supervise all plans and works at the head office, as well as exercise a general superI f they vision in the other States, and that there should be an officer in Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia respectively, at £ 6 0 0 or less, the money originally intended for the second officer being devoted to the supervision of works in Tasmania and South Australia. That is how the - arrangement was made, and the salaries of these officers came on to the Estimates as they are. The recommendation originally was that six officers should be appointed at £ 6 00 a year each, but in order to economize, I arranged the matter as I have explained. I should have been perfectly justified in appointing six officers, because the House voted the money last session. But I was able to struggle along with a less number-and it has been a struggle during the past twelve months. I did that for purposes of economy. I hope honourable members will give me credit for having tried to conserve the interests of the Treasury instead of being extravagant. If six appointments had been made - the money would have been voted without a word of criticism. The Public Service Commissioner will recommend the salaries to be paid, and I put in the words, "" not exceeding £600,"" so that if I could get a satisfactory man for £500 he might be appointed.' I hardly think, however, that any man qualified for the position would be obtainable in the Commonwealth at £400. Ifc will be entirely a question whether a proper man can be obtained for less than the money here specified, and that will have to be determined by the commissioner. Question-That the words "" at salaries "" proposed to be omitted stand part of the item-put . The committee divided. . Ayes ... ... Noes ... ... Majority Bumfoi-d, F. W. Mahon, H. Cameron, N.

I therefore m o v e That the item-""Chie f Clerk at £500 per annum From 1st Octorber, 1B02, £375,"" be reduced by £75. Amendment agreed to. Reduced vote, £9692, agreed to. Division 22 (Works and Buildings)£79,300.",38
196,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I notice here a very large outlay on rent. Possibly it might be economical in some of the States to pay rent instead of erecting buildings, but the amount appears extraordinarily large. In Western Australia the sum paid as rent is £1,112. draw attention to the matter because in the year 1898 a Royal Comniission appointed by the Western Australian Government recommended a considerable saving in this direction. For instance, at Fremantle the Government had paid for twenty years £170 a year for three rooms. The Royal commission stated that the rent paid was ... 27 far more than the costof permanent ... 15 buildings would have been. I do not know whether the Commonwealth Government is 12 paying £ 1 7 0 a year for the use of those AYES. rooms at Fremantle, but I suggest to the Minister that a more economical arrangement could be made. Of course, I am ignorant as to whether the, recommendations of the Royal commission, the report of which was dated 25th October, 1899, were carried out, but I trust that the Minister will look into the matter, and see if any saving can be effected under this heading.",39
197,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I wish to ask for an explanation of the item under the heading, ""Victoria, "" ""Fittings and furniture, Home Affairs, £1,050."" Noiss. Does the item relate to office furniture ?",39
198,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable member will see that there is a sum of £3,407 provided For fittings and furniture required in Victoria. That sum includes £1,500 for the Post and Telegraph department, £485 for the Defence department, £165 for the department of Trade and PAIRS. Customs, £ 1 0 0 for the Treasury, and £1,050 for the department of Home Affairs. A new building has been erected for us by the State at the end of the original Federal Offices, in which the department of Home Affairs is located, while we have taken two adjoining buildings which have since been knocked into one. All these buildings have to be furnished, and the cost of fitting up and furnishing the rooms for the various departments is charged to the department of Home Affairs.  desire some further information upon the same point. I notice that provision is made for £ 2 00 for fittings and furniture for the department of Home Affairs in New South Wales, and £ 7 5 for electric lighting and telephonic communication, while in Victoria provision is made for £1,050 for fittings and furniture, and £ 1 2 0 for electric lighting and telephonic communication for the I same department. Provision is also made for £200 for fittings and furniture, and £ 1 0 for electric lighting and telephonic communication for the department in Queensland ; and £ 2 0 0 for fittings and furniture, and £ 1 0 for electric lighting and telephone communication for the department in South Australia ; and £ 2 0 0 for fittings and furniture, and £ 1 0 for electric lighting and phonic communication for the department in Western Australia ; and £ 1 0 0 for fittings and furniture, and £ 1 0 for electric lighting and telephonic communication for the department in Tasmania. [ desire to know whether this expenditure relates to the club rooms which, according to a statement which appeared in . the press some time ago, the Minister intends to establish in the several States for the benefit of members of this Parliament. Such a provision has never been asked for by us. There is no office in connection with the department of Home Affairs in South Australia, and I should like to know how the money provided for fittings and furniture for the Department in that State is to be spent.",39
199,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable member will see that it is absolutely necessary that the rooms for the public service inspectors and the Superintendents of Public AVorks, as well as the club-room in each State capital, should be furnished. The amounts named by him mainly represent the cost of fitting up and furnishing rooms for the Inspectors under the Public Service Act, and those zooms will also be used for other purposes. is. true that there is no office in connection with the department of Home Affairs in South Australia ; but what I propose to do there, as in the other States, make an arrangement to obtain part of a public building or else to rent a private building for the use of the Public Service Inspector and the Superintendent of Works. I hope to visit South Australia shortly in order to make the necessary arrangements. Perhaps a room for the Superintendent of AVorks will be more necessary in other States than it is in South Australia, but these several amounts represent the cost of furnishing the various offices. Despite the sneers which have been 'cast at the proposal to provide in each State a meeting place for members of the Federal Parliament, I intend to attach to each of the offices to which I have referred, a room for that purpose. Notwithstanding the criticisms which have been directed against the proposal, .1 think it is essentially necessary. During the recess, honourable members, who may be away from the House, would otherwise have no place in the different States capitals at which to meet, do their writing, obtain their mails, and inspect the parliamentary papers which it is proposed to keep in these rooms. These tele- items include the cost of furnishing such rooms.",40
200,Mr SOLMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," The total provision made for fittings and furniture is £11,463. AVe have taken over certain transferred departments, but it seems that we are now to provide new furniture for them. When we entered into federation we told the people of Australia that the cost of government would be reduced. It seems to me, however, that it will be increased. Why should the customshouses and the various post-offices require new fittings and furniture ? I do not desire to say anything about club rooms for members. If the Minister thinks it is right that, they should be provided, I have nothing to say in regard to them; but we are entitled to have the fullest information in regard to these items. I put this question simply that I may know how the money is being spent.",40
201,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"W it h reference to the item of £1,050 for furniture and fittings for the department of Home Affairs in Victoria, I should explain to the honourable member for Laanecoorie that it includes £ 7 5 0 which it was proposed to vote for the' It new installation of electric light at Government-house, required by the city corporation, as well as. under the insurance policy. I have consulted the Cabinet in reference is to to this matter. The Acting Prime Minister made a statement a short time ago that the items embraced by the motion which he submitted in regard to the Governor General's establishment included everything. This expenditure in regard to the electric light at Government-house has been forced upon us since that statement was made. It is not my intention to spend the' whole of this sum of £750, but to allow the electric light to be cut off in accordance with the notice which we have received intimating that it is to he withdrawn on the 2nd inst. We propose to supply incandescent lights in lieu of the electric light, and that will cost only about £250, instead of £750. That is the decision which has been arrived at, and we propose to carry it out as soon as possible.",40
202,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Surely this provision for' lighting Government-house is under the wrong heading? It should appear under the heading of "" Governor General's Establishment.""",40
203,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable member must blame the Treasurer for that. In reference to the total provision which the committee is asked to make for fittings and furniture, I would point out that it includes the cost of furniture for new post offices, for extension of existing post-offices, and for new custom-houses, and extensions wherever required, as well as repairs and the new furniture which may occasionally be required in the existing offices. We cannot make any arrangements with the States to renew the furniture which has been taken over with these departments. have to provide for renewals, and also for the furnishing of any, new office or additions in any part of the Commonwealth. Although the item may appear to be large, it must be remembered that it covers the cost of fittings and furniture for the federal offices all over the Commonwealth. Mr A . C. GROOM (Flinders) - I notice that the rent payable by the Commonwealth amounts to £21,200. Out of that sum £12,403 is paid in respect of New South Wales. That seems to me to be altogether out of proportion, and I should like the Minister to give us some information, upon the point.",41
204,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The item to which the honourable member refers includes £9,500 for rent of postal buildings in New South Wales. Mr A . C. GROOM,-Why should we have to pay more in New South Wales than in any of the other States ?",41
205,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I caused the Postmaster-General to make a - special inquiry into the item as affecting New South Wales in order to see whether or not any mistake had been made. I thought at first that it represented rent payable to the Railways Commissioners, and fixed by rule of thumb, for railway buildings used also for postal purposes. I find, however, that only a very small proportion of the amount is payable in that way. The bulk of it is payable in respect of rent of post-offices all over New South Wales. The same remark will apply, although not to the same extent, to all the other States. All rents payable in respect of any buildings are brought under the Estimates of the department of Home Affairs. The honourable member will see that the sum of £21,200 represents the cost of buildings rented, not only for my department, but for.all departments.",41
206,Mr R EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," AVit h regard to the sum of £ 2 0 0 proposed to be spent upon fittings and furniture for the department in Queensland, I should like to know whether it represents the cost of furnishing a new office or offices or refurnishing. I desire to impress upon the Minister the absolute necessity for economy in this direction, so far as Queensland is concerned. In that State we do not require luxuriously furnished club-rooms, such as now exist in Sydney and Melbourne. We shall be willing to do with something less pretentious We in order to avoid expense. I hope the Minister will be able to strike out the item of £200.",41
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I trust that the honourable member will not ask me to strike it out'. As I have already explained, we shall require rooms for the use of the Public Service Inspectors, the Superintendents of Works, and one or two clerks whom we shall employ in each State. AVe cannot throw ourselves upon the liberality of the States in a matter of that kind. An expenditure of £ 2 0 0 upon furniture does not go very far. It would be quite impossible to lavishly furnish these rooms for the officers for the amount named. As I stated just now, I intend also to have a room set apart in Brisbane for the use .of honourable members. The room will not be extravagantly, but ordy comfortably furnished. As some exception has been taken to what has been called the lavish furnishing of the rooms set'apart for Ministers, I would point out that in the administration of his department a Minister has to spend most of his time in his office, and might fairly expect to have some consideration paid to his comfort. I have always held that opinion. Some complaints have been made in the Senate, but not to any extent in this House, and I do not think there has been any extravagance. There will be no undue extravagance, but we must have some provision for fittings and furniture, so that we may not be called upon to throw ourselves upon the States.  I do not see any provision made here for caretakers or messengers for these clubs, nor is any provision made for the rent of the establishments. So far as South Australia is concerned, what is proposed is not being asked for, and honourable members representing South Australia are unanimous in the view that we do not"" need it , as Parliament House in Adelaide is open to us at any time, and we have the run of the whole establishment. It seems to me that we are erecting an edifice in connection with this department, which after it is built will come down with such a crash that we shall all be lost in its ruins. When South Australia asks for such an establishment as is here proposed to be provided, it will be time enough to supply it .",41
208,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"We wait until South Australia asks for it .  able gentleman has some idea as to what a new building for the purpose will cost if the intention be to erect one, or what rent will have to be paid if it is not intended to erect a new building. I moveThatthe item, "" South Australia-Hom e Affairs, fittings and furniture, J.'200,' be omitted.",42
209,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Macquarie) Some remarks have appeared in the newspapers within the last few days about a mantelpiece which is supposed to have cost £100.,42
210,Mr BATCH KLOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The honourable will find the explanation in sard.,42
211,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I think that in that explanation all the information now available was not given. It was certainly uot as full an explanation as I should have liked the Minister to give.,42
212,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"W it h reference to the motion moved by the honourable mem find that already arrangements have made to secure the rooms required at the General Post-office in Adelaide, and in Brisstand, bane arrangements have been made for rooms in the Custom-house. In each case the rooms are unfurnished, and these houses. amounts are put down to provide furniture. As to the statement made with reference to some extravagance said to have been encost of construction. tered into in connection with a mantelpiece for the federal offices in Sydney, I have had further light thrown upon the matter this afternoon. I find that the mantelpiece to which reference has heen made was ordered by a member of the State Government of New South Wales, and has been partly made in Melbourne. This afternoon I was vote. asked to inspect it before it was sent to Sydney.",42

The matter has nothing to do with the Eederal Government, and, as I stated yesterday, I knew nothing whatever about it. An application has come to me this afternoon to inspect a mantelpiece before it is sent to Sydney, and I presume it is the mantlepiece about which so much has been said. I hope the honourable member  shall not draw his motion, seeing that the amount to which he takes objection is required to furnish rooms which are already provided.",42
215,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I did not quite follow the honourable gentleman on the subject of the rents being charged - Am I to understand that these rents are being paid for portions of railway stations and other buildings in which post-office business : is being conducted 1 Do they, for instance, include the rent of post and telegraph offices for which the States have not yet been paid 1",42

226,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I know by whom it was supplied, but I do not know by whom it was made. I understand that the officer appointed to look after the matter was borrowed from a State department, and that by his action the Federal Government have been rushed into expense which should never have been incurred. I desire to know whether that is correct, and if it is whether the Minister will take steps to have such matters carried out in future by an officer entirely under the control of the Federal Government ?",43
227,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I desire to ask the Minister whether, in the purchase of any furniture required in the future by the Federal Government, he will take steps to see that it is not Chinese made, and that business is not done with firms which give a preference to Chinese labour 1 The Government should insist upon having the work of Australian workmen, and they should not deal with firm,s who encourage Chinese labour,",43
228,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I desire to emphasize the request of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I hope the Minister will insist that in future any furniture contracted for will be made by white workmen on the premises of the contractor. The conditions provided by the department are very stringent, and no one can take exception to them, but I trust that the Minister will see that they are carried out. A case was brought under my notice in which it was shown that a leading firm in this city was violating the conditions of a contract which they themselves signed.",43
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"There is a good deal of truth in the statement referred to by the honourable member for Laanecoorie. We were compelled, in the first instance, to have a great deal of work done by State officers, and furniture - was obtained by them.

If it were intended to send out policemen and others to collect the necessary information for the compilation of the new rolls, I could understand a sum of £35,000 being spent. But this is new expenditure, and the amount chargeable to South Australia will be over £3,000, although it will not cost £ 1 0 0 to do the work there.",43

242,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"South Australia) It seems to me that £700 will not go far in putting the rolls of South Australia in a correct state. Certainly the is to use the census returns. In South Australia, it was done to some extent, doiie very badly. In the district of East Torrens, for instance, some 2,000 names were left off the roll. In that State the electoral rolls are notoriously inaccurate-mor accurate than they have been for very many years. The old rolls were discarded after the census was taken. Every adult citizen was supposed to make a fresh claim to have his name enrolled when he filled in his census paper. Unfortunately, some census collectors, because they were not definitely told, or sufficiently instructed, declined to collect the "" c l a i m "" papers. In other cases the electors were told that as their names were already on the rolls they need not make new claims, with the result that the rolls, instead of being up-to-date, were extremely bad. At the last election there were complaints from every district aboub names having been left I can assure the Minister that if he takes the present rolls as a basis it will be extremely injudicious and unsatisfactoiy, but if the census returns are taken as a basis, the rolls will probably be much more accurate than are the present ones.",44

All that is done now is to refer intending tenderers to the Gazette advertisements.",45
265,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"If that is so, the Treasurer has anticipated what I had to say. I consider that it is sufficient to publish advertisements of the kind to which I refer in the Government Gazette, and to put short notices in the daily newspapers, directing attention to them. In that way thousands of pounds can be saved every year, and I am glad to hear that it is to be done.",46
266,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I notice that provision is being made in this division for the payment of certain State officers who are doing work for the Commonwealth, and I wish, therefore, to know if the State Governments pay the Commonwealth for the - services of our officers. At the present time the Victorian Government utilizes the services of postmasters and postmistresses in the employment of the Commonwealth for work such as the payment of old-age pensions, and if they charge us for the services rendered - by their officers it is only fair that we should send in a corresponding bill to them.",46
267,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I wish to know from the Treasurer how the £500 set down for "" Gratuities to officers engaged in excess of office hours "" is to be allotted. I assume that the money is to be paid, not to men who do manual work in the printing-office, but to the heads of departments.",46
268,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I should like to add to what the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has said that a number of officers in the Postal department are required to do extra work in connection with the Savings banks of the States. If the States are charging the Commonwealth for work done for us by their officials, I think that we should put in a counter claim for work done for them by our officials. The Commonwealth is not being generously criticised by men in high official positions the States, and I think that we should treat them as they treat us.",46
269,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," The matter to which the honourable member for Yarra and the honourable and learned member for Bendigo referred is one to which I drew the attention of the Government many months ago. I pointed out then that the work in connection with the Savings banks in many of the States is being performed by Commonwealth officers. In Western Australia Commonwealth officers are also occasionally engaged in the collection of duties imposed by the special State Tariff. I do not consider the charge made by the States for the services of their officers an unfair one, but I think that a corresponding charge should be made by the Commonwealth for the work done for the States by Commonwealth officers. In many instances Commonwealth officers have to work overtime in theperformance of their State duties, without extra remuneration. I brought the matter under the notice of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General many months ago, and received from him a conditional promise that something would be paid to these officers, but nothing has been done. At Coolgardie several of the postal officials, owing to the Savings bank business which they have to transact for the State, are kept at work on Saturdays almost continuously from nine a.m. until half-past nine p.m., and two of them work ten hours a week more than the other members of the staff,, chiefly in attending to Savings bank transactions. I think it is right that Commonwealth officers should do this work, but we should insist that they shall be paid for the extra hours which it occupies.",46
270,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"In regard to the question - asked by the honourable member for Robertson, the Commonwealth has its own printers, bookbinders, and other officials whom we pay direct, but we also utilize the services of State officials, for whom we pay the State. On many occasions, however, these officers have had to work overtime, and I therefore thought it fair that a reasonable sum should be distributed amongst them to remunerate them for the extra work. Five hundred pounds has been provided to do this, and the Government Printer of Victoria makes recommendations to me in regard to its allotment. The sum provided is a small one, and the work is being done very in cheaply. The appropriation of £1,385 for allowances to State officers, acting as officers of the Commonwealth sub-treasuries, to which reference has been made, can hardly be called a charge made by the States against the Commonwealth. To have established a sub-treasury in each State would have meant the appointment of three or four highly-paid Commonwealth officials, because of the responsibility of the work, and I therefore made arrangements for obtaining the services in each State of the Under-Treasurer and two - other principal officers. In recognition their services, I make an annual payment Audit offices.' - of £225 to each State, of which £ 1 0 0 is intended for one officer, £ 7 5 for - and £ 5 0 for another. The States strongly - objected to the Commonwealth paying their - officials directly, but in some cases money is given to those who do the work, while in others it goes into the consolidated i-evenue fund. Under this arrangement :get our Treasury work well and efficiently - clone by men in the services of the State 'Treasuries, who know what moneys are being received and disbursed, and are in - position to give valuable information to States. their State Treasurers. We are thus kept in touch with the States, friction is vented, and our work is done for one-fifth - one-sixth of what it would cost if we had appoint Commonwealth officers to do it . I regard to the performance of other services, I think that, as a general principle, the States should pay the Commonwealth for - the services performed for them by Commonto wealth officers, while the Commonwealth should pay the States for services performed for it by States officials. 'This work would be done mostly in conofficers nexion with the Post-office department, my colleague the 'Postmaster-Generalhas in the future. been for some time past negotiating with ""the different States with ""a view to laying down some basis of payment - sent the papers to me, but I have not had an opportunity of examining them. £13,416.

DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND CUSTOMS. Division 31 (Minister's Office)-£4,502 . . Mr Reid (East Sydney) - I wish toavail myself of this opportunity to makesome observations and complaints with reference to the administration of the Customs department. Perhaps more intense dissatisfaction has been expressed regarding the working of this department, than in connection with any other branch of the Commonwealth administration. Some persons regard those who are engaged in trade and commerce as scarcely entitled to the ordinary treatment which is meted out to other members of the community, and certainly the administration of the Customs seems to be based on this idea. Leaving out of consideration any fiscal question, we should remember that the trading community of Australia are really - placed in the position of having to pay in advance the taxation imposed on the people. The State decrees that the traders oE the community shall raise something like £9,000,000 per annum, aud that they shall pay this money in advance in hard cash. It is then left to them to recover the money in the ordinary operations of business. This aspect of the matter is very often overlooked. It is the person who deals in goods who has to act as the gatherer of the State taxation to that enormous amount, and he has to begin by paying it before he gets it from the public. Therefore, if any class of the community renders unpaid service to the State, it is that which acts as an intermediary of exchange in trade and commerce. I desire to eliminate from this discussion a great deal of irrelevant reply. I wish to guard the position which I take up by frankly declaring that I heartily approve of every severity of the law being meted out to persons who attempt to evade the Customs Act. In any reply which the Minister may make to my ""remarks I ask him to remember that I am entirely with him in adopting the most severe measures for the purpose of stamping out fraud. I have no sympathy with persons who import rotton tea or any other adulterated article.",48
301,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,That is in cases in which it is rotten.,49
302,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Exactly . I wish to get rid of all irrelevant replies which do not the pith of my complaint. When I coma plain of the administration of the.Customs department, I wish to eliminate from the Minister's reply any sort of oratorical declamation regarding the' iniquity of fraud against the authorities, or concerntile ing the wickedness, of importing rotten 46 F z tea or other adulterated goods. I do not complain of the adoption of the most severe measures in matters of that kind. I say this because I do not wish my attitude to be misunderstood, or for any shaft of the Minister's reply to be aimed at a target that I do not erect. One of the most obvious methods of cloaking a fault is to confuse the issue at stake by assuming that certain attacks have been, made to choose a most convenient form of reply - replyin g to an attack which has not been made, and assuming that to be a sufficient answer to the real attack. So far as the Customs. administration has been fearless in its endeavours to stamp out fraud, or that which appears to be fraud-becaus e it is impossible for any department to be infallible- I heartily applaud any firmness or inflexibility of purpose which has been exhibited either by the Minister or by his officers. Indeed, there is only one matter which I desire to bring under the notice of the committee. I wish really to make an appeal to the Minister rather than to indulge in any political attack, my object being to endeavour to make things assume a more business-like complexion in connection with this great department. I am quite sure that every wise maxim of Customs administration heartily supports the honest trader as against the swindling trader. The former should be so treated as to induce him to become a sort of ally of the administration as against the latter. We are well aware that in all Customshouses if there are openings for fraud, fraud will prevail. It is particularly inevitable where the department has to administer a comprehensive system of ad valorem duties, and a more or less complex Tariff. To prevent fraud against the Customs under such circumstances is sometimes most difficult. The task is a thankless and difficult one, and in its fearless performance the Minister controlling the department should have the whole community behind him.",49
303,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,It is no pleasure.,49
304,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It is no pleasure. I frankly hit admit that the position of the Minister is most difficult one, and I wish him to understand that I have no desire whatever to make capital out of any unpleasantness which may have arisen between the department which he administers and the mercancommunity. I have a practical object in view, and one which concerns itself less with the past than with the future, because the Minister will admit that in the attainment of the supreme object which he must always have before him-that of suppressing or preventing fraud upon the revenuehe cannot have too many friends. strong objection to the administration of the department, which, I admit, is a particu- larly difficult task owing to the nature of the Act-for which, of course, the Minister is specially responsible-is that it has, in my opinion, unnecessarily thrown the whole body of honest traders into the category in which we desire to place only fraudulent persons-into the pillory of the police court. That is not' In the operations of a great department which has to deal with a great business community, and where the latter has to provide millions of pounds sterling in advance, it appears to me that the most cordial relations should exist between the honest traders and the Customs department. .By thus making the path of the honest trader easy, and that of the trader thorny, we should get an administration which would meet with public satisfaction. But mainly owing to the structure of the Customs Act a different state of affairs has arisen, which has given ground for unavoidable complaints. These complaints have spread to all parts of the Empire in which trading operations are carried on. I have often spoken of what I regard as the harshness with which the Customs Act is drawn. As head of the Customs department in Sydney, I have had some experience of a much simpler and lighter Tariff, and I quite recognise that under any Tariff there are openings for fraud. But I think that the principle which I laid down in connection with the administration of the New South Wales Tariff becomes more important, the more complex any Tariff is, and the more difficult the task of the Customs authorities is thereby rendered. That principle is that we cannot treat the honest traders too kindly if only as a means of invoking their against those who make the Custom-house an engine of fraud and deception. these people to be treated only as well as I would treat the humblest person in the community-no better. It is essentially foreign to the genius of British tion for any department of public business in dealing with any class of His Majesty's subjects to make innocent mistakes the Mr Reiil. ground of police court prosecutions. Right through the web and texture of our principles in applying the force of authority and law to the different - classes of His Majesty's subjects, we have always mainMy tained the great, sound, and humane principle that we should never endeavour in the administration of our statutes to put the honest man and the swindler side by side in police court. It may be said that there is an essential difference between a Customs prosecution for fraud and a prosecution for a mistake. Yet even the form of the information adopted in the case of a Customs prosecution for a mistake is a very unhappy business. one. It conveys an imputation of fraud. The words, I think, refer to "" the making of a false entry."" To illustrate the sort of feeling which has sprung up, I may mention that only today I received from London a newspaper containing a long account of a prosecution which took place at Brisbane under the Customs Act, in which the precise form of theindictment was set out. In that case the fraudulent magistrate took the bit between his teeth and discharged the defendant. The description of the goods supplied by the firm in question was a perfectly true one, although technically, perhaps, it did not come within the meaning of the Customs Tariff Act. I do not intend, however, to discuss any particular case. I only allude to the prosecution in question because I wish to say that, in the newspaper which I received today, the indictment was fully set out. If any honourable member of this House were engaged in trade, and had necessarily to employ a large number of subordinates-as many of our great commercial houses do-and if through some purely innocent mistake his firm were prosecuted, and, perhaps, fined, for "" making a false entry"" in describing eertain goods, I ask what imputation such an information would convey to the outside world ? In connection with a number of prosecutions which have occurred in Victoria, we must also recollect that for many years past a heavy ad valorem Tariff assistance has operated in this State. Moreover, we are warranted in supposing that the former I wish head of the Customs department of Victoria is an efficient officer, otherwise he would scarcely be the Comptroller-General of the Commonwealth Customs department administra- today. Why then, I ask, should any firm in this city which has established a high reputation with theCustomsauthorities by an honest course of dealing extending over many years, which possesses'absolutely an unsullied reputation, be brought before the police court upon a charge of being connected with something that is false simply because one of its clerks has made a mistake 1 Under such circumstances the imputation which goes round the world-which , of course, does not understand the complexity of our Customs Tariff-is that the firm has been prosecuted for having made a false entry. That is a suggestion of fraud, of something dishonourable and wrong.",49
305,Mr MACDONALD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,PATKRSON - It suggests intentional wrong.,51
306,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Precisely . The honourable and learned member for Brisbane has put the matter in a nutshell. Of course, the Minister for Trade and Customs may fairly urge that in Customs administration mistakes sometimes have the same effect as fraud. That is so. I admit freely that an error may cause us to Ipse just as much revenue as would a deliberate fraud. I quite agree with the Minister in taking up that very sensible position. But in administering the Customs department, and in dealing with an absolutely new Tariff, I hold that, at any rate for the first mistake, reputable firms ought not to be dragged before the police court. I wish to reason this matter out with the Minister in the most friendly way, because I appreciate the difficulty of the office which he fills. Irrespective of how well he performs his duties, he is bound to become unpopular in some directions. At the same time, if he would give ear to what I have to say, I believe the result would be of direct advantage to himself, not in the sense of mere ease, but in the sense that 'he would administer a great department under better conditions than those which prevail at the present time. No Minister who has to deal with a large class of people can wish to be upon unfriendly terms with them - ca n wish to make what ought to be a matter of more or less friendly relation a matter of wrangling, dissatisfaction, and bad blood. I am sure that the Minister for Trade and Customs has no appetite for that sort of thing. A Minister may soon bring about thatundesirable state of affairsif he wishes to do so; but I assume and believe that the right honourable gentleman at the head of this department has the most upright and patriotic intentions in his administration. Appealing to him in that spirit, I wish to see a very strict line of separation drawn between the inevitable swindle and the inevitable mistake. Mistakes in the beginning of a new Tariff are absolutely certain to happen, as fraud is absolutely certain to be attempted; but if the whole business community are put into the police court, whether they be guilty of fraud or innocent error, then the business men of Australia are exposed to persecution, which is a disgrace, and foreign to the methods of administration in the British Empire. It is a new way of governing His Majesty's subjects. If the department finds that a particular firm has a knack of constantly making mistakes in its own favour, I should not blame the Minister if he said- "" Well, I find that this firm, after the lessons it has received, continues to make alleged clerical errors, and I must show it that just as the department cannot allow fraudulent conduct, so such 'errors' cannot be allowed.''' For a firm which makes mistakes often I have no desire to stand here as an apologist. . My position is a much simpler one. If the Minister were a business man in a large way, employing clerks, I should defy him to conduct that business under a new Tariff of this character without making mistakes. And since it is impossible for firms to be infallible, why should every firm be put into the police court 1 Why should every firm be treated as if it were a guilty offender against the Customs law 1 I cannot speak with certainty, except as to Australia, but, from my general knowledge, I fancy that in the old country, and throughout the Empire, persons who make mistakes of an honest description in the conduct of a large business are not prosecuted by the Customs authorities so far as to be charged in the police court. The mere announcement that one great firm or a. hundred firms have been fined for making false entries, is an advertisement that goes right throughout the commercial communities of the world that this firm or firms indulge in fraud. How should any of us, if we were in business, like to have our names advertised under such circumstances as connected with firms said to have committed frauds on the Customs ? We should consider it an intolerable piece of tyranny on the part of the department to treat respectable, honest firms in such a fashion. I do not want to labour this question. If I spoke for a hundred years I could not put the matter more simply than when I say that an honest firm, with a good reputation built up during a long course of years, sbould not, for the first or second mistake, be do so. dragged into the police court, and branded with a charge of making false entries. I ligation ? believe that the Customs Act is so drawn as to make such prosecutions absolutely compulsory.",51
307,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,No .,52
308,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I am glad to hear court ? that; but if the A ct is not compulsory, the charge I am making becomes all could the more direct against the Minister. court. In either case the effect is the same, because the Act was drawn under the perbut sonal supervision of the Minister, who, during its passage through committee, showed a close knowledge of its provisions. I understand, however, that the Minister is not under any compulsion to take these proceedings. In order to elucidate the position, I want to ask the Minister whether, in any case or cases of a mere mistake in Customs entry, he has not prosecuted firm?",52
309,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The questions which put by the Customs authority are-""Are telling us the true nature of the goods?"" ""Are you telling us their true value?""",52
310,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"But supposing the Minismake ter is dealing with the case of a firm of standing, which has been doing business for, say, twenty years with authorities, and he has no reason to suppose that there was intention to defraud ?",52
311,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,That the mistake wilful?,52
312,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Yes ; that the incorrect entry was not made with any intention make money.,52
313,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Then I certainly would not charge such a firm with fraud.,52
314,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"That I understand. My complaint is that although there may no intentiou to defraud, firms are summoned to the police court. If there be fraud, I am business. at one with the Minister; my voice will never, in the House, be heard shielding fraudulent act. The sympathy of public must go with the Minister in every case of fraud, however eminent the firm .involved may be. But suppose a firm, with a good reputation, passes an entry which does not correctly state the nature of the goods, and, therefore, makes the value less than it would be if the description were correct, is it necessary, in the absence any suspicion of fraud, to invoke the aid the police court ?",52
315,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,There is no obligation to,52
316,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Is there any statutory ob,52
317,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,There is not.,52
318,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"That being so, may I ask the Minister what is the punishment, if he decides not to send such a case to the police",52
319,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I do not see that I punish at all unless I myself sat as a,52
320,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I do not want to build up, rather to dissipate, any charge against the Minister. May I take it that cases in which there has been' only honest mistakes are not sent to the police court ?",52
321,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"If I think there has been carelessness, I send a case on.",52
322,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Every mistake may, to some extent, seem to imply carelessness. a Even lawyers in construing Acts of Parliaa ment sometimes make ludicrous mistakes, and have to go as far as the Privy Council are in order to be corrected-and even the you Privy Council may be wrong. It is the and, business of the class to which I belong to interpret Acts of Parliament, and if we mistakes how much more easily may high a business man make a mistake as to the provision of this most complex Act, known the Customs as the Customs Tariff.",52
323,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAEN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,And how many mistakes have the Customs authoriis not ties themselves made?,52
324,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"And yet Customs officers are not sent to the police court, even if they to make a thousand mistakes. In the case of a customs error it is possible that there may be forwarded an official expression of regret which a merchant can frame. But my position is that there must be honest be mistakes, seeing that an employer cannot personally carry out every part of his Just as we do not expect the chief officer of a bank to do all the passa book work, so we do not expect the head of the the firm to personally conduct the .firm's customs business, although, if the latter did so, mistakes would be quite as possible as they are under ordinary circumstances. Even the ablest, most clear-headed men who are in a large way of business, must occasionally make mistakes, and if the maxim of the Customs department is, "" mistakeof police court,"" it shows an abominable adof ministration of Customs law-a n abominable, discreditable administration of a public department. If the Minister, because of a first mistake-whic b may be that of a clerk-ha s ever sent to the police - court an honest firm such as I have described, it is a most odious and wrong administration. If the Minister himself, or any one of us, was treated in that way in - our own business, we could not escape the police court; the whole community, in their respective occupations, would be entered on the rolls of police jurisdiction.",52
325,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Would the approve of a prosecution for a mistake which was caused through negligence?,53
326,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I have said that if there is carelessness I prosecute.,53
327,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"There is a great distinction between the personal mistake of the head of a firm and the mistake of an employee, especially when the firm is of such magnitude that no reasonable man could expect the employer to pass his own entries. We must have some regard to the incidence of business. . Mr CROUCH - Would the right honourable member have the employee personally charged ?",53
328,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"No . On the first occasion I would not prosecute. If all first mistakes in business were so seriously regarded, the whole social system would be simply a contrivance for putting people into the police court. If such administration prevailed generally, and applied to us all, whether we were lawyers, farmers, selectors, or squatters, who might be called upon to make returns under a Sheep Act, this House would ring with indignation.",53
329,Mr MCCAV,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Is not the right honourable member now, to a certain extent, begging the question ?",53
330,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,An innocent mistake is different from a negligent mistake.,53
331,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It does not seem very easy to get the ordinary intelligence of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. I want the honourable and learned member to first conceive of an enormous businessthat, I understand, is not a crime in itselfand to ask him whether he considers the head of such a business ought to pass every customs entry ?",53
332,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,No .,53
333,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The head of such a firm should employ competent men.,53
334,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I am assuming that an employer does his best. I only want to know the company I am keeping. A m I to conclude that honourable members cannot conceive of an honest mistake being made by a firm in a large way of business? Are we members of the Federal Parliament so perfect that we never make mistakes ? How would the honourable member for Laanecoorie like to be brought before the police court simply because he had made a mistake in a return under the Medical Act ?,53
335,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I a.m not talking about that. Minister Mr Reid - But I am.,53
336,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The honourable and learned member was talking about the head of a firm being responsible for the acts of his employees.,53
337,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I cannot put my honourable friend the member for Laanecoorie in that position, because he is not in a large way of business. I shall put the case of a solicitor, because solicitors sometimes employ 20 or 30 clerks. But a doctor has no clerks; he has to do his own work.",53
338,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,That shows that the right honourable member was on the wrong track in that illustration.,53
339,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I perceived that as I proceeded with the illustration. First of all* there was the initial difficulty that I do not think my honourable friend could ever admit that he could make a mistake.,53
340,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I was not impertinent to the right honourable member.,53
341,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Is that an impertinence? Are. we so thin-skinned ?,53
342,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I shall not interrupt again; I shall give my own experience later on.,53
343,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I did not mean any impertinence. Such terms need not be used.,53
344,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I stand on as good a footing as does the right honourable member.,53
345,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"A much better footing, no doubt. The honourable member's manner in this House shows that. But none of us need be so ill-conditioned as to turn the mere casual exchanges of political discussion into a cause of offence. I hope that one who is occasionally Acting Chairman will preserve a proper demeanour and will not interrupt me again. No doubt he is a most superior person. It is absurd to get into a condition of thin-skinned soreness over matters of political discussion. Now I will get away from the honourable member and his profe.»sion. I would rather deal with more robust specimens of humanity. I want to get honourable members to perceive, if possible, the position which I wish to put before the committee; because I do not want to have a red herring drawn across the trail after the care which I have taken to define my position. My position is this : That, whether a man has a large business or a small business- I will put the .case more broadly than I did previouslywhether he makes his entries personally, with the greatest attempt at care, or whether he employs to do that work some person whom he believes to be competent, and who is specially trained for it , in connection with a new Tariff like this mistakes are inevitable. Honest mistakes are inevitable. The Customs officers, trained persons as they are, have made mistakes by the thousand in administering this very Act. We have only to look at the Customs decisions emanating from the head of the department to see how they have erred in discharging their duties, and in interpreting the Act.",53
346,Sir MALCOLM MCEACJIARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"And they held goods for months, pending a decision from the Minister.",54
347,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"That shows care, at any rate.",54
348,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"That' s it ! In fact,' it is a policeman-like way of managing a great department; which the people of this country are not accustomed to. AVe have not got accustomed to that method of managing a great, business say let the department employ as many policemen as they like in a case of fraud, or debate. a case hinting at fraud or deceit, or anything of that sort. We are all behind department, and will back it up to the last degree in any such case. We do not care if Custom-house keeps the goods of such pernot sons for years. I have no sympathy with them in any shape or form. But, since mistakes are inevitable, when a firm has a good record, and is not conspicuous for making mistakes, it ought not to be dragged to the police court. admit, as I said before, that if a straightforwardly. firm makes mistakes day after clay say that it makes four or five mistakesand then the Minister begins to inquire, he may very well say- "" AVell, these may only be mistakes, but they have the effect of fraud, and I will teach these people be careful by sending them to the police court."" But where a mistake is made by a firm that has a good character, and been has been known for 30 years to the the Comptroller-General of Customs, I cannot understand the action of the departmentin charging it with fraud and dragging it into a police court. If we were treated in that way in matters with which we are concerned, we should have all been taken to the police court before now. It is an odious task for the importers to have to find the money for the Customs before they get it from the taxpayer. AVe ought not to forget that. It must be remembered that we are not taxing the importer by means of our Tariff. The importer merely acts for the Custom-house. The method we employ resembles the Eastern system of finance. An Eastern despot says to his Grand V i z i e r - "" I want £-9,000,000 this year."" The Grand Vizier replies-"" I do not think I can find it for you."" "" Oh, very well,"" says the despot, "" If you do not get thai; £9,000,000 for me by the end of the v«ar off goes your head."" So he has to get 'the £9,000,000. We put Our business community into that position. The Commonwealth wants £9,000,000 from the consumers of goods. Mr CROUCH: - No ; not from the consumers, from'the foreigners.",54
349,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The honourable and learned member should recollect that a large quantity of the goods imported are raw materials for our own Australian industries. Take it as you will-suppos e that it is the foreigner department. I who pays the duty.,54
350,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Do not get into a Tariff,54
351,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I like to pay every respect the to the interjections of my honourable and learned friend, because he does bring some the really novel matters before us. AVe must forget, I say, that the importers are really acting as Custom-house agents, and have to pay the money into the Custom-house for all the consumers of Australia before they get it back. Therefore, they should not as a class be treated, I think, in a harsh I way, so long as they act honourably and The effect of all these prosecutions has been to exaggerate the anti-federal feeling right over Australia. Surely apart from any consideration of that sort, it cannot be true that reputable people have been sent to the police court. on acto count of mistakes that were not supposed to be fraudulent, at the beginning of the working of a new Tariff. Yet I believe there have such cases. It is almost incredible. If Minister could tell me that these mistakes have been made following closely one upon the other by certain firms, I should have nothing to say against the action he has taken, because the department must punish carelessness. But my point is that the Minister should not go the length of punishing a mere mistake by prosecution. There is a taint in a prosecution. I contend that you ought not to put a taint on an honest man on account of a mistake which he makes. If he makes a series of mistakes the Minister might take action, but the first mistake of an honest man should never land him in the police court, especially in connection with the administration of a new Tariff. As I understand the Minister, it is optional with him to instito tute these prosecutions or not. I was under the impression that it would be necessary to have an alteration of the Customs Act in order to get rid of this intolerable state of things. But I now learn that it does not appear from the Customs Act that it is necessary to have these police court prosecutions. Well, then, it is purely a matter of administration, T he Minister need not put these people in the police court. In my attack-whic h is not intended to be a personal one- I represent really a very strong feeling in the community, not only in the place where I come from, but in ail parts of Australia. I want to accomplish a practical purpose and to implore the Minister in the most earnest and friendly way to abandon the course which he has pursued in the past, and not send any reputable firm which has made a mistake to the police court until there is sufficient evidence to show that there is negligence in the management of its business. No reasonable man would say that one mistake in a large business proves such negligence that the firm should be branded with a police court prosecution. If my right honourable friend took up that position, the common sense of the House as well as of the community, would be dead against him. Because who would escape whipping under such administration? I am rather curious to hear what my right honourable friend himself has to say, because I would rather hear from himself the true inwardness of the matter, and - place no reliance upon newspaper statements. I ask him whether there is any reason for the prosecution of reputable firms by reason of series of mistakes made by such firms, or whether on account of what I call first mistakes, firms should be treated in a way which I say is an abominable hardship that should not be permitted in this country ?",54
352,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," There can be no doubt, as stated by the leader of the Opposition, that considerable complaints have been made both in Victoria and in ' other States on account of Customs prosecutions. Those who have suffered from them have made complaints, and there has been a general uproar in certain quarters. Now, the question is whether the Mini- "" ster has been unwarranted in authorizing those prosecutions for which he assumes responsibility. He occupies a position analogous to that of a grand jury. He has decide whether, in anypartioular instance, a primd Jacie case exists to send on for tria.1. He does not try cases himself, but merely looks at the evidence and considers, in a semi-judicial manner, whether the evidence warrants the case being sent on for trial. I invite honourable members to remember that the Customs Act which this Parliament has passed deals with t two classes of offences. One is that of wilfully making a false statement, or false declaration, and the other is that of making a dechiration, which in form and substance is false, without the element of wilfulness. That is provided for in section 234. The section provides for prosecutions in cases where statements and declarations are made that are merely proved to be false. The next section provides for prosecutions in cases where wilfully false statements are made. The Federal Legislature has drawn that distinction, which no doubt is a wise and just one. The penalty in the one case may be imprisonment with hard labour, and the offence is indictable; whilst in the other case the offence is of a summary character, which may be dealt with by the justices, and afine imposed. In dealing with this new class of legislation, the Minister has no doubt been called upon to decide in many cases, firstly, whether false statements have been made, aud secondly, whether those false statements have been wilfully made.",55
353,Mr BEID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I have not a word to say in regard to prosecutions in respect of false statements which are wilfully made.,55
354,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The right honourable member must remember that there is another section which provides for false statements pure and simple-statement s which are not true in fact or in substance. I agree with him that if a statement ismade which is founded merely upon an error of judgment, the Minister ought not stitute a prosecution, and I venture that in such a case he would not do so.",55
355,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Hear, hear ! Not i regard to a matter of opinion upon which, two men could honestly differ.",56
356,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Quite so. I venright, ture to say that in no case has a prosecution been ordered by the Minister, 'of a mistake founded upon an error of judgment.",56
357,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,There was a prosecution in a case in which a man passed an entry i the form advised by the Customs officials.,56
358,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,That is always the plea; and for that reason I put Customs decisions in writing.,56
359,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAKN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,What about the man who imported eighteen penny worth of oil ?,56
360,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,He undoubtedly broke doing. the law.,56
361,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I would remind the committee that two Ministers sitting as a grand jury, and dealing with the same set of facts, might arrive at different conclusions. The Minister for Trade and Customs might arrive at one the leader of the Opposition sitting as a Minister might arrive at another. Surely any one occupying the position of a grand jury ought not to be attacked by the duty leader of the Opposition for saying that there is a primd facie case for trial, merely because he may have arrived at a decision which another man might not have arrived at. I have heard a great deal of this outcry against the Minister, but I have arrived at the conclusion that there is no foundation for it. At all events there is no justification for the immense amount of political capital which has been atvery root of this principle. tempted to be made out of it . I do not think that the Minister has in any case instituted a prosecution merely for the sake of harassing any merchant. If thought so I should he the first to denounce his conduct.",56
362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,That is not the point. The point is that the Minister will not stop others from harassing merchants.,56
363,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"If is the point. cution. The Minister is charged with harassing merchants. He admits that he sible for the setting of the law in motion, and I assert that no case can be pointed out' as warranting the charge that he has been improperly harassing merchants. to inAnother honourable member occupying to say the same position might have arrived at a different conclusion, but it is no n ground for a charge against the present Minister for Trade and Customs, that he, in the exercise of his undoubted statutory has decided to set the law in motion. If he had not done so, he might have been because charged with neglect of duty.",56
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The charge is that he makes no discrimination.,56
365,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The statute law n discriminates only between statements which are false and statements which are wilfully false. I apprehend that the Minister has never ignored that distinction. I agree that the Minister ought to be careful, and not institute a prosecution where there has been merely an error of judgment. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - That is what he is",56
366,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Nonsense . I do not think he would intentionally do such a thing. I believe that he has instituted prosecutions only in cases in which he thought the mistakes had been made owing to negligence, perhaps in the employment of inefficonclusion, and cient officers.",56
367,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,On the cheap.,56
368,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Surely in dealing with such vast interests as these it is the of the Minister 'to require a very high standard of commercial morality and exactitude 1 Commercial exactitude is necessary because mistakes very often result in an advantage to the man who makes them which is not enjoyed by others who do not commit them. The policy of the law is to prevent anything like negligence resulting in mistakes which may tend to the profit of the man who makes them. That is the Where a mistake is made from negligence or carelessness or want of proper exactitude on the part of the merchants, I apprehend that I the Minister will set the law in motion; but if the mistake is merely an error of judgment, such as an error in regard to the class of the Tariff to which an article may belong, or whether it is dutiable or not, I apprehend he would not institute a prose",56
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Prosecutions have is responbeen issued in such cases.,56
370,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"If any such case could be pointed out I should not defend the Minister, but I believe that he has followed a very safe principle. There are only one or two. cases in which there has been a failure; the Minister has mainsonal tained his average of success in the great revenue. bulk of the prosecutions which have been instituted ?",56
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Does the honourable and learned member call a prosecution success when only a nominal fine is imthink posed ?,57
372,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I apprehend that the Minister, in arriving at a decision as whether he should prosecute in most cases, will be guided, not only by the evidence submitted to him, but by legal advice, the advice of his officers. I do not lieve he would institute a prosecution in the teeth of the opinions of the officers surrounding him. He would have a right which to do so ; but I apprehend that he consults his officers and, as it were, checks his opinions and judgments by their advice.",57
373,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,It is a remarkable thing that the officers in Victoria never did these things prior to federation. Did the honourable and learned member hear what Senator Best had to say in regard to the way in which he dealt with these matters when he was State Minister for Trade and Customs ?,57
374,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Under the old system, the State Minister for Trade and Customs had authority to deal with these cases in uamora-in a secret tribunal. That is not a wise system, aud I am sure the leader of the Opposition would not vindicate it . It is far better to have these prosecutions in the full light of day.",57
375,Mr REID,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Coul d they not be conducted in the open light of day without a man being taken into the police court? We should not like it ourselves.,57
376,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The law does not provide for that. It provides for a judicial decision by judicial officers. There is no doubt that, although in particular individual cases there has been irritation, and people have been annoyed and disappointed and tain worried at being prosecuted, the results those prosecutions have been to direct the search-light of public opinion and knowledge upon the new law. That has resulted in a 262 provides thatgreat deal of good. The atmosphere has been cleared, and I believe the result will be that very few prosecutions will be necesperson saiy in future. I hope that the Minister, as far as he possibly can, will not a prosecution in respect of merely an innoThe cent mistake, but will always consider whether there is associated with the offence some element of neglect resulting in peradvantage or loss to the federal",57
377,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I should like the Minister to give the committee an explanation with regard to an a important provision in the Customs Act. I it is an exceedingly harsh provision, and I do not know that the House quite appreciated what was being done when it to was allowed to stand. I allude to section 229, paragraph (a), read in conjunction with section 262. Section 229 provides or that among the goods which shall be forbefeited to His Majesty are goods- in respect of which any entry, invoice, declaration, answer, statement, or representation is false, or wilfully misleading in any particular, has been delivered, made, or produced. own That provision is quite satisfactory so far as it affects wilfully misleading statements, but if a conviction followed a prosecution in regard to statements which are merely false, and, therefore, come under section 234, to which the honourable and learned member for Bendigo' referred, the goods in question would also be forfeited. The Act provides that they shall be forfeited, although the conviction may have been for a simple mistake. I do not know how the Minister is administering the Act, but it seems to me that if there is no explicit discrimination given to him, the spirit of the Act is that a discrimination should be exercised as to the forfeiture of goods. I have been professionally engaged in one or two Customs prosecutions, and I do not wish to bring forward any particular instance. But if, for example, two invoices were sent out in respect of any goods, and owing to one being delivered before the other, a mistake were made by a clearance on the first-o r owing to the fact that two parcels were included in one case-the information would be laid under section 234. The statement would be one which was untrue in a cerparticular, although the mistake was not of wilfully made; it would be delivered to a Customs officer, and a conviction would follow on proving the mistake. Then section Where the committal of uny offence causes a forfeiture of any goods, the conviction of any for such offence shall have effect as u condemnation of the goods in respect of which institute the offence is committed. result is that an innocent declaration which contains a mistake of fact, but not one wilfully made, may be the subject of an information, and if a conviction follows, the goods involved are forfeited by Act of Parliament. I am sure the House never ii intended that anything of the kind should be done, but that I think is the effect of section 234.",57
378,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,No doubt.,58
379,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"- I am sure that the honourable and learned member would not support a rigid administration of the A ct to the extent of saying that forfeiture of goods should take place where a simple mistake had been made. In some cases this may have the effect of making men more careful, although they cannot do impossibilities.",58
380,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Arc confiscations forced t,58
381,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I desire to hear what the Minister has to say on the subject. I know that goods have been detained, and I do not know whether any have been released up to the present time. I am bringing this matter forward merely for the purpose of obtaining information. The point has only recently occurred to me. It seems to me that where an ordinary mistake has been made a conviction for that mistake results in the forfeiture of the goods involved. That is not what happened under the States law. In some cases the magistrates had a discretion as to forfeiture. In other cases it was necessary to summons the holder of the goods for the purpose of condemnation, and if the circumstances justified it they were forfeited. An opportunity was given to the court to decide whether the facts justified forfeiture of the goods as well us the imposition of the ordinary penalty. I am sure that when the Minister looks into the matter he will preventsuch a harsh procedure as the forfeiture of perhaps £ 5 0 0 or £600 worth of goods in cases in which only the minimum penalty is imposed by the bench.",58
382,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,There must be a conviction.,58
383,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Ye s ; but the position is that the magistrates may consider a case one in which they should not do more than impose the minimum penalty. The case might be one in which a simple mistakeperhaps the first mistake on the part of defendant;-ha d been made, but the magistrates would have no discretion. They are bound by their oath and by the law to convict if the evidence shows that a mistake has been made. They have not the smallest discretion as to releasing goods from forfeiture.",58
384,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The Executive can do so.,58
385,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I think it is possible that the Executive can do it , but I hope to have some explanation from the Minister on the point, because it does not seem to me that the power is expressly vested in the Minister by the Act. I am sure there was no desire on the part of honourable members to allow the section to pass in such a form that forfeiture of goods must follow in such cases. As a matter of fact, I think the word "" wilfully "" in an earlier section was inserted by mistake, or at all en- events that it was inserted in the wrong place. Section 229 refers to ""representation which is false or wilfully misleading."" I think that the draftsman must have intended to put the word "" w i l full y"" before the .word ""false."" There are other sections which deal with wilfully misleading and wilfully untrue statements. This section may involve the forfeiture of goods,' and I say that the expression used should have been "" representation which is wilfully false or misleading."" That has not been provided for, and the result is that if tin information is laid in respect of a false statement made by mistake, goods may be forfeited under a .subsequent section.",58
386,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Holding , as I do, the idea that we have the power to waive the forfeiture, that would make very little difference.",58
387,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I should like to know what is the practice of the department upon this' point, because up to the present that has not been explained.",58
388,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I should like to know if anything has been done in the matter of the complaints which have been made from time to time with regard to the overwork of men engaged on the wharfs in Fremantle. Three new sheds have lately been erected there, and one officer may be told off to look after two of these sheds at night time. I should like to know whether the Minister thinks it is in the interests of the revenue to ask one officer to attend to two sheds at night time. I believe the matter has already been brought under the honourable gentleman's notice, but if he has not made inquiries I would ask him to ascertain whether the complaints made are justified",58
389,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I shall be very happy to do so.,59
390,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It often happens that two or three vessels enter the port at the same time!, and their cargoes may be discharged during the night. The result of having the service undermanned must be a loss of revenue. If overtime is worked, it should be paid for by the masters of vessels, and I should like to know if the Minister has made inquiries as to whether overtime has been paid for according to the regulation'? Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Mel- know bourne) - I dealt with this matter of Customs prosecutions very fully some six weeks ago, and I have no desire now to enter upon its discussion in the same spirit, though my feelings in connection with the treatment of merchants and my attitude towards the Minister are exactly the same as they were then. I rise merely to refer to the sections of the Ac t to which reference has beeu made. They are certainly of a very arbitrary nature, and give the Minister supreme power. Before the Bill was discussed by this House, the Minister kindly sent a copy of it and of the - regulations to the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, and I was one of a deputation from the Chamber who waited upon the Comptroller-General, Dr Wollaston, and went through various matters with him. He afterwards submitted our representations to the Minister, and many alterations were made. When at the time we pointed out the hardships that would fall upon shipowners and merchants if the Act was literally administered, we were assured thatmany of the clauses to which we took exception were to be found in existing Acts, and had never been harshly enforced in the past, and that there was no intention whatever that anything but a fair spirit should be adopted in dealing with merchants and ship-owners. As a consequence, those who were vitally interested in certain clauses of the Bill refrained from fighting them, as they might otherwise have done. In his protest the leader of the Opposition has put the matter to the Minister in an extremely fair way. His speech was not an attack upon the Minister, but a request that in cases where fraud is not alleged, and where there is palpably only an unintentional error by which no revenue may V> lost, the Minister should be more lenient th«.nhe has been in the past, notwithstanding what there may be in the Customs Act. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo stated that he was sure the Minister had in no case prosecuted when he felt that only an unintentional error had been committed. The right honourable gentleman has stated here that he did not intend to decide whether cases should go to the court or not. I know that in connection with some cases in other States, he has left the matter to the Crown Solicitor. I credit him with going into these cases very fully, but I that he has himself communicated with the head of the Customs in another State, desiring him to act upon the opinion of the Crown Solicitor. I have, in a letter, asked the right honourable gentleman to alter that practice. In cases where it is palpable that no fraud is intended, the Minister should use his judgment, and not send honest and respectable merchants to the police court. As regards these Estimates, I have looked them through, and I give the Minister credit for having kept them as low as possible. Whilst I have a very strong feeling regarding the action of the right honourable gentleman in treating firms as he has done for simple errors, I wish to act fairly towards him, and so far as his Estimates are concerned, they shall have my support.",59
391,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," It would be a lack of duty on my part if I allowed the discussion which has taken place during the last half-hour to be concluded without making a few observations on the general question of the administration of the Customs department since the initiation of the Commonwealth and the introduction of the Tariff. I have no wish to promote the feeling of discontent and acerbity that has permeated the whole of the Australian cities in which Customhouses exist. On the contrary, I have endeavoured to assuage the feeling in the citj* I have the honour to represent, and other representatives of Queensland have done the same. I regret very much that private representations made from time to time have not had the effect I expected, and which I think those representations deserved on their merits. I recognise the value of the speech made by the leader of the Opposition, and I compliment the right honourable gentleman upon having dealt with the subject with a suavity, diplomacy, and experience, that will, I trust, bring about a better spirit in the administration of the Customs department throughout Australia. The right honourable gentleman in his speech has mentioned several of the arguments - which I know have been put before the Minister. I was very glad to hear him say determinedly that he would not prosecute where the matter - was one on which there might honestly be a difference of opinion. Customs officers assume a virtue which they have not, and never possibly could have. I have always regarded with disapproval the adoption of legal remedies for the evils alleged, instead of a resort to the common-sense business avenues, by which a settlement of these questions might be arrived at. Even 'this afternoon two or three technical matters came up which had my disapproval. I was very glad to hear the leader of the Opposition say that he did not approve of resorting to the court foi the punishment of simple mistakes which were jumped at as positive attempts to defraud the revenue-as if some of the best firms in the Commonwealth would in such a way besmirch their reputation, not only in Australia, but in the manufacturing and monetary centres of the old world. of the paltriest mistakes made by clerks have been made the grounds of prosecutions. I am not blaming the right honourable gentleman at the head of the Customs department for that, but I blame the system by which he is advised, and the officers in the different centres who are, doubtless, in constant communication with hirn. I am sorry to say that several of them have not had the pluck to telegraph to the head of the department that the persons involved had hitherto been considered honest and reputable men in the great business communities of Australia. As a young man engaged in other business relating to commerce and shipping, I was of teti amused at the mistakes and errors of judgment made by Customs officers in Brisbane and elsewhere. I desire to say, in the most respectful way, that in their "" Jaek-in-office "" position, with a fixed salary of about £600 per year and a free house, sub-collectors of Customs have looked upon themselves, as it is alleged the Minister has looked upon himself, as ""little Gods Almighty "" in the community. A revolution took place in one day when there was a change from the separate administration of the Customs for a population of 1,000,000 in Victoria, of' 1,125,000 in New South Wales, 500,000 in Queensland, and proportionately less in the other States, to the joint administration of Customs for 4,0.00,000 Mr Macdonald-Paterson. of people under a new and complex Tariff containing thousands of items that were never heard of before. Hundreds of new interpretations have been given, the Customs officials have been governed by an inflexible cast-iron rule, and have been required to keep their eyes open, so that every scintilla of error may be discovered and punished. They have been prevented from acting in accordance with their previous experience, and, as a consequence, the administration of the department has for the last six or twelve months proved a curse to the mercantile community. It would be impossible to get any one man, or any 50 men, who would be capable of determining exactly the nature of many of the articles which are imported, or of judging correctly 1 of the quality of the texture of many others. In the old country there are experts in cotton, who know all about it and its price from the time it is landed in the bale until it is cleaned, warped, wefted, loomed, dyed, and turned into the finished article ; while others know exactly the value of such Some delicate material as muslin, and would be able to say whether a certain line of goods should be invoiced at 6d. or 4£d. a yard. But our officials do not possess this expert knowledge; and, under the present administration, they are also wanting in pluck. It is not a wholesome thing that the general belief of Australia should be that they hold their office by the skin of their teeth unless they are able to catch defaulters. Instead of rising to the occasion, and exercising kindliness of speech and diplomacy of manner, the department has failed in its duty to the Commonwealth. I have heard it said that there ai'e times when even Ministerial departments should have a blind eye.",59
392,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,There has been too much of the blind eye about the Customs administration of the past.,60
393,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"On e of the greatest philosophers has said that one must sometimes be blind, even in his own household. It is in that sense that I use the expression. I have not acted after consultation with the honourable member for Oxley, but I am sure that my remarks will be thoroughly concurred in by him, and he and I together represent the greater busi : ness portion of southern Queensland. I have no fault to find with the - Minister individually, but if a less technical interpretation had been placed upon the Tariff, and there had been more flexibility in the administration of the department, it would have been better for all concerned. The leader of the Opposition interpreted my views in this respeet to a nicety, and I am sure that he has voiced the opinions of the mercantile community from the humblest storekeeper to the largest merchant. I trust that the discord, irritation, and unhappiness which the administration of the Customs has created will now cease, and that peace and contentment may reign throughout the Com mon weal th.",60
394,Mr SOLMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I have listened to what has been said this afternoon, and have read all that I could of the actions of the Minister since the Customs departments of the States were transferred to the Commonwealth. Undoubtedly there has been, and still is, a certain amount of friction between those who do business with the department, and those who administer it, but I feel that that is owing rather to the lax manner in which the department was administered in some of the States anterior to federation than to undue severity or to tyrannical procedure on the part of the Minister. The leader of the Opposition asked if it was fair that the head of a large importing house should be held responsible for the action of his subordinates. I interjected that he should. Honourable members who were present know what then followed. I do not wish to allude further to the matter, except to say that if a merchant cannot obtain accuracy in the work of those whom he employs, he should avail himself of the services of others who will not make mistakes. Sir MALCOLM: MCEACHAEN - It is impos_ sible to avoid mistakes. Theofficersof theCusand toms department sometimes make mistakes. experience was.",61
395,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I do not say that a clerk's position should be imperilled for the smallest error, but, speaking generally, merchant finds that his clerk cannot perform the duties, allotted to him without making mistakes, he should employ some one else. My experience as a Minister not a long one, but it was long enough enable rae to know how often merchants employ incompetent clerks. In many cases important duties are being performed by mere youths, who do not realise the serious nature of their work.",61
396,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I was a The Custom-house clerk in London when I was seventeen.,61
397,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,And no doubt a very competent one.,61
398,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,At any rate I never made mistakes. I began my business career at the age of fourteen.,61
399,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"In my opinion, sufficient care is often not exercised in the selection of those who are called upon to undertake the responsible duty of passing entries, and doing other Customs work. Numbers of young men find themselves detailed for these duties after an extremely small amount of instruction from those who employ them. In the wretched private investigations which used to be held in Victoria, I have hadlads before me who were prepared to accept almost any penalty rather than have their employer punished, because they feared to lose their situations ; and it was repeatedly' pointed out to me that the mistakes which had been made were due to inexperience and want of knowledge.",61
400,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,That excuse was made within the last week.,61
401,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I am glad that the Minister has not adopted this system of private investigation. There is no more tyrannical exercise of authority than these secret settlements. The Minister is to behonoured for the stand which he has taken against the strong representations which I am sure have been made to him for the perpetuation of this star-chamber system. I ask honourable members if they think it consistent with the principles of freedom and justice that a Minister should come tosecret determinations and settlements in this way. In Victoria a gentleman whois now a member of the Senate was Commissioner of Customs for over five years,, only the other day he told us what his",61
402,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,He alwaysi f a published his decisions.,61

The system which was followed, under my direction waswas far more open-althoug h not so open as I to should have liked-tha n the previous one,, and all the decisions were not published. I know that instructions were given that they should be published, but it was not done, owing to influence which was brought to bear upon those who were responsible. action of the Minister""will press hardly upon some persons who do not altogether deserve it . The punishment of beingdragged into a police court, and having fines recorded, will be a hardship in some instances. But for the sake of the honest trader, and the man who spares no expense to secure efficiency, I am bound to support the Minister in his attitude. We cannot too strongly inveigh against the system of secret settlements. In France it is' the custom for a prisoner to be brought up and interrogated. Is that the sort of system to be adopted in the Commonwealth ? In Victoria the Minister was urged by his officers to accomplish secret settlements. Why 1 Because of the great difficulty there was in securing a conviction. The Act was so impotent, inefficient, and unsatisfactory, that the officers were compelled to urge upon the Minister, ' in order to secure that there should be some punishment, the adoptionof the pernicious practice of considering questions in camera. We have an Act that .gives to the Minister and his officers all the power which is necessary to punish those who from neglect or wilfulness infringe its provisions. I earnestly hope that we shall never r«=vert to the old system of leaving it to the Minister to say what punishment shall be meted out to violators of the law. If we once enable the Minister to sit as a court and remit, or refuse to inflict penalties, we shall do an act not consonant with that freedom, liberty, and justice which we hope to make the principal bulwark of our grand Constitution. We have not had cited a single case to bear out the very unfair and unpatriotic statements which have been made regarding the action of the Minister. We have been told today that his action was - tyrannical and abominable, and, of course, - that no personal reference was intended by those remarks. In my opinion, his action has been that of a high-minded administrator of a most important department, and in that position he is a bright and shining example to those who take upon themselves Ministerial responsibility.",61
404,Mr LE GROOM,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Darling Downs) In various States, especially Queensland, the Minister has been seriously attacked in connection with his administration of the department. But I am glad to see that the condemnation is by no means universal. A much better feeling is beginning to grow up amongst many of his critics in that State, and it is very well reflected in an article in the Brisbane Telegraph, in which it is. pointed out that he is having fixed upon him the responsibility for all the friction which is the natural result of securing uniformity of administration in the Commonwealth. In the various States there has been a difference in the definition of goods and in the administration. The officers have had different ways of working the department, and upon the Minister is now thrown the onus of securing absolute uniformity of administration, and definition for the whole Commonwealth. The honourable member for Melbourne has given a very good illustration of the difficulty. The Melbourne merchants found fault with the definition of tea, and the Minister pointed out that it was the one which had been adopted in Queensland. When you try to get uniformity of definition you are bound to irritate persons in different States who have been working under another definition, and will not willingly relinquish old methods and practices. I regret that the Minister has had to bear all this odium. There have also been lax methods of administration in the States. The Minister has been charged with the protection of the interests of the taxpayers. He has been asked by the House to collect honestly all the money which the taxpayers are entitled to have deposited in the Treasury. He has also had to bear the trouble of those very provisions which were inserted in the Constitution for the purpose of protecting the smaller States- I allude to the trouble arising under the Inter-State certificates. He is practically carrying out the very provisions which uniformity of legislation renders essential. He has had to bear all the odium of this administration. As regards the reflections upon his action, I think that all persons will agree that it is his duty to collect the revenue, to take proceedings in the courts where it is justified, and to insist that importers shall employ fit and proper persons to do their business. In Queenslandtherehasbeen sometrouble. l a m not going to say that there have not been some grounds for complaint, but 1 do not think that those grounds, when investigated, have justified .any of the charges which have been made against the ""* inister. In that State the charges have been that he has assumed a dictatorial attitude, an unsympathetic attitude, andatyrannicalattitude. Ithinkthatal l these charges are without foundation. Whenever I have had to p ut matters before the Minister, he has, on the whole, listened attentively and given fair and i m p a r t i a l decisions. So far as I can see, he has simply taken up the position that he is bound to administer the law impartiall y and fair l y , and, on the whole, I think I can say that he is doing it mercifully. It is assumed that there are no merchants who uphold the 'position he has taken up. As regards Brisbane, there appeared in the Courier some time ago an article setting out the views of certain merchants upon the methods of administration of the department. newspaper sent out a representative with the view of ascertaining both sides of the quest i o n - the views of those who complained of the methods of administration, and the views of those who seemed to think that those methods had been fair. It is only r i g h t that I should quote the views of a f e w of the merchants who have looked at the question from a different p o i nt of view. For instance, the representative of Messrs. T>. and W . M u r r a y saidThey hud no complaint to make against the Administration offchedepartment, and they were inclined to think that some strictness in enforcat ing the Tariff was desirable. A not h e r f i r m took up this positionThey had had no difficulties with the departwho ment, and whenever any question of interpretation arose, they referred it to Melbourne, and got settled without serious delay or inconvenience. They were disposed to favour a and complete supervision of the goods imported into the State with the object of preventing evasion of duties. Mr Bowcher, the representative of Messrs. ""W. and A . Macarthur, said he was in accord with themHe suggested it would be a wise thing if it were recognised that a fixed percentage cases were, examined by way of check. From sources the information went to show that much of the trouble now experienced plained of is due to laxity of administration when the Custom-house was under State control. So that the merchants in Brisbane were really complaining of the l a x it y of the administration under State control, and praising the Federal Government for adopting firmer methods of administration. The w r it e r of the article goes on to sayThe determination of the Minister to strictly enforce the Tariff, and to prosecute all who inadvertently or unintentionally appear in the posiquarters. tion of evaders has brought things up with round turn,, and rendered necessary an amount of care and accurracy which previously was sisted upon. The opinion of the merchants who did not attack the administration was that 46 G a whilefchemercantile community will become reconciled to the new era, and will not find it unduly burdensome. One change which will probably be found necessary will be the substitution of caref u l and experienced Customs clerks for the boys aud youths frequently employed to pass entries. So that there the defence which has been made in the House has been amply verified. He r e are Brisbane merchants who say that it was really the f a u l t of the youths and the boysemployed on customs work which was responsible for p a r t of the trouble in that city . A not h er p o in t is raised by the w r it er of this article in these termsThat A phase of the question which also seems to require investigation, is the practice which is alleged to have grown up in regard to the invoicing of goods. Our representative was informed in one quarter that it is uot altogether uncommon for two invoices to be sent'to the purchasers of consignments of goods, one showing the actual cost to the buyer and the other, as it is phrased, ""the value for Customs purposes."" It is f u r the r stated in this a r t i c l e Another practice is said to be to invoice goods to a number, rather than in the name of the real consignees. How far either of these is carried on it would be difficult to ascertain ; but instances have been known of goods being offered for sale a much lower rate than thej' could be sold at iffchelegitimaSte duty had been paid upon them. Importers who deal honestly with the Customs naturally find it hard to compete with the rivals are able to undersell them in that way. This is one of the allegations which can only be proved it by the more strict comparison of the goods imported with the description and values given of more systematic them in the in voices. the I have quoted this statement to show that, although serious complaints have been made by Brisbane merchants, there are a goodmany traders in that city who are of opinion that the Minister is doing good and patriotic w o r k in enforcing the provisions of of the the Customs Act . Some complaints seem to have a certain show of reason, but when these are examined it will be found that or comthey are due to causes which are in evitable. For instance, it is complained that continual references have to be made to the central authorities in M e l bourne. In view of the fact, however, that the decisions given in these cases for m the basis of a u n if o rm practice which has to extend throughout the Commonwealth, it will be seen that it is necessary to refer complicated questions to headI hope, however, that the Minister a will see his way to expedite the publication of his T a r if f guide, so that he may put in to not in the hands of his officers at distant centres after the means of avoiding the present trouble. It would also be reasonable, now that the Tariff has come fairly into operation, to permit the officers in the various outlying centres, to assist importers to pass their goods through the Customs. Where difficulties occur in the interpretation of the Tariff in connection with the importation of new classes of goods, I think it is the duty of the Customs authorities to assist merchants who are really anxious to comply with the conditions of the Tariff. It is stated that the importers of general merchandise do not experience very much difficulty under the Tariff, but that it is amongst the importers of drapery and soft goods that the most fault is found with the administration. If the Minister can see his way to instruct his officers to assist merchants in cases such as I have referred to, he will render a great service to the mercantile community. It has been made to appear that the Minister is entirely without friends in his administration of the Tariff; but I would point out that the Launceston Daily Telegraph takes a very sympathetic view of the Minister's position. In an article published on 11th September, the following statement occurs :The completion of the first Australian Tariff has been appropriately taken as an occasion for some complimentary speeches in the Federal Parliament, where members of all shades of political opinion have joined in an acknowledgment of the great work done by Mr Kingston in framing and conductingfchepassage offchemost difficult piece of legislation of the session, and in the administration of the inosfc troublesome department of the Commonwealth Government. Honourable members must agree that the Minister has done a great work in getting the Tariff through. When the Tariff was passed there seemed to be a disposition on the part of a good many-members to disown it, but I venture to predict that before very long a large number of those who have expressed dissatisfaction will regard the Tariff as a magnificent achievement, and claim the credit of having assisted to frame it .",62
405,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I do not think they Will, although it is very different from the Tariff which was originally introduced. ,",64
406,Mr LE GROOM,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I think they will.,64
407,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Every satisfied with it now.,64
408,Mr LE GROOM,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The article from which I have been quoting continues as follows :The row of the first Minister of Trade and Customs, whatever his political colour may be, could - not be anything but a hard one to hoe, and no one with less experience, energy, and industry, could have succeeded as well as Mr Kingston has done in the performance of his titanic task. By-andby, when things have settled down under the new federal conditions, the benefit of his work in .the Legislature, and his sturdy administration of the fiscal laws on strictly impartial lines, will be felt throughout the Commonwealth. That is a Tasmanian opinion, and the Queensland view is very much the same. In an article published in the Brisbane Daily Telegraph after a meeting recently held there, the action of the Minister for Trade and Customs was spoken of in complimentary terms. The writer went on to sayTo be perfectly blunt, the Minister, doubtless, has had ample cause in the interests of all Australia to insist on a rigid observance of every rule and regulation for preventing fraud, otherwise the Federal Treasury might have been fleeced right and left by designing and unprincipled traders, as, in the past, State treasuries certainly suffered. I have read these statements merely to show that the condemnation of the action of the Minister has not been so universal as some honourable members would have us suppose.",64
409,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I could read a large number of statements in the opposite direction.,64
410,Mr LE GROOM,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I admit that : but surely, in view of the charges made against the Minister by the leader of the Opposition, I am perfectly justified in showing that there is another side to the question.",64
411,Mr OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," No abuse has ever yet been abolished by those who profited by it , and reforms must be brought about through the efforts of those who have to suffer. In this case the Minister for Trade and Customs is the martyr.",64
412,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," When the Customs Ac t was under consideration in this Chamber I pointed out that many of its provisions were so stringent that possibly they would earn for the Minister for Trade and Customs the title of "" a manufacturer of criminals."" . I regret' to say that the manner in which the right honourable gentleman has administered the Act has caused that title to be bestowed upon one is dishim. There is not the slightest doubt that many men who ought not to have been brought before the courts have been haled there and punished for perfectly innocent acts. We are not here to shield men who are really guilty, and the Minister .for Trade and Customs is only doing his duty in prosecuting such persons. The objection has, however, been taken that the Minister has not assumed'any responsibility. He has not distinguished, between what are innocent mistakes and wilful attempts to evade the law, and, as a consequence, many men have been summoned before the courts in cases in which the exercise of a little common sense would have obviated any such proceedings. That is the reason why so many complaints have been made against the Minister. Every mistake, whether wilfully or innocently made, has been treated in exactly the same way, and there has been every justification for the complaints made by merchants. If the Minister had been placed in the same position as the members of the outside public who do business with the Customs, and had been treated in the same way as he has dealt with merchants generally, he would have been the subject of innumerable prosecutions. Every mistake made by him as to whether certain goods were or were not dutiable would have resulted in his appearance at the police court. Once he was taken there it would have been useless for him to say that the mistake was the result of inadvertence, because under the provisions of the Customs Act he would have been convicted and fined. In over 300 different instances he has varied his decision, and therefore, applying to himself the same rule as he has applied to others, he should have been brought before the police court and convicted of 300 sepa1 rate offences. I - have no hesitation in saying that the number of wrong decisions given by the Minister has been even greater than I have stated. For instance, the Minister for a time did not consider that oilmen's stores were dutiable, and in every case in which he gave a decision in this direction he should have been brought before the police court and fined £ 5 . He considers that that is just treatment when merchants make mistakes. Surely - the Minister can take a little authority upon himself, and distinguish between innocent mistakes and attempts to evade the law.",64
413,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Is it not too late?,65
414,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"No ; it is not. I asked the Minister when the Customs Act was under discussion whether he would adopt that course, and he assured me that he would, but, unfortunately, he has not been 46 a Z able to summon up the necessary will or courage to do right, lest some one might turn round and say that he was conniving at evasions of the law. I would not have blamed the Minister for sending all these cases on to the courts if it had been competent for the magistrates to abstain from in ' flicting a fine in cases where they were satisfied that the mistakes were innocently made. That power, however, was never given to them, and, therefore, the Minister, by acting indiscriminately, has inflicted a double injury upon the community. The right honourable gentleman will not exercise any judgment himself. He cannot be blamed for this if he has no judgment to exercise, but why does he not seek the assistanceof one of the officers connected with his : department ? ""Why should he fear to do a thing if he believes it to be right? I should be prepared to back up the Minister, so long as he did right, but, unfortunately, we know that in nineteen cases out of twenty he would probably do wrong. It is ridiculous to talk of justice in cases where the Minister refrains from exercising proper discretion, and sends cases on to the courts, irrespective of the nature of the mistakes made. Once the case comes before the court a conviction must follow, and under these circumstances the Minister should recognise that a double responsibility is cast upon him. I need only refer honourable members to the numerous cases which have occurred in Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth.",65
415,Mr FOWLEK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,No ; there have been no prosecutions at Perth.,65
416,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I cannot say that I remember having seen any case reported from Perth, but in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide there have been instances in which the magistrates have distinctly asserted that if it were not for the provisions of the Act, which compelled them to impose a fine, they would have dismissed the cases. In these instances they were convinced that there was no intention to evade the law. In other cases, of course, deliberate attempts have been made to defraud the revenue, and the offenders have been very - properly punished. Surely, however, the Minister must admit that it was wrong to prosecute merchants for mistakes which the magistrates declare to have been innocently made ? It appears that whilstthe Customhouse officials may make mistakes without suffering any penalty, the merchants who are guilty of error are to be prosecuted und convicted. This is what honourable members on both sides of the Chamber wished to avoid, and that is why we wanted the Minister to show a little courage and take upon himself a certain amount of authority. Where prosecutions take place and the magistrates deliberately declare that no action should have been taken,- the officers concerned in the .secution should be brought. up and dealt with by the Minister. Surely if one class - of thecommunityis to be fined for making mistakes, theofficials in the Customs department - should be similarly deal t with. I was extremely sorry to hear that the honourable and learned member for Brisbane suggest that possibly - some of the Customs officials were seeking to curry favour with the Minister by securing convictions.",65
417,Mr MACDONALD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,PATEUSON .made use of any such expression.,66
418,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable and learned member said that many officials appeared to be anxious to institute prosecutions. The - only inference which can possibly be drawn from that statement is that their action was prompted by a desire to bring themselves - under the notice - of the Minister. I trust that that is - not so. My own opinion is that many - of the complaints against Customs administration arise from a reluctance on the part of the Minister to assume certain responsibilities. The result to the trading community has been a very mischievous one. I hold that it was a mistake to embody in the Customs A ct such stringent provisions as are there contained. I did not so strongly object to those provisions at the time that measure was under consideration, because the Minister declared - that they were necessary to prevent fraud. I did strongly object to the refusal to allow the courts to decide according to the evidence. The . position which I take up is that we ought not to invoke the aid of a court of justice and then muzzle justice, which is precisely what the Minister has done. It is to the interest of the great bulk of the traders in the community that there shall be no evasion of Customs duties, because if any such evasion takes place, they are compelled to compete with their dishonest rivals. Moreover, the importers do not ultimately pay the Customs taxation. Of course they pay it in the first instance, but subsequently it is returned to them with interest added. I trust that the result of this dis-; cussion will be to induce the Minister to exercise the powers with which he is vested in cases where there has been no attempt to evade taxation. I am thoroughly satisfied that if the right honourable gentleman would assume a larger measure of responsibility in pro- administering his department, he would not hear many of the objections which have emanated from this side of the House, and the murmurings of the mercantile community would cease.",66
419,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," If I did not hear complaints of the character of those which have been made by honourable members opposite, no doubt the occupants of the Treasury benches would be the subjects of adverse criticism of another sort. I am only too I never glad to know that those complaints are not founded upon fact. I have no fault to find with the general tone of the debate. I thank those honourable members who have testified to the difficulties which have beset me, and who have expressed a good opinion of the mode in which I have attempted to discharge an onerous and somewhat unpleasant task. That the difficulties have been great I frankly acknowledge, but that I have shirked their discharge no one can truthfully declare - In my own conscience, I know that I have done what I could to faithfully perform my duties, and I am satisfied that parliamentary and public opinion support my action. It has been put that I am an enemy of the importer, and would like to do him an injury. All that is idle talk, and honourable members know it . As they are well aware in accepting my present position, I recognised what were my duties, and I have not spared myself in my endeavour to fulfil them. One of those duties is to cultivate the best relations possible with the importers and the mercantile community. My duty is to the community as a whole, and to the majority of the mercantile community who are honest and careful. It is also my duty to enforce the law against those who are either dishonest or negligent where such dishonesty or negligence is to the injury of the community. As regards the revenue, I would point out that today we are deriving from moderate duties of Customs an amount which I venture to consider is considerably in excess of all expectations. There are many elements which conduce to that condition of affairs. One of those elements undoubtedly is that the law is now being more strictly enforced than it was formerly. Dishonest traders are being called upon to pay their dues to the exoneration of the people generally from further taxation and to the maintenance in the public departments of those whose services we could not retain if we did not continue to collect our dues as we ought. Let honor-, able members compare the collections of revenue today with those which obtained under the old State Tariffs. What do I recollect as regards Queensland - that grand State which has before it as brilliant a future as any in the Union ? The Government had hardly assumed office when complaints were made of a leakage in the Queensland Customs revenue. Accordingly we placed ourselves in communication with, commercial men. As the result of our inquiries, we found that considerable leakages were taking place. We, therefore, decided to send an officer to the northern State to inquire into the matter. The result was a more stringent enforcement of the Customs laws in Queensland, and the punishment of those who did wrong, without any detriment to those who did well. It is difficult indeed to estimate how much we lose by lax Customs administration. Let honourable members look at the figures before them. Even in Queensland, we .got an amount of £ 1 2 0 from one man for ""conscience"" money. What must have been the character of its administration there when that steal was executed by one individual ? Dishonest persons were under the impression that after the establishment of the Federation they would be able to continue their corrupt practices with immunity from punishment. To-day no such sense of immunity exists. It has been properly abolished, and I look to the House to sustain an administration which insists upon the law being observed, and will not sit silent while the public are defrauded. Ninety per cent, of our traders are, I believe, honest. But there are dishonest traders. Not only has the revenue been robbed, but the mercantile community have been robbed. How can business men be expected to successfully carry on operations against dishonest competitors 1 Of course, an importer may make an error which is unavoidable. Let that fact be established before a court, and the Executive can then deal with it .",66
420,Mr CONROY,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,It cannot.,67
421,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The Executive can do as it chooses in regard to the cancellation of any fine. It is idle for importers to plead- "" We made a mistake."" It is their duty to avoid mistakes. When they have established the fact that an. error has been innocently made, it is time enough to apply the remedy. But negligence I hold is no excuse, particularly when it is exercised to the advantage of the person who is guilty of it, and to the disadvantage not only of the revenue but of his competitors in business. Time and again I have been assured by particular individuals that formerly they were subjected to dishonest and careless competition from which they they are now free. I do not require importers to be infallible, but I do ask them to be accurate upon two matters of importance. The department says to them-""Tell us the nature of the goods contained in that box which you are importing. You know all about them. If you have any doubt as to its contents open the box, and ascertain exactly what the goods consist of. Tell us their value. When you have done that you will have nothing to fear."" No prosecution has been undertaken consequent upon an error _ of judgment as to whether goods ought to be classed under one particular line of the Tariff or under another. All such proceedings have been founded on facts, which were well within the knowledge of the importer. Not a single case to the contrary has been cited. I came down to the House armed with full particulars relating to the last dozen prosecutions which have taken place in Victoria. I could tell the committee the class and character of each of them. In some cases I might refer to aggravating circumstances. As regards prosecutions in other places the same remark is equally applicable.",67
422,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,What about the last nine or ten prosecutions in Sydney 1,67
423,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I had intended not to refer to them, but when I am challenged-as I am now- I will deal with the last eight or nine.",67
424,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Have they been heard and decided 1,67
425,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Yes . Eight of the defendants pleaded guilty, hut one, imagining that he had a complete defence to offer, fought the matter out. The facts in connection with his case were as follow :-He sent to England an order for bottle-wrapping paper, which, under the Tariff, is dutiable at 15 per cent. When the paper arrived what did he do ? Did he enter it as bottle wrapping paper ? Nothing of the sort. He entered it as printing paper, which, as honourable members are aware, is admitted free. What do honourable members think of a matter of that sort ? Did the defendant know when he was ordering the goods what he was getting? Of course he did. Why then did this merchant not say what was the nature of the goods ? The result was loss to the revenue and advantage to this defendant over his neighbours. ceedings were taken, and the defendant swore that this paper was properly entered as printing paper. He occupies a respectable and responsible position, and is just the sort of person who, under such - arguments as have been advanced, would never have been proceeded against by State Ministers, who were in the habit of settling matters within the secrecy of their own chambers. Experts were called in the case, and they swore that this was not printing paper, but bottle wrapping paper. Might the defendant not, at least, have given the country the benefit of the doubt ? „ Did he think that the person from whom he bought the paper had cheated him by sending another sort 1",67
426,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Is there an item of bottle wrapping paper in the Tariff?,68
427,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"No ; but the defendant had only to tell us that it was bottle wrapping paper, and it would have come under the n.e.i. The court held that the defendant had not stated the fact when hecalled the pa.per printing paper, and he was fined £ 5 and costs. I had no wish to refer to these cases, and should not have done so but for the reference made by the honourable member for Parramatta. I can tell honourable members of another case which presents a ludicrous aspect. One gentleman imported some toy bagpipes and some kazoos ; and, by the way, some of the latter were used last night to light up the darkness of a political meeting and generally make tilings merry. We can well imagine this defendant consulting the Tariff; and yet I suppose we must blame some poor clerk for making a "" clerical error."" The defendant, on looking at the Tariff, finds amongst the - special exemptions, ""musical instruments for the orchestra,"" and he immediately applies that description to the toy bagpipes, which, as fancy goods, are liable to a duty of 25 per cent. The kazoos were treated - in the same way, and the foolishness went so far as the calling of evidence to prove that this instrument had once been used in a performance managed by Mr J. C. Williamson. If such articles were used in a performance, I am inclined to think it must have been in the gallery.",68
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"But only nominal fines were inflicted in all these cases. - Mr KINGSTON - - I think that these defendants ought to have been fined more heavily. Amongst the defendants in other Pro- cases was one who had previously been fined £250 in the secrecy of the Victorian Customs department, and I hope that no sympathy will be extended to a person who has been compelled to contribute that sum to the revenue in consequence of his eccentricities in the valuation. In another case flannelette, which is subject to 15 per cent., was put down as ""cotton piece goods,"" which are subject to a duty 5 per cent. This, no doubt, was the work of a miscreant clerk, who indulged in the falsity for the advantage of his employer, and to his own everlasting distress. Then, I may mention, as a little incident, the case of a double invoice, sent with the explanation that one invoice, which declared certain finished articles as being in the rough, was furnished "" for Customs purposes."" I have confined myself simply to the last dozen cases in Melbourne, and the last day's performance in Sydney; and I feel that if I am to blame it is for not formulating a stronger charge, in some instances, against those who did wrong: But I recognise the seriousness of the charge of fraud. The A ct has drawn a broad distinction between fraud and offences in which there is no fraud; and I never care to unnecessarily take the more severe course. I have never suggesteda charge of fraud unless I felt it to be abundantly justified. All - that is asked from importers is reasonable 1 information as to the nature of the goods and their value. These particulars can easily be given, and where they are not 1 given either from a desire to defraud or from want of care, it is my duty, as the Minister of the department, to send the case to court. If the court chooses to report any circumstances which justify the exercise 'of the Executive prerogative of mercy, the Government can deal with any recommendation made; but I have not, and will not, deal with cases in the way in which, foi one excuse or another, they have been dealt with in the past in Ministerial bureaux, and some of them have been cases involving thousands of pounds, and years of continued fraud. The practice which I have adopted is one which has, at any rate, the merit of throwing the light of publicity on the proceedings. It establishes an example for the benefit of the community; it teaches wrong-doers to do wrong no further; and it declares, above all, that justice cannot be bought and paid for in Australia. Right and justice to their fellow-men, and justice to the revenue requires commercial men to be careful. I hold in ray hand a book, entitled Modem Business Methods : Import and Export Trade, by Frederick Hooper and James Graham. This is one of the best manuals of commerce; it has been prepared by men whose names command respect; and it is issued to some extent with the countenance of Chambers of Commerce of the highest classI n this book, on the subject of invoicing, we readThis is un important matter in connection with the exportation of goods. Correct invoicing is very necessary, not only to prevent difficulties between the merchant here (England), and his correspondent abroad, but also to prevent friction between the correspondent and the foreign Customs officials. In many cases the invoices have to be submitted to the Customs when the goods are imported, and in case of any discrepancy between the invoice and the goods there is certainMark you- "" certain ""to be a fine inflicted on the importer, which he, of course, claims from the merchant on this side. This book was put into my hands by the Collector of Customs of New South Wales. I need not go further into the subject. This has been a very troublesome time to pass through; but I feel that the storm of censure which broke on my head, and on head of the Government when the present system was initiated, has practically disappeared"". I believe sincerely that the action I have taken is appreciated and' commended by Australia generally. My only object has been the good of the Commonwealth, and this system has been commenced with the sincere desire that it may be'sanctioned by long usage as the law of the land.",68
429,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I of the sort. desire to make only two or three remarks, one of which is that this Chamber to-night has had an exhibition of the judicial temperament which presides over this department.",69
430,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The Minister is not, and should not be, a judge.",69
431,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I agree that it is better the Minister should not be a judge, particularly after what we have seen tonight.",69
432,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,No r should any other * Minister be a judge.,69
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It would be a' calamity to this Commonwealth if such a temperament were found on the judgmentseat. The Minister has shown himself to be incapable of exercising that calm, cool judgment which is required in cases of the kind to which reference has been made. ",69
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Of course, and I take it that I have a right to express my opinion. It must not be forgotten that ail those ""scandalous"" cases, were met by nominal fines.",69
435,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,There may have been sympathy on the part of the magistrates.,69
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable member for Bland has no right to make a suggesti6n of that sort unless he has some proof. It is a cheap sort of thing to say, particularly when he does not know.",69
437,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I know some of the magistrates.,69
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"At any rate, the magistrates heard both sides of the cases, whereas honourable members have only heard one side. If the cases are as bad as the Minister attempts to make out, the only conclusion is that the magistrates are not fit for their positions. According to the Minister, there ought to have been the severest penalties if the magistrates had done their duty to the Commonwealth. But we must assume that the magistrates did do their duty. At any rate, they had the evidence before them, and did not, as this Chamber apparently does, come to a decision on ex parte statements made by an hysterical Minister. Both the magistrates and the Minister cannot be right, and it would appear that there ought to be some further investigation. We are told by the Minister that magistrates are not doing their duty.",69
439,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I did not say anything,69
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It is practically a censure' on the magistrates for the Minister to sa,y that the sentences ought to have been more severe.",69
441,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I did not say the magistrates were to blame.,70
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"But that is the implication. I prefer to take the arbitrament of men who sit in cool, calm judgment and hear all the evidence.",70
443,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I know one magistrate ' who fined the P. and O. Company £ o for the fourteenth offence in regard to deserting lascars.,70
444,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Ship-owner s cannot prevent desertion.,70
445,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"They should be compelled to prevent it , if they bring the blackfellows here.",70
446,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The honourable member ought to be a ship-owner.,70
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Are that the magistrates are wrong 1,70
448,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,No ; but the honourable member contends that the magistrates are all right.,70
449,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Does the honourable member suggest that in these Customs cases there have been more shocking miscarriages of justice?,70
450,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"No ; I do not. Mr J OSEPH COOK - Ia m not assuming that the merchants are always right, but I say that in nearly all the cases tried up to date only nominal fines have been inflicted.",70
451,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The honourable member is wrong there.,70
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"In nearly all the cases tried in Sydney nominal fines were inflicted, and I cannot bring myself to believe that the magistrates were conniving at an improper state of things and letting off the perpetrators of these scandalous offences with nominal fines. It would be actually conniving at injustice.",70
453,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable member says, when it suits him, that £ 5 is not a nominal penalty.",70
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I shall say no more with regard to the matter, merely repeating that I prefer to take the cases as adjudicated upon by the magistrates, and draw the inference, from the fact that only nominal fines have been inflicted, that the cases were not of the serious character which the Minister has led the committee to - believe. I prefer to believe that the Minister has come down with his cases ready. He has got some shocking cases out of the bundle and presented them as typical, of the whole.",70
455,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,I brought down the last twelve cases for Victoria and the last day's cases for New South Wales.,70
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"My reply is that in all those cases in New South Wales only nominal fines have been' inflicted. The Minister cites only the shocking cases, and that is not fair.",70
457,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The honourable member asked me for particulars of the last cases that were tried.,70
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Unles s the right honourable gentleman gives us the good cases as well as the bad, he has no right to expect us to judge him as. we otherwise should do. I believe that the Minister has very good intentions in this matter. No we to infer honourable member would accuse him of not doing what he believes to be his duty. I only say that his judgment is mistaken, and that he ought to exercise some discretion and find out whether the cases are due to mistake or to a clear intention to defraud. Unless in the right honourable gentleman's judgment it is. shown that there has been an intention to defraud, he ought to make some other investigation, with a view of ascertaining whether it cannot be proved that only mistakes have been made. If the full details show that only mistakes have occurred, it is not right to holdup a reputable trader before the courts of the continent to the extent that the Minister is doing. He may suppose that he is bringing about a more salutary state of things than has hitherto existed. That seems to be his mission. He tells us that he is a reformer, that he is a Customs missionary, and that he is departing from old time methods. I fancy that the sum total of the right honourable gentleman's missionary efforts in this regard will not ultimately alter the trading practices of the continent veiy much. Where he is trying to discover fraud, we can do nothing but applaud him ; but at the same time he must not expect us to applaud him vigorously and heartily when we see reputable traders hauled before the courts with the frequency which has occurred, and only fined nominal amounts, leaving the inference to be drawn that nothing of a serious character has occurred.",70
459,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I wish to say something on behalf of those who are clearly innocent traders. We haveheard a great deal of those who are guilty of fraud, and the chief cases brought forward by the Minister are cases of such unmistakable fraud, that in the prosecution of offenders .he will ' undoubtedly have the sympathy of most honourable members. Considering that this extraordinary Tariff has been brought into force in six States that have had different Tariffs in the past, and have pursued different practices, it is wonderful that in'the altered state of affairs the Minister cannot produce a greater number of cases, and cases of a more flagrant character, than he is able to produce ; and this shows that there is not anything like the amount of fraud existing in the mercantile community that he would have the committee believe.",70
460,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I purposelv refrained, aud I should not have mentioned any cases unless I had been challenged.",71
461,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The Minister has mentioned some cases, and he would not have mentioned them unless they suited his purpose. But I will go outside the cases he has mentioned, and say that the cases t have seen reported in the public press are not more numerous or of greater seriousness than we had reason to expect under the conditions of the altered Tariff, operating upon the whole of this Commonwealth, and under which £9,000,000 of money is being collected. The Minister has not proved that only 90 per cent, of traders are honest on the facts he has given. The number of prosecutions and convictions point to the fact that we have not got in this community the number of dishonest traders that the right honourable gentleman seems to impute to us. The mistake all through has been that the Minister has taken up this absurd (stand. He repudiates the suggestion that he has no sympathy for the honest importer, but his own attitude on more than one occasion has led the mercantile community to believe that he is wanting in that sympathy and is only too eager to seize every occasion that arises in order to obtain victions against them. But it is not the cases of fraud to which I wish to allude, and with regard to which I would pass any strictures upon the Minister. It is the 999 cases of absolute innocence to which I wish to allude. In those cases a great deal of trouble, annoyance, and expense has been inflicted on account of the severe administration of the Customs department, due to the Minister's quixotic notions of the extraordinary duties demanded from him in order to carry out honestly the Tariff which the Commonmonwealth Parliament has imposed on the. people. Right throughout the whole of these States a very great amount of dissatisfaction does exist- a grave amount of dissatisfaction. It is of no use for the Minister to tell us that this dissatisfaction has only been caused on the part of dishonest traders. It has been voiced almost unanimously in the various chambers of commerce and meetings of mercantile men throughout the whole-of the States; and I suppose that the Minister will not contend that only 90 out of 100 of the members of these bodies and meetings are honest men ?",71
462,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Who put it in t h at way?,71
463,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The Minister himself said that 90 per cent, of the traders were honest men, and that the complaints came from the 10 per cent, of dishonestmen. But the representatives of the mercantile classes in the chambers of commerce must be held to be an honest body of traders. They are just as desirous.. as the Minister himself of seeing anything like nefarious practices put down. They have discussed the various disabilities under which they labour, and the trouble, expense, and annoyance to which they have been put. In some cases they have even been put in the position of paying the duty on imports which they contended were duty free, in order to obtain the goods and carry on their own business, rather than fight the battle out with the Minister. I have known men, with whose position I am thoroughly well acquainted, who have admitted to me that their goods, have been detained such a long time owing to some severe interpretation of the sections of the Customs Act, that they have paid the duty rather than be bothered any longer with the disabilities imposed on them. It is this friction, and the irritation to which the con- great body of traders of the community have had to submit, that has put the administration of the department by the Minister so much out of favour with the whole trading community. We all know, as has been admitted by the honourable member for Parramatta, that the right honourable gentleman is actuated by the very highest motives in this matter. But he does not take a common-sense or reasonable view of things; he goes on the assumption that honest and perfectly incidental cases of mistake should be punished as though positive fraud had been committed. The Minister seems to impute that there should be no such thing as a mistake. He never seems to understand that the Customs officials themselves have made mistakes. I saw the other day in my own office an entry which had been put through for certain imported invalids' food. That commodity, as almost every one in this committee knows, is free according to the Tariff. The goods were passed through the Customs, and-duty was imposed upon them. The duty was paid by my Customs agent, and it was only when it came before me that I saw that a mistake had been made. This was a mistake made by the department, which punishes mistakes made by honest traders.",71
464,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Does the honourable member say that the duty was collected in that case?,72
465,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Yes , the duty was paid.",72
466,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I suppose the honourable member knows that it is only special preparations of invalid foods that are dutyfree? . Mr GB EDWARDS - Many of the. so-called cases of fraud that the Minister has referred to have been created by the mistake we made in imposing duties on substances in accordance with the use to which they are put, arid not on the substances per se. In the case which the Minister has mentioned in regard to bottle wrappers, an importer brought them in as printing paper, but it was, proved that they were really bottle wrappers, and that duty should have been paid. But I think it extremely probable that the importer may have been intending to have printing done upon those papers.",72
467,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,That would not have made them printing paper.,72
468,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The matter ©pens up a discussion which we previously had in the committee.,72
469,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"If a lady gets on to a cart horse, does that make it a lady's hack ? If you put printing on ordinary brown paper does that make it printing paper ?",72
470,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I say that an honest man might import paper intending to use it for bottle-wrappers, and to print upon it in order that his own name, or the name of the substance in the bottles, might be placed on the outside. He might think i that as he intended to print upon the paper he could call it printing paper. The point was raised, as I have said, when we were discussing the schedule to the Tariff.",72
471,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The honourable member is wrong in regard to invalids' food. It is only special preparations of invalids' food that are duty free.,72
472,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"There again I contend that we made a mistake in framing the Tariff so as to make duty collectable upon any article according to the use to which it was - to be put. The honourable member for North Sydney urged that the duty should be levied on the substance per se. The clear intention of the committee was that invalids' food was to be duty free, but now the Minister says that only special preparations are to be free. If that is the case it appears that Parliament has made a special regulation in favour of particular kinds of invalids' food. The .point I am making is that the Tariff is of such an extraordinary character, and so different from the Tariffs to which we have been accustomed in many of the States, that these mistakes are extremely likely to occur, and that the Minister, in dealing with them, although actuated by the highest sense of duty, has gone to such extremes as to make the operation of the Tariff much more difficult and much more creative of friction than it otherwise would have been. There is no doubt that the Minister is responsible for the ill-will that has been displayed towards the Commonwealth on. account of the Tariff and its administration. I hope that he has heard sufficient in the discussion which has taken place to teach him a little more reason and common sense, and a little more knowledge of the fact that there are .still many honest merchants in this community, and that it is of no use toying to: punish them in order to put down rogues. In clear cases of roguery and of nefarious practices in endeavouring, to get in goods whilst escaping the payment of Customs duties, or to enter into unfair competition with other firms, I sympathize with the Minister in his action. But when it comes to little trumpery cases .in which mistakes have been made, I think the Minister is wrong in going to such lengths as to prosecute the parties. To cite only one instance, I would point out the case in which a gentleman, who I i understand is one of the Minister's personal i friends in South Australia, imported a little bottle of mustard-seed oil. The oil was made in the prisons of Calcutta, but the importer had no knowledge of that fact.",72
473,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The bottle was plastered with statements showing that it was a gaol product.,73
474,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"But it is very probable that the importer did not know that goods made in Indian prisons are contraband. This gentleman imported the bottle of mustard-seed oil quite honestly, and was pei-fectly willing to pay any duty that might be charged upon it . He was told in effect, however- "" This is contraband. You shall not have it . It shall not be thrown into the sea, as you desire, but you shall be prosecuted."" He was prosecuted, and prosecuted in respect of an act for which, if it had occurred anywhere outside the administration of the Customs, he would have been allowed to go scot-free, because it was such an innocent mistake. Vote agreed to.

Division 36 (Expenditure in Western A ustral.is)-£30,290 .",73
475,Mr EOWLE R,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," In connection with this division, I should like to remind the Minister of the matter to which reference has already been made by the honourable member for Fremantle, and which has also been brought under my notice. Three sheds have recently been erected at Fremantle, and by some arrangement it happens that frequently there is one tide waiter in charge of two or more shifts. I understand that the object of the arrangement is to avoid payment for overtime, but I think it will be seen by the Minister that in the case of two or more vessels discharging cargo, especially at night, it is an absolute necessity in the interests of revenue that there should be the requisite staff on the spot.",73
476,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I shall look into the matter. I will take this opportunity of saying to the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, that as regards the question of forfeitures, I think that no doubt there is power to remit by Executive act.",73
477,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"On several occasions the action of the Minister, in usurping power to tax ships stores on vessels which do not trade within Commonwealth waters has been brought under notice; but we have not yet obtained his decision on the question. There can be no gainsaying the fact that, in the opinion of the majority of honourable members it is not lfegal to tax ships' stores on such vessels. It was not the intention of Parliament that they should be taxed; and, while we give the Minister credit for his vigilance in guarding against frauds upon the Customs, it is high time that the Customs law should be administered as intended by Parliament. As the honourable member for South Sydney hus pointed out, the irritation which is caused makes the action of the Minister very irksome to traders. I do not know than it was ever the desire of any one that people who are not represented in this Pais liament should be taxed by us.",73
478,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The honourable member refers to vessels which simply call at Australian ports and leave again.,73
479,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Yes , they call at our ports and leave again without trading in Commonwealth waters. It was the intention of Parliament that when such vessels commenced to trade along our coasts they should be required to pay duties upon ships' stores just as have our own coastal vessels, but I do not think the law goes beyond that point. If it does, it is well' that we should know of it , so that we may effect an - amendment. I should like the Minister to give his absolute decision on the point.",73
480,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I wish to call the attention of the Minister to a matter relating to ships which are not on any Colonial or British register, but which, apart altogether from completing a voyage from a foreign port, trade between Australian ports. There is a provision in the Imperial Customs Act that such ships are to be subjected to the same regulations in every respect as are those on the British - register. I do not think there is any provision to that effect in any Australian Act,, but attention has been, called to the matter in South Australia, and a motion has been tabled in the Legislative Council requesting the Federal Government to introduce the legislation necessary to assimilate the position here to that under the Imperial Act. I draw the attention of the Minister to the matter so that an examination of the subject may be made by him as early as possible.",73
481,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I am obliged to the honourable and learned member for the suggestion. The matter had escaped my notice, but I shall look into it . As to the question raised by the honourable member for Newcastle, I would point out that, although, perhaps, we should have dealt with the question before there have been so many other engagements that we have not been able to do so. Our intention is to frame regulations at an early date in the direction suggested.",74
482,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Melbourne Ports) Last year increments were provided for a number of weighers in the Customs department, and I believe that although cheques were actually drawn in respect of the increases, they were not paid. I wish to know whether any provision is likely to be made for these men, and why, as the department went so far, they did not complete the arrangements ?",74
483,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is that these men weie given certain rights, but, according to the law officers of the Commonwealth, they are not entitled to these increments until they pass an examination. Provision will be made for the necessary examination, and, if they pass it, they will of course a right to their increments.",74
484,Mr BAMFO RD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I wish to know whether the Minister has made any provision for granting sustenance or living allowances to Commonwealth officers employed in out of the way places, such, for example, as Northern Queensland and certain parts of Western Australia 1 If the Minister has made any provision for granting these allowances in the tropics, how far north will a man have to be stationed in order to be entitled to them?",74
485,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," As the Minister for Trade and Customs appears to be in the humour to answer questions, I would remind him that the matter of the payment of duty on ships' paints has frequently been brought under his notice, but that we have not yet received any definite reply. All that I ask, on behalf of hundreds of men who will be thrown out of employment if the duty on ships' paints is insisted on, is that he shall regard a dock as' a bond, or grant a drawback in respect of paint used on ships in dock - He has done so in other cases, and why should he not do so in this 1",74
486,Mr AVATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I should like the Minister to give the committee some information in respect of the non-payment for overtime worked by the out-door hands in the Customs department. There are a large number of men engaged in each of the States as out-door officers, and on some occasions they have to work all night, and practically without notice, at the behest of the department. Until the control of the Customs was taken over by the Commonwealth, these men in the New South Wales department were paid for overtime, whether they worked at the instance of the Government or a private individual. The Minister, however, has introduced a new regulation by which they obtain nothing by way of payment for overtime, but are given a certain amount of leave if they work an excessive number of hours.",74
487,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The leave is almost hour for hour.,74
488,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The right honourable gentleman has surely heard something of the conditions applying to employees, whether in Australia or one might say, in any other part of the world, and he knows that it is never conceded by any fair employer that hour for hour is a fair return for overtime. After a man has done a full day's work he is have asked, without notice in some instances, to work overtime, to pay for his tea, although his - wife has already prepared his evening meal at home, and then in his tired condition to carry on for perhaps twelve or fourteen hours at a stretch in addition to his ordinary hours of employment. The Minister seems to be quite overjoyed to think that he has been liberal enough to give something approaching hour for hour for this overtime.",74
489,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Overtime should not be encouraged.,74
490,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I agree with the honourable member ; but when, men are compelled, to work overtime in these circumstances it is shameful to refuse to pay them anything for it . It is especially unjust when it is recollected that these men are not only at the loss of their own time at an inconvenient period, but are actually out of pocket. Out. of a scanty wage of about 7s. a day, they have to provide tea money, and supper money if they work late, and sometimes they have to pay for their own breakfast if they remain on duty all night. I do not know whether the Minister thinks that is proper, but I regard it as. a most improper thing. There seems to be a willingness always to give every consideration to the clerical staff, but to leave other employees without any chance of obtaining fair treatment. I trust the Minister will see the proprietj of making some monetary allowance to these men when the Government insist upon their working overtime. I might say that the Minister does allow payment if the men go back to work at the instance of a private firm. The private firms pay the Government, and the Government in turn hand over the money to the employees; but I am referring particularly to cases in which men are compelled to go back at the instance of the department.",74
491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Does the Government make that distinction 1,75
492,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Yes . This is an innovation which has come into force since the control of the Customs was taken over by the Commonwealth.,75
493,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The honourable member does not expect them to get fair play, does he?",75
494,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I do, and I do not think it is yet too late for the Minister to redeem himself in this respect. If he persists in this practice a great number of people who have regarded him as a fair man wili arrive at the conclusion that he is something the opposite of that. Surely he cannot reconcile the system with his own idea of what is right. It prevails in no other employ that I am aware of, and it is not right that the Government should initiate such a practice.",75
495,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I hope that the Minister will also inquire into the Customs department generally with a, view to seeing the amount of sweated labour there is there. The right honourable gentleman has some knowledge already of the condition of things obtaining, and I look to him with great confidence to stop this sweating at the earliest moment. There are a number of young men who do not seem to be able to secure any advance in wages. Some of them, who have been in the department for eight, nine and ten years, are getting today only £ 5 2 a year, whilst others are getting £ 6 5 , £ 7 0 and £ 8 0 . When men who are handling money all day are being paid such salaries it occurs to rae that they are under strong temptation to peculation. I know of one who is a clerk to the cashier, and he is handling money all day long. He has not - had an advance in wages for five years. There is nothing against him ; his reports - are all good, but somehow or another he is stuck there. I know of another, one of the best hands in the office, who has been getting a salary of £ 5 2 a j'ear for years past and can get no advance.",75
496,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Is he over 21 years of age t If he is the Public Service Act will bring him up a little.,75
497,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Yes , it will ; but there are some other cases to which the Act will not apply. Where men who have the handling of money have arrived at years of maturity they should at least receive a sufficient salary to enable them to keep themselves. That is not the case in many of the instances to which I refer, and I confidently appeal to the Minister to rectify this state of things.",75
498,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES, As bearing upon this question I desire to draw the attention of the Minister to the necessity for a few more clerks at the busiest shipping ports of the Commonwealth. So far as the port with which I am connected is concerned it is impossible for shippers to get their entries passed on goods landed after two or three o'clock in the afternoon.,75
499,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,No r can they in Sydney.,75
500,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I have learned that that is the case also in Sydney. They have to discontinue unloading, or else allow their goods to remain on the wharf to be pilfered, possibly, during the night. It is disgraceful that such a state of affairs should be permitted to exist in order to avoid the employment of an extra clerk or two to enable entries to be passed within the prescribed hours. I do not say that any blame for this attaches to the officers at present employed. It is due to the fact that the offices are undermanned, and that those who are employed are unable to cope with the work they are called upon to do. I urge the Minister to look into the matter with a view to making some improvement in the existing condition of affairs. ",75
501,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Replyin g first to the question of the honourable member for Herbert with respect to living allowances in the tropics, the matter is engaging the attention of the Public Service Commissioner, with a view to the adoption of a rule on the subject which will apply iienerally to the tropics. I hope that it will shortly be settled. It has generally been the practice to make an allowance to officers employed in the tropics, but the honourable member will understand that it is highly desirable, now that the States have federated, that a uniform practice should be adopted, and that will be brought about by the means I have indicated. W it h regard to what has fallen from the honourable member for Dalley, I must apologize to the honourable member as to the matter of paints. It is a difficult matter to deal with, but I hope to have it dealt with within the shortest possible time, on lines that will be considered satisfactory. On the subject of overtime, I do not know that at this moment overtime is being worked to any great extent. W it h regard to overtime worked in the past, which has not been remunerated either by payment or by allowance, and i u respect of which any claim is made, we shall have it looked into.",75
502,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Is it a fair thing to give only an allowance of time to a man who has been put to expense in order to comply with the requirements of the office ?,76
503,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"If expense is incurred that should be a matter for consideration. The officer should certainly not be subjected to a loss. The honourable member will agree with me that, generally, overtime is to be avoided, but those who have to - work overtime should certainly be fully compensated. I hope to see the time when overtime will be avoided entirely, because I believe it to be a mischievous system.",76
504,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The question is what are we to do in the meantime 1,76
505,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It is our intention, as regards the staff at Sydney and elsewhere, to make such provision as will avoid the necessity - for the working of overtime. Here I should like to say to the honourable member for Parramatta that I agree with him that there are a number of very hard cases- I think New South Wales is chiefly conspicuous in this respect-in which officers seem to have become stuck through no faultof their own. They have done good service, but have remained at ridicidously low salaries for the work they are called upon to perform.",76
506,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"And yet, the Government are sending men across from here to those offices.",76
507,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The federal service is one- Mr WATKINS - If men are sent from other places to the offices in New South Wales, there will be little chance of promotion for the men who have been employed there.",76
508,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Everythin g has to be considered, and we cannot permit a man who has been receiving only £ 6 0 a year to take a place at £200 or £300 a year, positions which are not so frequent as one might desire. My attention has been called particularly to - what I call the hard cases, of men who have been stuck through no fault of their own, and who are receiving salaries which are simply ridiculous, considered as emolument for the services of any one who has attained adult age. I have a list of them, and they would have been made provision for expressly on the Estimates, but it seems that in nine cases out of ten their position will be improved as soon as the section of the Public Service Act comes into operation, providing a certain salary for officers who have served a certain time. Cases which will not be affected by the Act will not be overlooked.",76
509,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I should like to know from the Minister distinctly whether he intends to pay for overtime worked. I would, remind the right honourable gentleman that this matter has been under consideration now for months. The right honourable gentleman has the reputation of being a man of decision, but he will lose that reputation if matters under his control are permitted to go on for months and months without any decision, and without those interested being able to get anything definite as to the conditions under which they are to work. It is a shameful state of affairs that the Minister should ask men who are receiving 7s. a day to spend as much as 3s. out of that in order that they may get food to sustain them while they are working overtime, without a penny of compensation being given them. ' They are merely offered some time off as compensation. That is not a state of affairs which the Commonwealth Parliament should allow to continue.",76
510,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Does the honourable member say that tea-mohey is not allowed ?,76
511,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I say that tea-money has not been allowed to these men, and I j say, further, that they have had to pay for' - supper and breakfast as well. It must be i remembered that these men have their > meals prepared for them at home, but they . get notice at the last moment that they must go on duty for the convenience of the Government, and though they receive a paltry wage of 7s. a day they get no compensation for the overtime worked. It is contemptible in the extreme to ask men to work under these conditions. The Minister should give us to understand definitely that the out-door and lower paid officers will be given more consideration in this respect than they have had in the past. I am convinced that if honourable members had an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon this matter, apart from other issues, the great majority of them would admit that what I suggest is only fail-. I know that the clerical officers of the department have had a hard time in Sydney for some months past, and they have been given tea-money and some time off, though not the full time to which they have been entitled, as compensation for overtime worked. It is to be hoped that, so far as the clerical staff is concerned, the Minister will supplement their numbers to such an extent as to allow of the work being completed within the specified office hours. But their hours are ordinarily much shorter than those worked by the men to whom I have specially referred. The officers in the clerical staff work from nine o'clock in the morning until half-past four in the afternoon, whilst the outdoor men must work eight hours each day before they are entitled to any overtime, and, as they are also lower paid men, their case merits greater consideration than that of the clerical staff. I trust that the Minister will say something on the subject a little more definite than what .he said a. few moments ago. The Statement the right honourable gentleman has made was merely-to the effect that these men have been allowed time off in the past, and he hoped there would be no necessity for them to work overtime in the future. I say that, without over-manning the outdoor staff, it is impossible to avoid some overtime work. I quite agree that it should be minimized to the greatest possible extent. None of us desire to see men working, too long hours, even if they are paid extra for it . But in the case of these men some overtime work is inevitable, and the Minister might revise the regulations previously existing in New South Wales, under which men working overtime, either for the Government or for private individuals, were paid for the overtime worked. I express no opinion as to the rate of payment. The rate previously paid may have been too high, or it may not, but that there should be some payment for overtime there can be no doubt. I am sure that a maj'oritj of 7 honourable members will be prepared to admit that this is a proper plan, and to insist that it shall be observed.",76
512,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"As regards the question of payment for overtime as overtime, it must be remembered that the arrangements hitherto existing have not been of that character.",77
513,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,They were in New South Wales.,77
514,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"But the systems were assimilated as soon as federation took place, and, of course, it would be impossible to justify the adoption of one practice in one State and a different practice in another. I feel that it is quite unfair that a man working overtime should be at any expense whatever in providing meals. As a rule, tea-money only is provided, but the honourable member for Bland suggests that the men may require to have a further meal.",77
515,Mr AVATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Me n working all night require tea, supper, and breakfast.",77
516,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I think it is proper that when men are working overtime they should be allowed payment for their meals, and I shall allow it .",77
517,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,What about extra clerical assistance where required %,77
518,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"It will be supplied where required. In the case of Newcastle, recognising the importance of the port, I have arranged to send an officer there of considerable experience and standing, and to provide the clerical assistance which is necessary.",77
519,Mr AVATKINS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The right honourable gentleman is sending men from other States there. Mr K IN G STO N - I contemplate appointing to the comptrollership of Newcastle a gentleman from New South Wales who has lately been in my own office, a man much senior to any local officer who might be an applicant for the position.",77
520,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,What about the two messengers whose case I brought under notice ?,77
521,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I think that they are provided for in the Estimates, and if not they will be provided for under the rule, for theirs is a very hard case. * I Yote agreed to. Division 37 {Expenditure in Tasmania) -£9,675 .",77
522,Mr BAMFO RD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I am sure that the committee, as well as the country generally, is very much interested in the success of our legislation in regard to the growth of sugar with white labour. I take this opportunity of speaking on the subject, because, so far as Queensland is concerned, my speech will obtain a great deal more publicity than if it appeared in any of the newspapers, either local or otherwise. Some time ago there appeared in the Age, a letter on the subject from Mr 0. C. Chambers, in which he implied that white labour in the cane fields is an utter failure. I desire to put the other side of the case. There are a great many persons who being interested in sugar-growing do not wish to see white labour a success. They have no sympathy with our legislation, and their aim is that it should be a failure. I have in my hand some extracts from northern newspapers, and also letters which I have received from private correspondents. It has taken some time to get a refutation of the statements made by Mr Chambers in his letter, and consequently I could not raise the question at an earlier period. He said, amongst other things, that the mills could not be kept going with small quantities of cane-that they required a great quantity of cane daily to keep them going, and that it was utterly impossible that they could be supplied by the users of white labour. As a matter of fact, there area number qf mills in theMaCkaydistrict, from which he wrote, which are supplied almost entirely by small growers. In that particular locality there are five central termsmills, which are entirely supplied by small settlers. In fact, the central mills were erected for the express purpose of giving the small grower an outlet for his cane. A mill is supplied by a number of small growers, each grower brioging in a small lot every day. At most of the mills there is a cane inspector, who goes round and judges when the cane is fit for crushing; and as soon as it is fit for crushing he gives notice to the farmer, and so much as is ready to be cut is then cut and carted to the mill. As regards the cutting of cane by white men, I propose to read a few extracts from local ! newspapers. The Mackay Chronicle wrote on the 20th August as follows :There comes from Plane Creek the news that two local young men are getting 3s. per ton for cutting and loading, and are making over £2 per week each, clear. In fact, their last week's tally was 38 tons, which works out at £2 17s. each. Plane Creek is in the same district as Homebush, from which Mr Chambers wrote. In his letter he said that he offered 5s., and even as high as 6s., if my memory serves me aright, for cutting; but that he could not get it done, whereas these men are doing the work at 3s. The Federal, which is published at Townsville, had the following statement in its issue of. 30th August:The gang of white cane cutters at Halifax finished their contract early this week. They were eleven in number, and have proved beyond a doubt that the work of cutting and loading cane is congenial to, and can be performed easily by white men. Thej' were receiving 4s. per ton, and averaged from 2 to 2J tons per day, occasionally when in heavy cane doing over 3 tons in a day. There are also excellent reports of the white cane cutters' working near Ingham. Halifax and Ingham are on the Herbert river, one of the hottest portions 'of the cane-growing area. The Trinity Times, published at Cairns, wrote on the 27th August as follows :The Hambledon cane gang informs us that they received every assistance from the C.S.R. Company during the performance of their contract. Taking in the time occupied in trashing and putting in the good with the bad patches of cane, the gang made just upon nawying wages for the whole time they were occupied, although it was onlj' a 12-ton crop. The men are perfectlysatisfied that among 15 or 20 ton crops thej' could easily make far higher wages than at any equal work. In the issue of the Federal for the 23rd August, Mr A . Humphries, a cane-cutter, gives his personal experience in. these I never handled a cane-knife before; but after a few daj'S I was willing to cut cane with nny Kanaka that ever saw daylight. I consider this six weeks' cane-cutting as the easiest employment I have had for .years. Having been nuvvying, bullock-driving, &c., I should be able to give an unbiased opinion. Mr Humphries Writes from Kalamia on the Lower Burdekin, where his gang were employed by a Mr G. Campbell, and states that they are looking for other work of. the same sort - In that district, I am sorry to say, there were very few growers who registered ; but evidently there were some. Mr R. M . Shannon, who grows cane in a comparatively large way, has written to me from Mackay in these terms I have seventeen white cutters, and mj' work has gone along with greater despatch than usual. The Sunnyside con. espcmdent of Mackay Chronicle writes as follows :I have just had u visit from one of the cane cutters in a white gang here telling me to call attention to the rumour in the press that all the white gangs at Homebush had broken up. This he tells me is not true. We have our gang here sticking to it well and making good wages. They are cutting Mr Dymond's cane at present. These extracts are representative of many others which I could quote if it were necessary. I may remark parenthetically that at Port Douglas, the most northern locality at which cane is grown in Queensland, white cutters have been Verysuccessfullyemployed. The distance from Plane Creek to Port Douglas is, I think, over 450 miles. Port Douglas is well up in the tropics. I suppose it lies between 15 degrees and 15£ degrees south. Between those points there are a great many sugar-growing areas, and in each case the experiment has proved successful. Mr Chambers further states in his letter that after the gangs had left the work he could get no other men to undertake it . I am credibly informed that at the time when he wrote the roads around Mackay were literally alive with men seeking work. It is a very remarkable thing that if others were so fortunate as to get men, he could not. On the 21st August-whic h is a little later than the time when he said that he could not get gangs, that several gangs had been disbanded, and would not re-form-ther e were thirteen gangs, aggregating in all 59 men cutting cane by contract, and four gangs, with fifteen men in all, cutting on weekly wages at Homebush. Two gangs only had disbanded up to that date-that of Mr. Chambers, fifteen men, being one, and that of Mr Winser, five men, being the other. I. can inform the committee that the statement regarding the men working at Homebush nt that particular date is absolutely correct. In face of these reports in the press aud the opinions of the cane-cutters, the statement made by the Premier of Queensland that men could not make more than 15s. per week at cane-cutting will not establish his reputation for sincerity, because here is proof that men were making £ 2 ] 7s. each, some of them earning more than that amount. In a letter w l ich Mr. Shannon sent to me, he says :Federation and federal legislation are doing a great deal of direct good to the sugar industry. White Australia is all right, keep right ahead with it. 46 H the Mr Shannon is a comparatively large sugargrower within a few miles of Homebush, from which Mr Chambers wrote. It may be remembered that when the legislation in regard to coloured labour was initiated, Mr . Philp wrote to the Prime Minister asking him if we would guarantee the cost of two mills, one on Johnstone River and one on the Russell River.",78
523,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"He had been asked by a «/ deputation to do so, and he said- "" Go to the Federal Government.""",79
524,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"He , as it were, asked the Commonwealth Government to carry the baby, but the request was declined. In 1S96, the JohnstoneRiver selectors had adistinct promise from the present Premier that a mill would be erected in their district and another on the Russell River; but after the passing of the Pacific Island Labourers Act, he declined to fulfil the promise, on the ground that the outlook for the sugar industry was so black that he was not justified in spending any more money upon the erection of mills. The selectors of those districts are again taking steps to induce the Queensland Government to erect mills, and it is a significant fact that a meeting recently held at Cairns with that object was presided over by a Mr Draper, I believe, the present mayor of the town, and a man who has always strenuously maintained that white labour could not do the work which has to be done in the canefields. At that meeting a resolution was carried, nem. con., of which this is the concluding portionWe are thoroughly satisfied that under the altered conditions brought about by federation, mills in this district would be highly payable, and their erection would be of immense benefit to this district in particular, as well as to the whole State of Queensland.",79
525,Mr WATSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Would the selectors in the district have to pay for the mills they wish the Government to erect ?,79
526,Mr BAMFORD,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"If the mills were erected, they would have to mortgage their land to the Government, and would therefore lose all they had if the investment failed. But, notwithstanding what has been said by the Premier of Queensland and some of his Ministers, these people are quite willing to go on growing sugar under the a - tered conditions brought about by federation.",79
527,Mr CHOBCH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Was the meeting to which the honourable member has referred one which any one could attend ? ... Mr BAMFORD - Yes, a public meeting held in compliance with an advertisement inviting the whole population to be present. Cairns is 400 miles north of Mackay, and Port Douglas is 50 or 60 miles beyond Cairns. Mr Shannon, whom I have already quoted, says, in a private letter to me, that men were so plentiful at the time that he could not find work for all who offered themselves, and had to put up a notice to the effect that he was fully supplied. In the face of facts such as these, the allegation that white labour in the cane fields is a conspicuous failure is proved to be an absolute contravention of the truth. thank the committee for having given me the opportunity of making this statement. - Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) - A few days ago, in an interview published by the Argus, the Premier of Queensland was reported to have saidThe anti-Kanaka legislation of the Federal liament is inflicting serious injury upon the sugar industry, and what between the drought and ill-considered legislation, Queensland is indeed in a bad way. Some planters at Geraldton have been making a sincere attempt to get their work done by white labour. They notified that 5.s. per ton would be paid for treating 1,000 of cane; but they succeeded in getting only 33 acres cut, and the men only made los. per week apiece at the work. The address just delivered by the honourable member for Herbert is a most valuable contribution to this important question, and the facts which he has submitted go a long way to refute the statements of the Premier of Queensland, and to justify the action of this Parliament in passing the legislation which he is denouncing, and because of which he has endeavoured to promote the disruption of the Union. It is to be deplored that a gentleman in the position of a Minister of the Crown should endeavour to damage our federal institutions, when information such as that which has just been placed before the committee by the honourable member for Herbert was at his disposal. I hope that the speech of the honourable member for Herbert will not be suppressed, but will be published far and wide, especially in Queensland, so that the misleading statements made by the - Premier of that State in order to damage the Commonwealth Government, if not the Union itself, will be refuted, and the public will be placed in possession of the real facts of the case.

528,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I wish to draw the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to a fact which I brought under notice when the Estimates were last being considered. In the first place, the Comptroller of Stores in Victoria, whose salary last year was put down at £ 4 4 0 per annum, is being given a salary of £ 4 6 0 per annum, from the 27th December next I - an increase of £20.' In the second place, the clerk in charge of Stores in New South Wales, who performs exactly similar duties, receives only £ 3 2 0 per annum. It seems to me that it would be only fair if the two officers received at least the same salary, supposing that the stores Parover which they have control are of about the same value; but, as a matter of fact, New South Wales being the larger State, requires a much greater quantity of stores than is required in Victoria. I know that the Minister will say he cannot regulate acres these salaries, but I should like him to make some statement which will serve as a direction to the Public Service Commissioner in. regard to the matter.",80
529,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I should like to know why the relatives of deceased officials, for whom gratuities appear upon these Estimates, have not already received the amounts due to them 1",80
530,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The gratuities are not legal liabilities, and can be paid by the Commonwealth only with the consent of the States.",80
531,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Has it taken twelve months to obtain that consent 1,80
532,Sir PHILIP FYSH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,Consen t has been obtained for those on these Estimates.,80
533,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,The gratuities will be paid directly the Estimates are passed.,80
534,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I have also something to say in regard to the slowness of the department in connection with the extension of the telephone system. I have brought under the notice of the Minister several instances in which extensions could be made which would pay from the start, but in each case I have received the reply that no funds are available for the work. It is a short sighted policy not to construct such lines. They could very well be paid for out of revenue. It may be necessary to raise loans :for the construction of very large works, but small connexions between suburbs, or to - bring an outlying district into communica.tion with a main centre of population, might - very well be paid for out of revenue, especially when it is obvious that they would pay from the start. ""We had a sufficiently large surplus upon last year's transactions to cany out these works, if we had kept as - much as we were entitled to keep. The present short-sighted policy of the department cannot be allowed to continue much longer. These works will have te be constructed to - meet the requirements of the public. The Minister should be prepared to undertake - the construction of telegraph and telephone lines where there is a prospect of deriving a profit from the beginning.",80
535,Sir PHILIP FYSH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," The honourable member for Dalley has supplied the answer to this question by calling attention to the fact that the relative value of the services of the officers to whom he referred will have to be determined by the Public Service Commissioner at an early date. W it h regard to the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Newcastle, I may mention that there is now being printed a revised list of the public works which are to be constructed out of the revenue for the current year. The honourable member will find that the telegraph and telephone extensions to which he has referred are included in this list of works, and that they will shortly be constructed.",81
536,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I am quite satisfied with the reply made by the Minister. In connection with the same division, however, I find that there are 502 employees in the letter-carriers' department in New South Wales who receive salaries amounting in all to £54,000. In the letter-carriers' room at the Victorian General Post-office the total number of employees is 245, and the salaries paid aggregate £30,000. There seems to be an inequality in this case, which should be explained.",81
537,Sir GEOKGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"And yet the torian officers are complaining because are not placed in the same position as are those in New South Wales. There may be a large number of juniors in the South Wales service. - Mr Wilks - S t ill there are more than twice as many letter-carriers employed in Sydney as in Melbourne, whilst the expenditure is not nearly so great in Estimates. -10 n 2 proportion. I find, further, that New South Wales is satisfied with one overseer of letter-carriers who receives the princely salary of £ 1 6 0 per annum, whereas in Victoria, with less than half the number of employees to control, they have one supervisor at £336 per annum and an assistant supervisor at £252 per annum. I am not arguing that the Victorian service is overmanned, but I think that this matter should engage the immediate attention of the Public Service Commissioner. It is no wonder that the Public Service of the Commonwealth is disorganized whilst these incongruities exist. Vote agreed to. Division 161 (Expenditure in Victoria)£552,332.",81
538,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," The charwomen engaged in the Melbourne General Post office complain that although they have been in the service for as long as 23 years in some cases, they are still classified as temporary employees. I brought this matter under notice when the last Estimates were before us, but I have not heard that the grievance has been remedied. These women are anxious to be placed on exactly the same footing as officers occupying similar positions in other States. They think that if the employees who are engaged in cleaning post-offices in other States enjoy the status of permanent officers they should be placed in the same position, so that they cannot be turned off at a moment's notice. In this and other respects it is desirable that uniformity should be brought about in all the States as soon as possible. I understand that the Public Service Commissioner has not yet been able to frame all the regulations necessary, but I hope that the work will be pushed on as quickly as possible. As the Treasurer is aware a case is pending in the Victorian law, courts, which may involve the Commonwealth in an additional expenditure of £30,000 a year for the payment of increments to officers under clause 19, VicAct 1721. I understand that he has prothey vided for this in the Estimates.",81
539,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"No . I have not provided for it, but I have promised that New the increments shall be paid. ' Mr TUDOR - Eigh t thousand nine hundred pounds are provided for increments to officers in New South Wales, but I do not see any similar provision in the Victorian",81
540,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"The Victorian increments are added to the individual salaries, but in the New South Wales Estimates the increments are provided for in a lump sum, because there was no time to apportion them.",82
541,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I am pleased that the Estimates are presented to us in a much clearer form now than they were last year, and I hope to see a still further improvement. Do I understand from the Treasurer that it will not be necessary to pass further Estimates to provide for the payment of increments in the event of the case now pending being decided against the Government ?",82
542,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"If it is shown that the officers are entitled to the increments involved in the present action, I shall do the best lean to pay them out of the Treasurer's advance account. I have asked for a large vote in order to meet these and similar cases.",82
543,Mr TUDOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I am glad that the Treasurer has provided for the payment out of his advance account of the increments .necessary to carry out the minimum wage provisions of the Public Service Act from .the 1st July, that is the beginning of the .present financial year.

544,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," The .amount which it is proposed to pay the Queensland Railway Commissioner for the % - carriage of mails-£50,000-appear s to be very large. I have been trying to ascertain the amounts paid to the Railway Commissioners in other States for similar services.",82
545,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"In £65,000 is paid, and in New South Wales I think ±""70,000. The amount named is paid to the Railway Commissioner of Queensland under an agreement entered into between the railway and post-office authorities in that State.  the amount just before federation was accomplished.",82
546,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I think that this is a matter which should be prominently brought under the public attention, becau'se the increase of the amount, in the manner mentioned by the honourable member for Maranoa, makes the Post-office department appear worse off to that extent, and places the Railway department in a better light ; whilst the people of Queensland do not benefit to the extent of one penny. There has been a great deal of manipulation of the Queensland finances by the State Government in connection with this and other transferred departments - as I shall show when the Defence estimates come under discussion-and I think that it is necessary, in view of the complaints regarding the increased cost of the transferred departments, that the whole of the facts should be laid bare. The sum paid to the Queensland Railway Commissioner for the conveyance of mails is altogether out of proportion to the amounts charged for similar services in other States. I am quite aware that Queensland has a large territory with a scattered population, but there must be a difference of more than £20,000 in the cost-of carrying mails in Queensland and in New South Wales, the latter State having a population three times as great as that of Queensland.' It would have been much better for the people of Queensland if that £10,000 surcharge had been spent in providing them with facilities in the way of telegraph and ' telephone lines and new mail services.  new services unless the department is guaranteed against loss.",82
547,Mr WILKINSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I am aware of that fact. To ra}' mind, it is exceedingly unfortunate that whenever people approach the department with a request for increased postal or telegraphic facilities, they are met with the objection that no funds are available for the purpose. I think that we might very well economize in other directions to enable us to provide these facilities, Victoria particularly in sparsely populated districts.",82
548,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I should like to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to item No. 18, which reads - "" Allowances to to non-official postmasters, receiving office keepers, <fcc., and to provide for the opening of new non-official post-offices, receiving offices, &,c, £9,300."" I desire to be informed of the jiolicy of the department in respect of these non-official post-offices. Is it iutended, with a view to bringing about a uniform system, to reduce to any considerable degree offices in New South Wales which have hitherto been classed as ""official"" post-offices, and to make them "" non-official"" post-offices. I know that at the present time a proposal to adopt that course in regard to a post-office in my own electorate is occupying the consideration of the Postmaster-General. I refer to Alectown, which was formerly a mining centre, and where for several years a post and telegraph office has been maintained. Upon the grounds of economy,! understand that it is now proposed to reduce the status of that office from an "" official"" post-office to a ""non-official "" one. As soon as this fact became known, certain representations were made to me by the residents. I instituted inquiries at the Postal department, and was led to believe that no further steps would be taken in that direction. Subsequent inquiries, however, revealed that the Sydney Postal department had committed the Government to the complete change of system which is now contemplated. As soon as I informed the people of the Ministerial intention, they held a meeting to consider the position, adopted certain resolutions which were forwarded to the Postmaster-General, together with a petition signed by a large number of the inhabitants. Since then I have learned that thedepartment has entered into arrangements with a local storekeeper to erect new premises; and has appointed him-som e time in advance of the termination of the present contract-to the position of non-official postmaster. I am informed that this action has been taken with a view of bringing about the adoption of a uniform system. Personally, I think it would be a great mistake to withdraw facilities of this - character from the community. I may' inform honourable members that Alectown does not partake of the "" mushroom"" growth which characterizes many other mining centres. It is surrounded by country which is admirably adapted to agricultural pursuits. Indeed, it is the agricultural population which now maintains it . During the past fifteen years a considerable area of Crown lands in its immediate vicinity has been held under pastoral lease, and has thus been closed against settlement. These leases have now expired, and it is quite open to the Minister for Lands to make them available, for closer settlement. Indeed, it is onlj' the severity of the prevalent drought that has caused him to decline to sanction their withdrawal from pastoral occupation at present. As soon as the drought breaks up, and better conditions obtain, no doubt they will be thrown open for closer settlement. Some fifteen or eighteen months ago a similar proposal to that which is now entertained, was under the consideration of the State Postal department. Indeed, the State Ministry had approved of the reduction of the status of the post-office at Alectown upon the same lines that are now proposed. Subsequently, however, the Commonwealth Attorney-General visited the town in connection with the federal campaign, and he was so impressed with the possibilities of the district that he communicated with the State Postmaster-General upon the matter, with the result that the arrangements which had been entered into were immediately cancelled, and the post-office was allowed to maintain its former status. The cancellation of those arrangements involved the payment of compensation to the storekeeper who had been appointed as non-official postmaster. Seeing that it was deemed wise to reverse the decision of the State Post and Telegraph department at that time, surely it is rather premature for the Commonwealth to adopt the plan which was originally proposed. People of the .district naturally feel indignant at the treatment which has been accorded to them. I should like to know to what extent this reduction on the plea of uniformity is likely to effect the privileges possessed by residents of New South Wales prior to entering federation ?",82
549,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," The honourable member for Canobolas deserves credit for having drawn attention to this matter, but I certainly do not agree with the conclusion at which he has arrived. I hope the Postmaster-General will persevere with the abolition of official offices where these do .not pay expenses, and hand over the business ' to storekeepers and others, who can carry it on at a moderate cost, and thus conduce to the economical management of the department. I have never heard anything more preposterous than the suggestion made by the honourable member for Canobolas, who, if I understand him correctly, wants the department to adhere to a course of action taken at the instance of a person who was a candidate for the Federal Parliament, and who was soliciting the votes of the people in the district affected by the change. That has been openly avowed by the honourable member, thus showing that the representations made by the candidate were interested, and that he presumably had sufficient influence with the local Government to induce them to take his view of the situation. This matter of unofficial as against official post-offices is very important to the State of Western and, in my opinion, the policy pursued by the department is a proper one. It is not pleasant for an unfortunate official to be located at some far-distant inland station, where the receipts may .be only from £50 to £100 a year. He is chained up in a locality where there is no congenial society or recreation, at a loss to the department. It is, therefore, far better to allow the storekeepers to run the post-offices, as is extensively done in Victoria. system has worked well in the State which I have just mentioned, why should it not work well also in the State of - New South Wales 1 Honourable members must not overlook the fact that if the postal department is to pay its way, and facilities are to be given in the interior of the continent, the funds must not be loaded down with unpayable offices. We expect the mails to run into the remotest portions of Australia, and that cannot be done if officials are kept at offices at salaries which the revenue earned does not cover. I shall have something to say on this matter when the Estimates of Western Australia before us. But I cannot help now expressing my disapproval of a suggestion which the honourable member for Canobolas has made, and repudiating his remarks as to the mushroom character of mining What about the mushroom character of some of the townships in the desert portions of Queensland and New South Wales which are dependent upon the squatters, and which are just as liable to fluctuation t A distinctinjustice is being done to the mining community by the facilities given in the more settled portions of Western which enjoy post-offices with highly-salaried officials, when a greater volume of correspondence has to be contended with in mining townships by men paid £10 to £12 a year. Only the other day I referred to a. case in which the department had actually offered a man £6 a year at an important mining centre, where, according to the representation made, nearly 2.0,000 letters passed through the post-office annually. the same volume of correspondence passed through an office on the coast, there would probably be an official with a salary of £100 Mr Mahon. to £ 1 5 0 per annum. The department didstretch a point, and offered the man. in charge at the mining township the. magnificent sum of £ 1 2 a year to do the work, although all commodities there Australia, are at famine prices, even a glass of beer costing Is. I hope the committee will not. follow the advice of the honourable member, for Canobolas, hut will approve of the policy of the Postmaster-General in extend- ing the system of unofficial post-offices. L do not say that there may not be some objection to these unofficial offices, but if the whole of the interior of Australia has to enjoy the advantages which we all expect and desire in the matter of postal communiIf this cation, every effort must be made to keepdown expenses, and so maintain the service which at present exists ",83
550,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I did not hear the early part of the speech of the honourable member for Cano- bolas, but I was very glad to hear a portion' of his remarks, if only because they afford. me an opportunity of expostulating against the opinions he expressed. I may nothe able to reply to the honourable mem-: ber for Canobolas in the happy termsused by the last speaker, who made one of the most practical and common-sensespeeches I have yet heard on the question come of postal facilities in the interior. I have had a large experience in this matter, and I am quite satisfied that we have men withe Post and Telegraph department who will' take care to carry out the reforms which are. townships. so necessary. There is no doubt that official buildings and appointments ought to beminimized in many hamlets, and also otherplaces which do not even deserve the latter> description. I know of a post-office that was built within the last few years at a cost of £3,000, and fully equipped,, though the population within a radius; Australia, of 10 miles is less that 500. I know of. another post-office which cost probably a little more, putting aside the value of the land. There is a fine brick building in the Gothic style of architecture, and the architect's fees, not considering the remuneration of the inspector of works,' would be sufficient to.supply a post-office to the village for the next 25 years. .But the contract price and other expenses had If to be paid, all, as usual, being taken out of loan moneys. AS to the carriage of mails, I remember once arranging with Cobb and Co. to cancel a contract which involved some hundreds of pounds. was, in round figures, £500, and the total revenue per annum was £ 5 3s. 6d., crediting every letter from England or Russia. In London I saw a population of 100,000 in one of the best neighbourhoods served, in two grocers' shops, used as telegraph, telephone, and post-offices by two girls and a man, to whom the British Postal department paid a certain price for providing most excellent facilities. These are a few facts which I wish honourable members to remember. Unless the expenditure is reduced to the most modest dimensions we cannot, as the honourable member for Coolgardie has pointed out, provide necessary conveniences in the back blocks. Money ought not to be squandered on official appointments and buildings in alleged townships which consist mainly of a blacksmith's shop and probably a lock-up. We should cease to appoint officials who have practically nothing to do and cannot live in comfort at their stations on a reasonable salary. I hope the time is not far distant when the Postmaster-General will try to make the department what it is in England andsome other countries, such as America. In Australia we can send for 2s. 6d. a telegram which in America would cost 15s. We have the cheapest telegraph rates in the world, but we must not forget that it may be possible to have them too cheap. I remember quite well that when local postage was reduced from 4d. to 2d. it nearly wrecked the finances of all the colonies. In two of the colonies at least the change was brought about for electioneering purposes. The Post and Telegraph department ought to be worked neither at a loss nor at a great profit in a new country. We know, however, that millions of profit are realized out of the postal service in England, Germany and elsewhere, and surely some attempt should be made to stop the flagrant disbursements to which the last speaker referred in terms which, while courteous, - were' strong, and must bring conviction to those who desire good service for honest payment.",84
551,Mr BROWN,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I spoke before merely in order to elicit from the honourable member representing the Postmaster General what the policy is to be, and to what extent, if any, it will affect existing interests at the disposal of the Lands department for such in New South Wales, quoting Alectown as an instance in point - As the outcome of my remarks the honourable member for One item Coolgardie made a short address, and caused it to appear as if I bad stated that the alteration was improperly brought about for the purpose of securing political advantages.. I made no statement of that character, and' what the honourable member stated was pure, inference. I am fighting with him to secure advantages for mining centres, and not. only that, but to retain advantages which the Government have seen fit to give to such' centres. Because population has decreased; in a certain place owing to the failing off in mining, it does not follow that that population has permanently left. A number of mining places in New South Wales have gone through the same experience, and further discoveries on the same field may lead to an increased population. I would, point oat also that this field is not dependent entirely upon mining resources.: There is also a splendid agricultural district in the vicinity, and it is quite within the limits of possibility that even if the mining were exhausted the agricultural interests would be great enough to maintain"" the town and probably lead to an increased population. As it appears that the honor j able member for Coolgardie has mis'inter^ preted my meaning, I wish to quote some resolutions which have been sent tome for transmission to the Postmaster' General. These resolutions were passed at a meeting held at Alectown on the 13th September, 1902, Mr John Crawford, J.P.,' presiding. They are as follow :1. That this meeting of the townspeople and district residents of Alectown, view with the deepest concern and regret the information that it is the intention of the federal postal authorities to reduce the status of the local post and telegraph office from that of an official to a non-official office, and desires to enter its emphatic! protest against such a proposal. 2. That no official intimation has yet been con{ veyed to the residents of this town and district of such proposed alteration, nor have they been con-' suited with respect to it ; and this meeting desires respectfull to protest against such treatment. 3. That this office has been an official one almost from the inception of the town up to the present time, and, in past years, has been a revenue-producing office. Ou account of the der cliue of mining within recent years the-revenue has fallen short of expenditure, but the town is the centre of a rich agricultural district, which is being developed, and is capable of greater ex pausion as soon as adjacent suitable Crown lands ; are made available for settlement, which are now 1 purposes. It is confidently expected that this expansion will place the office again on a revenue producing basis, and necessitate the existing official status. 4. That some eighteen months ago similar action to that now foreshadowed was approved by the State Postmaster-General, and on a visit to this town by the Hon. B. R. Wise, M.L.C, State Attorney-General, the undesirableness this action in view of the prospects of thedistricfc, were brought under his notice, with the result that the approved action was cancelled, compensation paid in connection therewith, and the ing status maintained. Although, in the meanat time, the district has passed through one of severest droughts ever experienced, and, as a sult, adjacent Crown lauds have not been made available as expected, still the town and trict have made substantial progress in the tion of the anticipated improvements. In view theforegoing facts, it is respectfully submitted proposed action should not be taken at the present juncture, but should be deferred for further reasonable period at least. ."">. That the foregoing resolution be to Mr T. Brown, M.H.R., for presentation to the Federal Postmaster-General, and that Mr. Brown be asked to urge the claims of this town and district to existing post and ties as set out in the resolutions submitted. I have also presented a petition to the effect, signed by a considerable number of people. I do not wish it to be understood that I am not thoroughly in sympathy with the policy of the department to make the expenditure and the.income balance, but in a case like this, where a privilege .been granted, but where the revenue has temporarily fallen off, and there are reasonhad able grounds for hoping that in the future the population will increase, it is a very unwise policy to withdraw facilities unless tire department is thoroughly satisfied that the district has gone back such an extent that there is no hope of regaining its old position. I do not think that the department can contend that that is the case in respect to this district. merely want to retain for a mining centre the privileges it has hitherto had, and hoped, in making that fight, that I should have the sympathy of those who, like the honourable member for Coolgardie, know what mining interests are, and what fluctuanumber tions mining centres are subject to.",85
552,Sir PHILIP FYSH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"--I hope the mittee will not be led away by the remarks the honourable member for Coolgardie to think ing that postal facilities have been withnot drawn from this district. township to which the honourable member referred. It had been found necessary prior to federation, by the State Postmasterthe General, to recommend that the office there should be reduced from an official to official office. The total revenue has fallen to £ 8 1 , and there is nothing to show customs. that the district cannot be as well served by a non-official office as by a permanent officer resident there. It is very certain that under of section 21 of the Public Service Act the Postmaster - General will have to ask whether he should continue to pay £ 1 1 0 exista year for the services of an official a place where the revenue onlj' amounts the to £ 8 1 , particularly considering that that rerevenue a few j'ears ago amounted to £ 1 1 2 . disThe honourable member for Canobolas maj' direcrest assured that when thelarge pastoral of areas to which he has referred become agrithat cultural areas-and I hope that will be a in the near future-if the revenue in creases the Postmaster-General will be forwarded happy to restore the official office.

562,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Even in New South Wales the proportion of the increase is not nearly so great as in South Australia. It may arise from contingencies which may not be recurring. As' this year's estimates for the Northern Territory have been separated, whilst those for last year were bunched together, it is quite impossible to pick out each particular item. Vote agreed to. Division 164 (Expenditure in Western Australia)-£261,607 .",87
563,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES," I have waited very patiently in the hope that something would be done in the direction of improvcentre ing the department in Western Austhe tralia. Sir GEORGE TURN BE - An inspector has been appointed for Western Australia under the Public Service Act, and he will deal with the whole matter.",87
564,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"Agai n and again matters have been brought up which, I am bound to say, have not been dealt with a very satisfactory way. At first I was inclined to blame the Deputy Postto master-General, but I am bound to say that I now consider the honourable learned gentleman at the head of this department is in some degree blameworthy for not doing a little more than what has been done to accomplish improvement. would be very hard, indeed, to strong a case with regard to the condition of postal affairs in Western Australia. Here is an extract taken from a sub-leader penditure. which appeared in a daily newspaper lished in Perth, and it is only one of complaints that are continually being urgedScarcely a day passes without the levelling of some serious complaint against the administration of the Postal department of the State. . . It was thought that the transference of the Postal department to Commonwealth control would be one of the most noticeable blessings that the State would receive from federation, the expectation being that our postal system would at once brought up to the same level as those the other States. No doubt this will be the ultimately, but up to the present time it would appear that the effect of federation has to make the postal authorities more careless than ever offcherequirements of the public. This is merely a sample of the general sumdo ming up by those who have been watchthe affairs of the Postal department in Western Australia. I shall detain the committee for only a very little while in giving one or two instances of what is yet being done there. I dare say that the Minister at the head of the department is fully aware of the peculiar conditions regarding postal development in Western Australia. It appears to me that the department is being starved in this connection in view of the estimated increase of our population as made by the Treasurer himself. Around Perth, in particular, new suburbs are growing up, but no adequate attempt is being made to increase the postal facilities in accordance with the increase of population. One of the suburbs-the suburb in which I reside-is Subiaco, which at its is somewhere about three miles from post-office at Perth. In the year 1900 it had a population of 2,000. At the present time it has a population of 4,500, and that, honourable members will admit, shows a very considerable increase for the period named. The municipal authorities of that suburb have written to the Postmaster General, and pointed out that they have in appealed time and again for an improvement of the postal facilities there. I wish emphasize one statement in the letter to the department, which is worthy of the and attention of the Government. They say that although the population has increased from 2,000 in 1900 to 4,500 in 1902, ""the staff in the post-office remains absolutely It the same."" The answer obtained from the state .too postal authorities is thatTo give the residents all the facilities they would wish would mean a large additional expubThat answer is given as if the expendimany ture would not be fully justified in the circumstances. Then a further statement is made of a most surprising character, namely, tliatThe same would be asked for on equally good grounds by a dozen other outlying suburbs of Perth and Fremantle. Surely if it is admitted that there are good grounds for these requests, the department should make some effort at least to overtake them. A little while ago a doctor commenced to practise his profession in another suburb. The telephone wire passed his door, and he asked to have his house connected. That request was refused. He could not obtain any satisfaction from the deputy Postmaster-General. He was determined to obtain telephonic communication, to which he had a perfect right, but before anything was done the secretary of the Perth Chamber of Commerce, the Premier of Western Australia, and finally I myself, had to take the matter up.",87
565,Mr SALMON,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,What was the reason for the failure of the department to do anything?,88
566,Mr EOWLER,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"I cannotgive the reason, but I propose to show how the work was eventually carried out. A reply was made to this effectYour telegram re complaint by Dr Darbyshire. - The Postmaster, Cottesloe, informs me his application dated 15th inst., und rent paid for months in advance from 1st June next. As he is a medical man he utilized portion of a dead wire with some old material and had him connected on the 1.9th. Surely that is not a condition of things that ought to exist in connection with this large and important department ? Surely it should not have been necessary for the department to obtain portion of a dead wire and some old material before a medical man's house could be connected with the telephone system which passed his door. Here is another complaint by a gentleman who lives a little over a mile from the Perth Townhall. He has telegrams sent occasionally to - his private residence, and in addition to the cost of transmitting a message, he is charged Is. for its delivery. I find that according to the regulations in Melbourne a telegram would be delivered over the same distance at a cost of 3d. There is a good road to this gentleman's house, and I fail to see that there is evidence of very much effort un the part of the department to obtain uniformity if at this period such a remarkable difference prevails with regard to the rates charged in the large cities of the Commonwealth. These are simply samples of numerous other cases which have been brought before me as having occurred in my own electorate. The same condition of affairs is prevailing throughout the whole of Western Australia. I would strongly urge the Government to take some steps to, place the department in Western Australia upon something like a commercial basis, That is all I ask, and I think sufficient patience has been exhibited in regard to these matters to justify an improvement at a very early date. I can assure the honor; able gentleman in charge of the department that I intend to see that something is done in the direction of remedying these legitimate grievances. My patience is now rapidly becoming exhausted, and I think I have shown that very strong reasons exist for a greater effort being made by the department in Western Australia to meet the re-; quirements of a permanently increasing community. There are one or two other matters with which I desire to deal, and which go to show the curious anomalies that exist within the department. There is not only an almost unanimous outcry on the part of the public against the management of the department' in Western Australia, but there is a condition of seething rebellion within the department itself. There are very few six of the different branches in which the employees are even reasonably satisfied. This state of affairs is largely owing to the many inconsistencies and anomalies which have existed up to the present time. I am expecting that under the commissioner and his inspectors these matters will be speedily righted. But In the meantime it is my duty to call the attention of the gentleman in charge of the depart 1 ment and of the commissioner' to a few of these anomalies. There seems to be no system, whatever regulating salaries, and particularly the salaries of officials in charge of post-offices. I have taken out some rather significant figures which I desire to lay before the committee. The town of Geraldton, with a population of 2,400, has a postmaster whose salary is £ 2 4 0 a year. The postmaster at Bunbury, with a similar population, receives £270. At Northam, with a population of 2,000, the postmaster receives £190i. At York, with a population of 1,300* the salary paid is £220. At Busselton, with a population of 452, the salary paid is £180. At Newcastle,, with a population of 339, the salary paid is £ 1 5 0 . My point is that these are old centres in Western Australia. 1 now quote some of the newer settlements.",88
567,Sir PHILIPFISH,COMMONWEALTHAND STATES,"H as the-honourable member any record of the money order and other departments connected with these post-offices, because they have an influence in regulating, the salaries 1 ' - Mr FOWLER - I have not that information, but I hold that the salary should bear some fair relation to the-population. I find that at Subioco, with a population of 4,500, the postmaster is paid only £ 1 6 5. At Helena Yale, or Midland Junction, with a population of 1,500, the salary paid is £ 1 8 0 ; and at Leederville, where there is a population of 2,500, the salary, paid is only £140. To compare two specific cases, the salary paid to the postmaster at Newcastle, with a population of 339, is £ 1 5 0 , whilst the postmaster at Leederville, with a population of 2,500, only gets £ 1 4 0 . I quote these figures as evidence of anomalies existing in Western Australia, which I . trust will soon be remedied by the Commissioner and his inspector. I should have dealt with a number of other matters showing the maladministration of . this department in this State; but as the Government are anxious to get through with 'their Estimates, I shall not labour the subject. I think I am fairly justified in asking that some attention shall be given to the conditions which I have indicated as prevailing in Western Australia, and. that some earnest effort shall be made at' an , early date to bring about some degree of improvement. Progress reported. ADDITIONAL ESTIMATES.
