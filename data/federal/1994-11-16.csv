2,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's report, incorporating two dissenting reports, of the committee entitled The 1993 federal election, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",11
3,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEES,I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report Leave granted.,11
4,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEES,"The 1993federal election, which is the committee's inquiry into the conduct of the 1993 federal election campaign and matters related thereto, has been tabled as an interim report in June on the present inquiry entitled Financial reporting by political parties. The government has now responded to the interim report and has recently introduced legislation to implement most of its recommendations. The report that I have just tabled records the findings of the committee on the criticisms and proposals for change that have been submitted to the inquiry based on the experience of the 1993 federal election. This covers all matters that were raised with the committee other than some aspects of election funding and financial disclosure which we intend to deal with in a further report, once we have had the benefit of the AEC report on funding and disclosure which is expected early in the new year. The committee is able to make a positive report on the operation of the electoral system and its administration by the AEC. Thb AEC provided an improved level of service at the 1993 election at a lower cost, in real terms, that in 1990. The use of revised polling place strategies and the adoption for the House of Representatives scrutiny of the two candidate preferred count virtually eliminated problems experienced at the 1990 election with queuing at polling places and slow results. The result of the House of Representatives election was predicted at a very early stage on election night. In our report we have recommended further improvements to the conduct of the Report two candidate preferred count. The report recommends refinements to many areas of the electoral system. Most of these proposals have the support of the whole committee. However there are differences of opinion on some matters of policy. My opposition colleagues and I have recorded dissents on several issues. The majority have concluded that changes to the existing enrolment procedures are not necessary because there is 'no objective evidence of widespread fraud'. The opposition members believe, however, that this conclusion is too complacent given evidence to the committee which revealed cases of multiple voting. We are also concerned that under the existing procedures there are opportunities for irregular and incorrect enrolment. Procedures to register as an elector are much less stringent than are required to open a bank account, register for social security or obtain a driving licence. Accordingly we have added a dissenting report recommending that individuals claiIping the right to enrol should be required to provide the AEC with proof of identity and evidence of age and citizenship by production of a birth certificate, passport or certificate of naturalisation. The committee is, however, agreed that the integrity of the electoral rolls is of central importance to the functioning of the system and acceptability of the electoral outcome. We would like to see a move away from the present arrangements which rely on a blitz on enrolments through habitation review just prior to an election. A better system would be one based on continuous roll review. In the view of myself and my opposition colleagues on the committee this would also obviate the need for the electoral rolls to remain open for to seven days after the election has been called, which is when many new enrolments and changed enrolments occur without any opportunity for checking. Opposition members of the committee also believe that there should be a move back the old system of electors voting only in electoral subdivision on polling day as believe that division-wide ordinary voting potentially facilitates multiple voting. The report makes various recommendations to help electors in remote locations. However, the government members of the committ-e parties have not gone as far as we would go to assist postal voters in remote areas. These. voters are offing. regularly disenfranchised because mfrequent mail delivery means that they cannot return their ballot papers in the time allowed for postal voting. The procedure used for most state and territory elections is to send to general postal voters in remote locations-that is 20 kilometres from a polling place-ballot p-pers rather than postal vote application forms as soon as an election is called. In our dissenting report, we recommend the Commonwealth should adopt this procedure. However, government members have qualified their support for this eminently sensible proposal by restricting the right to those general postal voters livirig 100 kilometres or more from a polling place, thus creating two classes of remote postal voters. The report acknowledges the importance electoral education by recommending a public vote. education campaign to improve electors' understanding of how preferential voting works. However, we do not support the majoas rity in the continued retention of section 329A of the Electoral Act, which makes it an offence, punishable by six months imprisonresearch ment, to advocate anything other than a full and consecutive preferential vote for the House. We believe this heavy-handed providuring sion is a denial of free speech. We of the opposition also believe that the provisions of the Electoral Act requiring truth in political advertising should be restor-d. Again we are joined in this by the Australtan Democrats and the Western Australian Cox, Greens. Government members of the committee Com:nonwealth's have taken the opportunity to reduce the minimum nomination period to a highly marginal five days in order to reduce the minimum election period from 33 to 28 days. to If adopted, the reduction in the - o-inat-on their period will cause. serious admm!strat-ve we difficulties, as we note in our dlssentmg report. There is no justifica-i-n for the P!Oposed reduction in the mlmmum election period. This proposal favours the government which is in the position to prepare for an election and launch it before opposition can fully prepare or, for that matter, even be aware that an election is in the The opposition members of the committee have also used the occasion to affirm in. our dissenting report our opposition to the concept of compulsory voting which, as well as be-g inconsistent with the notion of democratic freedom, has led to other evils, including pressure to oversimplify the electoral syst-m by the introduction of de"".ices to make vo-mg easy, such as ticket votmg. - ese deVices that diminish the value of the franchise. We also oppose the recommendation. to extend the franchise to those undergomg sentences of imprisonment for serious offences. We believe that this is morally wrong, as the punishment of a person who has committed a serious crime against society should include suspension of the ordinary privileges of attached to citizenship such as the right to Finally, I would like to thank all those who made submissions to the inquiry and appeared witnesses, in particular the officers of the Australian Electoral Commission. I thank the committee's secretary, Mr Donald Nairn, the officer, Mr Russell Chafer, the administrative assistant, Mrs Helen Fyfe, and the other staff who served the committee what has been a long and drawn-out inquiry. On behalf of the committee, I also take this opportunity to note our particular appreciation of the high quality advice from the Electoral Commissioner Mr Brian Cox. We thank Mr who has'recently announced his retirement for his distinguished service as the most senior electoral officer and for the support he has given to this committee during his period in office. T commend the report to the House.",11
5,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,"by leave - The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the Deputy Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, has outlined the thrust of the committee's report. I wish to concentrate on that area which the honourable member for Bradfield has concentrated on; namely, the dissenting report. I will do so very briefly. The thrust of the dissenting report is found on page 153 of the report, which reads: In Chapter Four of the report the majority concludes that changes to the existing electoral procedtained ures are not necessary because there is no ""objective evidence"" of widespread electoral fraud. We believe that this conclusion is too complacent given the evidence to the Committee which indicates cases of multiple voting (see paragraphs 4.2.4 and 4.2.8). We are also concerned that under the existing procedures there are opp'ortunities regular and incorrect enrolment. This assertion needs some careful analysis. The most appropriate starting point is the second paragraph of the report at page 1, which states: As at the close of rolls 11 339 849 electors were enrolled to vote. It goes on to say that an additional 9118 electors who turned 18 years of age before the day of the election subsequently enrolled. So there were over 11 million persons enrolled to vote. The report goes on to say that over 95.77 per cent of eligible voters did vote. So at the last election in 1993 over 11 million people were enrolled to vote and over 10 million people actually voted. In chapter 4 of the report we find the conclusion, which is based on the objective evidence presented to the committee, that there was no evidence of electoral fraud. The key paragraphs are paragraphs 4.24 to 4.28, which refer to detected cases of multiple voting. Paragraph 4.24 states: There were 14 172 ... letters sent out in 1993. That is, about 14,000 letters were sent out to those people whom it was believed ff1iY have engaged in multiple voting. It further states: Of the replies, 7173 revealed cases where the name of an apparent non-voter could be matched with the siplilar name . . . So, of the over 10 million people who voted out of over 11 million enrolled voters, there were 14,000-odd cases of possible multiple voting, with 7,000 apparent obvious explanations. The report comes to the conclusion, based on the ABC evidence, that of the entire number of cases of possible multiple voting 188 actually were referred to the Australian Federal Police. So, of the over 10 million people who actually voted out of over 11 million enrolled voters, 188 cases were referred to the Federal Police as a result of possible multiple voting. So what is at the heart of this dissenting report? It is not susby the objective evidence. The heart of the dissenting report is found in a paragraph on page 153, which states: The current arrangements stress the obligation which proceeds from compulsory voting. We propose that compulsory voting be abolished so that the franchise again becomes the valued right of the for ir- free citizen in an open society. So the dissenting report, which is supported by those opposite, is basically a call for the abolition of compUlsory voting. Why are those opposite calling for compulsory voting to be abolished? It is not backed up by any of the objective evidence; it is backed up by what they believe in. After the 1992 Liberal Party state conference in Western Australia, the West Australian in August 1992 contained an article entitled 'Plan to end forced voting', which states: -. The Liberal Party's annual state conference yesterday backed the call to end compulsory voting in state and federal elections. The article goes on to refer to the president of the Canning division of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, Mrs Ricky Johnston, who has been a candidate for the seat of Canning on two or three occasions. The article states that the president of the Canning division, Mrs Ricky Johnston, said: A compulsory system meant ""dregs of society"" got a say whereas with voluntary voting only those who were interested actually cast a vote. Those opposite actually believe that those people who vote against them are 'dregs of society'. The real complaint in the dissenting report is that they lost the election. They think . they lost the election because their so-called 'dregs of society' are actually entitled to vote. Let us look at some proper, decent analysis. We only have to go to an article by Gerard Henderson in the Sydney Morning Herald of Tuesday, 15 November to find out why those opposite lost the last election and why their so-labelled 'dregs of society' vote against them. Henderson is the historian of those opposite. His book which I have here entitled Menzies' Child: the Liberal Party of Australia: 1944-1994 should be read by those opposite; its analysis is worth more to them than the standing committee's dissenting report. The article written by Henderson is entitled 'Outdated Liberals out of tune with the voters'. It states: Certainly most of Alexander Downer's wounds are of the self-inflicted variety. However, in this is not alone. Every Liberal leader in the last dozen years has made at least one terminal political error-including Malcolm Fraser ... Henderson then goes on to make the key point: Rather than contemplating yet another leadership change, the Liberals in Canberra should be focussing on what are the cultural and organisational reasons for ongoing political failure. In his lively critique Is The Party Over? ... Christopher Puplick argues that ""Australian society and the Federal Liberal Party are no longer moving in the same direction or at the same pace"". Henderson then goes on to illustrate a range of reasons why that is the case. The opposition ought to concentrate on bringing itself into the modem Australia and not try to pretend that there is widespread electoral fraud when there is not; and not try to pretend that people vote against it because, as it labels them, they are 'the· dregs of society'. The opposition should understand that the real problems highlighted by its dissenting report are reflected by the fact that it is an outmoded, outdated, irrelevant institution in Australian society.",13
6,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I commend to everybody-the press, the public and honourable members-this excellent report entitled The 1993 federal election, which contains some very interesting reading on the electoral system in this country. It has been past practice on both sides of politics to try to agree, as much as possible, on the content of reports. As we can see from the presentation of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), it has been difficult to do so from the coalition's point of view on this occasion, and we have a rather lengthy dissenting report. Because of severe time restraints, I will limit my comments to one particular section. Paragraph 6.4.1 on page 94 relating to general postal voters states: Electors who live more than 20 kilometres from a polling place can register as General Postal voters. The register is reviewed at least once every 18 months, and it concerns only about 9,500 voters-less than one-tenth of one per cent of the Australian voting population. When an he election is called the procedure is for these people, if registered, to be automatically sent postal vote application forms. If they are on a weekly mail service, they receive the forms, fill them in, sign them and send them back. Ballofpapers are then sent out to them. They fill those in, sign them and send them back. Once the ballot papers have been received, the signature is checked against the application for registration: Some people receive only one mail service a week. This government has just knocked back an Industry Cortunission recommendation that people in remote areas should get at least two mail services a week. If for some reason they miss their weekly mail service-it has rained and the roads are cut or they are out mustering-they cannot get their vote in. Paragraph 6.43 in the body of this report in regard to voting states: While this poses no problem for electors with regular mail delivery, there are electors in remote areas who are regularly disenfranchised by the current procedures. At present, the period between close of nominations and polling day can be as few as 22 days. In many remote areas of Australia the turn-around time for mail can be a week or more, meaning that the process of receiving and returning a P9stal vote application, and then receiving and returning ballot papers, can take up to a monthtoo long in many cases for electors in remote areas to have their votes ·counted. . What is this government going to do? It is going to reduce the minimum election period from 33 days to 28 days, which means that many more of these people will be disenfranchised. There were 10 submissions, out of 152, put to this inquiry that were particularly concerned with this point, including a submission from the Electoral Commission itself and the electoral commissions in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. This government, I am sad to say, has ignored that. There is a solution. Paragraph 6.44 of the report states: The AEC and others submitted that the best solution would be to adopt the practice of some State and Territory electoral authorities and matically send electors in remote areas their ballot papers when an election is called. This would remove two steps . . . and would thereby give remote General Postal Voters more time to register their votes with the AEC. Such a reform would have the added attraction of eliminating confusion caused by differing State and federal procedures. It goes on to say that a pJ;.ecedent does exist because there are general postal voters, by virtue of being infirm and unable to sign documents, who automatically receive ballot papers when an election is called. In New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, people over 20 kilometres from a polling place who are registered are automatically sent voting papers. As the AEC has said, there has never been a case of fraud identified yet from that system. In fact, the integrity of the system is higher than that of a normal vote because the signature is checked off against one on an application form. All we have now is confusion between the states and the federal government. This committee has made a recommendation that we have two categories of registered postal voters, which I think is a recipe for disaster. A recommendation of the AEC states that the introduction of such a proposal: . .. would continue to adversely affect registered general postal voters in remote areas . . . would also be likely to add to voter confusion by introducing another difference between federal and State voting procedures . . . would appear to be grade step ... It also says: Evidence from the Northern Territory strongly supports the proposition that the distance of the ejector's residence from a polling place or mobile polling station is not a relevant factor in an elector's access to sufficiently frequent and dependablemail services. ' It goes on to say: . . . the situation is exacerbated if electors are working (eg mustering) during the election period and miss the consignment of mail in their weekly service ... Again the relevant issue is the frequency of the mail service. The AEC goes on to say: From an administrative viewpoint, there would no longer beautoif we brought ourselves into line with the statesthe need for the current double-handling process of issuing a postal vote application followed by a postal vote certificate when the required declarations have already been made in applying for general postal voter status. The adoption of such a proposal would also achieve estimated savings of around $40,000 in the overall cost of an election. So there is overwhelming evidence that such a recommendation should be made. Yet this government has made an outrageous and stupid recommendation, deliberately ignoring the advice of the AEC, and is cynically misusing the electoral system to disadvantage country voters.",14
7,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"by leave-There are only a couple of matters that I wish to raise in speaking to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and they involve ttfe compulsory system of voting and full preferential voting. They are two concepts and two principles that I wholeheartedly support. I believe we in Australia have one of the best electoral systems in the world. We have one of the best participation rates in the world as, far as the general public is concerned. I will quote some figures concerning the last two elections later. This is the second report I have participated in which comments on the results of elections. After I was elected in 1990, I was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral a retro- Matters which commented on the 1990 election, where there were some problems with I queuing. The committee made a number of recommendations in relation to that matter and other matters. There is no doubt that that improved the electoral process for the 1993 election. The problem of queuing was largely overcome, amongst other things. There is no doubt that the dissenting reports in this report are really based on policy considerations. I believe we have a system that can withstand scrutiny and a system of the utmost integrity. I think that is shown in the closeness of the last election and in the fact that that result has been widely accepted. It was a result in which the electorate participated. When we compare the 1990 election with the 1993 election, we see that, in 1990, 10,225,800 people registered first preferences fqr the House of Representatives. That is 95.32 per cent of eligible voters-an outstanding participation rate by the community. That was increased in 1993 when 10,900,861 people voted-95.75 per cent. Again we recommend a continuing education program by the Australian Electoral Commission. We must compare that participation rate with the participation rate in America or in the United Kingdom where only about 50 per cent of the voter population turns out. In a close election result, you could get a party forming government that has only about 25 per cent of the voting population voting for That leads to problems. My theory is that it leads to other forms of protest such as riots and people not accepting those in power. By having a compulsory system of voting we are encouraging people to participate and to come along and register their protests through the ballot box rather than through some other means. That is one of the reasons this country has a stable political environment and that there is a general acceptance of the voting system. Voters can certainly come along and register an informal vote if they want. What happened in the last two elections is that people exercised greater caution and tried to register a valid vote. In 1990, the number of informal votes was 3.19 per cent ofthose who voted, whereas in 1993 the number of informal votes came down to 2.97 per cent. I think that says something. It shows that there is an acceptance of the compulsory voting system and people are trying to get it right in their candidate. If people did not agree with compulsory voting they would come along and register an informal vote and we would see the informal vote skyrocket as a form of protest. That is not what has happened. In recent campaigns, the number of informal votes has been coming down. That is a good thing. The other thing that is important is the full preferential system of voting. It enables people to register a protest with a minority party and then come back to the mainstream parties. We do not have the situation that is developing in the United Kingdom and that will develop in other countries where they have a first past the post voting system and they get parties forming government when they have only 35 per cent or 40 per cent of the vote. Here people can register a vote for a minor party and it comes back to the mainstream parties. Normally, the party with more than 50 per cent of the vote is ,elected to government. With some minor exceptions that has occurred. One notable exception was the failure of the Whitlam led opposition in 1969, which received well over 50 per cent of the vote, it. to obtain government. Those sorts of quirks in the system can happen. That situation is not going to be enhanced by having non-compulsory voting or optional preferential voting. My message to the parliament is that this examination of the last election shows that we can certainly refine the system around the edges to try to encourage more people to vote in a formal manner and to assist them to vote-and we are talking particularly of rural Australians, people from Aboriginal communities, and remote Australians. This report shows that there is a bit of ignorance out there in the community and there are the occasional redneck radio commentators who try to impugn the electoral process and run their own agendas. When the system is put under the microscope it comes up trumps. This report shows that we have a good electoral system. I commend the report to the parliament. Again, it highlights how we are picking leading the world when it comes to the conduct of elections.",15
8,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,"by leave- Mr Speaker, I welcome the fact that you are in the chair during this significant debate on a matt-r that is fundamental to democracy in Australia. I wish to make a brief speech about the report of the Joint Standing Committee on EleCtoral Matters. I have some very fixed views on the issue of voluntary voting. The report reminds us that fraud was not a significant factor in past elections. I believe that is probably true simply because there is a compulsory system of voting. I am a bit disappointed that the member for Perth(Mr Stephen Smith) decided to pickon the evidence of an individual person who said that one side of politics might be alittle less intelligent than the other. There is no evidence of that. I do not subscribe to that theory. It is not that many years ago that in Western Australia we had voluntary voting in the upper house. It Wag the Liberals who changed that. One reason we did that was that there was fairly good evidence that Labor voters could be better organised to attend to the polls than Liberal voters and compulsion was a policy that was of some benefit. I served for 16 years in Western Australian local government where, of course, as in most states, voting is voluntary. Quite often you find that getting people to vote is an extremely difficult issue. I might add that I used. to achieve a voting turnout of 80 or 90 per cent because everybody came out to vote when I stood-not always for me; there were those who had a commitment to voting against me. That points to something in the system: if you have a sufficiently controversial candidate, you will always get the voters coming out in number. I was rather proud of that-that I never ever won an election uncontested, and usually there was a large group opposing me. I used to like the fact that I always won. Having made that point, I wish to make a couple of remarks about the system, particularly in response to the remarks by the member for Perth, who I thought might have avoided the opportunity to have. that little There will always be people who nmke those sorts of digs. He has been a state secretary of the Labor Party, and I am just giving him a little dig back. I remind him that there is an old saying: vote early, vote often. That in itself can be used as a criticism if we choose. Also, as to the extent to which fraud might exist even at this time, we are now in the arena of data processing and databases. For instance, any political party wishing to corrupt the system which can get hold of a list of members of a religious group which currently, today, is classified as a conscientious objector-its members refuse to vote-can use those names to vote, without any severe risk of being caught. I have heard stories of how, in the old days of local government, there would be candidates with a truckload of suits out in the back· room; .certain people would come in, swap a suit and vote, and then come back in, swap a suit and vote again. Nobody has been able to tell me, in fact, that that did riot occur-and we. have opposite another spokesman who has had a bit of background in or may still have connections with local government. Those are the issues. Once we move to a voluntary system, it will not take long to establish a database on people who regularly do not vote. If you wish to move in that direction, there will be an obligation .to give people some form of identification-which I think the American system has-where you have to prove who you are. Nevertheless, I believe that, because of changing times and the ·fact that political parties, if they choose, can obtain information on people, as"",I said, who might be conscientious objectors, a situation exists even today where we are very close to the need to have some form of identification of a person's right to vote. Of course, I am an adamant opponent of the type of identity card that has been proposed, not on the basis of its nature as an identity card but because of how some people have proposed using it. That is the great downside of those sorts of things. In confronting this issue, my grave fear has always been the potential for fraud. Whilst one could argue who might do that best, in the end both sides would be in it. It would be dig. a very unsavoury situation and one in which I would prefer not to participate, having always said in this place, 'You make the rules, I'll play the game.' But, on the. other hand, we can avoid that in this regard. Some of my colleagues would disagree with me. I understand all of the other arguments. I often say to people in my party that, when one talks about commitment to vote, I recognise the grave apathy which there is in our party and in the Labor Party, but I recognise the lack of it in the lunatic fringe. I worry sometimes that, through the absolute commitment of the lunatic fringe and the apathy of others, we may find the wrong sorts of people representing our interests in places such as this. Nevertheless, in closing, I make a comment on preferential voting. I always had a reasonably open mind on preferential voting until I heard a lady make a statement on the radio one day. She said, 'I, as a supporter of a major party, get one vote; all the supporters of minority parties get two or three.' I guess you can attack the logic of that in various ways. But it is a fact that, as you vote for some of the minority parties, you find yourself in a situation where you are actually allowed to second-guess. I thought that was restricted to the quizzes of the ABC. However, that is an issue. If I had to choose between voluntary voting and preferential voting, if one had to go, I would let preferential voting go. I am not convinced that it gives us good government. It might be time to put down a minimum primary vote for the Senate. Such a requirement is not unusual. The South Africans decided on that just recently in writing a brand new constitution. I just cannot understand why, when someone needs 35 per cent of the vote to win an election under a firstpast-the-post system, we let control of the Senate rest with people who have been elected with a two per cent primary vote that is built on by picking up all the scraps left when quotas are filled. I am a bit inclined towards winner take all, to tell the truth. It is time the major parties had a look at that. I do not think they ever will, because in the end they would rather see somebody with a very small political base running the country in an effective way. My view is that we might be better to say that one has to get a minimum primary vote in the Senate before one can participate in the distribution of preferences. That is an issue people should look at. I would rather the government had the right to pass some of its more silly legislation, because I am sure it would get us into government a lot quicker. In fact, we so often save the government from itself that it is not funny. If one looks purely at the operation of government, there should be every opportunity for those who win the House of Representatives to win the Senate, if they can; but certainly we should not have the Senate controlled by people who have no seats in the House of Representatives. Then, as I said, the people would get the government they deserved. In that situation I would advise people very strongly always to vote for us because they would get much better, much more mature and much more sympathetic government, particularly from me. I apologise for that levity at the end of my contribution. I think this matter is very serious. I nevertheless welcome the report and the hard work that people have done. Both political parties have a responsibility to look very closely at the temptation to defraud the existing system. I hope it is not being defrauded. Motion (by Mr Cobb)-by leave-proposed: That the House take note of the report. Debate (on motion by Mr Snowdon) adjourned. RACIAL HATRED BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 November, on motion by Mr Lavarch: That the bill be now read a second time.",17
9,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"Werriwa) (10.08 a.m.)Racial tolerance is an essential part of any civilised community. In a multicultural nation such as Australia, it must be an essential part of our values, our aspirations and the laws of the nation. The Racial Hatred Bill is an effective safeguard against extreme acts of racial intolerance. It amends the Crimes Act to make it a criminal offence to threaten physical violence or the destruction of property because of the victim's racial background. The bill also amends the Racial Discrimination Act to allow the victims of humiliating or intimidating racist behaviour to complain to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This civil remedy involves, in the first instance, conciliation but, if that fails, the possibility of compensation orders. This bill fulfils Australia's international responsibilities under the 1966 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Article 4 of the convention obliges parties to: . .. declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin . . . The Senate removed this provision from the Whitlam government's Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Since then, 80th sides of the chamber have promised to either restore the provision or not oppose its restoration. Sometimes in politics, however, progress takes a long time. In the final days of the last parliament, the government introduced the Racial Discrimination Legislation Amendment Bill, which lapsed at the 1993 election. I am delighted that the government, through the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch), has now brought to the chamber this legislation to ensure that racial violence and racial vilification are outlawed in each of the states in Australia. This is indeed landmark legislation. It represents an important landmark in Australia's transformation from an inward looking, monocultural society to an outward looking, tolerant, confident, multicultural society. Speaker after speaker in this debate has praised the way in which Australia leads the world in the 1990s in tolerance and multiculturalism. That much is absolutely true, but I would like to place this debate in an historical context through an understanding of how in Australia tolerance and multiculturalism has not always been a feature of our society. In the last century and in the first half of this century, Australian society displayed some of the most unacceptable features of monoculturalism and racial intolerance. Those of us who understand that history will appreciate the need to be vigilant in this nation to make sure that those values of Australian tolerance and egalitarianism are expressed in a multicultural society in the fashion envisaged by this legislation. I refer members on both sides of the House to Elaine Thompson's excellent social history of Australia, published earlier this year, entitled Fair enough: egalitarianism in Australia. It states: Australia had an egalitarian cult. That much we know and take for granted, yet there are paradoxes and contradictions within the cult that have gone unacknowledged and unexamined. Australia's egalitarianism was about much more than social manners. Part of it involved the simple idea of sameness. It portrayed Australians as a homogeneous people, whose dominant characteristic was that they were British. From first white settlement Australia was committed to 'Anglo' values, interests, institutions and cultural perspectives. That egalitarian sense of sameness had profound effects, both positive and negative. It helped democratise Australia's political system but it also created the White Australia Policy . . . It also suppressed and denied the diverse cultural heritage of many Australians . . . It is now an unhappy recorded fact of Australian history that for decades-indeed for more than a century-Aboriginal people in this nation were the subject of consistent racism, abuse and occasional genocide. It is now an unhappy recorded fact of our history that in the 1870s the .gold rush produced enormous racial violence towards and vilification of Chinese people in Australia. The antipathy towards the Chinese was to flourish beyond the goldfields. They were resented, threatened and bashed. On occasions they w-re massacred. It is now, unhappily, a recorded fact of Australian history that even in this century the wave of Australian migration was accompanied by acts of racial violence and vilification against southern European migrants after World War H. Even after the time of the Federation, Australians saw themselves as a white island continent, isolated in the Pacific from the rest , of the white race and constantly under threat from non-whites. This produced a whole range of xenophobic features within our national institutions and national laws. Indeed, one of the first acts of this parliament was to institutionalise racist immigration policies in the White Australia policy. . The first official census conducted soon after Federation claimed falsely that 98 per cent of Australian inhabitants were British or of British stock. This myth of Anglo-Celtic racial homogeneity in Australia was perpetuated for more than 50 years. At the beginning of this century and for decades that followed, Australian politics and Australian institutions were geared around this idea of an inward looking, monocultural society that brought with it some very unfortunate features of racial violence and racial vilific-tion. This legislation is an important landmark in Australian politics and Australian social history because it says that Australia no longer regards those sorts of attitudes and forms of social intolerance and racism as acceptable. We are embracing in the 1990s all the best values of tolerance and multiculturalism. With this bill the government is providing an effective safety net that entrenches those values and attitudes in our society, offering a safeguard to people who may be the subject of racial violence and racial vilification. Looking at the historical perspective, I note that even my own party, in this matter, is not without fault. The fact that Australia is a multicultural society in .the 1990s is the product of post-World War II migration. But even that migration program was inspired by a fear of isolation and a fear of Australia's place in the world. In 1947 the Labor Minister for Immigration, Arthur Calwell, announced that Australia had '25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down on us'. That was the attitude that underscored the migration program leading to Australia's tolerant multicultural society in the 1990s, but it has taken a very important transformation of our values to bring it about. For so much of our history, Australian egalitarianism in social mannerisms was expressed with an inward looking monocultural focus. But we have been very fortunate in the 1970s, the 1980s and now the 1990s-through legislation, changes in. social attitude, education programs and all the tolerance and understanding of our society-to turn this focus around into the tolerance and outward looking confidence of multiculturalism. This landmark legislation builds on this achievement and entrenches those values into the statute books of the Commonwealth. It recognises that it is part of Australia's laconic and easygoing character and an expression of our egalitarianism to have these forms of racial tolerance. Most Australians do not pass judgment or express intolerance on the basis of race, colour, creed and culture. Yet a small minority of racists and racist organisations do express and seek to incite racial intolerance and hatred. We need to be vigilant in these matters, understanding the racial intolerance, vilification and violence of a small minority in Australia and also understanding that, in the broad sweep of Australian history, there have been some unfortunate characteristics of racism that at one time held the majority. In Australia in the 1990s, we do not have Le Pen or the re-emergence of the fascist movement that has been seen in recent years in Europe. But we do have the League of Rights and we do have in election campaigns organisations, such as the Australians Against Further Immigration, which run their campaigns on a racist platform. There is a by-election campaign now under way in the division of Kooyong, vacated by Andrew Peacock, where unfortunately the Australians Against Further Immigration are using as their first plank and platform the racial background of the Liberal candidate. This is a shameful piece of Australian political behaviour. It is shameful by anyone who practises it. It is shameful by anyone involved in that campaign. I had an experience in the Werriwa by-election earlier this year when the Australians Against Further Immigration contested that campaign. These people distributed blatantly our racist material, trying to link migration with some of the worse health problems in Australia and targeting certain racial groups to serve their own prejudices and play on some of the worse fears and insecurity of a minority in the electorate. Happily, they were easily defeated. Three major reports since 1991 have highlighted the need for vigilance and legislation against racial hatred in Australia. The first was the report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, published in April 1991. It found that racist violence, including intimidation and harassment, remains a problem for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; that practices pervade some Australian institutions, both private and public; that racist violence also occurs on the basis of ethnic identity; and that the existence of a threatening environment is the most prevalent form of racist violence confronting people of non-English speaking backgrounds simply because they are visibly different. The report was followed by the findings the Royal Commission intQ Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which was also released in 1991. It recommended that governments legislate proscribe racial vilification and provide a ciliation mechanism for dealing with comour society. plaints of racial vilification. The third report was in 1992 by the Australian Law Reform Commission on multiculturalism and the law. The majority of the commission also supportThe ed making racial vilification unlawful. These three reports confirm the need for vigilance, a safeguard and a safety net to placed in the statute books of the Commongood. wealth. It is to the Attorney-General's credit that he is acting on the reports, understanding that there is still in Australia engages in racial violence and racial vilification. Indeed, last night in debate, the honourtion able member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holdregulations, ing) provided recent instances in his electorate of acts of racial violence and vilification against the Jewish community. We need to vigilant in all these matters. The parliament also needs to understand two important issues in this debate. The first concerns states rights. It is better to have against racial vilification in some parts of Australia than nowhere in the the less, it is inconsistent and inadequate that the rights of Australians under such laws should vary from state to state. This can bp left as a question of states rights; it national responsibility of this parliament and government to enact laws to prevent racial violence and vilification in our society. Racial vilification does not depend on where people live. Racial vilification can cross state boundaries. Invariably in the electronic media it does. For that reason, these responsibilities cannot be left to the states. They need to be acted on by the national racist attitudes and parliament. Racial vilification has been illegal in New South Wales since 1989, in Western Australia since 1990 and in Queensland and the ACT since 1991. A racial and religious vilification bill was introduced by the Kirner government before the last Victorian election, but it has not been revived by the Kennett government. There is no law against racial vilification in of South Australia, Tasmania or the Northern Territory. This bill covers the gaps. It produces national consistency where it is needed to most to provide a safeguard, entrenching the convalues of tolerance and multiculturalism in The second issue, which has been raised frequently by opposition members during this debate, is the question of freedom of speech. High Court recently established an implied constitutional guarantee of free speech but also ruled that at times free speech be should be restricted for the greater public That is"""" there is in Australia, as with every other country, no unrestricted right to say or publish anything regardless of the harm a minority which it may cause. We have laws in Australia against defamaand obscenity. There are broadcasting consumer protection laws and criminal laws about counselling others to commit a crime, all of which can be seen as be restrictions on absolute freedom of speech. The only institutions in this country that have absolute freedom of speech are the parliaments of the nation. But outside the parlialaws ments, as a product of the laws of those parliaments, there are restrictions on absolute natio,B. Nonefreedom of speech. A restriction against incitements to racial violence and vilification is totally valid to never ensure not so much absolute freedom of is a speech but fair speech, consistent with the values of tolerance and understanding. Presently in Australia, if someone incorrectly claims in public that you are a thief and a liar, the law allows you to sue that person and claim compensation for the harm caused by those words. However, if someone uses words to inflict or incite racial hatred on you, in some states the law offers no protection or source of redress. This bill overcomes that inconsistency. It provides a safety net for racial harmony in Australia as both a warning to those who might attack the principle of tolerance and an assurance to their potential victims. There is no absolute freedom of speech in Australia because of those other restricting laws. This is a provision for fair speech, consistent with proper Australian values in the 1990s. It is most unfortunate that opposition members do not acknowledge these facts. It is very unfortunate to see the backdown by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) on this matter-a backdown to appease rednecks in his own party and the National Party. On 26 June this year, published in the Australian Jewish News, the Leader of the Opposition had this to say: Where there is incitement to violence or to damaging property on the basis of race, then there's question that should be a criminal offence. If he really believed what he said on 26 June, he should be supporting this legislation and ensuring that the coalition parties give it unanimous support in this chamber. It is a nonsense to say that opposition members support absolute freedom of speech when, consistently, they recognise the need for defamation and obscenity regulations and consumer protection laws in this country. This is a political fix of the worse kind by the opposition and its leader-selling out principles of tolerance to sort out a political problem for the coalition, caving into the people whom this week in the national media the Leader of the Opposition called the rightwing freaks and right-wing fringe dwellers in his own party and the National Party. No leader of a party should ever cave into rightwing freaks and fringe dwellers. The problem for the coalition is that racism is part of the culture of the Liberal and National parties. National Party members of parliament use racist language in and around their electorates. That is no secret in this parliament. We need only go to the words of the leader of the National Party in New South Wales, Ian Armstrong, who at a rally in Queanbeyan on 29 January 1988 had this to say: We've got to get rid of crime, drugs, hoons and coons. That is the sort of language leaders of the National Party use in public debate at public rallies. It is the sort of language that is very common among National Party and redneck Liberal Party members in their electorates. They traffic and trade in racism around their electorates to put down the rights of Aboriginal people and put down the rights of anyone who challenges their old-fashioned attachment to homogeneity on racial grounds, the old fashioned style of a monocultural Australian society.· The parliament need only look at the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in the Liberal Party to understand his form of racial violence and vilification. It was using an iron bar. That was his style of contribution.",18
10,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a no point of order. The member well knows that what he has just said is a gross contravention of the standing orders in reflecting on the member for O'Connor. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to ask him to withdraw what is a highly offensive remark.",22
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Nehl)Since the honourable member for Moore finds the remark offensive, would you withdraw it?",22
12,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEES,"Well, it is a recorded fact in the media but, if it causes offence, I will withdraw it. The truth is that the Liberal Party member opposite-having opposed native title for Aboriginal people on racial grounds and believing that Aboriginal people are not qualified to make decisions about the use of land and native title-knows full well that racist language is the stock in trade of the Western Australian Liberal Party. Racist policies reflect the ideas and ideals they consistently bring to this parliament and to their own party forums. Racist and paternalistic language is the stock in trade of the tory establishment in this country-the Melbourne and Adelaide clubs-and among fellow travellers like Joan Sutherland who support the monarchy. She was offended by being interviewed for a passport by Chinese and Indian post office employees. That is so typical of tory values and attitudes. (Time expired)",22
13,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"It is interesting that every time we have a debate over a piece of legislation, without fail-you could almost time it for its consistencyLabor Party members come in and accuse the opposite side of being racist. They cannot avoid it. I think this is some deep-seated for the fact that the ALP has been one of the most racist organisations in this country's history. Let me tell the member opposite that the campaign genius from the Northern Territory, the man who single-handedly delivered government to the Country-Liberal leagueMr Snowdon-Do you remember Ridge?",23
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Nehl)Order!,23
15,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,The man whose campaign organisationsMr Snowdon-Let me tell you about it.,23
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! The honourable member for Moore will resume his seat. The parliamentary secretary will restrain himself. If you wish to enter the debate, there is a time and place for it.",23
17,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"The Labor Party carried the White Australia policy until the 1960s. It was a central part of its policy platform. There was a good, logical reason for its racism. Back in the early history of Australiaparticularly colonial history-members of the Labor Party were concerned that their jobs would be at stake if there was widespread immigration into this country. That is why at all stages of Australian history where there has been racist legislation, or certainly intent in legislation, you can see the AU's hand behind it. Essentially, racism in Australia has revolved around the ALP's function within this nation. In opening my contribution to the debate on this bill I want to talk about another type of vilification, bigotry and bias; that is, the comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Prime Minister talks about racial vilification. In his own tainted and twisted mind he sees Australia divided into various classes, and he perpetuates and encourages class vilification-hatred of one Australian against another. Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order concerning relevance. This is a bill concerning racial vilification laws. It has absolutely nothing to do with other questions of class or the words of the Prime guilt Minister that have so upset the member for Moore. It is about racial vilification-no other form of vilification.",23
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! There is no point ,of order. In your own contribution you took a very wide-ranging approach.",23
19,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"Let us take a few examples of the eloquent language of the Prime Minister, a person renowned for his use of very torrid and hard-hitting language in this chamber. Certainly, in the case of some of his utterances, he stands one Australian against another or vilifies one particular group of Australians for his own purposes. On 22 March 1988 the Prime Minister said: They have spent all their years trying to look after the eastern and northern suburbs of Sydney. It is the same in Me}oourne. They have always looked after the toffs. That is why they left the tax system open to massive criminal evasion for yearsbecause they knew their crowd were all climbing through it. These are the Prime Minister's words; this is the gentleman who has just purchased a $2 112 million home, attacking one group of Australians. For what reason? It is only for his own political purposes. I have here a quote from a debate in which the parliamentary secretary who has left the chamber, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), participated. On 22 May 1992 the Prime Minister said: And who is doing it? Not the people from the western districts or the Toorak blue bloods or even our mate over here from South Australia, but a couple of scrubbers from Western Sydney who basically have taken out Liberal Party tickets and have said, 'Right, we are now in the Establishment and we have been fitted up for the pinstripe suits; let's get our boots out into the ordinary people'. More vilification. On 12 May 1993 he said: I obviously struck pay dirt yesterday with that little answer, because here they are, the toffs, as usual, saying, 'Well, look, if we have got it in Bellevue Hill and Vaucluse, or if we have got it in the lower North Shore and Toorak, who cares about Forbes, Junee, Wagga, Canowindra or rural Queensland? Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The opposition member may well be obsessed with the Prime Minister and his personality, like so many of his colleagues are, but it has got absolutely nothing to do with racial vilification or this legislation.",23
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,There is no point of order. I would remind the honourable member about the penalties that are attached to frivolous points of order.,24
21,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"On 24 March 1994, more recently, he said: As I said the other day, they are being replaced by fogies-a fogy being a person who is attached to old values and old norms that are now irrelevant. It is true to say that we are seeing a combination of old fogies and young fogies but, nevertheless, 24-carat fogies. In a debate on 10 October 1994 the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) said: For you it is the Adelaide Club test, so pass that one. We have a range of vilifying comments from the Prime Minister-the one person who has been touting himself around the country as being somebody who is bringing Australia together, particularly through the introduction of this legislation. He is trying to pass himself off as someone who is going to protect particular communities within the nation. I can assure the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) that, in stark contrast to the ALP, the federal Liberal and National parties are totally opposed to racism of any form, wherever it rears its odious head. It should not be an issue in any way. In particular, racism should not be a means of putting one side against another to obscure the points being made by members in the debate. The Australian community as a whole, including those Australians of overseas origin from non-English speaking backgrounds, know this full well. The coalition, in contrast to the ALP, has a record second to none in this area. It was Harold Holt's coalition government in March 1966 that abolished once and for all the White Australia policy-a decision which enabled the welcome inflow of so many people from such a wide range of ethnic and racial backgrounds, and since then including people from Asian nations particularly, especially China and Vietnam. This nation is blessed with one of the most diverse, tolerant and cohesive multicultural societies on earth. The Prime Minister's Racial Hatred Bill is a political stunt which could damage the fabric of our society by encouraging intolerance and confrontation between different sections of the Australian community, particularly those from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds. These sections of the Australian community along with all Australians rejoice in the freedom of speech, thought and expression that is an integral part of our vibrant democracy. The coalition will have no part in threatening or curbing these fundamental underpinnings of the Australian way of life. The coalition's decision to oppose the Keating Racial Hatred Bill was taken after full consultations with leaders of a wide range of ethnic communities. Those consultations revealed, quite rightly, a widespread concern that the government's bill was unnecessary, divisive and potentially counterproductive to social cohesion, tolerance and diversity and that the draconian racial hatred legislation of the nature proposed by the Prime Minister is not the right course for Australia. They reject strongly the notion that people can be gaoled for expressing their opinion. Let me point out to the members opposite that many of these people came to live in Australia precisely to escape those very concepts. Many came during times of great oppression and suppression of freedom of speech in their former countries. One of the things they found so inviting and attractive about this nation was its tolerance-the ability of people to express themselves, obviously within the parameters of a decent society, that expression of freedom of speech being protected at law. There is a fundamental difference, as we all acknowledge, between expressing an opinion, however odious, and threatening violence to personal property. The latter has always been and remains totally offensive and unacceptable. One of the aspects of this bill that is of concern is that it may well risk the right of sections of our community who have come from overseas countries of origin to continue their often vigorous rejoicing in their cultural history and heritage and the debates that arise from them. Rallies, for instance, by Greek, Cypriot, Turkish, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Bunnese, Tibetan, Chinese, Albanian, former Yugoslavia republic, Arabic, Indian subcontinent and African communities could become subject to prosecution under the bill. Even the use of historic symbols, insignia or flags could become subject to prosecution. Certain clergy, for example, Jewish Greek, Buddhist, Maronite and Islamic, could also face the risk of prosecution in certain circumstances. Without exception ethnic communities in this nation believe that widespread multipronged educational strategies are of the highest priority. Education attacks the cause of racism; legislation does not. The coalition totaily shares this view. For this reason we have announced that the coalition will support a $10 million education campaign. The full details of this campaign we finalised after extensive consultations with ethnic communities. The coalition has already benefited from discussions with several of the larger communities. The campaign will be directed towards schools and other education institutions and the wider community. Amongst other things, the campaign will enable community workers and community leaders to better assist their members resolve racial incidents and understand their rights, particularly for recently arrived older migrants of non-English speaking background. The campaign will also address the extensive ignorance and lack of understanding of ethnic communities in Australia that exists in various quarters, particularly in some sections of the ¥stralian media. We need to look at exactly what this bill does. The bill has two parts: it contains l criminal provisions which allow people to be sent to prison and it contains civil provisions which allow a person who objects to a racist remark to take the person who made the remark to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In both parts of the bill it is quite clear that the government has gone way over the top. In the introductory summary, the government bill goes much further th,an is necessary or appropriate to combat racial harassment or than is needed to send a message to the community that such conduct is unacceptable. We in the coalition will prepare our own bill after appropriate consultation. Unlike the government, we will not go over the top with respect to the provisions contained therein. Our bill will not be extreme. It will not provide a criminal sanction for otherwise free speech. As I mentioned, we will commit $10 million over two years to a community education campaign to promote awareness and tolerance. I refer particularly to the criminal provisions. Proposed section 60 of the bill is a fundamental denial of the right to free speech. It establishes a new class of offence which impacts upon expressions of opinion rather than expressions of violent intent. Such an incursion is objectionable and unwarranted. We on this side of the chamber will not support a criminal sanction for expressing a view and enco<1raging others to adopt it when you are not inciting people to damage property or persons. To create an offence of inciting racial hatred without linking the incitement of damage to personal property makes it an offence to try to get other people to agree with your own view. An offence is committed even if there is no urging of other people to act in a violent way on that view. This is a most serious and inappropriate infringement of free speech. The coalition again does not believe that a person should be put in gaol for encouraging others to adopt a view, however violent or racially prejudiced that view may be. Supporting laws that restrict what people say, even where the vast majority believe the remarks themselves are offensive, undennines our democratic system. I looked through the provisions of the various sanctions contained within the bill and tried to see exactly where current statutes in my home state would fail to be of use or to redress the situation. In proposed section 18C(i) of the bill, under the heading 'Offensive behaviour because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin', the offensive behaviour contained therein would be quite easily prosecutable under the state police act, for instance. I refer to proposed section 58 under the heading 'Prohibition of threats to cause physical harm because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin'. That quite clearly would be contained in the offence of threatening behaviour, which is relatively easy to prosecute. In the prosecution, one would merely need evidence to show that there had been race, colour or national or ethnic overtones in whatever discussions, threats or otherwise were contained in the offence. In the case of prohibition of threats to property because of race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, in my state section 80 of the Police Act would cover that, as would the more serious provisions contained in the criminal code. In reference to proposed subsection 60(2), I am interested to learn from the parliamentary secretary exactly why an offence committed in private was excluded. In Western Australia. I think the previous speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa, referred to this-amendments were passed by the state parliament in 1990 which amended the Western Australian criminal code and which outlawed the possession or publication of material to incite racial hatred. It brought in punishment of two years gaol for offenders. Possession or display of material to harass a racial group also became an offence, with offenders facing up to a year in prison. What that effectively means in the case of my state is that there are no clear reasons for the enactment of an overlaying federallegislative framework because the state legislation quite easily deals with all of those provisions. statute. I might add that there have been no prosecutions under Western Australia's criminal code amendments, but the minister, Mr Kierath, has pointed out quite rightly that the legislation plays an important role within Western Australia-it has an educative function. He said: I think the legislation in its current form is necessary if for no other reason than it sends a clear signal to people about what is acceptable and what's not. He pointed out: You must remember that most laws rely on the fact that most people will obey the law and not break it. We have also been told-and I mentioned it earlier-that our nation does have a very good record of multicultural harmony and tolerance. Most of the supporters of multiculturalism, of which I am one, have cited this as being one of the fundamental reasons why multiculturalism is an effective policy in the case of Australian society. It seems somewhat illogical that, at the same time, others are saying that because of this there ought to be legislation introduced to prosecute or create criminal sanctions against racial intolerance or bigotry and threatening and other racially based behaviour. Through my reading of the Bills Digest on the Racial Hatred Bill, I have found that it deals with the meaning of 'hatred', Rather than rely on my views, I will quote the views of the Parliamentary Library: As noted above in the Background, the international instruments which form the constitutional support for this bill avoided reference to 'incitement to racial hatred' , on the basis that hatred is too subjective a term for a court to assess. In the United States and Canada, concern has also been expressed that the term 'hatred' is too uncertain a standard to include in penal legislation. For example, in State v Klapprott the Supreme Court of New Jersey that a statute that made it an offence to utter any statement inciting hatred, abuse, violence or hostility against a group by reason of race, colour, religion or manner of worship, was void for uncertainty, because the terms 'hatred', 'abuse' and 'hostility' are abstract and indefinite. Chief Justice Brogan concluded that it is not possible to say when ill will becomes hatred. He noted that there is no norm to say when such an emotion comes into being, and that it cannot be made a legitimate standard for a penal So here we have a problem already in the drafting of the legislation, where we are going to find it is difficult to determine what is racial hatred. As has clearly been shown in the above quote, there is a difficulty in concisely defining exactly what racial hatred means. The other aspect of the matter which has been raised by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) is the problem created by relying too heavily on the explanatory memorandum for the purposes of further defining the offences within the act. In his address yesterday, the member for Tangney gave a very concise but full criticism of the problems inculcated by the over-reliance on the explanatory memorandum in relation to the application of the bill. In the few seconds remaining to me, 1 will give one example of that. In the case of the training guarantee levy, the explanatory memorandum was different from the bill. Constituents of mine were who were trying to assess their liabilities training guarantee levy, relying on the explanatory memorandum, came up with one figure; they were then told by the authorities that that figure was not correct because the act provided for a different set of criteria in assessing the liabilities under the act.

22,Ms HENZELL,COMMITTEES," I rise to support the Racial Hatred Bill 1994. Mr Deputy Speaker, I put this question to you: will the Racial Hatred Bill be Alexander Downer's final comeuppance?",27
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The member for Capricornia will refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his correct title.,27
24,Ms HENZELL,COMMITTEES,Will it be the final comeuppance of the Leader of the Opposition?,27
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Nehl)1 assume that was a rhetorical question, and that you are not seeking an answer.",27
26,Ms HENZELL,COMMITTEES,"It was definitely a rhetorical question. I will try to clarify when I am being rhetorical and otherwise. Mr Duncan-Mind you, an answer would have been interesting.",27
27,Ms HENZELL,COMMITTEES,"The answer is gtJing to be interesting. I think today's Australian is rather instructive on where the current political debate on this bill is going. The major headline in the Australian is 'Historic trade deal for Pacific'. That article refers to the gathering in Indonesia-the APEC conference-which it has indicated will increase Australia's national income by nearly $7 billion a year. What is the minor headline? Another rhetorical question. The minor headline is 'Downer threat appals ethnic leaders'. This is the sort of consultation that the member for Moore has just been telling us that is going to be the basis of this $10 education campaign. I refer to the Don Greenlees article which reports a meeting that the opposition leader had with ethnic leaders in Melbourne on 2 November, just a few days ago. It states: The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer, has placed relations with ethnic communities under severe strain after threatening at a private meeting to cut off access to ethnic leaders if they campaigned in the media against the Coalition's stance under the on race hate laws. During the 90-minute meeting, the leaders of the Ethnic Coalition of Australia called on Mr Downer to honour a commitment made by former opposition leader Dr John Hewson to support criminal sanctions against incitement to race hatred. Ethnic leaders told the meeting they would make a statement to the media expressing their disappointment at the outcome but stating their hope that the Coalition would support the Government's Bill once it had been released. At this, sources claimed, Mr Downer replied, ""If you bucket us in the press, we'll deny you access."" Further, the article states: The handling of these negotiations over both the Government's Racial Hatred Bill and the Coalition's proposed alternative race hate bill has seriously undermined the efforts of the Coalition at building relations with ethnic communities. There are other headlines about the opposition leader's perilous status in his own party, but this I think indicates the great difficulties the opposition has with this bill and other bills in relation to human rights. We saw this issue replayed earlier with the privacy bill in relation to gay rights. Opposition members are saying that they will oppose this bill because it is flawed. If it is flawed, as they argue, they are perfectly entitled to put up amendments. They are not putting up amendments; they are going to write their own bill. This is really to placate the internal dissent within the coalition parties, in my view. The Racial Hatred Bill is a matter of real concern to many in our community. I commend the ·member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on his excellent historical account of racism' that has been part of this country's xenophobic monoculturalism and has infected all political parties. I do not think any member of this House would walk away from that. Let us just see what the opposition leader said a very short time ago in relation to racial vilification. The member for Werriwa has previously referred to an article in the Sydney edition of the Jewish News of 24 June. Having said that he supports criminal sanctionsI want to repeat that so there is no misunderstanding-the Leader of the Opposition said: ""Where there is incitement to violence or to damaging property on the basis ofrace, then there's no question that that should be a criminal offence. The article continues: Mr Downer-who has described himself as an unambiguous opponent of discrimination on the basis of gender, race, religion or age-finds the League of Rights' antisemitism and attitudes on race abhorrent. ""1 did have some League of Rights groups in my electorate at one redistribution, I think, has largely taken them but I haven't heard much from them because they never regarded me as a friend at court and so that was it."" That is fascinating lx<cause subsequently there were many reports and electronic media replays of the opposition leader's attendance at meetings of what could only be described as fellow travellers and supporters of the League of Rights. Here again, I unfortunately I have to say that the opposition leader's views were dependent on the context in which he was uttering them. When he is being interviewed by the Jewish News, he is supporting racial hatred laws;, when he is not, he is saying something else. That is the problem-the lack of real policy commitment from the opposition. Sudderily, out of the blue, we have $10 million worth of education. That is fine and all very well, but it does not deal with the core issues of racial hatred. The real controversy is over the relative balancing of the rights of free speech and the rights of people to live without fear of racial harassment and violence. I want to refer to an article from the Quadrant magazine written by lsi Leibler in which he quotes Professor Kathleen Mahoney from Canada. It goes to the point that the member for Moore was making a little earlier. In the article Professor Mahoney is quoted as observing that: ' . ... non-violent hate ... exists on a continuum which eventually and inevitably leads to violence once the weapons of segregation, disparagement and propaganda have done their work. Professor Mahoney in a recent speech is also reported by lsi Leibler as saying: Modern democracies that respect equality and multiculturalism have accepted as a fundamental principle that legislative protection and government regulation are required to protect the vulnerable. To use the free speech doctrine as an instrument to permit disadvantaged or vulnerable groups to be seriously harmed by more powerful groups misunderstands the proper role of governments and free speech . . . Governments must speak on behalf of those who cannot be heard, to facilitate the expression of their ideas and to promote the interests of tolerance, pluralism and individual autonomy. All constitutions in free societies embody this concept by permitting limitations on speech activity if those' limitations are justified, reasonable and prescribed by law fu the democratic stage,"" he said. ""The context. out; I think that goes to the core of the concerns about this bill. Certainly, there have been many high profile critics of the bill. Therefore, it is encouraging to see that we are having a full debate on this matter in the parliament. It is also important to speak about the victims of racial intolerance. I want to refer to reports of racist incitement against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people contained in the report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence in Australia by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, under the chairmanship of Irene Moss, the Federal Race Discrimination Commissioner, and Ron Castan QC. No-one would disagree that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been subject to racism in this country. This did not happen in the distant past; it is happening right up to the present day. In the report the commissioners talked to many people right around this country. Page 76 of the report states: There were also complaints of violence and intimidation by non-Aboriginal people who attacked particular Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal settlement on the outskirts of Mareeba (northern Qld) had been subjected to visits by car loads of youths in the early hours of the morning shouting racist abuse and throwing bottles. The submission from the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Legal Service noted that Aboriginal people in camps at Charters Towers had their property burnt and destroyed by non-Aboriginal persons (allegedly security guards) in early 1986. In Katherine (NT) the Aboriginal community was frequently the subject of verbal abuse by nonAboriginal youths. In Alice Springs there were complaints that Aboriginal people were being 'terrorised' by groups of whites. Such incidents involved the alleged rape of Aboriginal teenage girls, and alleged poisoning of Aboriginal men in which five people died and the dousing and painting of Aborigines. . These are only a few of the many reports of racist attacks against individuals and communities. It is very important that we understand the issue from the perspective of the victims. This was the position of Dr Nguyen Trieu Dan, the President of the Vietnamese Friday Club in Melbourne, who has also written a book entitled A Vietnamese family chronicle: twelve generations on the banks of the Hat River. Dr Dan is also quoted in the Quadrant magazine of November 1994. Reporting on a seminar at which he had spoken, he says: l . . . I mentioned that in my fifteen years or so in this country, I had experienced three fairly bad instances of racial abuse, one of which was a threat of violence. He says that that was in contrast to many, many positive experiences of welcome Australians. He continues: Yet I did not remember the good experiences as clearly as the bad ones. He refers to the proverb 'Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me' and says: A broken bone can be treated and mendld . . . but racial abuse can leave a mark for a long time. Any discussion of racial vilification laws primarily focus on the victims. He refers to a survey of 630 year 11 and year 12 students in Melbourne working class suburbs in 1993-the prevJous year-by the Department of Psychiatry, Melbourne University. He said: Of one hundred Vietnamese refugee students in that group, 69 per cent said they experienced racism at school, 59 per cent experienced it in the streets and 14 per cent said racism involved physical threat or injury. As a result of such experiences, some of the students suffered from loss Of sleep, others felt ""nervous and shaky inside"", some said they panicked in crowds and some even thought of killing themselves. According to the research team, 15 per cent of the Vietnamese surveyed·could face serious long-term psychological damage. These are very important Issues. As Dr Dan says, this is in a society that prides itself on giving everyone a fair go, a society where the mainstream majority experience tolerance and pride themselves on living in a tolerant multicultural society. But if we do not listen to those people who are on the receiving end of intolerance and racism, we will not understand the reality of people's lives in AustraliaAs Dr Dan says, this affects not only the victims but society as a whole. As a society composed largely of immigrants from many parts of the world, Australia's cohesion depends on the ability of all-indigenous Australians as well as settlers---.:to integrate and be committed to the idea of a multicultural nation. He says: ""Commitment to a country"", to quote a Vietnamese lady on her experience here, is often a ""tentative and incremental process. Like a transplanted seedling, it needs time and tender loving care to take roots and grow. Acceptance and encouragement strengthen it. Rejection and rebuttal make it wither."" He continues: Racial intolerance results in particular groups in society feeling isolated and rejected. It creates disunity and alienates the victims from the mainstream Australian society. Most of all, it implies that not all people are of equal worth or deserve to be treated equally. These are very important issues. The bill attempts to address them and to plug lega.l loopholes that do not provide, under existing legislation, the same sorts of rights that we in the mainstream of Australian society-that is, should the Anglo-Celtic mainstream-are used to receiving. In the Canberra Times of 8 October, Dr Colin Rubenstein addresses the issue of free speech. He says: The absolute idealised right of free speech generally cited does not exist anywhere and never has. No one, in any country, has the right to express whatever they want wherever they want to. To give just a few: examples, defamation laws, incitement laws, obscenity laws, false advertising laws, and broadcasting regulations all temper both the contents and the form speech and expression can take. Why? Because' there are vital public interests or important pri-ate rights at stake, which outweigh the minor curbing of free speech involved. This is a very important issue that, unfortunately, we will have to address in a democratic multicultural society. I think it is very important to note that in other states in this country this issue has been taken up. I refer to Chris Puplick, President, Anti-Discrimination Board of New South Wales. On 4 November he responded to an editorial in the Australian of 1 November. He supported the racial vilification laws introduced in the parliament of New South Wales. He stated: Since that date the Anti-Discrimination Board has handled 448 complaints of racial vilification, with 86 of our 1713 cases in 1993/4 falling into this category. To the argument that criminal sanctions are rarely used, he says: The fact that there have been no prosecutions in NSW is not evidence of any failure of our laws but rather evidence of the success of the laws and the Anti-Discrimination Board in conciliating complaints. Without the law, however, we would have had no capacity to start on these programsthat is, education prograrnsor to broker conciliations. As with sexual assault and domestic violence laws, until we instituted criminal sanctions, all the education in the world did not take away a perception in the community that people had the right to behave this way. When there is a clear legal sanction and a criminal penalty, it then becomes very clear when people breach these laws that they have committed an illegal act for which there are sanctions in this community. Chris Puplick goes on, in responding to Father Brennan's criticisms of the Racial Hatred Bill, to say that Father Brennan's criticisms: . . . fail to recognise the enormous impact of the adoption of racial vilification legislation as a powerful statement of public policy-namely, a declaration by the pOOpl, 's elected representatives that racism will not be tolerated where it promotes hatred, violence or community division. The experience of NSW, well tested over five years, is that appropriately drawn racial vilification laws provide the basis for public education to eliminate racism; allow conciliation to take place to the benefit of all parties; does not impede free speech, create martyrs or drive people underground; makes a clear declaration of our public policy and provides ultimate sanctions which ought to be available in any society where respect for the rights of individuals and their protection together with promoting tolerance and social cohesion are among our highest and most noble goals. I think the words of Chris Puplick, who after all fell foul of the Right of the New South Wales Liberal Party and allowed for the entrance ultimately into this House of the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), indicate just how far the Liberal Party has moved to the right on these issues. It is very disappointing that on this bill, as on many other issues of human rights-the privacy bill, the Mabo legislation, the land acquisition bill; there is a litany of bills of great importance to this country's democratic status, our international commitment to conventions that we are signatories to-the Liberal-National parties once again are divided and cannot form a clear position. It has been suggested that the alternative bill to the Racial Hatred Bill will never see the light of day because it is simply there to deal with divisions in the Liberal Party that the current Leader of the Opposition has no stature, authority or leadership to deal with. That is to the detriment of this country and its democratic principles. I support the Racial Hatred Bill. I hope that it will not only pass through this House but also find support in the Senate.",27
28,Mr NUGENT,COMMITTEES,"I work on a number of committees, and I work on one particular committee in this place with the previous speaker, the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell). I think we have a common view on a number of issues and we have a common concern about some of the problems in our communities around the country. Therefore, I was somewhat disappointed with particularly the opening part of her speech in which she was very clearly trying to play politics with a matter that I think is very serious; that is, the subject of racial treatment of people in this country. My intention is to treat the matter seriously and in its own right. I want to start by perhaps defining some of the problems as I see them from my own experience and some examples from elsewhere. I want to go on and examine the Racial Hatred Bill and look at what it actually does in its main provisions and comment briefly on each of those sections. I want to look at one of the major aspects of the government's justification for introducing the legislation and explain why I think that justification is wrong. 1 will then examine briefly the views of one or two outside experts in the area of race relations. Finally, I will explain why, on balance, I came to oppose this legislation, although I believe that somewhat less draconian legislation based on the New South Wales model may be appropriate if a major education program is unsuccessful. Let me start by just giving the House a very brief experience of where I am coming from. My first wife was Chinese and we were married for 3D-odd years. My children are Eurasian. I can assure honourable members that through my working life we personally suffered-my wife, my children and mefrom a number of racial comments and discrimination in one form or another. Within a matter of weeks of my first being elected to this chamber in 1990, my office in Melbourne wa- daubed with anti-Asian slogans because of my then wife and my children. At the local railway stations people handed out anti-Asian and anti-Nugent leaflets. The police were somehow inexplicably unable to catch these people. They said to me that if they did catch them they were not sure what they could do about it. So I ha;te some personal understanding of what it is like to be on the receiving end of racism, although obviously not personally as much as those who are non-Anglo-Saxon. Clearly, that is where most of the attacks occur. It was interesting to read in yesterday'S paper an article by Mr Ron Castan QC who was co-commissioner of the 1991 national inquiry into racist· violence. He said in his article: Some weeks ago, a man in a passing truck in Doncaster, in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, screamed at Dr Harry Cheong (not his real name), who was standing at the side of the road: ""Why don't you go back toChina, you f ... ing wog!"" A large gob of spit then landed on Dr Cheong's suit. The doctor recorded the vehicle's details. The doctor, who has been an Australian for 20 years, came here from Malaysia after medical training at the University of Singapore. He has saved numerous lives and' helped thousands of fellow Australians back to good health. He is much loved by his many close friends, of whom I am one. Harry asked me what he could do about this event. I told him that technically the spitting might be a form of assault. The language might amount to a breach of the Summary Offences Act of Victoria, which makes it an offence to use ""threatening, abusive or insulting words"" in a public place. But the present law provides him with no real redress that deals with the demoralising effect it had upon him. He decided not to pursue the matter. Harry is a well-established professional with a large group of relatively influential friends. Each time he tells someone his story they express horror and regret, and reinforce their support and friendship. His faith in this country is still solid. But I know that we let him down. Not just because of the ugly racism of a'""huckie in Doncaster, but because our system does nothing for him. And there are thousands of victims of this kind of street racism in our communities. Ron Castan then goes on to argue in support of the legislation. It would be unfair of me not to make that point. He concludes by saying: Most Australians believein tolerance. Justice and good government demand that our laws make it clear that racial hatred is un-Australian. And people such as Dr Harry Cheong are entitled to protection from the spitting truckies who shame us all. I quote that particular incident because it seems to me that we have to understand that, whilst it may not be necessarily a widespread problem or even a growing problem-that is hard to quantify-there are undoubtedly in this country daily instances of racism which are hard to deal with and which cause great suffering, humiliation and hurt for many people. I turn to the bill to see whether some of those matters will be addressed. My complaint about the legislation is that it is flawed and ineffective and will not actually deal with the problem. I acknowledge that the Parliamentary Library's Bills Digest is an excellent document in this respect. It takes the act and technical terms apart fairly well. There are offences that deal with threats. It is proposed that the Racial Hatred Bill amend the Crimes Act 1914 by inserting a new part-'Offences based on racial hatred'. This part contains three criminal offences, two of which concern threats of violence. One is the proposed section 58, which provides that it is an offence to threaten to cause physical harm to a person or group because of race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. The penalty is imprisonment for two years. The proposed section 69 provides that it is an offence to threaten to destroy or damage property because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any other person or group. The penalty is imprisonment for one year. It is already an offence to threaten to cause injury to people or their property in Australian states and territories, although in some jurisdictions the laws are limited to specific types of threats. In many cases, the penalties are higher in the states than are the penalties provided in the Racial Hatred Bill. If a person were to threaten to destroy or damage the property of somebody else in New South Wales, under the New South Wales legislation he or she would be liable for imprisonment for five years. If, however, the threat was motivated by racial hatred and prosecution was commenced under this legislation, that person would be liable for imprisonment for only one. year. This discrepancy between the penalties, it seems to me, runs the risk of giving the impression that racially motivated crimes are treated less seriously than crimes committed for other reasons. The third item under this particular heading of the· Racial Hatred Bill proposes another amendment to the. Crimes Act, inserting section 60, which provides that it is a criminal offence to do an act which is reasonably likely to incite racial hatred. This offence contains several qualifications. The first is that the act must be done otherwise than in private. This phrase is partially defined in the proposed subsection 60(2) which notes that an act is not done in private if it is done in a public place or within sight or hearing of people in a public place or is communicated to the public through words, sounds or images. Accordingly, words painted on the wall of a private house which can be seen from the road could be subject of an offence, but conversations within the house which cannot be heard from the street outside would not be an offence. It is less clear whether meetings of racist organisations would fall within the description of acts done otherwise than in private. The offence does not require that there be actual incitement of racial hatred. There is no test of causation. Accordingly, a person may be convicted of an offence even if no person has been incited to hate on the basis of race. There are, however, two tests of intention which must be met. The first test is a subjective test, which requires it to be established, according to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt, that the defendant committed the impugned act with the intention of inciting racial hatred against another person or a group of people. It must also be established that a substantial reason for doing the act was the race, colour, or national or ethnic origin of the person or group against whom it was intended to incite racial hatred. The second test is an objective test. It must be proved that the act is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to incite racial hatred against the other person or group. The term 'racial hatred' is not defined in the bill. So one might assume that 'racial' was intended to cover colour or national or ethnic origin. But this is not explicit at all. The tests of intention have caused some difficulty, as has been said by others in this place, in other countries, such as the United Kingdom. One problem is that it often depends upon the people to whom the act is communicated-in other words, the audience of a speech or the readers of racist material. If the people at whom the act is directed are unlikely to be incited-that might even be members of parliament or others who are being lobbied on a particular issue-or if the intention of the act is to get them to support a change in policy, then, no matter how offensive the words, an offence would not have been committed. Then we turn to the civil offence of offending people on the basis of race. This bill proposes to amend the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 by inserting a new part: 'Prohibition of offensive behaviour based on racial hatred'. Contrary to its title, the part does not make any reference to racial hatred. The proposed section 18C provides that it is unlawful to do an act which is reasonably likely to 'offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate' another person or group if one of the reasons for doing the act is race, colour or national or ethnic As with the criminal offences proposed in section 60 that I have mentioned, the act must be done otherwise than in private. The definition is the same as that in the criminal section. The proposed section 18C does not contain a subjective test of intention. The person doing the act does not have to intend to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate the other person. It is enough if one of the reasons for doing the act, and it need not be the dominant reason, is the race, colour, national or ethnic origin of the other person or people. The main test is the objective test that the act be reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or group. There is no requirement that any person actually be offended, insulted, humiliated or intimidated. The proposed section 180 sets out exemptions to this particular provision. These exemptions are meant to cover things that are said or done reasonably and in good faith in relation to things like artistic works; genuine academic, artistic or scientific purposes; discussion or debate on a genuine purpose in the public interest; fair and accurate reports any event or matter of public interestiand fair comment, representing a genuinely held belief, on any event or matter of public interest. The proposed section 18E provides that an employer is liable for a breach of the proposed section 18C made by one of his or her employees, when it is done in connection with the employee's duties, unless the employer can establish that he or she 'took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee' from doing the act. How draconian do we have to get? This bill refers to acts which are reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate a person. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission expressly recommended against such a low threshold as would allow complaints for hurt feelings or injured sensibilities. The word 'offend' is defined in the Macquarie Dictionary as meaning: to irritate in mind or feelings; cause resentful displeasure. origin. The problem with using terms such as 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' is that they are largely subjective in nature. The courts of the UK have had trouble interpreting the word 'insult' in relation to public order legislation, and there have been similar problems in the United States. I tum briefly to one of the government's main justifications for introducing this legislation. The explanatory memorandum that attaches to this bill opens by saying: This Bill makes provision in relation to racial hatred by amending the Crimes Act 1914 to provide for three criminal offences and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 to provide for a civil prohibition. The Bill addresses concerns highlighted by the findings of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. In doing so, the Bill closes a gap in the legal protection available to the victims of extreme racist behaviour. This is simply not the case. It is a misleading statement. During the period of 1991-92, three reports were written which touched on the question of national racial vilification. The Australian Law Reform ""'commission, in its report Multiculturalism and the law, concludof ed that incitement to racial hatred and hostility should be made a civil offence which is dealt with by conciliation. The commission rejected making it a criminal offence, noting that this would unduly restrict free speech. Commissioner Elliott Johnston QC, in his report of the Royal Commission into Aborigithe nal Deaths in Custody, also recommended a other groups. civil offence of the kind existing in New South Wales. He supported conciliation as means of dealing with racial vilification, but rejected the use of criminal sanctions. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in its report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence in Australia, commended the creation of a civil offence incitement to racial hostility. stressed that the threshold for prohibited conduct must be higher than expressions of mere ill will or conduct which results in hurt feelings or injured sensibilities as this can lead to a large number of trivial complaints, as has occurred with similar legislation New Zealand. The commission rejected the incitement to racial hostility should be a criminal offence. We have a number of other examples of that sort. The government has said that it is introducing legislation based these sorts of reports, which are downright misleading if not that other word which we are not allowed to use in this place. I would like to briefly refer to Father Frank Brennan, who is well known in this country as being very active in the Aboriginal affairs area. Father Brennan, who is very supportive of Aboriginal causes, is a legally trained He has done major work for the government in a number of different areas. He would considered one of the more respected people in the Aboriginal community by those who deal in those areas. It is interesting to note that Father Brennan silencing is also opposed to this legislation. He says expressed, that the law will not serve the purpose for words which it is intended. He argues that there already a sufficient body of criminal law that is capable of dealing with the worse conseto On quences of racism. He says: ""The major concem I have can be summed up by asking the question, what activity that criminal will be rendered criminal by these laws?"" I ask the same question. Brennan says that motivation can now be taken into account by courts when sentencing. He says to accept the argument that tougher penalties mean making a judgment that violence against one group in community is worse than violence against In the case of incitement to racial hatred a or generalised threats, he suggests that the difficulty of establishing evidence would mean little prospect of successful prosecutions. He lists several other reservations, including the risk of making martyrs of racists reby sending them to gaol, and fears the laws of might be used as a weapon to inflame interThe commission ethnic rivalries. The case against racist laws is strengthened by the fact that versions of these laws introduced in New South Wales in 1989 and Western Australia in 1990 have not yet rein sulted in a single prosecution. Given ongoing concerns about racist violence, it seems that proponents of the legal remedies are view that unable to explain why. In this speech, I have not dealt with the general subject of free speech because I beon lieve that the bill fails on other counts, and time is against me. My view is that no Australians support racist words or actions that involve threats to injure or damage people or property. No citizen should have to live in fear of such threats or tolerate people who incite others to make such threats. It may be that milder legislation than this man. might be appropriate on the New South Wales model, but my view would be very much the be one articulated by Ron Merkel QC, who is a former president of the Victorian and Australian Council for Civil Liberties. He says: Nothing in our national experience suggests that evil has ever corrected it . . . to eradicate racism we need to listen to the words which are to delve beneath them, to find our own of reply and explanation, before we can even is begin to make the changes we seek. the other hand, for those who defend the right such speech the lesson is clear. Those who seek to protect the rights of racists to express their views have a corresponding duty to expose those views is not now for the evil that they represent. It is through the process of exposure and education rather than prohibition that we can achieve a tolerant and understanding community. The legislative path against racial vilification has not been shown to be successful elsewhere and there is no reason to believe it will be . . . in Australia. I agree. Education and conciliation are the way to go. The law, based perhaps on the New South Wales model, may have a place in our overall armoury to combat racism, but this bill is fatally flawed and should be rejected. (TIme expired)",30
29,Mr FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"The speech of the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) encompassed some legitimate concerns of the legislation. However, ironically, whilst he on two occasions called for 'milder legislation', the general thrust of his contribution, as distinct from the contributions of most of those opposite, was more to the actual lack of strength in the legislation. I do not want to dwell at length on the contributions of other members. I do not want to treat this in a partisan fashion because, in my own electorate and marty like it, the issue is so fundamentally important that at the end of the day it is necessary for this country that the opposition review its attitude. I do not think that, from the government side, much would be gained on this basic issue by point scoring. However, the contribution of the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) does cause some legitimate concerns. He builds sandcastles and windmills by saying that people might accuse him of being racist and that he might be taken as being politically incorrect. I do not want to enter the competition he suggested as to whether he goes to the most diplomatic parties and the most ethnic functions on Saturday nights and whether people have been overseas to ASEAN countries as often as he. Whilst he accuses others of stereotyping him as a racist, his own analysis of why people are bringing forward this legislation is equally partisan and mischievous. The Leader of the National Party speaks of social engineering and agenda setters. He puts in the words of those who endorse this legislation a preoccupation with being manipulated by outside experts, by essentially alprofessional elite that has no real knowledge of the issues. However, the reality is that, whilst the Leader of the National Party can come into this House and talk about how when he goes out in the electorate or when he is at a meeting he would treat people who make racist remarks as ratbags, that is not the real world. This problem does not exist in nice debates at Oxford University or Harrow or Eton public schools. Many people cannot handle this degree of attack, this degree of denigration and this hate. They cannot walk away comforted by the fact that they are members of the federal parliament and that these people are ratbags. In a very real sense, this legislation deals with a fundamental problem in the electorate. As people on both sides have acknowledged, whilst our society has generally been able to cater for a wide diversity of backgrounds, if we are honest about it, we would recognise that some groups in the wider society seek to undermine multiculturalism in the country and seek to engender racism. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) noted that one or two of the actions seemingly directed against the Jewish community actually had a basis in accidents. There is evidence in one case in Melbourne that it might have been a bit more to do with a feud over money and jewellery than anything to do with religion, but very few people dispute that there is obvious evidence in Melbourne of a campaign directed against Jewish yeshiv-s and synagogues. In the aftermath of Jolin Newman's death-whatever the reasons for and the background of that there have been manifestations of racism against the Asian and Vietnamese communities. I do not go along with the exaggerated reports of the Islamic Council of New South Wales of attacks on every second Muslim walking down the road. Many of those are loutish activities that have nothing to do with racism. However, in the aftermath of the Gulf War, there was a very real upswing in attacks on people of Arabic descent in this country. Equally, we might be comforted that, in relation to the Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian conflict, things have not got out of hand here but, once again, some people out there in the community have manifested racial hatred and have attacked others on grounds that this government should deal with. Whilst it might be very reassuring to us that the Leader of the National Party would treat people making these remarks as ratbags, it is a bigger problem than that. Many of the people who suffer this degree of assault and are threatened see themselves as having very little power to do anything about it. They have no knowledge of any laws that can protect them, and they are in groups that are often inarticulate, disorganised and incapable of manifesting activity against racism. To some degree I agree with some of the remarks made by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I think that people are not facing up to the truth if they do not acknowledge that many of the most extreme forms of racism in this country are manifested by people from other societies-not because they have different blood or are of a different colour but because they come from societies that have not had the historical growth that we have had, have not learned to accept other cultures and perhaps have not had the benefit of a number of institutions that this country has inherited. I do not for one moment dispute his conclusions that very real threats can come from a variety of ethnic groups in this country, perhaps even more than from the mainstream culture. That, however, is not a reason to undermine the legislation. It is not a reason to come in here and oppose the legislation. One thing that I am particularly pleased with in this legislation as opposed, from recollection, to that which went through in New South Wales is that there is no reference in this legislation to the predominant culture or to minorities, and to this law applying only to them. That is a very important point because there was a problem in New South Wales. A large part of the electorate perceived the legislation as being designed only to protect non-English speakers, as being dictated to some degree by ethnic lobbies. This legislation does not do that. It talks about activities directed against any person on a racial, ethnic ground. That is an important advance in this legislation. It is the same with 'regard to discrimination. People are being dishonest if they do not acknowledge that in parts of the work force in this country if you are not a particular nationality you cannot be employed in certain jobs, in certain sectors of the economy. If you speak English, if you are not from another country, you just cannot get employed. The government and some of the 'experts' in this field have to wake up to that. This legislation comes forward not because-as suggested by the Leader of the National Party-some social engineers sat around one afternoon over a few drinks and decided that it might not be a bad idea. It comes forward after a series of investigations into this problem. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) noted quite correctly that only the national inquiry into racist violence in 1992, which noted 60 incidents, specifically recommended criminal penalties. However, I do not think it is a matter of these inquiries dictating to the government or to the opposition their stand. I take my position on the basic analysis they make of our society. The fact that the Australian Law Reform Commission report Multiculturalism and the law and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody did not formally reach a conclusion that there should be criminal penalties is not the be all and end all. It has to be seen in the context of the actual problem out there. That problem has been indicated by the reality of violence, by the reality of groups who seek to denigrate others, by the reality of forces that exploit racism. It should also be seen in the context of statistical evidence by people such as Chris Cuneen and I. des Rome who in the article 'Monitoring hate crimes' in Current Issues in Criminal Justice, 5(2), November 1993, evidenced an increase in problems in this area. A series of inquiries and a wealth of material have indicated that there is a very real problem out there. I do not want to bash the heads of members of the opposition, but I think they have to review their attitude on this matter. Perhaps their difficulty was indicated by comments by Angela Chan, the chairperson of the Ethnic Communities Council, who on 11 November stated that the opposition's position: ... is a betrayal of the basic principles of Australian Liberalism ... it is essential that all Australians should be protected against the threat posed by racists of racist propaganda to our social peace and harmony. We call on the opposition parties . . . to reassert the traditional principles which we successfully implemented in the New South Wales legislation. Colin Rubinstein, senior lecturer in politics, Monash, put this issue in context on 1 June this year when he said in the Australian: Racism and racist belief clearly has as its end result real harm to the rights and lives of members of minority sectors of the Australian community. The whole group with which the victim has been associated is adversely affected and pays a price in fear, in insecurity, in what amounts to genuine psychological harm. If we look at the international dimensions of this matter we see that this supposed assault on freedom of expression, free speech, et cetera, has not really convinced a large number of other liberal democracies that they should not move to do something about this. In France, the Press Act prohibits provocation in public places or meetings which lead If towards discrimination, hatred or violence. Canada, under section 319(2) of the criminal evidence code, assaults and statements which vilify and promote hatred of an identifiable community group are punishable with a prison term of two years. In its Human Rights Act, it also police. has prohibitions against physical or verbal harassment and expressions that are racially related. Whilst we are talking about the internationbate al dimensions of this matter, I refer to the United Kingdom's third report of the Home Affairs Committee entitled Racial attacks harassment. What did this Tory dominated committee conclude about the problem? I knowledge that perhaps the United Kingdom is facing more intense difficulty What did those people of all parties conclude about this field of policy? They recommended brawlers that there be additional and consecutive gaol terms of up to five years if there were'a racial pretext element to assaults. They spoke of racial harassment meriting a £1,000 fine and a three se-tence of 12 months. They asked that the United Kingdom re-emphasise to chief constables that tackling racial incidents should be a priority. At the same time, they stated that the police force had to again look at ethnic recruitment. It was interesting to note some of the committee's remarks. It agreed with Sir Peter Imbert, the former Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis, who said: . .. racial attacks are not only against the law, they are also socially divisive and morally repugnant. The committee stated: We would go further. We believe that if racism is allowed to grow unchecked it will begin to corrode the fabric of our open and tolerant society. For this reason, crimes and anti-social behaviour become more serious when they are racially-motivated than when they are not. It is quite obvious that this is a core element of this legislation. The Conservative dominated committee further commented: ... an assault motivated by racism is more socially-divisive than any other assault, and if allowed to pass unchecked will begin to corrode the fabric of our tolerant society. evidence of racial motivation is presented it will In be for the court to decide whether or not the is sufficient to establish the crime. We see no problem with this. We certainly feel that if racially-motivated assaults are to be deterred it cannot be an acceptable argument that it may require a little more investigative work by the 'v I tum to Germany, where the onset of unemployment and the huge influx of refugee claimants have led to a far more intense deand violence. I refer to a document from the Federal Ministry of the Interior. I note again that this is not a social democratic goand vernment. This document has emanated from a coalition government of the Christian Deacmocrats and the Free Democrats. This document of the Ministry of the Interior dated July in this matter. 1993 reads: The Federal Government does not tolerate that and right-wing extremists take the current political discussion about the right of asylum as a for xenophobic actions and brutal attacks. Putting people's life and limb at danger will not be put up with. The Federal Government has banned right-wing extremist organizations and has thus given a resolute and unmistakable warning signal directed at those using right-wing agitation and violence. It is at present being examined whether other organizations can also be banned. In the long run the violence directed at foreigners can only be stemmed if, beyond stepping up police protection and criminal prosecution measures, the young people can be convinced that attacks against foreigners are unfair, unworthy and harmful and that tolerance and cosmopolitanism are desirable aims. This attitude can be achieved by shortand medium-term educational campaigns and an unwavering school education. The document goes on to say: The police law and the criminal law can also be employed to forestall anti-foreigner attacks. The Penal Code makes the following acts punishable offences: incitement to hatred and violence against segments of the populationwhich is an element of this legislationincitement to racial hatredwhich is another area that this bill attempts to counteract-damage to propertywhich is another matter that the legislation has in its sightsand all acts directed against life and limb of others. Whilst we might be comforted by the fact that racial hatred does not confront us most of the time, that we ate in the predominant culture and that we do not suffer from it, in the wider electorate it is a very real problem and the government attempts in this legislation to address it. Mr John Dowd, the former Attorney-General of New South Wales, when he introduced legislation on the same policy area on 4 May 1989, said: Victims of racial vilification require an accessible and inexpensive means of redress. Legislation against racial vilification must involve a balancing of the right to free speech and the right to a dignified and peaceful existence free from racist harassment and vilification. In introducing that legislation, he put his name clearly on the line-he recognised the need to be pro-active and the need to face up to the problem. He further went on to say: This bill is a clear statement by the Government that racial vilification has no place in our community. That is no reflection on our society. Our society has been perhaps the most successful in bringing together people from different parts of the world to form a community in which my children's generation and, more importantly, my grandson's generation, will not draw. a distinction between themselves and the ancestry of others. They will be known for who they themselves are. That is an important statement. We are better than the rest of the world but our standards must be higher. There is a growth of racial vilification within the community. The Government does not intend to interfere with freedom of speech but it must redress the balance . . . Finally, I want to indicate one area of concern with the legislation-and I might be taking a very literal wording of the material. I note that a definition in King-Ansell v. Police, 1979, in the New Zealand Law Reports, is used as the basis upon which certain abuse will be judged. That definition takes a very wide interpretation of ethnic groups. I think we are all aware-and this was certainly highlighted by the member for O'Connorthat some religious groups have been called what might' be termed ethno-cultural. The ones that stand out in this country are the Sikhs and the Jews. Clause 18C of the Racial Hatred Bill says: 18C.(1) It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if: (a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate . . . Some of the interpretation material speaks of Muslims. There is a very reasonable concern about people making statements about Shariah law, about female circumcision and about a wide variety of religions. But I do not want to single out Muslims; let us just say that statements are made about a wide variety of religious groups. We are verging on semiblasphemy laws here. The wide interpretation of that wording of this law-for all of the qualifications and for all of the reassurances that were given by the government-could be used basically to diminish debate, to diminish comment, and to diminish criticism of particular religious groups. I would feel that this is one of the weaknesses of the legislation. On the broad front, the legislation is merited, it is overdue, and it is worthwhile.",35
30,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"Mallee) (11.48 a.m.)I have come into this debate on the Racial Hatred Bill after approximately 51f2 hours, and I have to say that I have listened to it with great interest. I have an open mind on a whole range of matters, and I have come to the chamber willing to be persuaded on an alternative point of view to that which I previously formed-which was to oppose the bill. But after that whole 5 1/z hours I still remain unconvinced that there has been any example provided which makes this bill so necessary. The bill has been around for a number of years, and the enormous ground swell of public opinion against the need for it has·been evident. I have watched the polling and have sought many views, certainly from my own electorate-which I am here to represent. I continue to oppose this bill. It amazes me that the government is pushing for its enactment, despite the overwhelming public opinion against the need for it. No-one is more opposed to racial prejudice and the expressions of hatred that can result than I am. But this big stick. approach does not have my support. There are already legal sanctions and criminal sanctions within the community to deal with all of the examples that I have heard presented in this chamber yesterday and today during the debate. I have heard examples of racist graffiti on walls. Laws exist to bring the people who do that to account. Some of the examples of expressions of racial prejudice and hatred that have been presented sadden me, particularly when parents have been upset by expressions of that sentiment by children in the school grounds about their own children. It appals me to witness the baseness human nature which uses forms of vilificasodomy-like tion-be they religious, ethnic, of a political persuasion or even about disability. Some of the things that have beep. said in this chamber case. would fall into that category. As a matter of principle, I believe in the concept that all people are equal; all people ought to be treated equally regardless of their ethnic religious origins. Australia is renowned for sense of fairness and tolerance. The member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) has given us examto ples of vilification that have occurred in United Kingdom and Germany. Othtir speakspeak ers have mentioned situations in Canada and other places. This is Australia, which has reputation for tolerance and fair-mindedness. I rely on that sentiment and on taking a better approach to resolve the difficulties that we have been talking about and that we are equally concerned about than on taking a big stick approach. This bill will contribute towards the demise of progress towards tolerance. It will detract from any progress towards a sense of decency and acceptance of people from all races in Australia. The bill advances the concept that what is a criminal offence is that which has actually been a crime for the last 80 years, that is, the incitement or the perpetration of violence. I do not agree with the view put forward by supporters of the bill that racial violence is qualitatively any worse than any other form of violence. Violence and destruction of property, whether actual or threatened, is deplorable. I again make the point that legal sanctions already exist against such acts. I have been interested in comments that this legislation will provide some form of moral imperative, by way of an educative role, to bring about a sense of tolerance. I particularly refer to the contribution made by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). This idea is really quite odd, coming from the government benches, following the debate on the sexual conduct bill in which the government of Tasmania was soundly condemned for using the educative function of legal sanctions and legislation in regard to its anti-sodomy law. Given that there can be far more compelling of public interest questions associated with the expansion of the AIDS epidemic-it is amazing that the government now uses that argument to support its current As I have said, the overriding urgency and need for this legislation has not been proved to me or .to many other speakers. I have got or some concerns about how this bill basically its neuters what I consider to be the reasonable expectation which all Australians have come treasure-the right to free speech. That the right preserves the capacity for people to out on a whole range of issues which they consider to be in the public interest. a Sometimes these views may require comment in regard to ethnic origins, whether in respect of immigration, foreign policy or any other matter. I see legislation such as this, in the hands of fringe minority groups, being used later to constrain such freedom. I continue with my intention to ensure that this legislation is not supported by the parliament and voted out. We all know that this parliament makes law that has honourable intentions at the start but which, in the hands of fringe groups, is used for a purpose for which it was never intended. True freedom of speech allows the promotion of a range of views. Although the deliberate giving of offence may not be the purpose of such speech, it is sometimes amazing what people can be offended by. For example, I was offended this morning by assertions of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) that the National Party is a group of redneck right-wing people. That is not fair or reasonable, and I resent the insinuation, so I am offended. We are so easily offended. When we get offended, we are likely to use whatever recourse is provided to us for compensation or recompense. If this bill becomes law, I am convinced that freedom of speech will be constrained. I want to tum to specific provisions of the bill to highlight a number of deficiencies that I have already observed. The bill amends the Crimes Act 1914 and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Firstly, in respect of the Crimes Act, three new crimes will be created. The first of these is the prohibition of threats to cause physical harm because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The second offence is the prohibition of threats to property because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The third offence is the prohibition of incitement of racial hatred because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The first two laws have historically been the charter of the states to enact and administer, and I believe that that is where it should stay. The government has argued its case in respect of this legislation under section 51 of part V of the constitution. I have a copy of the constitution with me, and I exhort all honourable members to regularly read it. I think it contains some valuable sentiment to which we ought to continually refer. Section 51 states: The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to ... I refer in particular to placitum (xxvi), which states: The people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. I emphasise the word 'necessary' because I am not satisfied that there are persons within the community who can claim a lack· of protection if this legislation is not put in place. Each state already has criminal laws protecting people against those elements in the community that would threaten to cause physical harm to persons or property irrespective of the purpose for issuing the threatwhether of a political nature or because of racial or even matrimonial discord. No deficiency is so blatantly obvious in this existing state legislation which can so justify the need for this Racial Hatred Bill. This government seems to have a great propensity to ramrod the states and ride roughshod over their traditional areas of law. But, in this case, there is simply no justifiable cause or need. In fact, in browsing through the stipulated penalties in this new bill, I find that the retribution in respect of such offences seems to be much less than it is in existing state legislation. For example, in relation to threats to cause physical harm, the bill proposes imprisonment and a sentence of two years. In relation to threats to property, it proposes a sentence of one year and, in relation to incitement of racial hatred, it proposes a one-year penalty. That is substantially less than some penalties for like offences that already exist in state legislation which can extend to periods of five years. It is the third crime that I oppose because I have formed the view that every fair-minded Australian also opposes it. I think it foments even more division than the bill purports to address. The purpose of this third crime is to establish-I think it is a ridiculous situationthat what people say and what people think ought to be considered as a crime. Regardless of how I feel or how anybody else might feel about expressions of vile and ignorant racial prejudice, this proposal to control what people say and think is outrageous. How on earth can this parliament justify the enactment of legislation to control what people say and think? It is fair enough to control what people do when it impacts on the rights of others, but not what they say. People can say a whole lot of things but not necessarily act on what they say. They can say things out of anger, temper or frustration-and that, I have observed, often happens in this chamber. But does the parliament seriously want to make such people criminals? There is no doubt that the vast majority of fair-minded Australians want no part of racial vilification-and I am certainly one of those. But enacting this legislation, which we all know will be used by fringe minority groups for the wrong purposes, will achieve little towards what we ought to·regard as an ultimate and noble aim. Hatred, whatever its source or whatever its target, is a negative and a corrupting emotion. But that is all it is-an emotion or thought process. Other crimes deal with actions. These can be incitements to commit fraud, murder or sedition or threats of physical harm. All these crimes require some sense of physical action. Hatred is simply an expression of the mind. There are alternatives to the big stick approach of the Racial Hatred Bill to achieve the purposes that this legislation sets out. We ought to look at our children. If my children came home and were the source of racial prejudice in examples that have been given in this chamber, I would take some necessary educative action to restore their sense of fairness. Children have an enormous capacity to change the attitudes of society. I remember eight or nine years ago when the concept of recycling was part of a public education program. It was my children who came home and demanded of me a second bin for the recycling of materials. They actually asked, 'Why haven't we got two rubbish bins-one for the rubbish and one for recyclinglmaterial?' The children were able to make a parent more responsible in what was considered to be a vital issue in those days-the community recycling of waste materials. We lose a valuable opportunity by adopting the big stick approach rather than an incentive process when dealing with the essential issue of removing racial intolerance and prejudice from our community and the society we are all part of. A trap has been opened up here if we want to fall for the concept that the thought police seem to want to foster in our society. The enactment of a new crime covering what people say will be a serious erosion of the expression of free speech-and it is in the creative environment of free speech that community debate is stimulated on a whole range of national issues. My view-and I stand by this view-is that this legislation will erode this great principle. As I have said, I think there are far better ways to achieve those objectives which were flagged by the minister in his second reading speech. I note that the explanatory memorandum states: The Bill is based on the principle that no person in Australia need live in fear because of his or her race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. Those are sentiments the general thrust of which have my wholehearted support, and noone would be more anxious about them than 1. But the constant message I hear, particularly from my electorate, which contains a whole fruit salad of ethnic groups-Turks, Greeks, Italians, Indians, Pakistanis, Asians of all persuasions;Jr'",38
31,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,Yugoslavs.,41
32,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"Yugoslavs-I thank the member for Murray. I would have a fruit salad of ethnic groups in my electorate, not one of which has demanded of me the need for legislation of this nature to address the problem of ethnic prejudice that they encounter. I think there are far better ways to deal with this issue. The mind boggles in respect of the second major platform of this bill, which is the amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act. An amendment has been proposed which will allow a complainant to bring an action before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission about expressions made by. others. It is proposed that, if another person acts in a way which causes offence, insult, humiliation or intimidation because of race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, a case can be brought before the commission. The mind boggles at the potential for the commission to be inundated and bogged down with spurious complaints. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has not made clear-and I have been anxiously waiting to discover this-what I might be able to say today that I will not be allowed to say once this legislation is enacted. I think the Attorney-General has gone way past what is practical or capable of being managed in this measure because the scope is just far too wide. Unfortunately, people could offend, insult or humiliate deliberately, but sometimes it can happen quite innocently. It might even happen in a situation of poor taste. If it is deliberate, it is regrettable. But if it is part of bad taste or the original purpose is to highlight an issue which embraces the need to make comments about ethnic origin, I think this will simply lead to a huge myriad of complaints. My mind boggles when I try to imagine what will happen to journalists, cartoonists and comedians-for example, the journalist who wants to lambast the poms the next time they thrash us in a Test Match. The minister has not satisfied me that precautions against spurious complaint have been put into this legislation. This legislation is completely unnecessary. I believe that five or six hours of debate is unnecessary, and I oppose the bill. (TIme expired)",41
33,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (12.08 p.m.)The contribution by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), indicates exactly why this legislation is necessary. He expressed sentiments of regret as to this and that-but what is he going to do about it? That is the issue which is involved in this legislation. This legislation involves a fundamental issue of social justice. Why do I say that? Because we are talking here about the protection of the fundamental human rights of all Australians and, in particular, those groups of Australians which, unfortunately, the evidence tells us have been subjected to racist attacks, racist taunts and racist violence. We have made it perfectly clear, especially in the last 11 years since we have been in government, that we support multiculturalism, social justice principles, fundamental human rights and, as a part of that, access and equity. What do I mean by access and equity? I have special responsibility in the government for the access and equity program. This program is designed to ensure that all Australians, irrespective of their race or ethnic, cultural, language or even religious background, have a fair go, have equality not only in formal terms before the law but also in terms of the programs of the national government and the state governments that have also agreed to the access and equity program. We are talking about a wide range of programs here-employment, education, training, health, aged care, language services, the law and the Attorney-General's Department. In all of those programs and many others, the fundamental question is: do we have equality of access? Have we achieved what we as a society set out to achieve-that is, to ensure that everyone is treated equally irrespective of their racial, cultural and ethnic background? This year I have conducted 18 multicultural consultations throughout Australia on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Senator Bolkus. In those consultations we had a very wide range of people from the ethnic communities and people working with the communities. It became clear that there are still shortfalls. Some have to do with shortfalls on the part of government. I am going to address that issue in a report that is to be tabled in parliament in the next three weeks, but we will need further programs to address those shortfalls. I will be looking at further programs next year. The important point is that there is an additional element-discrimination on the basis of ethnicity and race. There is no doubt, unfortunately, that this discrimination continues. It is not widespread in the sense that it is everywhere, but it is significant. For example, in the area of employment, some employers, because people speak good English but with an accent, will refuse to employ them. They do not even give them an intel.'view. They do not even see them. When they do have a perfect English accent and get to an interview and the employer sees that they are of a different race or ethnicity to the mainstream, what do the employers do? They do not give them a fair go. I am not saying that is true of all employers but there is a significant group. This issue has to be tackled. You might say, 'Surely education is the way to tackle this issue.' Indeed, education is a primary element but, unfortunately, there is incontrovertible evidence in the report Racist Violence and in other reports before the government that the attitudes of some individuals and groups will not be fixed by simple education. Their attitudes are based on hostility, negativism and dogmatism, and they will not be changed simply by education. Those people who refuse to participate or to discuss the issues but actually go out and spread hatred of others because of ethnicity or race are the ones this bill is deliberately concerned with. I outline two situations that exist here. We have first the extremely bigoted individual who not only has negative attitudes towards other people because of their race ancl/or ethnic background but also expresses these views to others in the form of clear and blunt statements of hatred and who incites others to undermine the rights of those people, and even in some cases to physically harm them. The report Racist Violence documented many cases. It might be worth referring to a couple of them. The report states: A Migrant Resource Centre in Victoria reported the case of a second generation Australian woman of German descent whose neighbours waged a campaign against her, damaging her garden, throwing dirt over her fence, and shouting: 'Hei! Hitler, back to Germany'. ... ... A Lebanese family in Sydney was subjected to a 'terror campaign' for almost two months. They felt isolated in an area which had a reputation for -9stility to and racist violence against Muslims. After an increasing number of incidents, including attempts to set the house on fire and windows being broken by stones, the hus1:>and and father of the family suffered a stroke and heart-attack. and died. His physician attributed his death to the campaign. The family reported that repeated complaints to the police had not resulted in them obtaining any protection or in anyone being charged and, indeed, that the police had threatened family members with arrest because they did not believe their claims that the house had been attacked. Evidence to the inquiry from Jewish organisations indicates that attacks on Jewish community and religious centres, schools and businesses have occurred on an almost monthly basis ovyr the past two years. This included the fire bombing of a Jewish girls school in Sydney and damage to a range of business premises operated by or for Jewish people. Since that report, there have been many other incidents of attacks and hatred campaigns against the Jewish community. It is a nonsense to pretend that the phenomenon does not exist. In addition to the bigoted individuals, there are those more terrifying groups-the racist groups. The concern of these nasty and spiteful organisations is to directly threaten people because of their racial or ethnic background. These organisations often operate in a secretive fashion and often resort to violence or threats of violence. Irene Moss also talks about these in the report, which states: The Australian"" Nationalist Movement (ANM), centred in Perth, has been involved in a range of activities including fire bombing Chinese restaurants in Perth and conducting a concerted publicity campaign which had a significant effect on racial attitudes in Western Australia. Those who think that such campaigns do not have impact should note that point. It goes on: National Action (NA), centred in Sydney, has also been particularly concerned with the level of Asian migration to Australia, and has produced similar (although generally more sophisticated) stickers, .., go posters and leaflets as ANM. NA has paid particu. lar attention to action against groups opposed to racism. These racist organisations are a serious matter. How do members opposite expect to deal with these phenomena by saying 'It being regrettable', and, 'It happens, but let education take care of it,' or 'Let the society's progress take care of it'? Lest members of the House believe that such organisations do not exist, I can say to them that I have had direct personal experience of their existence and their tactics. I have not previously referred to these matters in this House. However, in the context debate and its importance, I want to make the following reference to illustrate the central point. In the years that I was chairman of the parliamentary and caucus immigration committees, which was a number of years, I received a number of letters which threatened to kill not only me but also members of my family and which insisted that I was not Australian because of my ethnic background and because of my views promoting multiculturalism, immigration, and racial and ethnic equality. Suffice it to say-and I do not want to go into details-that those who believe that these groups do not exist, or that this form intimidation does not exist, quite frankly do not know what they are talking about. Very few members of this House actually want to argue against the view that we should confront such individuals and such groups. Of course, there is another positive reason why we should do so: we in Australia are building one of the great multicultural societies of world. We are building a multicultural society based on a framework of social justice, equality of opportunity, tolerance and appreciit ation of cultural diversity. Most Australians enthusiastically endorse that concept. This multicultural society has been so successful that it is seen as a model by many other countries. Australia is continually receiving praise for its approach to multiculturalism. Recently, when I was in Cairo at the International Conference on Population and Development, a number of representatives of different nations specifically spoke to me about our policy of. multiculturalism and the positive impact which it has had. Given all of that, it is true to say that have that base of multiculturalism, of social justice and of tolerance, but we also have a significant minority of individuals and groups who are determined to tear that fabric apart. These people are not going to be thwarted simply by some sophisticated argument. They know what they are on about. They know what they do not want: a tolerant multicultural Australian society. They are out to tear it apart through their activities. So they embark on all kinds of campaigns of promoting racial of this hatred and ethnic vilification. From what we have heard, it is true that many members of the opposition-I do not know whether it is the majority or notsupport the idea of racial vilification or racial hatred legislation, including apparently the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). So we ask: why is the bill being opposed? This is a very difficult question to answer, especially since we are told that the opposition is going to produce an alternative bill based on New South Wales legislation. Yet the government of New South Wales, through its own Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs, supports our legislation. Anybody looking at of this would want to ask: what are the bona fides in this? Our legislation is being supported by Michael Photios, who is the Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs in the government of New South Wales. We are told that the opposition is going to draft something the based on the New South Wales legislation, as if this bill does not have any similarities with the New South Wales legislation. Of course does. Yet we can clearly see that those people in the Liberal Party who know what they are talking about in terms of the ethnic communities, who know what they are talking about in terms of these issues, support the legislation. We have a situation where the Leader of the Opposition is caught between those people in his party who do not want any legislation-and we have heard that from many of them here and it amounts to nearly the totality of the National Party-and those people who are prepared to look at some form of legislawe tion. What did he do? He came up with the ludicrous claim that he is going to present his own racial hatred bill as if that will be some alternative solution to the problem. That is nonsense. If opposition members had been content to honestly accept the fact that they are opposing the bill for no other reason than political opportunism and that they cannot bring the tensions within their own ranks together, at least some of us who feel very strongly about this bill would understand their position. But we have had the spectacle of members of the opposition in this House pretending to present valid arguments about the impact of the bill. If we looked at most of the arguments logically, we would find that we would not have any other bill. Most of the arguments have been against any form of racial vilification or hatred bill. So what is the opposition talking about bringing in an alternative bill for? Leaving that point aside, one argument has been put forward which is very misleading and is intended to try to create fear in the community. The absurd argument that I am referring to is when those opposite pretend that they are concerned about the impact of the bill on the ethnic communities of Australia. Let me make it perfectly clear: there is no doubt that these communities and their leaders overwhelmingly support the bill. Meetings of ethnic community leaders have applauded the bill. The New South Wales Ethnic Communities Council not only supported the bill but also condemned the opposition for opposing  support for the bill. So how can the opposition claim that the ethnic communities do not support the bill? Rather than direct our attention in their comments to racism, opposition members have been concentrating on claims that the bill will have an impact on the differing views held in different ethnic communities. In other words, the very communities that are most concerned to have the bill to protect their rights were told that they do not want the bill because there will be problems for them when the bill comes in because they will not be able to have debates or discussions between themselves. No evidence has been produced to support this claim, yet it has been made by a number of speakers, including the leader of the National Party, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the member for O'Connor <jM Tuckey). Each of them in one way or another has tried to tell us that the bill is going to have a negative impact on multiculturalism because the ethnic communities will not be able to discuss differences of opinion on political issues and other issues. This is a nonsense. This nonsense has to be exposed. This claim has nothing to do with free. speech. The. fact of the matter is that, if we. really support free speech, we must support the idea of the protection of the general framework of free speech. That means ensuring that there are limits to utterances when they promote racial racial hatred and undermine our multicultural society. (TIme expired)",42
34,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEES,"La Trobe) (12.28 p.m.)The Racial Hatred Bill is designed to prohibit certain conduct involving the hatred of other people on the grounds of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. There are· those on my side of this House of Representatives of the people of Australia who believe that the government brings this legislation to the parliament with less than pure motives. In making my contribution in the recent debate on the bill to guarantee sexual privacy, I accused the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) of 'creating a bit of mischief'. On this occasion, I will resist the temptation of impugning either the Attorney-General or the government's motives because I believe the issue is of basic and fundamental importance to the social harmony, tolerance and equality before the law in this great nation. All right thinking and tolerant individuals abhor racial hatred and racial vilification. I place myself at the forefront of those in our society who very strongly believe in fairness, equity, tolerance and understanding in all matters dealing with individuals in our communities, in our nation and in. society in general. I know a bit about racial hatred from two aspects. The first is as a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant male growing up in the redneck south of the United States. I was born into a society of apartheid. My childhood and early schooling years were spent in an atmosphere of paternalism by whites towards blacks. The blacks were accepted by the white society as inferior human beings of inferior intellect who were dirty, smelly and lived in shanty towns of their own which were tolerated but not accepted by the white community. We had black maid, but we never invited her, her husband, her children or her wider family dinner. I went to a white school and her children went to a black school. I went to white picture shows and her children went to black picture shows. I rode in the front of the and she and her family rode in the back of bus. I went to a white toilet and they went black toilets so that, according to the white society of the day, I would not be contamiorigin nated. I recall that we did business with a Jewish gentleman when I was a teenager. But we never invited him or his family to our house. We were not invited to his house, nor could he join the country club or any WASP organiwritten sation. As Mike Seccombe reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, when I was 13 I spent a summer in the potato and cabbage fields on the Atlantic coast in Virginia. I was the only white worker in the fields. The summer when I was 17 I worked in a steel building construction shop as a welder's helper, and welder was black. In both instances, when we sat down together to eat our lunch from a brown paper bag, we discussed race relademolition tions-the things that divided us and the Germany. things that we had in common. As a child, I was a racist. I was a product of the time, the society in which I lived and the attitudes which prevailed predominantly in that society. By the time. I reached university in a northany ern state of the United States, my attitudes were changing. I would like to think my attitudes toward race, creed, colour, origin, religion and ethnicity have continued to evolve over the years. One thing I can tell you I have learned through that time is that prescribing attitudes does not work but that education does. There is no place society for intolerance or hatred, and we must work together at getting rid of them. Gaol sentences will not change attitudes. I said that there are two aspects to my knowledge of racial hatred. The second of them is as a minority migrant in Australia. There are no doubt those in this place and in the broader community who would genuinely a doubt that someone born in the United States could be the subject of racial vilification or to hatred in Australia. Without canvassing the details, I can tell you that I have been and that it hurts. There are those of my colleagues who come from other countries and backgrounds who have described to me the incredbus ible racial ostracism to which they were the subjected as children and young adults into Australia. I know that their hurt and the hurt of many ethnic, religious and other country of people in Australia is real and much greater than mine. The point is that racial or religious slurs do hurt and have the potential to damage not only individual self-confidence but the basic fabric of our society. But so also has spoken, or symbolic hatred based on youth, sex, sexual orientation, facial expression, body shape and size, and so forth. All expressions of this nature are hurtful and destructive, but I remain singularly unconvinced that blackletter laws will deal with these issues in a satisfactory social context. We create laws to tell people what they my cannot do rather than what they can, and regulating thought is ever likely to be unsuccessful, as was demonstrably indicated by the of the wall between East and West I would make the general observation that, after almost six decades of living and travelling this world, we Australians have undoubtedly managed mass immigration better than other nation on earth. Invariably, I say to new Australians at citizenship ceremonies that Australia has become the greatest example on earth of a melting pot of the world's humanity without the racial and religious intolerance and hatred leading to violence and physical acts of desecration which are so prevalent in many other and older societies in both the in our developed and developing world. When I came in 1990 to join this House as a democratically elected representative of the people, I did so with some trepidation for fear that I might be rejected in this place because of my accent, and that people - might question my commitment to this country versus the country of my birth. I need not have worried. I recall that on 8 May 1990, as we left this place, having been duly sworn in as members of the House of Representatives of Australia, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) walked up to me, stuck out his hand and said, 'Well, Yank, I bet you thought you'd never make it.' I responded, 'Well, Ian, it wasn't exactly something I grew up as a child wanting to do.' The point of this is that, under the bill we are debating today, there might be those who would take the remarks of the honourable member for Barker as offensive. I took them as a term of endearment and friendship, and I still do. There has only ever been one person in this place who had the audacity to question my commitment to Australia because of my place of birth, and that was the former member for Capricornia who, in debate on a notice of motion raised by me condemning the Prime Minster for denigrating the Queen and the flag, stated that I was un-Australian and I should go back to Yankeeland. I was deeply offended, but I sought my recourse through the procedures of this place or would have sought it privately. I would never seek recourse for such statements via the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or through the courts. I note that the former member now resides at Her Majesty's pleasure in a Queensland gaol for other criminal offences. I made the point previously that, in my view, no other nation has managed mass immigration as well as Australia. That is not to imply that we are perfect, that we do not have problems or that there is not racism or intolerance in Australia. We all know that we are not perfect and that there is racial hatred, racial vilification and racial though we are good, we can certainly be better. It seems to me that the difference between the United States anQ Australia is that Americans have generally insisted on integration into the American society by its migrants and have not viewed with tolerance'outward manifestations of race or national origin. In recent decades, we in this country have done i- differently. We have allowed immigrants from other cultures to express their heritage and their conventions while quietly encouraging them and helping them to learn English and to become a part of the general Australian society. As a result, I see no evidence that we are breaking up into separate tribes, which seems to be occurring in the United States. We have managed better integration of other cultures into Australia than we have our relations with our own Aboriginals. We need to do very much better. I reject this bill because it is a serious intrusion into the very basic foundation stone of our democracy, which is freedom of speech. Every time we write another blackletter law to restrict freedom of speech, we chip away at that foundation stone and we undermine the very basis of the free and democratic society which has drawn to our shores so many people from countries of oppression. This bill is not an issue of rights or responsibilities; it is an issue of the basis of democracy founded on freedom of speech. A few selected quotations might help us to understand the nature of that very basic freedom. Firstly, Woodrow Wilson said: I have always been amongst those who believe that the greatest freedom was the greatest safety, because if a man is a fool the best thing to do is to encourage him to advertise the fact by speaking. It cannot be so easily discovered if you allow him to remain silent and look wise. But if you let him speak the secret is out and the world knows that he is a fool. #' Charles James Fox said: Opinions only become dangerous to a State only when persecution makes it necessary for the people to communicate their ideas under the bond of secrecy. Oliver Windell Holmes Jr, in Gitlow v. New intolerance. Even York 1925, said: It is said that this manifesto is more than a theory that it was an incitement. Every idea is an incitement. Lewis D. Brandeis, in a concurring opinion in Whitney v. California 1927, said: Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burned them. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears. They have said it all and much better than ever I could. There are four essential parts to this bill. Clauses 58 and 59 of part IVA make it a criminal offence to threaten to cause physical harm or to threaten to destroy or damage property because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any other person or group of persons. It should be an offence to threaten to damage persons or property and any fair society would deem it so. But I am advised that it is already an offence to threaten to cause injury to people or their property in each of the Australian states and the territories. The question in my mind is why we need such federal legislation when the states already have such statutes in place. I have listened to the speeches of some of the government members in this debate and they have spoken with justifiable alarm at property damage imposed on some religious institutions. We already have in place laws to deal with such offences. It remains only to catch the perpetrators and subject them to trial and justice. Clause 60 of part IVA would make it a criminal offence for the intention of inciting racial hatred if the action of a person is reasonably likely to incite racial hatred and is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or some or all of the people in the group. I cannot find in the legislation any requirement that actual incitement of racial hatred need take place. It would surely be unconscionable that we would consider imprisoning individuals for their intentions which have not been proved to have resulted in actual harm. The Attorney has not defined the term 'hatred' but instead will leave it up to each actual case in court for our jurists to determine exactly what constitutes hatred. It is a subjective term, not easily codified. The fourth section of the bill is found in clause 18C of part ITA, which makes it a civil offence to do an act which is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate another person or a group of people because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or some or all of the people in that group. Such a statute would absolutely offend any concept of freedom of speech. Thus during question time. I asked the Attorney-General a question involving the use of words such as 'bloody yank- and 'septic tank'. If those words were used against me I would find them extremely offensive, insulting and humiliating. I would likewise find it offensive, insulting and humiliating if someone called me a 'fat poofter' or a 'green toad' or anyone of a multiplicity of derogatory nouns and adjectives. If we legislate for every unkind thing that one person says to another, whether or not in public, our courts and our tribunals will be full to overflowing and division in the community will reach such proportions as to put at risk the very basic tolerant fabric of our Australian society. No-one likes to be insulted, but writing a law to prevent it just will not work. In a letter to me and I assume other members and senators, Richard Black of R.D. Black and Associates, Solicitors, of Cronulla, New South Wales made the following point which bears consideration and putting on the record: One of the enduring channs of Australians is that they do not give undue reverence to any person or to any institution, including political correctness. This very characteristic could involve a non reverent but also non racist Australian in a brush with a bureaucrat empowered by this proposed legislation for expressing criticism of immigration policy, including immigration levels and/or certain aspects of multi culturalism. In speaking to his justification for this bill, the Attorney-General has stated that there is an educative function associated with blackletter law. He has also stated that this proposed law is unlikely to be used, as the New South Wales legislation in this area has not been used. There is, however, a basic incompatibility between his position on the sexual privacy bill that federal legislation is needed, notwithstanding that the state laws which he wants to override are not used, and his position on this bill that the law will be educative or intimidate but is unlikely to be used. The Attorney-General has stated that he has consulted widely. Not only did he fail to consult the federal opposition but also he even withheld details of the bill until just prior to tabling. If he is so concerned that this legislation is urgent and necessary, I find it incredible that he did not even consider consulting this side of the House on the detail or even let us know what the bill would say. This legislation represents an attempt by the Attorney-General to regulate social behaviour through legislation. We all should know that such an approach is doomed to failure. This bill is not about rights of individuals; it is more about basic civil liberties. When it comes to civil liberties, this Labor government has not got clean hands. I draw to the attention of the House the government's prior attempt to introduce into Australia an identity card for every individual in Australia. The people of Australia quite rightly rejected that basic attack on their individual liberties and right to privacy. In the last parliament, the government rammed through the House and the Senate its political advertising bill, ·supported by the Australian Democrats, which was an attack on freedom of speech and freedom of press. Quite rightly, the High Court judged the government's attempt on that occasion to be unconstitutional. In the last parliament, I brought to the House a private member's bill to eliminate from the Industrial Relations Act a section which made it a criminal offence to criticise a commissioner of the Industrial Relations Commission or the commission itself. The government refused to process my bill through the parliament. But the High Court found that the government was wrong, that I was right and that clause 299(1)(d)(ii) of the Industrial Relations Act violated freedom of press and freedom of speech. The government has not got clean hands when it comes to basic civil liberties. I wish to make it clear that I will not be apologist or spokesman for the ultra rightwing race hate groups which might otherwise use my speech on freedom of speech. Racial hatred and vilification are to be deplored, but anti-racial hatred cannot be legislated against; we can only educate. Every restraint we put on freedom of speech lessens our ability to grow in positive ways as individ)lals, as communities, and as a nation.",45
35,Mr OCONNOR,COMMITTEES,"It g-ves me a great deal of pleasure to rise in House today to support the Racial Hatred Bill 1994. I commend the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) for bringing this legislation to this place. I do not intend to speak at great length on this bill, but let me say that the electorate of Corio, which I represent in this parliament, has a unique and diverse ethnic structure as far as regional communities are concerned. I am proud to say on the floor of this parliament that, over time, we in the Geelong community have forged a very peaceful and harmonious regional community. I have had only one letter opposing this particular legislation, in which I was called a Labor Nazi. I took that on the chin. I am pleased to report to the House that that was the only letter-a rather vehement letter-I received in opposition to the proposal that the government has put before us today. I am sure that, in the length and breadth of the electorate that I represent here in the parliament, there will be widespread support not only for the legislation but for the intent and purpose of the legislation and the sentiments that are behind it. Just because we in Australia have achieved what other societies have probably not been able to achieve-a high degree of racial harmony in a population with diverse ethnic origins-we ought not delude ourselves that the issue of racism is not critical to the future of Australian society. We have various ways of combating racism in this country. We can do so through the laws enacted by this parliament that the Attorney-General has put before us today which set out the basic parameters of conduct for citizens who wish to live in this society. We can certainly do so through education campaigns. Such campaigns have an been instituted in our schools and throughout our local communities to keep to the forefront of people's attention the need to put behind them, for the sake of the cohesion of the nation, some of the instincts that often surface in ethnic communities and various groups in the community. We also have a range of community initiatives and programs that are resourced by local, state and federal governments. They are designed to bring people from various communities together to share the their ethnic experiences, to encourage the expression of their origins, and to encourage them to be more tolerant of the cultures and customs of the wide diversity of people who make up Australia today. There are several central questions in this debate which I will canvas briefly. We need to ask ourselves whether the substance of this legislation is worthy of support from the national parliament of Australia. This bill is entitled the Racial Hatred Bill 1994. I do not think anybody in this community thinks that the issue addressed by this bill is not a substantial one and is not worthy of the strongest support of the parliament of Australia. We have debated here the necessity of this particular legislation. I alluded before to the fact that we ought not delude ourselves that we have a society which is free from the sorts of racial tensions and problems that abound in other societies throughout the world. It is to Australia's enduring credit that we have been able to put the community overlay on some of the tensions that perhaps have been brought to this country by ethnic communities. Despite the fact that we have a cohesive community here in Australia, there is a need for the Commonwealth parliament to state very clearly, through legislation of this type, the sorts of conduct it expects from each and every citizen when confronted with the issue of racial diversity. I am very interested to take up the issue of whether this bill will actually impede freedom of speech and expression, because that seems to be one of the fundamental arguments being raised in criticism of what the government is doing today. As far as the freedom of speech argument is concerned, we have to appreciate that society and its operations on a day-today basis is just a day-today story mise of the rights of citizens, the rights of assembly, the rights of expression, the rights of free speech and the rights of governments when they enact regulations and securities to protect the security of the nation, for example. I point out to honourable members opposite that, whilst they speak of freedom of speech here today, they ought to reflect on those people in our society who have a right to be free from harassment, who have a right to live in peace and harmony. This legislation quite clearly says to those people who may well compromise those rights to fr-dom from harassment and the freedom to live in peace and harmony that this society will impose severe penalties on conduct which is racially motivated. If we put ourselves in the position of various racial groups in this diverse society that we have in Australia today, we find that many of those people already engage in defensive behaviour because of their ethnicity. Where those people are subject to racial harassment, they may well engage in further reclusive behaviour which could mean that they fail to reach their potential in society. Society places restrictions on freedom of speech, and those particular restrictions have been canvassed in debate today. Governments impose certain restrictions on freedom of speech in the interests of national security. I think this particular legislation, although it does not in the main restrict freedom of speech, may impose some brakes on the behaviour of some people in our society on the basis of preserving national unity. This bill strengthens our vigilance in a very sensitive area. Let us call a spade a spade in this debate. The position of opposition members is being clearly articulated from a proposition that they are seeking to preserve the internal political cohesion of the coalition. It is not really motivated by the fact that they have a concern about freedom of speech because they know in their heart of hearts that this bill does not compromise it. Their opposition today has more to do with the politics of the coalition and the leadership issues of the coalition than with a clinical analysis of this bill and the manner in which it might or might not inhibit of the compro- freedom of speech. In the decade that I have been in public life, I have had a lot to do with groups that push racial hatred and racial disharmony. I have had a lot to do with the way in which they do that in the most deceitful and surreptitious of ways. I would have thought the members of the National Party of Australia would have been more sensitive to this piece of legislation than they are demonstrating in this House in this debate. In the past, the National Party has been the subject of deliberate undermining in its regional branches and its regional branch structures by organisations such as the Australian League of Rights. I say to members of the National Party that I am disappointed in the manner in which you have opposed this legislation because it is based on three reports that have a high degree of credibility in the Australian community. This bill is the product of widespread consultation with the Australian community, not over a period of months but over a period of years. If there is one party in this parliament that ought to be sensitive to the activities of organisations that engage in racist activities and peddle racist propaganda in all sorts of surreptitious guises, it is the National Party. But, of course, members of the National Party are laying down on this particular issue, and so are certain memb-rs .of the Liberal Party. I have never appeared on a platform with the League of Rights, as has the Leader of the Opposition. We have already canvassed that issue in this parliament. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that this is the time for some real leadership. It is not a time to be threatening colleagues who open their mouths in a coalition caucus with ejection from the shadow ministry. It is a time for the Leader of the Opposition to stand up in this parliament and do what his previous leader indicated he would do and support a rational and reasonable piece of legislation. On this one very simple and important issue to the Australian people, the Leader of the Opposition has failed. He has failed to give real leadership, not only within his own ranks but to the Australian community as well. We ought not to be here having any sort of divisive debate on this issue, but because of weak leadership and weak commitment to these sorts of principles we are having this debate today.",49
36,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEES,"Bradfield) (1.02 p.m.)This legislation is important. It is legislation which goes to the very heart of the rights of citizenship in this country. It is l-islation which affects every single person here whether that person arrived on a plane yesterday, is fourth or fifth generation Australian or is an Aboriginal Australian who can trace ancestry back indefinitely. As probably one of the rare people in this chamber, I lived for most of my youth in other peoples's countries, and I am very conscious of what racial discrimination is all about. I was discriminated against on numerous occasions. I saw other people discriminate against each other on the basis of race, on the basis of tribe, on the basis of colour and on the basis of religion. I saw people kill each other for some or all of those reasons. So the whole issue of incitement to commit a crime or to affect the rights of a fellow citizen for no other reason than an act of birth or a physiological reality is something that I take very seriously indeed. This legislation in many respects fails to achieve its own goals. Already speakers on this side have made the point that it smacks of a political exercise, and I think that is a fair description. If the government were genuine about trying to achieve its objectives, it would not have to use a steamroller to crack a nut irrespective of how hard that nut might be. Speakers on the government side have told us, in their sonorous tones, how the underpinnings of the Racial Hatred Bill are the various reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission. They have all been quoted here. But they have been selectively quoted. That is""the important point. I want to go through them in detail to emphasise how none of those reports has asked the government of the day to take criminal action or to make criminal matters which they. regard more appropriate to be left in the hands of the civil jurisdiction. . The Australian Law Reform Commission in its report Multiculturalism and the Law concluded that incitement to racist hatred and hostility should be made a civil offence dealt with by conciliation. The commission specifically rejected making it a criminal offence, noting that it would be unduly restrictive to freedom of speech. That is precisely the major objection of the opposition parties to this legislation. Commissioner Elliott Johnston QC, in his report to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, also recommended a civil offence the kind existing in New South Wales. He supported conciliation as a means of dealing with racial vilification, but he rejected the of criminal sanctions. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in its Report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence in Australia, also recommended creation of a civil offence of incitement to racial hostility. cases the commission rejected the view that incitement to racial hostility should be a criminal offence, and in that report on racist violence it concluded with these words: Incitement of racial hostility is not as serious outright racist violence and intimidation. It not, therefore, be subject to criminal laws criminal penalties. It should be dealt with as matter under the Racial Discrimination Act, with the same remedies, that is, conciliation and compensation, as provided for racial discrimination. It is important to note that it is already offence to threaten to cause injury to peothe ple-irrespective of their colour, their relineighbours, gion, their race or their property-in the Australian states and territories, although some jurisdictions the laws are limited to specific types of threats. In many cases the penalties are higher than those provided for this Racial Hatred Bill and accordingly, person were to threaten to destroy or to damage the property of another in New South Wales, that state's law, its Crimes Act, under section 199 provides that he or she would liable to imprisonment for five years. however, the threat were motivated by racial hatred and prosecution were commenced under this proposed amendment to the speaking, Commonwealth Crimes Act, the person would be liable to imprisonment for only one year. Surely this discrepancy between the penalty in the Commonwealth legislation and that in the state legislation runs a risk impression that racially motivated crimes are treated less seriously than crimes motivated for other reasons. Essentially, therefore, our concerns about this legislation can be put down to the fact that the government's claim that it is on the advice of successive reports by royal commissions is false. The whole issue really turns on whether these requirements should of covered by the criminal and civil. provisions and to what extent. In other words, what is the fair level of legal involvement where use involvement could well result in a diminution in the rights of the citizen to freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly-which obviously flows from it-which are put at risk if the government brings down legislation of such a character that it interferes with those In all of those fundamental rights? I would like it to be said that no Australian supports racist words or actions that involve threats to injure or to damage people or their property. Unfortunately, we all know that as there are Australians, just as there are people need of every nationality, who throughout history, and from time immemorial, have sought to distina civil guish themselves from others and to take action that they regarded as appropriate but which we would regard as grossly inappropriate. The events of Rwanda in recent months an are an outstanding and poignant example of extremes and the excess to which people, villages and communities can go once they get a lust to emphasise the differin ences between one group and another. As I said, I grew up in communities like in that and I saw it happen. There is nothing if a more frightening than to see people dying because of their race, to see their houses blown up, destroyed and burnt, and their possessions with them, for no other reason be than race. Fortunately, through most of our If, history-and, of course, many Aboriginal Australians would exclude themselves from this comment-Australia has been, relatively a nation that has been at peace with itself. There is no doubt that no member of the opposition parties would suggest that any citizen should have to live in fear of such threats or to tolerate people who incite others of giving the to make such threats. This legislation falls into two parts. There are the criminal provisions which allow people to be sent to gaol, and there are the civil provisions which allow a person who objects to a racist remark to take the person acting who made those comments to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The question is: to what extent has this be legislation gone? To what extent has the government fallen into the trap of trying to use this legislation in the guise of changing what it perceives to be a social wrong into a political advantage? The opposition believes that this legislation goes further than is necessary or appropriate to combat racial harassment. It goes further than is necessary to send a message to the wider community that such conduct is unacceptable. For that reason, we have committed ourselves to preparing legislation which will solve some of these problems and which will, at the same time, not contain the obvious difficulties which we have found in this legislation. We are going further than that. The government, with all its talk, has not, as far as I am aware, seriously put forward the proposition that budget appropriation should be made available for a community education campaign to make people more aware of the need for racial tolerance. The opposition has committed $10 million over two years for that purpose. Clause 60 of this bill is the essence of the criminal provisions. It states that a person must not, with the intention of inciting racial hatred against another person or a group of people, do an act, otherwise than in private, if the act is reasonably likely to incite hatred and is done because of the race, colour or nationality or ethnic origin of the other person. The penalty is one year in gaol. We believe that clause 60, as it is currently drafted in this bill, is a fundamental denial of the rights of freedom of speech. It establishes a new class of offence which impacts upon expressions of opinion rather than expressions of violent intent-which, of course, we would not support. Such an incursion is objectionable and unwarranted. We will not support a criminal sanction for expressing a view and encouraging others to adopt it when it does not incite people to damage property or persons. To create an offence of inciting racial hatred, but to fail be able to link the incitement to darrmge to a person or a person's property, makes it an offence to try to get other people to agree with your own view. However wrong my view may be, in a free society which claims to believe in freedom of speech, I am entitled to argue with my colleague the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) that the world is flat. He will not believe it, but I still have the right to demand that he believe it. I can even shout at him to try to make him believe it, but he will still say to me, 'The world is not flat.' Mr Thckey-How do you know?",51
37,Mr CONNOLLY,COMMITTEES,"Touche! This issue is a fundamental one. This bill is a serious and inappropriate infringement of freedom of speech. We do not believe that a person should be put in gaol for encouraging others to adopt a view, however vile and racially prejudiced that view may be. We do not support laws that restrict what other people say, even when the vast majority of people believe that the remarks themselves are offensive or that they undermine our democratic system. It is worth remembering that Australia is essentially a nation of migrants. Australians come from hundreds of destinations. We come from a myriad of cultures, creeds, races and communities. We came here together to build a new land, a land based on freedom, a land based on the rights of the individual to say what he likes, provided-to paraphrase Lord Hailsham-'My freedoms end where yours begin'. That is the essential ingredient and we must never lose sight of it. Section 60, as it is proposed in this legislation, goes much further than any similar criminal offence in any state jurisdiction in Australia. In New South Wales, for example, which has a similar piece of legislation which has been quoted by many speakers in this debate, only threats or incitement to violence towards people or damage to property are criminal. That difference is crucial. The criminal sanction is justified when incitement is associated with threats to violence or damage to property. There are serious doubts as to whether to criminal sanctions are appropriate for expressing an opinion. The three reports I have referred to have covered that to some degree, and the case on that point stands without any difficulty. We have people such as Father Frank Brennan saying that racial vilification laws would only encourage the thought police and stifle public debate. Other people such as Phillip Adams take similar views, making the point that it is better to have bigots in the open than to have them hidden behind the doors. These are men-and there are women in our community as well-who have been forthright over the years in defending the right to freedom of speech. Father Frank Brennan would be one of the most outstanding Australians in his unremitting support for Aboriginal welfare. All he has ever done is try to establish in the minds of the Australian community that Aboriginals are Australians entitled to a fair go and to the same range of rights, privileges and responsibilities as any other Australian citizen. The fact that he says this legislation contains within it the seeds its own destruction and the potential to create an environment which makes it more difficult for him to be able to stand for the principles that he believes are important and more difficult for him to work for Aboriginal advancement is something this government should take very seriously indeed, in light of the views it has espoused over recent months. I return to the New South Wales legislation. I made the point that no other jurisdiction in Australia has civil standards comparable to those in this bill. The New South Wales act, for example, limits civil action for incitement to racial hatred to acts that 'incite hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of a person or group of persons on the grounds of the race of the persons'. That sets a much more appropriate standard than the looseness contained in this bill, where we find words such as 'offend', 'insult', 'humiliate' and 'intimidate'. The simple fact is that they are all words closely associated with value judgments. What the honourable member for O'Connor finds an insult I would probably find absolutely appalling. What he finds offensive I may not find offensive. What someone else may find humiliating I may not find humiliating. If somebody tries to intimidate me, I may think it is a joke. The point I am making is that how we react to these individual words and the expressions which are used to reach those conclusions varies indisputably from person to person and, of course, is often influenced by the environment in which the person grew up and by experiences he or she previously had. So to create an offence of inciting racial hatred at large makes it an offence to try to get other people to agree with your own view. An offence is committed even if there is no urging of the other people to act on that view. Surely, that is a serious infringement of the rights of freedom of speech. There are related constitutional questions regarding decisions recently emanating from the High Court that we believe would strengthen the view that if these cases found their way to the High Court there is every possibility that the court would find them of lacking in legal basis and the view that the laws prohibiting such discussion would be unconstitutional unless the government can show a counterbalancing public interest-or, more precisely, a public good. No doubt the government will claim that the public interest is freedom from racial harassment, but there is a good chance that the High Court would say in response that the law is too heavyhanded and that there are other measures such as education to combat racial harassment that would not impact on freedom of speech. To sum up, while there is much to be said for a situation where civil remedies should be sought, there is a genuine problem which we have with this legislation in relation to its criminal provisions. There are three provisions in particular in the criminal context: proposed sections 58, 59 and 60. It is proposed section 60 which we find offensive, and it is principally on those grounds that we cannot support this legislation.",53
38,Mrs EASSON,COMMITTEES,"I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this most timely issue. The issue has been widely canvassed and, I am sorry to say, a lot of misunderstanding has grown up over this matter. I hope to be able to help minimise this misunderstanding and to maximise the self evident virtues of the Racial Hatred Bill. Every member of this House is aware that Australia is not racially, religiously or culturally homogenous. Many countries in the world are, including Iceland, Norway, Japan, Nepal, the Pacific island states and Bolivia. However, Australia is not, and this is recognised by our policy of multiculturalism. Multiculturalism has a lot of enemies in Australia. Many people think that multiculturalism is, or will lead to, multinationalism. I think that these people are wrong. Objectively, this fear of multinationalism has no basis in any perceivable development in Australia today. The fact on the ground today is that various religious, racial and cultural groups live together with minimal strife. I am not saying that there is no strife. Australia is not some kind of Garden of Eden. But there are certainly no group antagonisms, and there is no group violence, of the kind one sees every day in Europe, the Balkans and the USA. The reasons for this major level of calm and normality are ""not easily known. I suppose our national character is the principal reason that we are able to calmly cope with and absorb all who come to Australia. There is, in fact, great social pressure in Australia not to cause a fuss. One does not have to conform to the external way of dress or lifestyle, but there is serious pressure to conform in the matters of tolerance and not interfering in another person's life. This conformism is good and beneficial. We are a nation drawn from every part of the world, and our social order requires that tolerance and non-interference be our most important public social values. Because the causes of violence are so widespread in our country, we must make a serious, ongoing effort to avoid igniting these causes. This bill will strengthen this required serious and ongoing effort. The opponents of this bill are of the view that the bill will infringe freedom of speech. Whilst I never impute malevolent attitudes to my opponents, I must ask whether they know what freedom of speech is. The law in Australia allows for court action in questions of defamation, libel and slander. I will leave the strict definitions of these words to mt legally learned colleagues. But everyone knows that, if Mr X says a certain thing about Mr Y, Mr Y may take legal action to punish Mr X and, most importantly, may obtain a court order to prevent Mr X from repeating his offending remark. Is this not a curbing of freedom of speech? The rules of this chamber prevent me from expressing my honest and truly held beliefs concerning some of the members of the House of Windsor. Should I begin to do so, the members for Warringah (Mr Abbott) and O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) would be quick to curb my freedom of speech. So, when any member here says that he or she is opposing a bill because of a question of freedom of speech, let that member also say that he or she is only a partial and qualified supporter of the practice of free speech. Let that member say that he or she does not support my right to express my views on some of the members of the House of Windsor, or the right of anyone else to express certain views on the financial probity of the member. None of us believes in absolute freedom of speech. Each of us would immediately take action to silence an offending opponent, if the rules of this House, or a solicitor's advice outside the House, made such a silencing possible. I wish to read into Hansard part of a letter from the former Liberal senator, Mr Chris  the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board. The letter is from the Australian of 4 November 1994, and it reads in part: ' The experience ""'of NSW, well tested over five years, is that appropriately drawn racial vilification laws provide the basis for public education to eliminate racism; allow conciliation to take place, to the benefit of all parties; does not impede free speech, create martyrs or drive people underground; makes a clear declaration of our public policy and provides ultimate sanctions which ought to be available in any society where respect for the rights of individuals and their protection together with promoting tolerance and social cohesion are amongst our highest and most noble goals. This excellent letter from a genuine Liberal clearly captures the main points of a federal bill. It is a great pity that members opposite are so trapped by their own political frustrations that they are unable to think clearly about this matter. It is very interesting to see who is opposing this legislation. One sees a great preponderance of middle-aged white men. One does not see a lot of support for the Liberal-National position from the groups who are the regular receivers of racist abuse and violence. The opponents of this legislation say, and rightly so, that abusive language and behaviour already incur the punishment of the law. This is true; but it is also true that an individual act of abuse or violence should, where possible, be identified by the reason for the act of violence or abuse. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), Leader of the National Party, like me, is a Catholic. If last year every Catholic church in Australia had been burnt down, would he say that this was just so many hundreds of cases of arson, or would he say that there was a wave of anti-Catholic violence sweeping Australia? I think he would say the latter. Similarly, racist abuse and violence are not directed either at the honourable member for Farrer or at me, as the member for Lowe, but are directed at Asians, Jews and Arabs, not because they have done something offensive to someone but simply because they exist and are Asian, Jewish or Arab. To these people, the abuse and violence is not general and undirected. It is specific and particular. It has not happened to them as a bit of bad luck. It has befallen them from a perpetrator who was consciously looking for someone in the targeted category-just as the anti-Catholic arsonist would not look for just any building but for a particular building of a specific class. The sad fact is that nearly every member of this parliament is from the white middle class, which is the least threatened social group in Australia. Members opposed to this bill should take the time to read the 1991 report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence, an inquiry conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. What we are seeing in the opponents of this legislation is a dramatic failure of their collective social imagination. They themselve-, white and well-connected, cannot imagine being nonwhite and isolated and subjected to a relentless regime of terror-verbal abuse at first and then possible physical terror. Let me give a small example. Last year the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Melbourne published a survey of 630 students in years 11 and 12 at Melbourne schools. Of the 100 Vietnamese refugee students in that group, 69 per cent said that they had experienced racism at school. Can 69 per cent of this House say that they have experienced racism at school? Fifty-nine per cent said that they had experienced it in the street. Can we say we have had that experience? And 14 per cent said that they had endured race-based physical threat or injury. The answer to each of these questions, if applied to us, would be no. Very large numbers of Australians are not like us. Many look different, sound different and were not born here. We invited them to come here and we have a duty of care towards them. The Liberal Party has a very serious problem out in the electorate. Opposition to this bill, even on the phoney 'free speech' basis, is perceived as blunt indifference to a very serious problem that is encountered by very many Australians. The opposition's attitude to migrants in Australia is that they, like children, should be 'seen and not heard', and this patronising attitude by the Liberals is repaid to them by migrants on election day. I hold an electorate where 50 per cent of the people were born overseas or have a parent who was. To these people, racist and ethnic abuse and violence are real and painful. They do not see that some people should have the right to abuse or to bash them because they were born in Saigon or Beirut, or because they are walking into a synagogue, or because they are wearing a headscarf. The Liberals seem to think that these outbursts of verbal and physical violence are not really serious: the woman in the headscarf who is punched is just unlucky, not Muslim; the building burnt is just unlucky and not a synagogue; the boy stabbed by skinheads is just unlucky and not an Asian. Our nation must take an implacable stand against racism. Its verbal and physical outbursts offer nothing to our future. We must have this bill and we must apply the social pressure to squeeze racism out of the Australian public arena. Racists can scream and yell about Asians and Jews and Arabs and Aborigines and anyone else they dislike in their own homes. On the streets and in public the rights of everyone must be preserved. And the rights are not grace and favour handed out by whites as they feel like it. If we get to that stage, our country will decline as fast as those in other places-in Europe, in the Balkans and in the USA-have declined because they allowed mentally ill racists to inflame society with the curse of racism. This bill does not attack freedom of speech; it attacks the public tolerance of racist speech. If we declare our intolerance of racist speech, the social ethos will evolve over time away from racism. This is the aim of the bill. I support this aim and I commend the bill to the House.",54
39,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"I am amazed at the speech just made. The member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) obviously has forgotten the occasion when a certain sheik in Lakemba said despicable and obnoxious things about the Jewish community and her leader and Bob Hawke went to dinner with the man that said those things. They did it to gain favour and funds during the 1990 election campaign. So members opposite should not come into this House and hold the Labor Party up as pure. I want to say to the people of Australia that this is the most hypocritical piece of legislation I have seen from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I will read to the House the remarks made by that sheik, that imam, that religious leader, which the Labor Party endorsed by attending a fundraising dinner that he put on. These are the words that he said about the Jewish community. These are the things that he said that were endorsed-bigoted, vile things. This was not pursued by the government under any of its legislation at the time but implicitly endorsed by the bigoted Prime Minister. I read from a report in the Bulletin dated 16 October 1990: Hilaly arrived in Australia on a thr--month visitor's visa in 1982, aroused controversy within the Moslem community which had brought him out and finally made the headlines in 1988 when he to}4 Sydney University Moslem students that Jews were a cancer in European society, the underlying cause of all wars and that they tried to control the world through sex, sexual peJ;Version and the promotion of espionage, treason and economic hoarding. Those are the words of that religious leader, an ethnic religious leader whom your party endorsed. I displayed to the House at the time the photograph of Bob Hawke, the Prime Minister, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) and all of that right-wing bunch from New South Wales sitting at a head table having dinner with this religious leader, endorsing these vile remarks. Talk about vilification and incitement to racial hatred, and the Labor Party took not one step against this individual. Not one step did the Labor Party take to prevent those words. The best the Australian Labor Party could do in government at that time was flick it off to the Ethnic Affairs Commission of New South Wales and hope that it would deal with it. There was not one word of racial vilification legislation at that time. There was not one word to withdraw the visitor's visa or temporary visa entrusted to that religious leader. Instead, the government rewarded his patronage by granting him permanent residency of Australia. Those are the standards of Australian Labor Party; those are the standards of the people that are bringing into the House racial hatred legislation-aOfJ they claim themselves to be pure. They are not pure. This is a stunt. They do not believe in it. Their actions show they do not believe in condemning people who display racial intolerance or racial hatreds. There is not a member of their leadership team that believes in this legislation. They are a bunch of bigots and hypocrites in the way in which they behave. Look at the record",57
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! On two occasions the honourable member has referred to bigots. On one occasion he specifically referred to the Prime Minister as a bigot. I do not know what the previous practice of this chamber has been, but I find that that word could cause offence. I ask the honourable member for Mitchell to avoid the use of such terminology.",57
41,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I quote again from the Bulletin of 16 October 1990. At page 110 it says: Keating told parliament that he and other Labor Members of parliament",58
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The honourable member for Mitchell will refer to the Prime Minister by his correct title.,58
43,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,I am quoting precisely the words in the Bulletin.,58
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I will accept that.,58
45,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"The quote reads: Keating told parliament that he and other Labor Members of Parliament-including the Speaker, Leo MCLeay-had made representations on Hilaly's behalf. ""This man is a religious leader of a very large community within my electorate and surrounding electorates,"" Keating said. The president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Leslie Caplan, says there has been a complete failure by Hilaly to resile from attacks on Jews and on Australian society and that the ECAJ has endless reports about Hilaly's antiJewish and anti-Christian statements at the Lakemba mosque. If the government is serious, it should do something. It should not come in here with this stunt which it calls legislation. The legislation is worrying enough. The government quotes the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and endless reports as the basis of this legislation. What it fails to do is to give the House the exact quotes from, and recommendations of,· those reports. Nowhere do those reports recommend criminal sanctions for racial vilificatioJl or racial hatred. The government has gone over the top. It is beating its hairy chest in front of ethnic communities and it is going to raise criminal sanctions. The government is quoting the wrong authorities; Why not quote the Prime, Minister and his wonderful attitudes to racial hatred and vilification? If there is a dollar in it for the Labor Party, the Prime Minister will bend to anybody. That is the fact of the matter. We have seen that happen. It has occurred.. It is on the record. It is in the newspapers. That is exactly what has occurred. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) bases the authority for this Racial Hatred Bill on a number of reports: the report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence; the Australian Law Reform Commission report Multiculturalism and the law; and the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Not one of those reports recommended that there should be criminal sanctions. In fact, those reports argue strongly that the educative, persuasive process should be used in racial intolerance, racial hatred or racial vilification laws. There is a strong argument that there is an educative process that people need to understand. Tolerance is the preeminent goal. Happy working relationships between people, irrespective of race, should be the goal of this legislation. What has the government done? It has done precisely the opposite. It has decided to be heavy handed. It has decided to use criminal his sanctions. It has decided to bring in factors that were argued against in these reports. The reports in fact indicate that words such as 'complaints about hurt feelings and injured sensibilities' and 'words that offend, irritate in mind or feeling, causing resentful displeasure' need to be dealt with with great care in any legislative approach to vilification and racial hatred. The government has stepped straight into that minefield without any definitions. With this legislation, the government has opened a Pandora's box of definitions. It has failed to define 'racial' . It has declined to define 'hatred'. International courts have stepped back from defining 'hatred'. They have refused to move into that area because it is a subjective term that is difficult for courts to define. I invite the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) to look at what other countries have done. They have declined to define the word 'hatred' because it is a subjective term. Yet government members, without definition, have used that word throughout the legislation. What are they going to do when that matter comes before the courts and the courts find that they too cannot define hatred or find a term that matches hatred because it is a subjective term? What are the courts going to do when they come up against hurt feelings, injured sensibilities, offences and things like that? They can be soft words but people may take umbrage. This government, instead of following the patterns of the states of Australia, has launched into a brand new world that no other country has explored. The government does it simply from a sense of guilt, because the fact of the matter is that its behaviour demonstrates that it has other attitudes. Its behaviour demonstrates that if it is in a fundraising mode for an election campaign it will back the most vile racist statements about the Jewish community in Australia. The government will support the leaders of those communities condemning Jews and it will take their money.",58
46,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,I raise a point of order.,59
47,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,You hadbettet have a reason.,59
48,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"Don't you talk, you disgraceful individual. This disgraceful speech has gone far enough. The honourable member for Mitchell has made allegations time and again that the Prime Minister and others have supported the comments of Sheik el-Hilaly.",59
49,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEES,You did. You had lunch with him.,59
50,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,That is absolutely false.,59
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"There is no point of order. Would the Parliamentary Secretary allow me to comment? I believe that the honourable member for Mitchell has skirted perilously close to casting aspersions on the motives of the Labor Party. If the Prime Minister attends a function, the insinuation is being slightly conveyed that it is for monetary gain. I think he is skating on thin ice and perhaps he could modify the expressions he is using.",59
52,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"If I meant to imply that Mr Keating was Prime Minister at that time, that is certainly incorrect. He was Treasurer and Mr Hawke was the Prime Minister. They were both at the dinner. If I have made comments that have misled slightly ih regard to the status of each individual then I withdraw those but I do not withdraw the descriptions I have offered of their behaviour because it is an accurate description. Mr Keating himself has endorsed that. I will read again from the article for the benefit of the Parliamentary Secretary.",59
53,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,Point of order. The honourable member has specifically said that when the Prime Minister was Treasurer he had a meeting. To say that because he had a meeting with a certain gentleman he therefore approves and concurs with certain views stated by that gentleman is false.,59
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"There is no point of order. I am listening to this debate very carefully, and I will be very quick to ask for withdrawals if I believe the honourable member for Mitchell has used unparliamentary language or made what I consider to be unparliamentary insinuations.",59
55,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"I know you will, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I will obey you instantly. I will just repeat for the benefit of the Parliamentary Secretary the words of Mr Keating as reported in the Bulletin of 16 October 1990 when he said of Sheik elHilaly: This man is a religious leader of a very large community within my electorate and surrounding electorates. What he was saying was that he supported the application",59
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,With all due respectjif',59
57,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,I am just reading from the Bulletin. I have not gone beyond that point.,59
58,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Please let me finish. With all due respect, I am listening very carefully, and you are reading from a published document. I was going to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he allows me to handle this situation I think we can get through it with minimal disruption.",59
59,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"You have my regard, Mr Deputy Speaker, and my trust in your exercise of your duty. I will go on with the legislation. The fact of the matter is that the Attorney General has sought to muddy the waters and cloud the reason for bringing this legislation forward. He has claimed to the House-and in doing so I believe is going close to misleading the House-that the basis of authority is three important reports presented to the Australian parliament. Those reports do not suggest criminal sanctions. In fact, they argue against that and argue for a quite different approach in the way in which the Australian government should handle these issues. Why can the government not be honest with the Australian people? . This and the Tasmanian legislation on human rights are completely opposite principles. The government has asserted in the Tasmanian case that privacy is the important thing Australians need to have. It has said, 'Nothing must interfere with an Australian's privacy. We will knock out every state law that stands between an Australian and his privacy.' That was the attitude. Government members come in here today and say, 'Oh, freedom of speech-that's not so important. We impede that every day. No Aussie really needs to have freedom of speech. We've got laws for this and laws for that, and here we are going to knock around freedom of speech a bit more but that really does not matter.' The Australian Labor Party as a group has inconsistent values that really do not give any direction to Australia. What it is doing is just imposing a political regime because it happens to suit it. It has got no consistency in way in which it approaches this thing. Even former Senator Walsh gave the government a real serve yesterday in the Australian Financial Review when he raised the inconsistencies of the government's approach to basic human rights of the Australian people. It is prepared to fiddle with one in Tasmania because it suits it politically and to adopt an absolutely opposite attitude with another one because it thinks that will gain it favour with particular groups of the Australian community and in the process cause trouble for the Australian Liberal Party. The government is wrong. We have taken a stance that we believe is right. We do not believe that the way in which the Attorney-General has approached this is consistent or sustainable. Let me look at some of the statements and assertions that he has made. He says that racial hatred is not an everyday occurrence, and he then scratches around to find some instances of it. What he needs to do is to look at the legislation the states have, not reinvent the wheel, and to embark on an educative program. The Australian Labor Party proclaims itself to be the great advocate of racial harmony. I remember Bob Hawke doing that. I have given examples of where Bob Hawke's personal behaviour and his comments do not match up. The Australian Labor Party likes the facade of legislation but legislation without any substance behind it. It is a choice between legislation and education. The Attorney is wrong. Australian people really are some of the most tolerant in the world, and anybody that says anything different needs to look at our rating by world standards of the freedoms that we have here. I have heard speeches in this House saying, 'The Poms and our British heritage wrecked everything. If only they hadn't come, everything would have been all right.' It is the very fact that we have a parliamentary democracy and the freedom of the courts and the processes by which this country is governed that means that the Australian Labor Party is allowed to introduce the legislation that it is introducing. In many other countries, including some of our near neighbours, this could the never happen, because the elitist heritage would mean that there could never be any changes. But this is a vital and open democracy, one that invites people to participate, and members of the Australian Labor Party criticise the roots of this democracy as being the very factors that restrict it. Not so. It is dynamic, it is growing and changes are being made. I think that the Australian Labor Party needs to look at where it is heading on these issues. It is writing a whole lot of new national laws that are overriding the states. It is setting an agenda and a system of attitudes or values for Australia not sought out from the Australian people themselves and is in many instances overriding the states.",59
60,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,Huh!,60
61,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEES,"The parliamentary secretary scoffs. Let me give some examples. The penalties under the criminal codes in the states for some things-the destruction of property and the threat to destroy-are probably much tougher than here in this legislation. If I were a lawyer I would say, 'Oh, he smashed up the house but he was racially· bigoted when he did that.' In that case he would go to gaol for one year instead of five years, which is the punishment under the criminal law of New South Wales. That is what the government has done. It has weakened the consistency of the criminal code. Do members opposite want an example the acts and the laws and the processes? It obvious that the parliamentary secretary not read the legislation, because there gross inconsistencies between what has done and what it is said is going to be done. The very basis of the law is wrong. The approach is wrong and the results will be cess. wrong. The thing that really rankles me and people on my side is the hypocrisy of members opposite. They will not take action against racists and they will not stand up a party against people making despicable statements. That is condemnation alone.",60
62,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEES,"Northern Territorynourable Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for· the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (1.51 p.m.)-I am very pleased to be involved in this debate today as a strong supporter of this legislation. I want to make an observation the honourable member for Mitchell Cadman), who is leaving the chamber. It We concerns members of the New South Wales of Liberal Party. Their support for this legislaHatred tion has been stated on a number of occasions in the course of this debate. I am not quite sure how the honourable member for Mitchell marries that up with his own position or the position which was advocated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). The Leader claim of the Opposition on 26 June said: Where there is incitement to violence or to damaging property on the basis of race, then there's no question that should be a criminal offence. The then shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), said in February 1993: . . . the coalition supported the underlying principle of Labor's draft law which creates a criminal offence of racial incitement . . . We can contrast that with the reports in the press of the last couple of days showing that on the surface at least the Leader of the Opposition and his now deputy have voiced their strong support for the objectives of this legislation. We see in today's Australian that the Ethnic Coalition of Australia called on the Leader of of the.Opposition to honour a commitment made is by the former opposition leader, the honourhas able member for Wentworth' (Dr Hewson). are The current Leader of the Opposition basibeen cally said to them that if they bucketed the opposition in the press as a result of their position then he would deny them acIn a sense what he is saying to them is, 'Look, just shut up. Don't worry about the principles of free speech and don't worry as about acknowledging our position. You just say what we want you to say or don't say anything.' The contradiction between the two positions ought to be obvious even to the homember for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I would like to refer to page 2 of yesterday's Australian because I think that demonstrates very clearly the motive behind the position adopted by the opposition. The headline reads 'Nats force backdown on race Bill'. to The text has the Leader of the National Party (Mr (Mr Tim Fischer) saying: do not need in this country a prescriptive piece legislation suc;,h as the Government's Racial Act to handle racial tensions. That is quite contrary to the position previously adopted by the Leader of the Opposition and the then shadow Attorney-General. I quote also this part of the same article: The anti-legislation MPs within the Coalition to be taking their orders from party organisational policy. In September, the federal council of the party moved a motion opposing any legislation. The resolution reads that the party ""strongly"" opposes the Government's proposed legislation ""on the basis that it would restrict our freedom of speech and prevent honest criticisms of certain unjust behaviour, religious biases and malpractices, and certain government policies which are not, in the nation's best interests (eg Immigration Polii cies)"" . I think it is obvious that what the opposition is all about is the position of the Leader of the Opposition. It is about the opposition's internal strife and how to maintain a leader who is just hanging on but waiting for someone to kick the chair out from underneath him. I wonder if that will be the honourable member for O'Connor. I would like also to make a point about people who have expressed support or otherwise for this legislation. I noted an article in the Australian of Tuesday by Ron Castan, an eminent QC and civil libertarian, who was once president of the Council for Civil Liberties. In this article he said why he originally adopted an approach which might be in line with the approach of the opposition currently. The article states: Some years ago, when president of the Council for Liberties, I also opposed any laws dealing with racial vilification, on idealistic ""free speech"" grounds. I changed my mind while· working with Irene Moss on the National Inquiry into Racist Violence. We surveyed 580 ethnic Australians, most of whom were recent immigrants. The majority had complaints of specific acts of racial violence or ment they had suffered. Recent research suggests that incidents of racist speech and violence in Australia are increasing. It is simply not the case that existing laws always adequately cover racist acts that clearly amount to threats of violence, harassment or incitement, especially in those States stilI without racial vilification laws. The Northern Territory does not have racial vilification laws. My electorate of the Northern Territory has not had a proud history in this regard. I refer to a part of our history which, while we all acknowledge it happened, we all wish had not happened, and that is the attitude of conservative elements in the Northern Territory community towards Aboriginal self-determination and Aboriginal rights. During the 1970s and early 1980s, particularly over the issue of the legal rights of the Jawoyn people to lodge the Jawoyn-Katherine area land claim in 1978 until the grant of the Nitmiluk Park claim in 1989, local Aboriginal people of Katherine faced organised, albeit sporadic, racial attacks and acts of racial vilification. Shortly after the land claim was lodged, groups such as Rights for Whites sprang up in Katherine and waged a low-level campaign that culminated in 1982 with a major street demonstration in Katherine one Saturday morning. That demonstration was led by the then Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, Les Macfarlane. That same parliamentarian, for a number of weeks, displayed outside his electorate office a strip of racist cartoons attacking Jawoyn and other Aboriginal people in the Katherine region. The cartoons were based on crude drawings and the worse kind of racist stereotyping. I have a copy of one of the cartoons here which talks about 'Katherine for whites'. What was the intent of that particular cartoon or of the march that this person led if it was not to incite racial vilification? During the period surrounding this and during the public demonstration, false claims were made about the Jawoyn people, including allegations that they would damage the local economy, restrict or prevent access to harasspublic land at Nitmiluk, and that they would be manipulated by outside forces. During this period, two senior Jawoyn men had shots fired at them. By whom? By supporters of Les Macfarlane, then Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. That is the attitude which some of our conservative friends adopt. That is not the only example. I listened to the pathetic contribution to this debate earlier in the day by the member for Moore (Mr Filing). I was in Western Australia in the late 1970s participating in an election assisting Ernie Bridge to be elected to the Western Australian parliament. At that timeand I am sure the member for O'Connor will recall it- Mr Bridge's opponent was a mail called Ridge. Ridge attempted to adopt every possible course to prevent Aboriginal people from voting. He was supported by an attitude which was reflected in the Kimberley Echo, which is the newspaper run out of Kununurra, which was at best racist in that period and extremely divisive. I have a quote from Alan Ridge, who was a member of the Western Australian Liberal Party.",61
63,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,And a former minister.,62
64,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEES,"And a former minister, as I am reminded. Mr Ridge said: It was a degrading experience to have to campaign against the Aborigines to the extent I did and it offended me to know that whilst I was concentrating my efforts on these simple people ... I was neglecting a more informed and an intelligent section of the community. It is indeed a travesty justice that a comparative handful of such ill informed people that can be used like pawns in a game by unscrupulous opportunists, should have the right or power to determine the future of our State. What does that say about the Liberal Party in Western Australia and the way in which it has tried to prevent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people participating in the democratic processes? It has happened time and time again. I have been an observer of these things. Mr Thckey-Now that we are into history, tell us what CockyCalwell said.",63
65,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEES,"I make no apologies for Calwell, no apologies whatsoever. I do not claim ownership of Calwell; the honourable member claims ownership of Ridge. Mr Deputy Speaker, times have changedMr Thckey-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the allegation that I claim ownership of any member of parliament is false. But I make the point again that if you want to go back in history",63
66,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"There is no point of order. The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. If he would be quieter and not seek to interrupt the speaker, perhaps he would not be leaving himself open to such things.",63
67,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEES,"They are condemned out of their own mouths. Times have changed and racist violence might not be so common, but it does exist, and we need to acknowledge that it exists. We must acknowledge the need to take appropriate steps in the form of this legislation to ensure that it will not continue to exist. It is the aim of this government to show that the Australian people do not accept the actions of a few that inhibit theAives of many. The government recognises that this bill will not stop racism, but it will stand as a lesson that racist violence, in both its physical and its emotional forms, is unacceptable. I have already mentioned ·some incidents which have happened in the Northern Territory at Katherine. I want to remind people about the operations of a very small, divisive, of hating group in our community that appears and has appeared over the years from time to time in small pockets around Australia. I am referring to the Ku Klux Klan. At various times in the Northern Territory whilst I have been living there there have been people in the community who have claimed membership of that august organisationMr Thckey-August,he says.",63
68,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEES,"They define it as august. . I certainly would not. They have used the KKK sign.in their attempts to vilify Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islan.der persons, but not only Aboriginal - nd Torres .Strait Islander persons but persons of other ethnic origin. Do opposition meJ;Ilbers believe .that, when these groups go out.inciting violence and division and vilification, this sort of action should not be stopped and prosecuted? Are they seriously saying to the Australian community that that should be the case? If they believe so, that is what they should say. This legislation is a balance and it ought to be seen as a. balance. A number of speakers this morning have demonstrated very aptly where freedom.""of speech in many respects is curtailed in this country - even in· this House. It is for the good of the community, for the good of the nation, that this legislation is being proposed by the parliament. I would hope that, despite the differences between the National Party, or at least some rump elements of the National Party, and the Liberal Party, the coalition will at some point in the near future come to its senses and recognise that this particular piece of legislation is for the good of the nation. The desperate attempts by the Leader of the Opposition to seek solace in the conservatives in the National Party will not help his leadership. I conclude by quoting a short piece from the noted Aboriginal poet Oodgeroo Noonuccal. It is a few lines out of a poem called 'God's One Mistake': In my own heart I know That hate is wrong, Injustice evil. Pain there must be and tears, Sorrow and death, but not Intolerance, unkindness, cruelty, Unless men choose",63
69,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"Cowper) (2.04 p.m.}-I must say that I have been slightly disturbed during this debate by the attitude of many of the speakers on the government benches towards those of us on this side. I was particularly perturbed by the contribution made earlier today by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in which he attacked the National Party members of this parliament as racists and branded us all as racists. I was sitting that time where you are, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I could not do anything about it. But had I been where I am now I would certainly have risen on a point of order and asked for the withdrawal of that, because I found it offensive. This matter is germane to the bill that we are talking about, because what is offensive to me may not be offensive to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) or, indeed, to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss. This whole bill is sinking in a swamp of poor definition. It does not define 'racist'; it does not define 'hatred'. Throughout it there are technical terms, but they are not conclusive at all. I believe that as a country, is noted for tolerance. I know, and I recall from hearing some of the arguments put in earlier speeches today, that we indeed have a history which all of us must admit has had intolerance, bigotry and bias. I can recall as a small child being subjected to bigotry and minor physical interference because of my religion, and we did have bad times. But the Australia of the future, God willing, is going to be even better than it is now. We are a tolerant society. We are a society of great cultural diversity, and one only has to look around this parliament to see that. Before the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) leaves the chamber, I want to make a point regarding one clause in the bill. If I were to say to 'Come outside, you white Territorian, and I will pull your nose', this bill has two years gaol for that. Of course, I respect the gentleman, and I use that example purely in a metaphorical sense, but it gives an indication of at least my understanding of this bill. If I were to say something like that to somebody, with this bill there is a prison term of two years. We have gone mad. The government has gone absolutely crazy in introducing this. We really do have, in this society of ours, great equality of opportunity. There is no doubt that there are still areas of racism, and anybody would be a fool not to say that that was the case. Whether the racism is· against at some people of European origin or against our Aboriginal Australians, it does exist, but I do not think that we are going to solve that by legislation. I certainly endorse the action of my coalition colleagues in coming forward with a proposition that there should be a $10 million education campaign. That is how we are going to change things. We are not going to change people's attitudes by legislation. I find quite amazing the situation that we are going to imprison people just for words and not for acts. Let us face it: the Crimes Act in· force right now has ample provision for the prosecution of people who destroy property. It is worth noting that some of the government speakers have been relying in their arguments on the three reports which Australia, were produced during 1991-92. The first of those reports was Multiculturalism and the law, from the Australian Law Reform Commission, which concluded that the incitement of racist hatred and hostility should be made a civil offence which is dealt with by conciliation, not by gaol. The commission rejected making it a·criminal offence, noting that this would unduly restrict freedom of speech. Speaker after speaker from this side of the House has made the point that there will be a restriction on freedom of speech under this bill.· We are not on our own; the Australian Law Reform Commission has already reported and made that point. Commissioner Elliott Johnston QC, in his report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, also recommended a him, civil offence of the kind existing in New South Wales. He supported conciliation as a means of dealing with racial vilification, but rejected the use of criminal sanctions. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in its report on the national inquiry into racist violence in Australia, recommended that there should be a civil offence of 'incitement to racial hostility'. But the commission stressed that the level for prohibited conduct must be higher than expressions of mere ill will or conduct which results in hurt feelings or injured sensibilities. As the New Zealand experience has shown, that could lead to enormous numbers of trivial complaints. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission totally rejected the view that incitementto racial hostility should be a criminal offence. Why is this government so hell-bent on wanting to put Australians into gaol, not necessarily for acts but for 'words? I just cannot believe that, towards the end of the 20th century. God knows, we went through what happened in Nazi Germany and the holocaust, and I think we are going down the same track. I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who is sitting at the table, pull a face. He may well pull a face.",64
70,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"What? You don't know what you're talking about, mate.",65
71,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"We, with this bill, are restricting freedom of speech.",65
72,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,The Nazis were racists.,65
73,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"I know exactly what the Nazis were, and so do you. This is probably why your family came here in the first place.",65
74,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,It is to stop Nazis and others in Australia of their type that this bill has been organised.,65
75,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"The Racial Hatred Bill is, in some aspects, completely contrary to those three reports that I have quoted. All three reports recommended against criminal sanctions for incitement to racial hatred 01 hostility. But the proposed section 60 of the Racial Hatred Bill creates a criminal offence of incitement to racial hatred. In the case of civil offences, it was recommended that racial vilification and incitement to racial hostility be the subject of civil offences. Those descriptions do have a very high level of serious conduct. But this bill establishes a civil offence where conduct which offends, insults,humiliates or intimidates becomes the basis for action. Those words certainly include the hurt feelings, the injured sensibilities and the ill will which the Human Rights and Equal. Opportunity Commission warned should not be the basis for a civil complaint. It is interesting, too, that when the government first brought in its bill, in 1992, it had community consultations right around Australia. There were 646 submissions on the bill received from the public, and 563 were opposed to the legislation. There were only 83 in favour of it. I think that, if one were to conduct the same exercise with this bill, one would probably get at least the same sort of response. It is interesting to see that commentators right around Australia, who are certainly not members of the Liberal Party or the National Party, are totally opposed to this bill. I think that seCtion 60 is a denial of the right of free speech. To draw a long bow, and I will exaggerate, let us look at a scenario. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has achieved all of his agendas-we may be a republic, and the states and the Senate will be abolished-the next thing will be that one will get thrown into gaol for criticising the government. That is dramatic and theatrical, and an exaggeration. The parliamentary secretary need not snort, because that is the next step. I can see that, if the government were to achieve its stated scenario for changing Australia, that is where we would end up. I totally and absolutely deny being a racist, and I must say that I believe that Australia has become a far better and more enjoyable country because of migration, and because of the wide numbers of people that we have. Coffs Harbour, where I live, has a wonderful Italian community. At Woolgoolga, there is a very vibrant Sikh Indian community. These people are making a wonderful contribution to Australia, but we are not going to achieve anything for them by having this bill. Proposed section 58 provides that it is an offence to threaten to cause physical harm to a person or group because of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. It is an offence not only to do it but also to threaten to do it. As I said to the member for the Northern Territory before I started speaking, if I said, 'Come outside, you white Territorian, and I will pull your nose,' I would get two years imprisonment on any reasonable interpretation of this clause. Proposed section 59 provides that it is an offence to threaten to destroy or damage property because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any other person or group. You do not have to destroy, attack or damage something; you just have to threaten to do it and this mob would throw you into gaol for one year. This is democracy? All I can say to my friends in the Labor Party in this government is, 'It is about time you rethought this. Go back to the drawing board and see where this country should be going in terms of democracy. ' I understand it is desirable that members restrict their time to allow others to speak, so I will stop now. Far from being what it purports to be, this bill is a specific attack freedom of speech and the democratic freedoms that we enjoy in this country and which so many hundreds of thousands of our fellow Australian men and women have fought for, suffered for and died for. That is what this bill is about. It should be opposed and rejected.",65
76,Mr SNOW,COMMITTEES,"Eden-Monaro) (2.16 p.m.)The Racial Hatred Bill 1994 is intended to prevent people from seriously undermining racial tolerance within society. To quote the outline of the bill, this assumes evidence of seriously undermining tolerance within society by inciting racial hatred or threatening violence against individuals or groups because of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. There is evidence of incitement to racial hatred. This has been uncovered by reports to government and has been mentioned in this debate. There is also evidence that violence has been threatened, but there has so far been no evidence of a serious undermining of tolerance within society. In order to undermine tolerance within society, the perpetrator would have to convince a significant number of society members to lose their tolerance. Not only is there a lack of evidence of that having happened; there is no evidence that it will happen. As members have repeatedly said, the evidence is that Australia is becoming more tolerant. Those of us over 50 have seen the extent of the vilification of Italians, Greeks in their turn, the English in the 1960s, the Chinese and former Yugoslavs, among others, drop quite significantly. People would not buy the Bulletin today if the racist slants of its early 20th century issues were still maintained. Multiculturalism happened before the word was created. Australian society is quite harmonious by world standards. Australia's success with multiculturalism can easily be demonstrated in our cities and towns. Cooma's 45-year association with the Snowy Mountains scheme makes the town one of our oldest examples of multiculturalism. It happened before the word was invented. At a recent Lions convention in the town, it was observed that the club's membership historywith its Polish, Italian, Greek, German, on Chinese and other backgrounds-showed how multiculturalism happened in Cooma. Australians are tolerant. While there is often unwarranted prejudice, this is not so often reflected in relationships at work or at play, in the pub, in the church or over the back fence. People treat others as they find them. This is happening in the city of Queanbeyan, which has a high number of people who were either born overseas or who are the children of people born overseas. People are treating others as they find them. This legislation will do nothing to stop the suspicion of new arrivals who have different cultures, beliefs and traditions. That suspicion will continue. The solution to those problems is education and stimulation of interests between new arrivals and others, and between others and new arrivals. It does not take long before all of us adapt-to our mutual advantage, I must say-while often still holding to those values which are precious to us. I do not agree with some of the members who, when speaking on this legislation, have said that the bill does harmful things. I cannot see that the bill does anything that is intrinsically harmful. In fact, it is probably a useful statement of belief by a government, and can be supported in the parliament for that reason. But it will contribute little to racial harmony. What is the point of having legislation for that sort of reason? None. Legislation is not like All Bran: if it is not needed, it is better not to have it. Clause 6 of the bill addresses acts done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin, otherwise than in private, which are reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate people. Are we going to have legislation to protect the greenies when they are offended, insulted, humiliated or intimidated; or timber industry workers when they are offended, insulted, hltmiliated or intimidated; or members of parliament when they are offended-as we often are-insulted, humiliated or intimidated? Where will it all stop? One consolation about the bill is that legislation can place such behaviour under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for conciliation. But that could be done without this legislation. Legislators ought to keep legislation to the minimum necessary for protection, fairness, efficiency and other aspects of good government. This legislation, under the heading of protection, goes further than it needs to. I repeat: education and conciliation can happen now; it is not necessary that it happen through the bill. I also repeat: there is plenty of intolerance and bigotry about. For instance, the League of Rights has been mentioned in this debate. The League of Rights has a phobia about Zionism. But that phobia is shared with quite of lot of people on the left of Australian politics; they have a phobia about Zionism too. Zionism poses some ethereal threat, which I have never been able to perceive in spite of all the writings of those who are either on the right, such - those in the League of Rights, or those on the left. Of course, the League of Rights seems to be able to link Zionism with credit cards, particularly when we are talking about the Australia card, and the Telecom centre in Deakin, ACT, where it thought there was .to be a massive communications network linked with all our homes which would spy on all we are doing. They are the sorts of people, I believe, who pose problems with intolerance, but they are not the sorts of people who are able to get their message across to most of Australia. It is true that there is prejudice; there is prejudice against Muslims, Asians and Jews. It is true that there is abuse. I have seen orthodox Macedonian churches covered with unpleasant graffiti, and orthodox Greek churches, including the Greek church in Queanbeyan, covered with unpleasant graffiti. It is true that there has been violence perpetrated on synagogues and mosques. But I am saying that, in spite of the increased migration component of Australia, the violence, abuse and prejudice are nothing like they used to be. In fact, speaker after speaker in this debate has mentioned increasing tolerance. The opposition has a problem with the legislation in regard to freedom of speech. I am one of those people who regards people's right to privacy as being grossly exaggerated time and again in our community. We seem to forget that the natural state of humans over many thousands of years has been the tribal state in which everyone knew what everyone was doing. Privacy is starting to reach the stage that we ,i-re exaggerating to the extent to which some individual freedom of speech is being denied to people. As far as I can see, there is no real threat in this bill against freedom of speech. I was one of the proponents of the Australia Card where everyone would have an identity card. Maybe people would not take some of the chances they do if they were carrying an identity card. The opposition's problem is that it has, over the past year, struggled in its effort to find initiative, and its only initiative has been to follow the government, whether it has been on Mabo, the Tasmanian privacy legislation or a range of other issues. When things get too hot for some of its members, the opposition divides. Those opposite tell the government, 'You are going too far.' Then they say, 'We'll only go this far,' and then, 'We won't go this far for a while. We are not going to do it because there is too much division within our opposition.' They could have taken the opportunity and opposed this bill instead of coming up, as they seem to be, with some wishy-washy alternative. I repeat: the things they are arguing for-education and conciliation"":""""'can happen now. They ought to have the courage of their convictions and not come up with some alternative. There is no real need for this legislation. It is harmless. Therefore, I cannot see why it cannot be supported and there is no need for what they are doing, which is even more wishy-washy. I support people like Phillip Adams and Father Frank Brennan and oddly, as often happens, I support the opposition to the bill expressed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I did not hear his speech, so I do not know what he said in the parliament, but it is interesting how he and I quite often come to similar decisions from entirely different directions. I support aU people in saying that this legislation is not necessary. It is intended to prevent people from seriously undermining racial tolerance within society, but it assumes a serious undermining of tolerance by inciting racial hatred or threatening violence. There is no evidence of a serious undermining of tolerance within society.",66
77,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMITTEES,"In Australia in 1994 no person should have to live in fear of their life, in fear of serious intimidation or in fear of violent outcomes of incitement to racial discrimination. Legislators in this parliament have a duty to all Australians to make adequate provisions to protect citizens and others from what is totallyunacceptable behaviour in contemporary Australia today. Conversely, Australians, regardless of their origins, should not have to live' in fear of a bill which is insufficiently clear in its definition and which could affect the lives of innocent parties in a very negative way and also neuter a community in terms of its rights to express an opinion or view. Criminal sanctions are a blunt instrument and they should be applied without question to prosecute those engaged in violent acts. But should we use such a blunt instrument as . criminal sanctions to prosecute those who express a personal view? That is the question. There are a number of definitional defects in the bill. Subjectivity is always a poor basis on which to frame such important and far-reaching legislation and there seems to be a fair amount of subjec-ivity in some aspects of this bill. . Suggesting that the judiciary should sort out the mess that this bill potentially could ,create is simply highlighting the inadequacy of the drafting and the content of the bill in its present form. The bill diminishes public confidence in both the process of the parliament and, later, the judiciary, as people struggle with the consequences of such uncertainties. We in this parliament have a great duty of care to present something to the Australian people that we all understand, that we can all reasonably expect to define, and that certainly our judiciary can reasonably expect to be able to define. The use of the those memorandum is simply not acceptable in this instance. As the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has already pointed out, Australia is not the first country to grapple with the conundrum of making laws to protect people from the horrors of racism and ignorance while, at the same time, protecting citizens' rights to freedom of speech and expression of their views. Nevertheless, this bill in its present form has chosen to ignore all of the pitfalls gleaned from a close examination of legal proceedings in other countries. Those proceedings, often after a great deal of time and cost, have shown that some of the definitions used in legislation in other parts of the world simply have not been adequate to deal with the task. Not only is great expense and great time consumed in sorting out these differences but also many cases overseas have been lost, and the criminals have not been brought to justice, because of the difficulties arising from the way in which the legislation has been drafted. We already have the benefit of hindsight from racial vilification legislation that has been passed in other countries and we ought to closely examine those difficulties that have been experienced and make sure that we do not go down, the same path and run into the same pitfalls. Freedom of speech, as a colleague on the other side mentioned today, has never been an absolute- We have always had some safeguards and restrictions placed on what we can say and what we can write, which can lead to prosecution if it can be clearly demonstrated that that speech or that written word can seriously harm other people. Nevertheless, to pass legislation curtails freedom of speech we must be absolutely certain· about what we are trying to achieve and ensure that we can prosecute and have the kinds of outcomes that were intended without placing undue pressure on people's right to speak up as they see fit. The basis for the drafting and presentation of this legislation to the parliament at this time is no doubt to be found in some of the disturbing and very serious events which have occurred in various parts of Australia, includprosecution. ing my own state of Western Australia. Those events, although infrequent, are cause for great concern for many Australian people, both those in the ethnic groups to which these acts were directed and those of us who feel strongly that this kind of behaviour has no place in contemporary Australia. Certain events have quite understandably given rise to great fear among certain groups in our community which have suffered both violence to themselves and to their property, and threats of violence-which, again, is quite unacceptable. It is interesting to note that three reports have been carried out in recent times and these were the forerunner to the development of legislation that we have before us today. Those reports were quite unanimous in their direction in not imposing-in fact, some of them warned about it-criminal sanctions for incitement to racial hatred as opposed to criminal sanctions for the actual violence against persons and properties. In fact, they were nearly all very concerned that we use conciliation wherever it is approprittte to do so. That was seen as the most acceptable means of dealing with racial vilification in people's verbal and written expressions. In my view, the recommendations of the reports have not been given sufficient weight in the drafting of this bill. I think there should have been perhaps some more reading, preparation and consultation with the authors of these reports. They have gone into some considerable depth in trying to make recommendations and it would seem to me that insufficient weight has been given to these insights and recommendations in the drafting which further of this bill. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission rejected as a basis for civil offence the use of words which hurt feelings, for example. It was concerned that the inclusion of words in this category could lead to a large number of trivial complaints. Again, here we could benefit from the experience of other countries. New Zealand has passed legislation of a similar nature. It went down the track of including words that hurt people's feelings and provided an opportunity for It found that there have been an overwhelming number of trivial complaints. That takes away from the serious nature of events and hinders getting on with the prosecution of people who are causing great trauma and concern within our communities. As I said before, I think we also need to become focused on what it is we are trying to achieve with this bill and to make sure that we maintain that focus on the serious issues of racial violence to both persons and property and, of coUrse, threats of violence. There has been a great deal of discussion centred on the rights of people's freedom of speech and the rights of those for whom sometimes freedom of speech brings uncomfortable and unpleasant consequences. In an article written by Ron Castan-it was edited by Paul Austin-he makes the point that recent research suggests that incidents of racist speech and violence in Australia ,are increasing. That must concern all of us. He said that it is simply not the case that existing laws always adequately cover racist acts that clearly amount to threats of violence, haraSsment or incitement, especially in those states still without racial vilification laws. He is quite right in his concerns there because, although a number of states have passed racial vilification laws, some of them clearly do not go far enough. In some states there are no laws at all. In fact, you could say that in some states penalties for violence against people's property are much more toughly applied than for violence against people. To me this seems to be somewhat of an anomaly. That is an important consideration and there is no doubt in the coalition's mind that it is necessary for the Commonwealth to get on and produce legislation that will ensure that all Australians have a right to protection and that people perpetrating acts of violence against Australian people and others should be prosecuted and feel the full weight of the law upon them. Mr Castan went on to say that, while there are some people in our community who are the subject of racial vilification and who are well connected and well educated, there are others who are not. He points out: Most of them do not have QCs and politicians as their close friends. They are Arabic women who are publicly jeered at and abused because of their dress, in the suburbs of Sydney. They are Aboriginal Australians who are denigrated (sometimes by police and public officials) ... in towns throughout Australia. They are Jews abused in streets as they walk to synagogue on a Saturday morning. At the cutting edge of multicultural Australia things are different to the ""highly principled"" of people such as Phillip Adams, Frank BrennanI would have to agree with him on that point, although I do believe that the majority of Australians and citizens in this country are decent law-abiding people. Australians do have a history of accepting into their communities people from many different countries, many different backgrounds, and of respecting their rights to live peacefully and to hold their particular views. In this legislation, and in the presentation of this legislation, we must go back to the drawing board, as has been proposed by the coalition. We must redraft the legislation, again, strongly protecting the rights of those people who are subject to racial vilification, violence and harassment but, at the same time, ensuring that prosecutions will be successful and that there is a clear definition in the aspects of people's right to freedom of expression. Many of the ethnic groups in Australia have expressed that this legislation can be a two-edged sword because it applies not only between one group of people and another but also between the people of a country where there is conflict. We have an obligation, as the law-makers and the legislators in this country, to draft this legislation with great care, ensuring that maximum protection is given to all citizens. I believe that that can be done with greater attention to the recommendations of the several committees that have reported in recent times and also with greater attention to some of the defects in legislation that the Attorney-General quite rightly pointed out has been passed in a number of countries. We should get on with that job. That is exactly what the coalition is proposing, that we draft a new bill and that we make sure that all of those considerations are made in the drafting of that new bill.",68
78,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"We have now been debating this Racial Hatred Bill for almost two days. When you are in my position on the speakers list, there is nothing very much new to say. Many of the arguments on both sides have been canvassed in the parliament over the last couple of days, and I do not intend to delay the House for world very long with my contribution. As I have said, many fine speeches have been made on both sides of the chamber. Many of the points of view that we all share, and many of the points of view that I agree with, have already been put. I do not dispute the sincerity and the genuine feelings that people have when they talk on this legislation. But perhaps one time we could come into this chamber with a united point of view, stop the point scoring and debate legislation that is important legislation for Australia and, in many ways, is landmark legislation. Let me make this point, which is not a terribly new one: I have never believed that you can legislate to change people's minds. If people have racist views or any other points of view, legislation brought in through the national parliament is not going to change them. Many people hold points of view because the attitude has been that it is logical that they have that point of view. I was born and brought up in a small country town in northern New South Wales in which there were very strong views about the Aboriginal population. There is no doubt that all the legislation in the world would not change those people's points of view. But, by legislation, you can make the stating of these points of view and acts of vilification illegal. In that way, to change a community's attitude. I have heard a lot of debate in this parliament about educating people. Of course, I agree with that but, while you are educating the young to be a more tolerant and better rounded society, many people in the society maintain racist views and I do not believe that they should be permitted to continue publicly stating those points of view. I now represent what I guess would be the most diverse cultural area in Australia. This area includes the southern suburbs of Wollongong and Port Kembla. There are something like 100 different ethnic groups there. I have a large Macedonian population-who love me at the moment-a large Lebanese population, a Chilean population, some second-generation Germans and some second-generation English. In the main, these people have lived in harmony but many of these people have been subject to racist taunts and to vilification, I believe that they should be protected. I have often taken the point of view that, in many of the smaller country towns, one of the greatest defenders of racist views has been the local newspapers. Many of these local country newspapers, although they have not always been overtly racist, have been very subtly racist and have for many years been putting forward a racist point of view. If honourable members want evidence of thatas I do not represent the area any more, I can say it-they should have a look at some of the newspapers in Nowra. They have been putting out a racist message for a long time and, every week, the local people are reading that in the local newspapers. I believe that many of our smaller country newsplJPers have quite a lot to answer for. We have heard a lot over the last two days about freedom of speech. Nothing is absolute in this society. We can talk about freedom to use the road. There is a freedom to use the road but there are certain rules that drivers abide by. They drive on one side of the road. When going out on the road, one person does not drive on the left while another person who is going in the same direction drives on the right. If drivers exercise this absolute freedom to drive on the road in any way they like, you can start there is going to be chaos. It is the same with freedom of speech. We all support freedom of speech, but there are limits. It is a nonsense when people stand up in here and agonise publicly about the right of racists to go out and practise their craft. That is not an absolute right. There is no such thing as an absolute right. So, although we talk about freedom of speech, like all things we do, it is always tempered with a community's expectations and what we do in the community. So it is a nonsense to talk about this absolute freedom of speech. I also agree· that Australian society has been very tolerant. As well as in Australia, I lived for 12 years in the United Kingdom. For my sins, I lived for two years in New Zealand and I also had 12 months in Malta. As some of my colleagues might also suggest, I have travelled a little as well. So I have seen other and societies working. I do not know any society that has been more tolerant than Australian society. We hear about Scandinavian society. Interestingly, 'that famous Scandinavian tolerance tends to break down a little when economic problems come up. The guest workers of Europe were not such welcome guests when the economy was not going so well. Australia, not just since the Second World War but throughout its history, has always been a nation where people from many parts of the world have come, be it for the gold rush or for other reasons. In the main, and especially since the Second World War, these people have been welcomed into our society. One of the exciting things about this society is that through multiculturalism we are building a distinct Australian character which is influenced by many parts of the world. When we look at the diversity of people who have come here, we realise that we have been a very tolerant society. I heard the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) speaking this morning. One of the things that gave me heart about our society concerned the Gulf War. In my area I have people who had family on both sides of the Gulf War, but the community throughout Australia and the community in the Illawarra were not arguing and fighting. Whether Irish, Yugoslavian or from other parts of the world, in the main people do not bring the troubles from their former homeland to this country. They are so sick and tired of the problems there that they are pleased to get away from them and they do not bring them here. I want to see that continue. I do not want to see our courts full of racial vilification disputes and I do not think they will be. I also think it is important that we have legislation on the statute book. We will main a tolerant society--'-.and, I suggest, haps the most tolerant society-only if we have those safeguards. One safeguard is have this legislation on the statute book. a measure of our maturity that we can introbecause duce and debate this legislation in this House. I have listened to a lot of the debate and have heard people say that there is no need race? for this legislation-what do we want it for? There is a need for this legislation. If nothing else, we have to set the guidelines. Hard may be for many members of the federal protection parliament to believe, there are people out there in the community, as many speakers have said, who have been subject to racial taunts, to racial vilification and to actions incite racial hatred. That is not the Australian way. It· has never been the Australian We must introduce this legislation to make sure that it does not become the Australian way. That is why I strongly support this legislation.",70
79,Mr CAMERON,COMMITTEES,"Stirling) (2.54 p.m.)The federal government's Racial Hatred Bill is the most recent manifestation of disturbing Orwellian tendencies in the ALP's legislative agenda. It follows in the tradition of the attempt in 1992 to ban political advertising. This bill is a smokescreen aimed the coalition. In naming it the Racial Hatred Bill, the government is deliberately attempting to incite divisiveness not just in the coalition but throughout the entire community. Hatred is such a divisive word for a piece of legislation attempting to quell such attitudes. For all this legislation's good intents and purposes, the fact is that you cannot legislate to alter attitudes. This legislation will not create a more harmonious society. It will not alleviate the bigoted and racist elements of society. You cannot legislate to attempt to change attitudes and, if you do, I believe it will simply incite further racism. This bill inserts new criminal sanctions into the Commonwealth Crimes Act and creates a civil wrong under the Racial Discrimination Act. Threatening a person with physical harm because of his race will be made a crime punishable by two years imprisonment. Threatthis ening harm to property on racial grounds will rebe punishable by one year's gaol. No-one perdisputes that it is wrong to threaten another person or his property. These amendments are to unreasonable, however, because they do not It is go far enough. Does a person threatened of the football team he supports or for no reason at all feel any less intimidI ated than a person singled out because of his This bill is analogous to the government prohibiting .theft from migrants only. One as it wonders why the government is extending a which all Australians should enjoy only to members of minority racial groups. The obvious, if cynical, answer is that the government will not earn kudos from the that multicultural lobby by passing a law with a general operation. The rest of us are entitled way. to feel discriminated against. I am about to mention some of my colleagues. I suspect that I could call the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) fatty. He, with some degree of accuracy, could in return call me fatty. I could call the honourable member for Deakin(Mr Aldred), the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and some others that I am looking at at this very moment four-:eyes. I could call the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) a red-headed, balding  Mr Hawker-Bluey.",72
80,Mr CAMERON,COMMITTEES,"Or bluey. I could call the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) Priscilla Precious. I could go on and on. I could call the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) a feral muppet. In each of these cases-I may have been defamatory in a few-we do not have legislation prohibiting these remarks which are offensive, which perhaps incite hatred and which perhaps have the possibility of causing violent reactions, just as if I called the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) a septic tank. But it seems that only the member for La Trobe would have recourse for such offensive behaviour. I apologise to the honourable colleagues whom I have just named if I have caused any offence. But I am trying to highlight the fact that racial vilification-or hatred, to echo the legislation's title-is not - an orphan in the bigoted and unfortunately unkind and heartless elements of our society. We have vilification for many reasons, including sexual reasons, human characteristic or deformity reasons and personal reasons. Vilification for ethnicity is not the only basis for hatred by these bigots and forms of low-life. If we are going to have such protective laws, then why not extend them to encapsulate all forms of hatred, or is this but another cynical attempt by the government to cause divisions in our society? A further amendment to the Crimes Act will make it an offence punishable with one year's gaol to do an act with the intention of inciting racial hatred which is reasonably likely to achieve that result. On its face, that might appear to be reasonable. The section seems to protect the accused by taking into account his subjective state of mind at the time he did the act. In a criminal trial, however, the accused's evidence as to the intention with which he did an act is frequently rejected on the grounds that he would be expected to deny having guilty knowledge. Because a person's state of mind cannot be observed, it must be inferred by the court from his words and acJ'ons. For example, if I fired a bullet at a man's head, then it would be inferred that I intended to kill him because his death would be, as an objective fact, the ordinary consequence of my action. In an ordinary criminal trial, such a result works no injustice to the accused. There are vested political interests on opposing sides of the question of the likely trajectory of a bullet and the consequences of it striking a human. Under political correctness law, however, there is. no accepted definition of what constitutes racial hatred. Most Australians accept that statements in the form 'Westphalians are racially inferior and should be exterminated' are unacceptable. Some sections of the community, however, regard any statement against the perceived interests of a minority group as racist. For example, Tracker Tilmouth of the Central Land Council reportedly claimed that the Greens and the coalition were racist for daring to propose amendments to the land fund legislation. Those with such extreme views are well represented in the race guilt enforcement industry charged with responsibility for the civil side of the law. In theory, the judges who are entrusted with enforcing the Crimes Act can be expected to be more objective. The High Court has written much recently about the need for courts to take community standards into account when interpreting the law. Some members opposite would have us believe that community opinions are always the same as their own, and'it takes a perspicacious judge to see through this facade. The danger is therefore that a person who makes a statement which to many of those opposite is so obviously going to incite racial hatred is likely to have his protestations that he intended no such result ignored. Consider, for example, a statement in the form, 'Westphalians have a greater propensity to commit crimes than the Australian population as a whole.' Such a statement is quite likely to engender ill feeling, perhaps bordering on hatred",73

82,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister representing .the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Does the Bogor declaration, which was signed yesterday, mean that by the year 2010 Australian industry will have zero tariffs across the board, including in the motor vehicle industry; in textiles, clothing and footwear; and in the sugar industry. Mr BILNEYThere has been a great deal of reporting of the magnificent result which has been achieved at the APEC meeting in Bogor, including the very important commitment by all of the 18 nations of APEC, to bring about zero tariffs-or minuscule tariffs-on a flexible basis by either the year 2010 or the year 2020.",74
83,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,74
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has been asked a question.,74
85,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is always important in these matters to make sure that we keep urging our industry to do better. The government has a magnificent record in that regard, which has led to an excellent performance by the very industry that the Leader of the Opposition mentioned-the motor vehicle industry. Mr Downer-In your electorate.",74
86,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In my electorate. It is the case that from my electorate Magna wagons are now being exported to Japan and other markets around the world. That has happened because the conspiracy that existed in that industry 20 years ago, when the honourable member was advising the then Prime Minister, has now been broken in favour of a competitive industry with growing productivity and employment. This industry is now manufacturing world-class cars which are exported to the rest of the world. That has been achieved because we as a government have brought about a productive export culture in that industry and in a number of other industries. The agreement that was reached in Bogor, as a result of the efforts of this government-not the supine dolts who sit opposite-will provide a further impetus to that process. It will mean that interesting and good jobs will be opened up to Australians in the future. It will also mean that other industries as well as the motor vehicle industry willMr Downer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My question was quite simple. I want to know whether by 2010 there will be zero tariffs in Australia for the industries I mentioned, including the motor vehicle industry-yes or no.",74
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no point of order. The minister is talking about that very issue. Mr Downer-He is avoiding my question. Mr Bilney-There is no way that I will avoid anything which represents so magnificent a triumph for this government, for this Prime Minister and for this country as does the agreement which has been arrived at in Bogor. It really amazes me that this bunch opposite can dream of attempting to denigrate that achievement. It is one of the most extraordinary achievements in the history of Australia during my lifetime. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a further point of order. We accept the success of the meeting.",74
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A point of order is not a debate. Mr Downer-I know, Mr Speaker. I was just going to make the point that the meeting was a great achievement, but the question was not about that. Mr Horne-Hear, hear! Mr Downer-lam glad you agree. I am surprised you even noticed that there was a meeting.",74

91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition will come to his point of order. Mr Downer-Sometimes I think you are going to explode, I really do. My point of order is that I asked whether this magnificent agreement meant that Australia's tariffs would be reduced to zero by 2010. Either it does it does not.",74
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no point of order. The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The minister is in order, in conclusion. Mr BILNEYI shall conclude by saying that the Bogor agreement embodied a principolicy ple which I see is being described as 'flexible consensus'. That means that there will applied to those countries which agreed-all 18 of them-a principle that we will all to these objectives in our own way and according to a timetable which is set down in that agreement. That does imply that to industries there will be applied a discipline similar to that which will be applied to the industries of all the other APEC countries. But who will be the beneficiaries? Australian workers and the Australian people. APEC Meeting",75
93,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Finance. I refer to the APEC meeting in Indonesia and the universal endorsement of the outcome of meeting as a triumph for Pacific trade and the outstanding efforts of our Prime Minister. What are the consequences for Australia's economy of the APEC deal? Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point oped. of order. On this particular question, the minister has no portfolio responsibility. The relevant minister cannot be bothered to come",75
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of represent order. The question was asked of the Minister for Finance, who is also Leader of the House, as I have ruled in this place before when the opposition has asked him questions in that role. Mr Downer-So we can ask him any question.",75
95,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not mind your asking me questions. Mr Howard interjecting- ,",75
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable since member does not have the call. The Leader the House.,75
97,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would enjoy a few or questions from the opposition; I get precious few of them. I do, I supP9se, as finance minister, have something to say from time to time about what happens inside the economy, and which is actually what the question was about. If you had actually sat down and had a bit of a listen to it when it was asked, you would know that it was not actually a foreign question; it was a question related to that. No doubt the Prime Minister will want be to talk very broadly about the outcome of APEC when he returns here tomorrow, but I get am pleased to say a few words about it. As you will be aware, the APEC leaders our meeting in Bogor has achieved an historic agreement for the long-term goal of free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. Only two years ago, that outcome would have been unthinkable. Specifically, the leaders committed themselves to the 'complete achievement of our goal of free trade and open trade and investment in the Asia Pacific no later than the year 2020'. APEC today is the engine room of world that economic growth and development. By 2020 to APEC will include seven of the 10 largest economies in the world. Significantly, APEC includes economies at different stages of development and with economic complementarities which have not yet been fully develFor Australi'ii the deal is of the utmost significance. The APEC economies currently take three-quarters of our exports. They our most important markets and our most important partnerships. This agreement offers the opportunity for an unprecedented level of integration of the Australian economy and those of the APEC countries. We have never been more ready to take advantage of the opportunities before us. When we started lowering the tariff wall some years ago, we found that our industries were more than ready to take on international competition. In fact, exports of sophisticated manufactures and services have grown rapidly the mid-1980s. Australia is already a of long way down the path to free trade, having already eliminated quotas. Probably of all the countries in the region, we will have the least adjustment to make in achieving these goals. For example, by the year 2000 the trade weighted average tariff in Australia will have been reduced to 2.9 per cent-a position that virtually no other country in the APEC region emulates. So we have more than just about anybody else to take to the table when we enter into discussions about the processes we are all going to go through in establishing free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. The APEC agreement means that Australia stands to enjoy a boost to annual national income in the order of some $7 billion. Mr Bilney-How much is that?",75
98,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Seven billion dollars. It means jobs and it means new opportunities. The details of how that liberalisation is to be implemented will, of course, be worked out over the period of time in front of us. For - ur region, this agreement means that the ASlaPacific has now come of age. I want to offer some words of praise for the role played by the President of Indonesia, President Suharto, who has shown real leadership in driving the process towards its successful conclusion. This agreement sends a clear message ab-ut the weight of this part of the world, about Its confidence in the future and about its capacity to cooperate effectively to attain common goals. I also want to pay tribute to the Prime Minister and his achievements in this regard. I am delighted that the two members opposite agree with me and stood to applaud the moment I mentioned his name. I would like to pay tribute to the Prime Minister because he has devoted himself tirelessly over the last 12 months or so to assisting in bringing about this outcome. I felt that I. needed to say a thing or two about APEC because I have noticed that the Leader of the Opposition and those he leads have had a bit of a distraction. There has been a bit of unnecessary depression about you over the last few days. I thought that this might be an opportunity for you to cheer up and take enjoyment in what is something of a national triumph. Shipping: ANL",76
99,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer the minister to his recent decision to give Australia's troubled national shipping line, ANL concessions on group tax on the grouhds that this will make ANL more internationally competitive. I have received several letters of distress over the last six monthswith one as recent as yesterday-from local small business people who have been bankrupted by the Australian Taxation Office for not meeting group tax payments. Can the minister therefore explain to the House why a struggling small business should not receive group tax concessions in the same manner as those that have been handed out to ANL?",76
100,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The difference between small business people and international seafarers-let me say that the arrangement that is under discussion brings far greater benefits to BHP shipping than to ANL-is that one is operating internationally, spendi-g more than six months of the year overseas In competition with seagoing countries .whi-h already enjoy a payroll tax exemptIon In respect of their international seafarers. Mr Costello-Payroll tax?",76
101,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Certainly income tax. Mr Costello-No. You said payroll tax.,76
102,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. It is income tax. We are talking about income tax. Let us not have any doubt about it: this is a concession that is on the table but which is also conditional upon a reform package to be negotiated between the shippers and the unions that involves a very substantial reduction in costs to the industry. After all, it is not just the government that is looking at concessions to assist our international competitiveness. The unions have on the table reduced training costs, reduced crewing levels and reduced - rewing fact-rs. They have also had a commItment to seemg their costs reduced so as to· equate to company employment. The House would be aware that we have appointed a facilitator to hasten those discussions between the shippersMr Downer-Who is the facilitator?",76
103,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and the unions concerned. Mr Young is the facilitator. When we have the result of that process, the government will give further consideration to the whole issue of income tax",77

107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I assume that the minister has finished. I again remind members of this HouseOpposition members-He's finished all right.,77
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I also remind members not to interject while I am speaking. Mr Costello-No. We would agree.,77

110,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. What are the results of increased safety surveillance by CAA on aviation operators and what other aviation safety initiatives have been undertakin en by the government?,77
111,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his .question. I can advise the House that the Civil Aviation Authority has been conducting the most intensive surveillance of low capacity passenger aircraft and charter operators that has ever been undertaken. This increased surveillance program, led by Mr John Pike, has now been operating for four weeks. To date 733 individual inspections have been carried out, involving a total of 278 individual companies-most companies have, in fact, been checked more than once-II individuals or companies have been the subject of enforcement action; 5) aircraft have been ordered to rectify defects before being allowed to fly; four companies have been effectively grounded following the withdrawal of chief pilot approvals. These companies are Seaview Air, Yanda Airlines, Newcastle Aviation and UZU Air. I am advised that Yanda Airlines, Newcastle Aviation and UZU Air are addressing the deficiencies found and will be able to resume operations when the CAA is satisfied that they are able to operate safely. The aim of the surveillance program is to identify those operators who could damage our generally very safe aviation industry. This intense scrutiny sends a very clear message to the whole of the aviation industry that safety is·paramount and must not be compromised. While every allegation raised about aviation safety is being properly and thoroughly investigated, the government has acted to address all major concerns. It has been anything but idle. In response to the findings of the BASI report on Monarch and the Seaview crashes, I announced a number of measures to improve aviation safety regulations. That is in addition to the parliamentary inquiry into air safety standards and the Street judicial commission of inquiry into the Seaview accident. At my direction, the Civil Aviation Authority has established a system which automatically triggers an increase in surveillance of operators who are known to be in financial difficulthe ties. A new domestic limit of $500,000 for passenger carriers' liability has now been set regulation. It will become mandatory and non-voidable after legislation is introduced early next year. Mr John Pike was appointed as acting head of the directorate of aviation safety regulation on 10 October to replace Mr George  Director of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. The Commonwealth has identified the Civil Aviation Authority in respect of its safety regulation functions to guarantee its responsibilities cannot be compromised by private indemnity insurance arrangements. On 12 October I announced that the government would lift its contribution for aviation safety regulation from $22 million to $29 million; 57 additional staff are being recruited to assist in safety regulation. One of the most important decisions of the government is to remove safety regulation from the Civil Aviation Authority and to establish a separate and entirely independent statutory authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Legislation is presently being drafted for introduction into the House early next year. I am also able to inform the House that, following a worldwide search, interviews are presently being conducted to appoint a new director of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. All this represents a responsible and, comprehensive response to the concerns about aviation safety. It is completely appropriate to itguarantee Australia's air safety standards. This has been in stark contrast'to what we have seen from the opposition with its scaremongering tactics. All we have really seen from them is a performance aimed at providing a wholesale purge of the whole of the Civil Aviation Authority.· The real question that the House should be considering is one for the member for Hume: why it is still the opposition's policy to implement full cost recovery for aviation safety activities forthwith at a saving of $20 million? That, for your information, is. on page 291 of Fightback. When are you going to change it? It seems to me that the opposition has been more interested in providing information to the media rather than working constructively to ensure all concerns are properly ed through each of the available forums. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Given the seriousness of the matter under discussion, Iinvite the minister to table the notes he was reading from.",77
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the minister reading from private notes?,78
113,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Private notes.,78
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is the end of the matter. Sales Tax: Fruit Juice,78
115,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"May I, as an opposition member, break the alleged question time drought being experienced by the Minister for Finance by asking him: does the minister believe that a tax should be applied to food? If not, how does he defend the inequity of applying a sales tax to pure fruit juice which is as identifiable a food as sales-tax-free whole milk? Has the minister ignored the advice of Senator Sherry and resisted this move to conspicuous tax equity simply on the grounds of lost revenue, with little regard for the viability of efficient Australian horticultural industries?",78
116,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The matter to which the honourable member refers, I know, is a matter which is currently under consideration within the government and, of course, a matter that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has direct carriage of. He, as I understand",78
117,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members interjecting Mr BEAZLEYr will answer all questions, and I will refer them; a referral also happens to be an answer, in case you had not noticed. It is a matter that the minister has under consideration, both in relation to its GATT impact and a whole variety of equitable questions about which you are concerned. I would'suggest that, if the minister has not actually made pronouncements on it at this stage, he may well be about to make them shortly. It would be sensible for you to direct questions to him because he is in a position where I think our deliberations are approaching finality and he should be able to satisfy investigat- your concerns. Income Distribution",78
118,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer the minister to claims that income inequality in Australia is increasing. What is the evidence related to those claims; and what is the impact of our tax transfer system on the welfare of Australian families?,78
119,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for her question. Of course, - she has a long standing interest in matters of social equity. Last week she asked me another question which enabled me to nail that other canard that the opposition is promoting-that this is one of the more unequal countries in the world. Of course, the reverse is the case.",78
120,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,79
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has the call.,79
122,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The other claim that one hears from the opposition is that government policies have tended to compound social inequality. For honourable members who are seriously interested in this matter, I can better, or recommend no better starting point, than to refer to the article on these matters by Ross Gittins in Saturday'S Sydney Morning Herald. In that article I think he succinctly put together some of the key elements of the argument, but he omitted certain key factors which I think significantly strengthen the government's position. I turn to what Ross Gittins had to say. He made the point, which is recognised by all those who have seriously studied the issue, that over the course of the 1980s market incomes in countries in the developed world tended to become more unequal; that is to say, wages and salaries. He talked about the global factors that led to that-the fact that we are moving towards a more global economy with a global labour market and the fact that technology is tending to raise the differing ence in the market values of people with or without skills and education. So the growing inequality in market incomes is a feature of the developed world, and we have seen here. Ross Gittins then went on to look at the impact of government policy on thataccord specifically, the impact of social security transfer payments on the one hand and taxincrease ation measures on the other. What he demonof strates quite clearly, drawing on a study by Ann Harding, is that the impact of governinclude ment policy, through the social security system, has been to diminish that underlying trend towards greater. differences in market incomes. Likewise, the changes that the government has made in the tax system, over the course of its tenure in government, have tended to diminish inequality. So the impact of government policy is quite unambiguously beneficial and benign in terms of, income distribution. There are three elements there: the underlying difference in growth in inequality market incomes, wages and salaries, taxes and transfers. What is the impact of opposition policy in each of those three areas? With market incomes, those opposite favour a wholesale deregulation of the labour market. The international evidence is unequivocal that the countries which have gone down that path have experienced the greatest increases in do no inequality in earned income. So that is the starting point: market incomes unquestionably would be worse under the opposition's policy framework than they are under ours. The opposition is committed to cutting $10 billion out of social security transfers. As I pointed out yesterday, those transfer payments are overwhelmingly targeted at people on low incomes. It wanted to impose a monstrously regressive goods and services tax as well as having opposed all the significant equity measures and changes in the tax system made by this government-capital gains, fringe benefits and so forth. Whatever aspect of policy you look at, the result is unambiguous: the coalition would make things significantly worse. , They are some points you can make drawon Ross Gittins's analysis. But what Mr Gittins does not fully take into account is, again, the exclusion from that sort of analysis of all the social wage changes that have been it made over the course of this governmentand we have had an explicit trade off between money wages - nd social wages as part of the framework. It includes things like the introduction of Medicare,the huge funded in education participation, the spread superannuation, the huge increase in childDr care provision. The Gittins analysis does not all the base broadening measures in the tax system, such as fringe benefits. When you factor these things into account, the picture looks significantly better again from the government's point of view. The inclusion of the social wage components of health and housing alone has the effect of reducing inequalities by around 20 per cent, without including all the other things that I have referred to. There is no doubt as to what the impact of government policy is. I refer to a very recent study by a very in well-known academic Peter Whiteford, a senior research fellow at the University of York. He has just published a paper entitled 'Income distribution and social policy under a reformist government: the Australian experience', published in Policy and Politics volume 24, No.4, which is a British publication. His conclusion, looking at a comprehensive assessment of these matters, is: Living standards were higher and inequality slightly lower in 1990 than when Labor took office. poverty is measured by reference to a constant poverty line, then poverty had fallen substantially. He also draws a very sharp contrast with the United Kingdom. His article contrasts those two countries. He states: The UK figures suggest a dramatic widening income inequality. The Australian figures suggest a slight narrowing in income inequality. So, in the face of those underlying forces amendmentsdriving market incomes apart, we have still been able to contain that and achieve a slight improvement in inequality. He concludes by saying: It seems fair to sum up the ALP's record as combining egalitarian social policies with economic policies attempting to enhance efficiency, within minister. the framework of a consensual incomes policy. That is dead right. That is what this governway, ment has achieved. It is a sharp contrast to what we could expect in the unfortunate situation of the coalition winning office. Aviation: Safety",79

The most recent was an initiative taken by Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales in 1990 which resulted in the introduction, in each of their state parliaments, of a model bill in 1991. Unfortunately, the initiative at that time floundered essentially on the dispute between jurisdictions as to whether truth alone should be a defence to an action of defamation or whether truth combined With . some form of public interest or public benefit should be defence. The most significant impact in terms of defamation law reform of the recent High Court decisions has been, inasmuch as discussion and a subsequent action for defamation relates to matters involved in the political process, that the court has held that truth alone shall be. an effective defence. As a result of that, it is now recognised by all jurisdictions, most notably New South Wales which had previously held the view that truth and public interest should have been the defence, that it is now to be truth alone. That has enabled a fairly major breakthrough in gaining agreement between jurisdictions. The last hearing of the standing committee held earlier this month agreed that a working group that had been looking at the laws in New South Wales, involving New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, would be supplemented by representatives of each of the other jurisdictions. The bill to come down from the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in the early part of next year, which will also tAke into account the recent High Court decisions, will then form the basis for a renewed attempt to gain agreement on uniform defamation laws. Given that the argument over the appropriate defence of truth has now been overcome effectively by the High Court decision, there are still issues to be resolved, such as whether these tests outlined by the High Court should extend into the broader community. But I am now quite hopeful that Australia will achieve agreement on uniform defamation laws some time next year. The next key date in this process will be the release of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission report and the consideration of that by Attorneys-General shortly afterwards. Director of Public Prosecutions: Western Australia",81
134,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Were the activities of the until recently Deputy Director of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Perth, Mr Bill Nairn, the subject of an the internal investigation by your department or the DPP? If there was an investigation, did it look into the awarding of computer contracts? What other matters did it examine? Will the findings of any investigation be made public? Mr LAV'ARCH - I have received advice from the. Director of Public Prosecutions that there has been an internal investigation by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions into the office in Perth. Those investigations specifically lop ked at the awarding of a computer contract by the office and a suggestion that there had been an improper conflict between a senior staff member of the office in Perth and the firm which successfully obtained the computer contract. I understand that the full circumstances of the letting of that contract were also investigated by an accounting firm-the name escapes me, but it was examined-as to whether the terms of the contract were proper and whether the payment of money in relation to the services obtained was proper. The conclusion of that is that the contract, on its face; was indeed a proper one and provided value for money. In relation to making public the result of the investigation, I will confer with the Director of Public Prosecutions and advise the member accordingly; Commonwealth Bank: Charges",81
135,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. I refer the minister to reports that the Commonwealth Bank intends to introduce additional charges for across-the-counter transactions from January next year. What will be the effect on consumers of such a proposal?,82
136,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his role as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. I certainly have heard of these reports and I am very concerned about this decision taken by the Commonwealth Bank. I realise very well that all banks charge fees and my concern with the C<.>mmonwealth Bank is with the steepness of thIS fee for some transactions and account keeping. I am expressing my concern with the amount of confusion that the new fees will generate for consumers. Mr Costello-Why don't the shareholders tell the directors?",82
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has already been warned.,82
138,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am also concerned about reports that other banks are looking at introducing a similar fee structure. As far as the Commonwealth Bank goes, one newspaper report did indeed suggest that if you opt for the new streamlined express account you will be charged $4 for any withdrawal made inside a bank. So what happens if the automatic teller machine is broken down or there is a giant queue? You have to pay to go into the bank. I am concerned especially about traditional passbook accounts and existing streamlined key card accounts because holders of those accounts will be slugged $1.50 on every transaction if they exceed a new limit of four transactions a month. We have to work out who are the people that make that number of transactions. They are holiday-makers, backpackers, young people and pensioners. What is more, people will be asked to keep a minimum of $500 in their accounts if they want to escape a $2 monthly account keeping fee. This practice is highly discriminatory against people who prefer traditional over-thecounter service, against people who make a number of transactions each month, simply because they like to keep their money in the bank for security reasons and withdraw it as they need it, and against people who do not normally have $500 in the bank. It is also discriminatory against people who have difficulty with the English language and do not like using automatic tellers. Why should they be penalised for having to go into the bank? I am also concerned that this might be a move towards the eventual closure of branches. There have certainly been branch closures in my electorate and it is even more drastic a situation for people in rural areas. Banking is not something we choose. People are forced, especially if they are on social security benefits, to put their money in the bank. I know that many people are objecting to this. I certainly will be writing to the head of the Commonwealth Bank to find the reasons for this. I will certainly be expressing my concern and I will certainly be watching what the other banks are doing. Transport Workers Union",82
139,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer the besieged minister to prospects of Christmas strikes by the Transport Workers Union and in particular, to threats against suppliers of major retail outlets such as Woolworths and Coles. Is it not a fact that, because the union no longer faces the threat of quick, injunctive response-part of your cave-in on the reform act-the union's threats are so much more credible? As the business community has called for their restoration, why will you not now reinstate the secondary boycott protection in the Trade Practices Act?",82
140,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This question from the honourable member for Parkes is the subject of the MPI debate that will follow question time today. I will be very happy to take part myself in that debate.,82
141,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, isn't that generous of you.",82
142,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to reveal the hypocrisy and the dreadful track record of the opposition when it comes to wage performance and strikes during its tenure. I made it clear in the House on Monday that the key to this issue, and every other wage claim, is the approach of the parties towards enterprise bargaining negotiations. Transport employers, I must say, judging by their utterances in the last few days, understand this even if the opposition does not. The problem with past wage break-outs, particularly the huge break-out of 1982-83 that the honourable member for Bennelong presided over, was that individual employers had no say in the award based rises that occurred at their workplaces because of the centralised nature of the system. The good news is that that cannot happen under the reform act because enterprise agreements have to be determined enterprise by enterprise. Indeed, wage·rises at the enterprise level are insulated in the act from the award stream. If people stray outside the guidelines of the act, as I made it clear on Monday, the act provides plenty of powers to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to take any necessary action. It also puts a duty on the commission to protect the Australian economy, or any important part of that economy, from serious harm. The power is there and the obligations are there. Having said that, if we are to accept that enterprise bargaining is the way to go-and of course those sitting opposite have been preaching enterprise bargaining for years now-the fact is that we must allow employers and unions the freedom to bargain. We would be hopeful that that could be done without the need to resort to industrial action. Whatever happens, anything the member for Bennelong or his colleagues say about this will have absolutely zero credibility-which is exactly what it should have. Anyone who was Treasurer in the early 1980s during that wages and strike spiral, as the member for Bennelong was, who claims to be an enterprise bargaining disciple these days/is certainly in no position to attack this government on its record performances on reform-and neither are any of his colleagues. Nigeria: Alleged Trade Fraud",82
143,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Is the government aware of recent media reports on apparent trade fraud originating from Nigeria directed at Australians and Australian companies? What action has the government taken? Mr BILNEYI thank the honourable member for his question. As I got up to answer this question, the Minister for Consumer Affairs reminded me that she too has had complaints of this kind and has taken action against them. I understand that these scams have included companies and individuals in Tasmania, whence the honourable member comes. A week ago, A Current Affair ran a program on the issue of trade frauds which originate in Nigeria. Over the last few years, quite a number of Australian companies and Australian individuals have been targeted by unscrupulous individuals living in Nigeria in an attempt to promote fraudulent international monetary transactions under a number of different pretences. Most of those frauds are pretty obvious, but some of them are pretty sophisticated and a number of Australians who believed they were involved in legitimate business dealings have fallen for them. The most common approach, as I understand it, involves letters being sent by individuals, inviting the recipient to participate in a scheme which purportedly involves releasing funds which are said to be frozen by the Central Bank of Nigeria. Another common scam involves requests for consignments of goods, which are supposedly to test the market in Nigeria. Once the goods arrive, the perpetrator disappears and no payment is ever made for the goods. A third sort of scheme involves business people being invited to go to Nigeria. Once they arrive, they are robbed and, in some cases, virtually kidnapped. A fourth, and perhaps the most heinous scheme, involves the targeting of charities. They get a letter saying that a wealthy Nigerian has left them a large sum of money and all they have to do is pay a certain amount in fees and charges to enable the release of this sum of money. They pay this advance sum and nothing happens thereafter. Quite apart from the action which has been taken by my colleague the Minister for Consumer Affairs, the Australian Federal· Police has issued a number of media releases in an attempt to alert businesses to this problem. For its part, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade includes in its travel advisory warnings to people proposing to travel to Nigeria a warning about the prevalence of these fraud attempts. We have also called in the High Commissioner of Nigeria to impress upon him the concern of the government. He has undertaken to convey that concern to his government. But, in the meantime, Australians who get this kind of letter or are approached in this way should beware. Unemployment",83
144,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Can the minister either confirm or deny a claim made by a member of his department that the recently announced government program for the long-term unemployt<d.is, in fact, a fiddle to fix up the long-term unemployment figures by the time of the next election? This scheme involves giving the long-term unemployed six months training. However, should they still be unemployed after that time, they go back to the front of the list so, despite their long period of unemployment, they are not recorded that way.",84
145,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is an absolute absurdity. The fact is that the government is taking effective measures to deal with long term unemployment. The evidence we have is that the sort of labour market and training interventions that are envisaged in the job compact and through the greatly increased labour market assistance have a major bearing on the prospects of people who have been out of work for a long time getting a job. The evidence is clear-cut that, in the absence of those interventions, the prospects of people going on thereafter to permanent work are very poor. It is demonstrable that people who participate in these programs have significantly better prospects. So there is a very real and effective policy intent behind these programs and those interventions, and to caricature them in that way is just a patent absurdity. Professional Liability",84
146,Mr ROBERT BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General and it concerns the liability of professionals. I ask the Attorney-General: is he aware of legislation which has just been introduced into the New South Wales parliament which apparently is designed to put a cap or a limit on the liability of professionals such as auditors? What type of effect would that proposal have on the national corporations scheme and, in particular, what effect could it have on the interests of investors in Australian firms or corporations?",84
147,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"l understand that the New South Wales parliament-indeed, the lower House-will shortly be considering legislation which will introduce a system of establishing particular standards for occupations, not only the professions but particularly the professions, and combined with that the placing of caps on liabilities of individual members of that profession. I accept that the issue of liability and large claims against auditors and other professionals is of great concern. Under the current law, if someone is even marginally responsible for someone's loss through negligence, then the law of joint and several liability can mean that that individual or firm is 100 per cent responsible for the payment of the damages. This is a particular issue for auditors in relation to their work under the Corporations Law providing audit reports on Australian companies which subsequently may turn out to be inaccurate through negligence or fault on behalf of the auditor, where the company collapses and the auditor is sued as a result of that, and particularly if the directors or other malfeasants in relation to the transaction are not available. However, I strongly believe that the action of the New South Wales government in proposing this law at this time is at the very least premature. Firstly, a consequence of one jurisdiction going it alone on a capping regime in this regard will lead to considerable anomalies in relation to the overall liability system, particularly that which applies to our national company law. We will see a situation, I believe, of mere forum shopping as companies seek to gain auditors from other states where there is not a cap in place. So I do not see that it is going to particularly advantage the profession in that sense. Secondly, we have seen a joint attempt by the Commonwealth and the government of New South Wales to examine the underlying problem of the law of joint and several liability. The ministerial council in will be receiving a report from Professor Davis of the Australian National University on this only next month. It is disappointing that the New South Wales government cannot wait until that report is received. The effect of capping will simply shift the problem; it will not solve the problem. It is unfair to those who have sOffered loss and it also weakens the basic structure of the Corporations Law, which places an important role on auditors in terms of their checking of the legitimacy of company accounts and the investor protection which flows from it. So for those reasons I would ask the New South Wales government to think again about proceeding with this legislation and wait at least until such time as we have had a chance to consider the recommendations of law reform and the underlying problems of the law of joint and several liability.",84

157,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The threat to the Christmas holiday period posed by strike action by the Transport Workers Union, underwritten by the government's changes to the Industrial Relations Act. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",86
158,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On the face of it, one would not imagine that there was a great linkage between the signature of the APEC document in Bogor and the Australian Industrial Relations Act. Yet, quite coincidentally, there really is a very significant linkage between what has been signed in Bogor and the operation of Australia's industrial relations system. If the document signed in Bogor heralds this great freeing of Australia's product markets and if it is going to usher in a great new untrammelled era of prosperity and free trade in the Asia-Pacific region of Australia, then there is one thing we can be absolutely certain of: we will never enjoy the benefits of the APEC agreement unless we take the necessary steps to modernise the domestic economy in Australia. Just as the government failed in the 1980s to match financial deregulation with labour market deregulation and thereby get the real benefits of freeing up the financial system, it is also failing to match the APEC agreement and the APEC aspirations with deregulation of Australia's labour markets. As such, we will not inherit any of the bounties of which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) boasted so much overnight in Indonesia. There is a linkage between the APEC agreement and our industrial relations system. It is not coincidental that today we are debating industrial relations and also reading reports of the signature of that document in Indonesia. It is an important document. Everybody must hope that Australia benefits from that free trade agreement, but we will benefit only if we take the necessary steps to capture the benefits of that agreement, and so far we have not done so. Just as in the 1980s the government failed to match financial deregulation with labour market deregulation, so it is now failing to match product free trade and product deregulation with labour market deregulation. The charge that we make against this government is that it has gone backwards on the subject of industrial relations since the last election. It did not just stand still. It did not just decline to implement the reforms that had been advocated by the coalition. It actually went backwards. The results of the government going backwards are now clear for everybody to see. The beer, the food, the holiday Christmas travel, some of the toy deliveries to retail shops and perhaps garbage collections thrown in for good measure are under threat as a result of the threatened imposition of a strike by the Transport Workers Union. In case anybody is in any doubt at all about who is to blame for this strike, I will quote some words of Mr John Price, the Federal Secretary of the Transport Workers Union, from an article in the Business Review Weekly of 14 November 1994-a mere three days  the culprit is the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) who is sitting opposite. Do you know who is to blame for this strike? It is you, y-o-u, sitting over there opposite us. You are to blame for this because you are responsible. Mr Sharp-Moi.",86
159,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, moi over there. You, y-o-u, are responsible for the introduction of this contemptible Industrial Relations Act. Let me read the pearls of wisdom that came from the lips of the Federal Secretary of the Transport Workers Union. The article reads: ""We will use whatever tactics are necessary to gain this increase,"" Price says. ""Given that industrial action is now legalised under the actthat is your act, the Brereton actnational strike action is likely. In many ways, militancy is regrettable, but the new system forces our hand."" In other words, the system introduced by the minister who sits opposite has forced the hand of the Transport Workers Union. If there are stoppages and if our Christmas is ruined by the industrial action of the Transport Workers Union, nobody in Australia will carry more responsibility for that than the federal Minister for Industrial Relations-the man who wants to disappear from industrial relations, and indeed who ought to disappear from industrial relations; and the man who has made a failure of industrial relations. Years ago his great mate the Prime Minister, when ballots were being rigged in the New South Wales ALP, called him Danger Man-an allusion to Patrick MCGoohan. That term has a certain relevance to today's circumstances. The Minister for Industrial Relations is a danger to Australia's industrial relations. He is a direct danger to our transport system. He has presided over a ramshackle failure of administration, and he ought to have the guts and the sense of personal responsibility to resign over the total breakdown of his administration of the Department of Transport. My remarks are directly related to his failure as an industrial relations minister. On three counts he is directly responsible for the union militancy that now threatens to iAterrupt the peaceful and happy enjoyment by Australian families of the up-coming Christmas period. The first count is his changing of the Industrial Relations Act to encourage the very action which is occurring at the present time. With those changes of last year, he took out of the Industrial Relations Act the secondary boycott provisions that provided protection against the very sort of action the Transport Workers Union is now threatening. What is the Transport Workers Union threatening to do? It is threatening to boycott the supply of goods and services to companies like Woolworths, Coles and all the other major retailers of Australia. That is secondary boycott action, which can now be carried out with total immunity and total impunity by any offending union. That was not possible under the former act; it was not possible under the legislation union that had been introduced by the Fraser government. That was not possible until Danger Man over there worked his wicked will and destroyed those effective sanctions against that kind of predatory union conduct. The second count relates to changes to the act. He has taken away the legal restraints on strikes that occur during the bargaining period between a union and an employer. Effectively, a union can now seek to bargain in good faith under the bargaining good faith provisions of the new act, can make a claim on the employer and, while the employer is responding, can go on strike while being completely immune from any kind of legal action resulting from that particular strike. The final critidsm I make of the minister is that he belongs to a government whose leader, the Prime Minister, deliberately talked up the 15 per cent wage claim by the Transport Workers Union. Last week the Prime Minister of Australia went on the John Laws program. Instead of exercising the sense of responsibility that was exercised by the Treasurer, who expressed concern about that 15 per cent wage claim, and instead of recognising that Australians would like to enjoy the Christmas that is about to come after five years of the recession we had to have, the Prime Minister deliberately decided to talk up that claim. For those three reasons, this government and this minister are directly responsible for the fact that the Transport Workers Union right now, as I speak, is threatening to interrupt supplies of food and beer, Christmas travel, and deliveries of cash to employers to pay Australian workers so they can buy toys for their children at Christmas. All of the things that Australian families take for granted at this time of the year are under threat because of the industrial relations failure of this government. This government has presided over a deterioration in the industrial relations law of this country. In the few minutes that remain, I will give honourable members a real, live, contemporary example of just how bad the minister's industrial relations act is. I know that my Western Australian colleagues-indeed all of my colleagues-will know where Geraldton is. There is a retirement home in Geraldton for returned service men and women which is run by the local RSL. The story I will tell you is about the 'Geraldton Five', as I christen them-five employees of that retirement home. For many years they were working under a state award covered by the Western Australian industrial relations legislation. Under the new legislation introduced by the Court Liberal government in Western Australia, those five people decided to negotiate a workplace agreement. Under that agreement they got more money; they got a higher annual wage; they were able to eliminate the shift penalties which, you can understand, are a real pest when it comes to running an operation that needs 24-hour care and 24-hour service, as a retirement home does. In every respect they were perfectly happy with the arrangement that they negotiated. In the course of the negotiation, they consulted the union, and the union's advice was ignored. They signed this workplace contract and happily went about their way with higher wages and better conditions. But they did not bargain on what the union would do. The union decided to apply to the federal Industrial Relations Commission, under your act, to get an interim order to restore the old state award. The joke does not end there. It was successful in obtaining that interim order. The federal Industrial Relations Commission has temporarily reinstated the state award which those five people rejected. That is despite the fact that those five people freely and voluntarily entered into that workplace agreement; it is despite the fact that they were getting more money under that agreement; it is despite the fact that the firm that they work for has got a better operation; and it is despite the fact that the patients in the nursing home are getting more relevant and more uninterrupted care. Despite all of those facts, somehow or other, this government's philosophy on industrial relations was interfered with. Those five people are now forced back into working under the state award. That is despite the fact that, in the course of the hearing, they swore and filed affidavits with the federal Industrial Relations Commission saying that they were perfectly happy with the arrangements. One of the female employees of the nursing home said to a member of the Western Australian parliament, 'The thing that angers me most about what has happened to me is not the fact that I am getting paid less money as a result of having to go back under the state award; it is that for the first time in 15 years, through the flexibility of this arrangement, I had been able to get a happy accommodation between my work responsibilities and my family responsibilities.' That is something that is of enormous concern and worry to working families in Australia. One of the great unresolved problems in Australian society is how people effectively blend work and family responsibilities. You are to blame for that woman being denied that effective blending. It is your legislation, your craven cave-into the trade union movement of Australia, that has made it possible. I say 'thank you' to you, Minister, for one thing: you warned me during question time about one of your lines of argument. You said that the level of industrial disputation and the industrial record of this government are superior to that of the Fraser government. This mob is very good at telling Richardsons. Nobody is better at telling Richardsons than one of Richardson's old mates who sits opposite me. One of the great canards I would like to put down is this claim that, in some way, the industrial record of this government is better than that of the Fraser government. When you look at the period between 1977 and 1982, Australia's industrial record pared with that of the rest of the world relatively better than it has been during last five years under your administration. can carry on. If you dispute what I say, I quote you the magazine that the Prime Mincountry. ister is always tugging his forelock to-the Economist magazine of January of this yearwhich proves that. The final thing that I say to you is that you get on to 1981-82, could I remind you that at the 1986 national conference of the ALP, your Prime Minister attacked George Campbell. He said, 'George, you've got 100,000 dead men hanging around your neck.' He was referring to the dead men lost their jobs because of the irresponsible union campaign during 1982, an echo of legislation. which is the irresponsible union campaign of the Transport Workers Union in 1994.",87
160,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Kingsford-Smithhe hate Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport) (4.10 p.m.)-Talk about chooswas ing the wrong issue on which to make leadership statement! The member for Benneanything long (Mr Howard) should be the last person in this parliament to attack our government wages and the threat of strikes. He was the Treasurer in a government which presided over a wages spiral, industrial chaos-he cial cannot deny it-double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment. His record' as Treasurer was one of the worse in the whole history of Australia. It is his personal tross hanging right around his ears. Now comes into the chamber today and attacks government-a government that has delivered the lowest annual level of industrial disputes for 50 years; a government that has delivered on wages moderation, that has seen inflation at less than two per cent and record employrejected ment growth. That is our record, and we are justifiably proud of it. Only this week the member for Bennelong stood in this parliament and attacked our bill to mainstream the Coal Industry Tribunal, even though that bill had the suppor1lof both employers and employees. He attacked it vehemently, but he did not oppose it. He knew that, yet again, it was something we had done which in his many years he had failed comto do. Today he attacks us over enterprise was bargaining and the claim of the Transport the Workers Union when he knows that he You himself has been the leading advocate of a decentralised system of bargaining in this ' What angle does he choose today-section 450. Ho-hum, what a surprise! When it comes to 45D;'he is capable of saying anyif thing at all. Today he' said that there is no protection from secondary boycotts, but he knows there is, and he knows that the protection is more tha- adequate. We have just made secondary boycott legislation apply to secondary boycotts. We have simply taken who away the blatant anti-union bias and the primary boycott application of the previous He hates what we have done. He hates it with a passion. Well might we ask: why does it? Why does he hate any changes to section 450? It is because old section 450 the only thing he ever did while he was a in government. Oid that section 450 do to stop the strikes or the wage explosion of 1981, 1982 or 1983? Oid it stop on any of that? Not on your nelly. Of course, all of the other achievements that he claims are vicarious. He says that he talked about finanderegulation. But did he do it? No, not on your nelly. He said that he wanted to float the dollar. But did, he do it? No, not on your nelly. He said that he wanted foreign banks albain Australia. But did he do it? No, not on he your nelly. Then he said that he wanted our enterprise bargaining. But he could never deliver it. No, not on your nelly. Three times the electorate has been served up with his brand of anti-union, anti-employee bargaining, and each time it has been comprehensively by the Australian electorate. It is always someone else's fault, never his. That is what he kept saying in the recent ABC television program on the Liberal Party. In 1987 it was Joh's fault. In 1990 it was Andrew Peacock's fault. In 1993 it was Jeff Kennett's fault or John Hewson's fault, with his $3 youth wage. When he was in government, it was all Fraser's fault. It is always anyone else's fault but his own. Even when the opinion polls show that the electorate thinks our policies on IR are better and they consistently rate our policies as being twice as acceptable as those of the opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong says that there is nothing wrong with his beloved Jobsback. That was until recently, when the opt-in arrangement was changed to an opt-out one. Something that he claimed earlier was a major feature of his policy was abandoned unceremoniously just a few short days ago. Well might we ask what prompted the change. Why this sudden change of heart? The last time that he had a change of heart was in 1955. We might well ask what changed his mind last week. The performance of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) changed his mind. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, it was when the opposition leader started going bad that the member for Bennelong again started to hear the age-old voices. Of course, a lot of those voices were from the moderates within his own ranks whose votes he needs in order to topple the Leader of the Opposition. What do these moderates want him to do? They want him to soften up Jobsback. They know that it is unacceptable. They want it to be made more saleable. In the current climate, the member for Bennelong said, 'Yes, I will agree.' He even had a press conference and, of all things, talked about a transparent safety net. He was prepared to even borrow our rhetoric in an attempt to look flexible. In the Canberra Times yesterday, we saw the member for Bennelong assuring everyone that the four pillars of Jobsback would be retained. He called them the four pillars of wisdom. They sound to me like the four pillars of salt. He said, 'Yes, the four pillars will be retained.' They might appear to have been changed, but in reality he is incapable of change. The truth of the matter is that he has never been able to change. He has never stopped hating us, the union movement and the safety net and he has certainly never stopped hating the right wing of the New South Wales Labor Party; that is for sure. The problem for him is",89
161,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Look at Daryl over there.,90
162,Mr BRERETON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Daryl and I have always managed to have a pretty reasonable relationship. The real problem is that the colleagues of the honourable member oppositethose who have been sitting behind him today - know that he is incapable of change. When leadership is in the balance, they might force him to suggest some changes to Jobsback. But, as leader, everyone knows-most of all his own colleagues-that he is incapable of change on industrial relations, the republic, immigration policy or on ultraconservative social policy issues. As bad as the current Leader of the Opposition is, he has one advantage, which is that he really does not believe in anything. But everything that the member for Bennelong believes in is truly outdated. He has got strong beliefs, but each and every one of them is outdated. The ABC program, more than anything else in these last several weeks, has illustrated that and reinforced it with the whole of the Australian electorate. The honourable member for Bennelong is really yesterday's man. For one thing, he is certainly not yesterday's hero; there is no way in the world that he is. The fact is that his IR policies are yesterday's policies. Listen to the speeches that he delivers in the House. They all sound like the Hansard of ten years ago, and you know it. Today's rant and rave is no different again; it is vintage member for Bennelong. I said on Monday that strong rules govern the behaviour of unions and employers in the bargaining process. They certainly do. Yet, in enterprise bargaining, it is up to the parties to determine outcomes. Employers can determine what they can afford to pay. That is something they could not do back in the time of the wages push of 1982-83, when the member for Bennelong was in the chair as the treasurer of Australia. If both sides act within the law-and I am pleased that the Transport Workers Union has publicly indicated as late as yesterday that it intends to-we have to simply allow the bargaining process to work, unless we want to go back to the centralised system. I do not think anyone in the opposition is suggesting that; the opposition wants an enterprise bargaining system without anyone being able to cut a bargain. For my part, I have never thought that the employers in the transport industry were pushovers of any sort. Those opposite appear to me to be the only ones who are of that view. They seem to think that 15 per cent claimed is 15 per cent achieved. Let me point out that not even Jennie George of the ACTU would be as confident of that as those opposite would pretend to be. Those opposite say that they hate the accord-but, of course, they would like to see a regulation of wages claims. You hope that there is no large-scale industrial action; we certainly hope that there is no such instance. You claim that there is nothing to prevent any unauthorised or highly damaging industrial action; however, you know that on Monday I outlined all of the provisions in the Industrial Relations Reform Act which will guarantee that the law is upheld. For the government's part, we will monitor the situation in the transport industry, just we have monitored in bargaining generally the encouraging progress-progress that has seen bargains in the federal system achieve 56 per cent of all federal award coverage, with the best performance from the states being 14 per cent in Queensland, and with not one of the conservative states yet to make double figures. That is the success that we have had. We certainly will also be making sure that we maintain the overarching framework of the accord to help keep inflation and the safety net wage rises quite modest in their impact. That is, after all, the very underpinning of accord. But I will say this: we will also guarantee the protection of the safety net itself, unlike those opposite who would tear it down. The formula of the safety net has worked well for us over the whole of the last decade; I believe that it will continue to do so as we go forward into this decentralised system. As I have indicated to the House, already our model of a decentralised system is working far better than are all of the conservative modtls. That is really the reason why it is so easy for me to come into the House today and dismiss performances such as we have seen from the member for Bennelong. We need only point out to him again and again the dismal record that was his, both in and out of government. That does more to discredit him and anything he might say than anything else possibly could. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is time for the House to reject the tired leadership plea that we have seen this afternoon. You must ask yourself about the Leader of the Opposition, though. To let the member for Bennelong have this platform today, the Leader of the Opposition must either be so sure of himself after his performance of the last 48 hours, or so stupid; or maybe it is the fact that the Leader of the Opposition knows that, given a quarter of a chance at the microphone here in the House, the member for Bennelong cannot change his spots. He is locked into that time warp of the past, with the same tired old rhetoric and the same failed old policiesthe policies which have been rejected again and again by the Australian electorate and as which in every survey are shown as still being utterly unacceptable to them. I think it is time for the House to reject the policies of the member for Bennelong and get on with the job of making sure that the area of industrial relations in this country continues to prosper in a way that it never did under any conservative government.",90
163,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I note that the Minister f9r Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) is sitting down, although he still has two minutes of his allotted time left in which he could continue the to speak. So thin was he on material to use in trying to defend his position that half of what he did say was devoted to a personal attack on the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). The minister ran an interesting line of logic in his remarks. He was blaming the member for Bennelong for the strikes that took place at the time the member for Bennelong held the position of Treasurer. If the member for Bennelong were to be held responsible for the strikes which have been referred to-strikes which were in an area not directly within his portfolio-I would think that the present Minister for Transport, now leaving the House, at least has to take some responsibility for the planes which have been falling out of the sky, an area which is directly within his portfolio. But the minister even tries to pass the buck on that. We are discussing this matter of public importance some 5 112 weeks before Christmas when Australians will be looking to sitting down with their families around the home table and enjoying themselves over Christmas dinner. But it appears that this year, regrettably, that enjoyment is in danger of being severely diminished. This government, under its incompetent minister, has put in place a disastrous industrial relations policy that has made possible the threatened Transport Workers Union strike which is facing us today. The Transport Workers Union is flexing its muscles and threatening to strike for a 15 per cent wage rise. I do not have to tell members in this chamber the consequences of that if it comes about. There will be a whole host of flow-on effects, not the least of which will be inflationary ones. We are just starting to reverse the disastrous job situation in - his country today. It is at a very tentative stage and the intended strike will present a lovely Christmas present to a number of Australians. I saw a report in the Age newspaper this morning referring to a Yellow Pages small business index survey showing that 33 per cent of non-farm small businesses surveyed in areas affected by severe drought fear they will be forced to close, while 50 per cent of them did not think they could last another year. If we get that sort of nonsense about wage rises coming out of the Transport Workers Union, presided over by the Minister for Transport, the situation will become even worse than it is now. Enterprise bargaining, which the minister was just bragging about, is an absolute farce federally in this country t9day, as any employer will tell you, and people are losing faith in the process. It is interesting to look at the players surrounding this strike. First of all, there is the TWU federal president, Steve Hutchins. Let us look at the mentality of some of the statements that he has made when demanding his 15 per cent wage rise at this critical time. He says that, if the employers force the TWU to use 'guerilla' style industrial tactics to achieve its pay claim, that will be their choice. What a way of twisting the whole situation around. This is what we are up against these days. He has also said that major retailers and transport carriers such as TNT, Brambles, Linfox and Mayne Nickless would be 'begging for attention' after he acts. The federal secretary of the TWU, John Price, has said, 'We are not backing off and, in fact, we have brought our plans forward and we have decided ... that we are going to kick off this campaign before Christmas.' What a lovely situation we have in Australia today! An article in the Business Review Weekly of 14 November states: ""We will use whatever tactics are necessary to gain this increase,"" Price says. ""Given that industrial action is now legalised under the act, national strike action is likely. A most revealing damnation of the present minister's policy is when John Price says: In many ways, union militancy is regrettable, but the new system forces our hand."" There you are-a damming indictment indeed of the present minister for both transport and industrial relations. Both these union officials said they were going to target the retail sector and the armoured car transport sector that delivers wages and retail takings to banks, et cetera. Their aim in this action is to starve the shops of goods in the lead-up to Christmas and to stop the money getting to the banks. It is a very critical time for retailers at the moment. They have been hanging on by the fingernails, to use the words of one of the retail representatives in Victoria. Assisting in all of this is the ACTU secretary, Bill Kelty, who gives strong endorsement to this claim. There are other people, like Jennie George, offering their support, and there is the minister himself, L.J. Brereton, who is so weakened, so powerless to do anything. When he gets up to give a shortened speech he can do no more than wring his hands, hoping it will all go away. He could not even answer a question today on secondary boycott provisions. He talked about everything else but. He does not seem to have a grasp of his portfolio at all. The consequences of all this are that grocery stores with perishable goods will be in danger; departmental stores which had a turnover of $950 million in November and which are looking to boost that to $1,700 million in December to keep going will be in jeopardy; and wholesalers and liquor outlets which will be looking to up their trade in December will also be put in jeopardy. In fact, the entire retailing sector is looking to boost its turnover from $8.6 billion to $11.3 billion in December. All that has now been put on the backburner. It is a very serious situation indeed, which is why we have brought this MPI before the House today. It is very instructive to look at how this strike came about. I think there are six ingredients to it. Firstly, the high capital intensive nature of the industry makes it vulnerable to union muscle and leverage. Secondly, vulnerable industries starved.of. cash flow are waiting for their profits to flow through in December-a traditionally good trading month in the retail industry. Thirdly, Christmas is coming up, and what usually happens every Christmas is that beer carters go on strike. This year the union movement is using a bit more imagination and widening the range of goods that it will be denying stores when it exercises its union muscle. Fourthly, militant union officials in the workplace-I have just given examples of the language some of them are using-have no care whatsoever for industry profitability. Mr Nehl-Economic vandals.",91
164,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are indeed economic vandals. They are prepared to use others and to make others suffer for their own cause. And what is that cause? The fifth reason is that a union election is coming up-surprise, surprise! The nominations opened on 8 November. I have an in-house minute paper from the Australian Electoral Commission which says that nominations opened on 8 November and close on 29 November, which coincides with the beginning of all this strike talk. The ballot opens on 10 February-this is the bad news-and does not clos\lJ until 3 March. So we will probably have five months of this industrial relations type language and strike action to prop up the union leadership which has failed its members so miserably over the last two or three years and before. It will be trying to lift its profile. by using others near Christmas time to get some votes. It is interesting to note that it says on the bottom of this minute paper: AU federal and branch elections are expected to be contested due to factional disputation within the union. The union has a long history of legal proceedings concerning disputed elections and these elections are unlikely to be any different. This strike talk is more about that than about anything else. On top of that, we have a weakened minister who has bungled ANL, bungled CAA and bungled his industrial relations reform, particularly the unfair dismissal provisions. As a result of all the legislation that was passed last year that the coalition warned the government about when the minister caved in, the chickens are coming home to roost. He allowed de facto compulsory unionism to continue, he took sections 45D and 45E out of the Trade Practices Act and he allowed rights to interfere in so-called non-union agreements. The minister should be condemned for the way he has handled the portfolio. (Time expired)",93
165,Mr CLEELAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"MCEwen) (4.34 p.m.)This matter of public importance debate is typical of the vast differences which lie between those people who stand on this side of the House and the Australian tories and extreme right wing members of the National Party. If there is one thing that distinguishes us, it is the differences in our views on the rights of individual wage earners of this country to sell their labour at the best price they can get. Of course, the tories and the extreme right have never accepted that view. To those on the other side, the individual wage earner has no right of collective bargaining. It is a right which is always denied by them to the individual Australian worker. The member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) speaks regularly on this topic. In fact, as a conservative, his views have not changed since I came into this House in 1984. It is a speech he made which I have heard with monotonous regularity. He says, and members of his party say, that those whose only economic value is the right to sell their labour do not have the right to collective bargaining. Opposition members say that business organisations have the right of collective bargaining. They distinguish between the individual and the corporate structure. That is a major fundamental difference between opposition members and those of us on this side of the House. When we look at what the conservativ:es in this country do, when we look at. Western AustraHaand Victoria, and when we look at the Fightback policies and enunciations from the conServatives on what they would do if they were in government, we know that they would remove the safety net. They would pull the safety net right away. That is what Mr Court wants to do in Western Australia; that is what Mr Kennett proposed in Victoria. They say that workers have to go out as individuals and fight for whatever dollar they can get from within the system. Mr Kennett is a good friend of members on the other side and someone they fully support. They say that he is doing the right thing for industrial relations. Mr Court is also well supported on the other side. They say that his approach to industrial relations is very proper and appropriate. They introduced legislation in their state parliaments which pulled away the safety net and removed the rights of the individual salary and wage earner to collectively bargain. They say that is desirable. They say that, economically, that is good. They say that no individual should have a minimum standard of wage. I find this very strange coming from the conservatives, because they sit here in this House and argue for individual rights. They argue that every Australian has certain individual natural rights. They go back to Adam Smith and say that this individual right cannot be contracted away. It is an inherent right of the human soul and the human spirit. It is most confusing when, on the one hand, they believe this as a fundamental principle yet, on the other hand, deny collective bargaining. They put forward a very confusing argument. They say that the ordinary salary and wage earner has the fundamental human right to collectively bargain with his or her employer, but when a bundle of workers sit down and say that they want to combine their individual rights into a collective the member for Bennelong says that is not a right they have. That is his argument. He denies them their fundamental right. Although he will argue for individual rights, he will deny the right of the individua. to join a collective. This is one of the strangest notions the conservatives or the tories of this country want to run with. I get very worried when I think about them getting into government in this country and their views, as expressed through Mr Court and Mr Kennett, becoming federal law. There has never been a more confusing industrial relations system implemented in this country than the system in Victoria-one which has demonstrably failed and one which the private sector, to its credit, says does not work. It is a disaster. it is designed to take away safety nets, yet that is what those opposite support. I have heard no-one from that side of the House criticise Mr Court for his disastrous industrial relations legislation. I have not heard the member for Bennelong stand up in this place and say that the failed industrial relations policy of the Liberals in Victoria is wrong. I have not heard him stand up once and say that it is a disaster. His natural colleagues, the business sector, constantly say that it is a failure and that it does not work. The inconsistencies are glaring and constant. The reality is that the worker who has only one thing to sell-the only economic value is his or her labour-should not be treated as an individual because the individual cannot under any circumstance compete against a collective, the corporation, or against the multiple employer groups. You deny that right to them consistently. You totally deny it. Why do those of you who put as a virtue your Christian beliefs and your Christian values-many of you on that side do, far more than we on this side do;· you constantly parade your Christian virtues and your Christian values in this House-ignore the teachings of the church on this issue? Why do you consistently ignore the Pope's rulings in several encyclicals on the right to strike? Why do you ignore that right? Why do you who parade your - irtues and your Christian values so well Ignore the Christian teaching, on the, most fundamental right-the right to withhold labour? You stand here today and say that no worker has the right to withhold la-our. you criti-ise him as being part of an ambIt claIm, as being part of the negotiation for a change in working conditions. You stand here and parade your ignorance-that is what it is-and you ignore vital and fundamental rights in the very arguments you put I listened to the debate. Those of us who are mature, who are at least grown up, know that ambit claims are very broad. We all know that there is an ambit claim in the marketplace. At least I know. You might be ignorant. You probably do not understand industrial relations. You always sound pretty ignorant in this place on these issues. So when there is an ambit· claim one would expect the current negotiations and public stances being taken by the Transport Workers Union and the employers. There is nothing new in it. One would think from listening to this debate that the world is about to fall down on us and that Christmas is going to be abolished by the workers. That is what you have been saying in this House. So it is an ambitdaim. We do; quite proudly, have in this ,House a decent, honest system of indw;trial relationsnot a system supported by Court, not a system supported by Kennett and not a system supported by you, thank God-which will enable these negotiations to work through their proper processes. Let us face it. Do you honestly believe there is going to be a 50 per cent wage increase?",93

They ignore you in your totality. They do not even listen to you. This is a debate which the member for Bennelong has run since 1984.

172,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new chancery at P<,>rt· Moresby, Papua New Guinea. The main elements of the proposed work are: the construction of a five-level purpose-built chancery; a flat grassed recreation playing area with associated facilities including toilets, showers, a change room and a services building; staff and visitor car parking; and assoCiated site works, services and landscaping. The total estimated cost for the works at February 1994 prices is $22.260 million. Five contracting companies with significant Australian association have been invited to tender for the managing contractor role of the works. Tenders will close on 1 December 1994. Subject to parliamentary approval, the contractor will be appointed during January 1995. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has made the following recommendations in its report. Firstly, the committee again draws attention to the continuing difficulty it faces in assessing overseas projects as, under current legislation, it is unable to meet outside Australia or its external territories. Until this legislation is amended to enable site inspections. to be carried out overseas, the committee continues to reluctantly give approval for the construc.tion of projects which, in its view, it has been unable .to properly assess. I can tell the committee that I will be in Port Moresby on Monday and will inspect the site on its behalf. Secondly, the structure of the present chancery does not conform to the current design codes for seismic performance. The building requires major refurbishment, does not meet the latest security requirements and was not planned to cater for the present staffmg levels and functions of the high commission. Thirdly, a need therefore exists to provide a new chancery in Port Moresby which will provide a safe working environment. Fourthly, the site is a suitable location the construction of a new chancery for. the Australian government in Port Moresby. Fifthly, the committee recommends that the Commonwealth Fire Board and the committee be kept informed of the results of the risk analysis-cost benefits study 9f fire protection to be carried out in the new chancery. The Overseas Property Group will advise the Commonwealth Fire Board and the committee of the outcome. Sixthly, the committee recommends that the Overseas Property Group advise it of the results of the survey into the past uses of the site, as well as the results of the munitions search. The Overseas Property Group will advise the committee of the results of both the survey and the search. Seventhly, the committee commends the Overseas Property Group on its willingness to consult with the Community and Public Sector Union in its planning process for this proposal. Eighthly, the committee recommends that the Overseas Property Group continue consultations with the Community and Public Sector Union during the construction phase of the project. The Overseas Property Group will continually consult the Community and Public Sector Union during the layouts for the office and during the construction phase of the project. Ninthly, taking into account the reservations expressed in recommendation 1, - committee recommends the construction of a new chancery at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea at an estimated cost of $22.260 million at February 1994 prices. I thank the committee for its report. I wish it well in its future travels. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. RACIAL HATRED BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.",96
173,Mr CAMERON,COMMITTEES,"Stirling) (4.54 p.m.)I was speaking prior to question time about how one defines racism for the purposes of the Racial Hatred Bill. Consider, for example, a statement in the form, 'Westphalians have for a greater propensity to commit crimes than the Australian population as a whole.' Such a statement is quite likely to engender ill feeling-perhaps bordering on hatredtowards Westphalians. Such a statement might well be true, but truth has not been made a defence to a prosecution under the new law. There should not, in any case, be a requirement that every public statement likely to offend someone must be true. The cause of establishing the truth is best served by allowing free and unfettered debate on all subjects, without the losing side having to fear a punishment for being in 'error'. In any case, there is no reliable means of determining the truth of many propositions in the field of social science. Like truth, public interest, although available as a defence to the civil offences, will,,- not be a defence to a criminal prosecution. A new section to be inserted into the Racial Discrimination Act will impose civil penalties on those who offend, insult or humiliate a person because of his race. One could then be sued for calling someone a wog. There is no doubt that one should not call anyone a wog. One should not call anyone fat or ugly either, but are such momentary slips of the tongue to be punished by grinding litigation followed by a damages bill in the thousands of dollars? To outlaw name calling is to go beyond the nanny state. Even the nannies have a rhyme about sticks and stones for use in such cases. As though there were not enough burdens on the business community as it struggles to emerge from the recession, the bill drafts employers as unpaid police to enforce politically correct morality. Proposed section 18E of the Racial Discrimination Act will make an employer responsible for the racist comments of his workers, unless he takes all reasonable steps to prevent them from occurring. Just what constitutes all reasonable steps is far from clear. No doubt the human rights commissioners will be pleased, when awarding damages against 'errant' employers, to inform them of what they should have done to avoid the penalty. It is quite interesting that many members opposite, quite rightly, expect those accused of traditional wrongs to be accorded the most stringent procedural safeguards. Yet, when a person is accused of infringing politically correct morality in the civil sphere, his rights practically disappear. The complainant, regardless of his means, has at his disposal the resources of the state to conduct an investigation of the offence. The respondent is required to answer the questions of the investigating officer. Is racism a greater evil than murder that one accused of the latter deserves the right to silence but one accused of the former does not? It seems that it is considered better to punish 100 innocent men than let a guilty racist go free. If we must treat various politically incorrect 'isms' as civil wrongs-and there is no doubt that we should not-at the very least let the complainant have to bring an action for damages in the same way as he would against, say, a negligent driver. A complainant in a political trial need not fear an order for costs if his complaint is dismissed. This powerful check on the commencement of unfounded proceedings in an ordinary civil case does not apply in the politically correct tribunals. A successful defendant will still be left with a large bill for legal costs. People found guilty of infringing political correctness can obtain awards of damages of a level which, in the personal injury field, one would need to be seriously hurt to receive. Instead of being heard by partisan commissioners, these cases should be heard by judges with a wide range of experience of real crimes so as to be able to keep in perspective a complaint of hurt feelings. All laws restricting speech contain a penumbra, a twilight zone in which a person cannot be sure if his statements infringe the law, and therefore cause the prudent and the timid to refrain from making a much wider range of statements than the law intended to prohibit. Sanctions imposed by the courts will probably not be the major practical impediments to free speech. Those who control access to the forums for disseminating ideas-the publishing houses, the media and academia-will be forced to walk on egg shells when dealing with any issue touching on race. They will, most perhaps from a genuine desire to act lawfully - but some from a cynical desire to suppress debate-cite the law as a reason not to publish anything at variance with contemporary wisdom on multiculturalism. All decent Australians recognise and shun a genuine racist, and that is the most appropriate sanction for the boorish and bigoted members of the community. We do not need to make them into martyrs and begin a race litigation lottery in the process. The Racial Hatred Bill is junk law, the legislative equivalent of the Big Mac. Although racism is a real evil, the bill is an illconceived and draconian reaction to a problem which can only be dealt with through education. This bill proposes to crack walnuts with a sledgehammer, and it will break up the pavement at the same time. This bill is about punishing errant thought. Violent acts are already prohibited by law. If threats are not already prohibited, then they should be, but on a non-discriminatory basis. The new law will punish only those who do such acts with particular thoughts in their mind. The federal government is running the country in the way that undergraduate radicals run student unions: fervently devoted to banning politically incorrect behaviour while their finances are in ruin. The Republican landslide in the United States was a backlash against the combination of fiscal irresponsibility and the socially engineered state. America gave us the intellectual virus of political correctness in the first place, and one hopes in the near future for the arrival on these shores of the antidote.",97
174,Mr MELBAM,COMMITTEES,"I understand that there is an informal arrangement between the government and the opposition which will see me restrict my comments to about 10 minutes. There are some matters I would like to have raised in the debate, but they have already been canvassed. I am quite happy to rise in support of the Racial Hatred Bill. Quite frankly, whilst I have listened to a number of speeches made by those on the other side and have listened to some of the critics of the bill, I think there is a bit of a misconception. Certainly, some inconsistencies are flowing. It needs to be understood that there are limits to free speech all around the place. You have only to pull out the New South Wales Crimes Act to see penalties that one could argue limit free speech. The Commonwealth Crimes Act is another act that one could argue limits free speech. It fs really a question of what we, as a community, need to say about certain behaviour. I endorse the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), who said: This legislation asserts our values as a communidisplay ty. It is about community values. We are saying that this sort of activity cannot and will not be tolerated. I agree with him wholeheartedly. I am not walking away from the fact that there are criminal sanctions in this bill, but I do not come to this debate as a hanger and a flogger, as someone who has a prosecution history; I come to the debate as someone who has spent a decade as a legal aid solicitor and a legal aid barrister defending people charged with serious criminal offences. I have never prosecuted anyone in my life and I have no intention of prosecuting anyone. But, when it comes to behaviour, we as legislators need to sit back and say, 'What is the conduct we are looking at and is it deserving of criminal sanctions?' I say to members of the opposition that the conduct we are discussing at the moment that attracts criminal sanctic;ns is deserving of criminal sanctions. Frankly, it is an overlay of existing conduct that is currently regarded as criminal and attracts penalties. The great defenders of free speech in the opposition-as they would have us believeare celebrating the 50th anniversary of their party this year. We hear about the great founder, Sir Robert Gordon Menzies. What was his contribution to free speech? It was the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. When he could not get his way, he attempted to have a referendum. He was defeated in a campaign by the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr Evatt. What also was his record? Do we remember Fitzpatrick and Browne, who were brought before the bar of the House in 1955? It was the then Prime Minister, Robert Gordon Menzies, who moved the motion in the House that saw those people imprisoned for three months. Last Monday week, we saw protesters ejected from the gallery. The law as it stands - the Parliamentary Privileges Act and the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971-enables protesters in the gallery to be dealt with and to be imprisoned, in some instances for three months and in others for six months. Where is the argument that that is an inhibition of free speech? Similarly, penalties apply to people who posters in the gallery. The trouble here is that there is some inconsistency. I suggest that some members of the opposition are acting like precious little petals. I will read the particular parts of the legislation that relatt;{, to acts constituting criminal behaviour. I am particularly interested in proposed section 58, which states: . . . a person must not threaten to cause physical harm to another person or a group of people because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group. Imprisonment for this offence is set at two years. In New South Wales, the offence of indictable common assault carries a penalty of two years imprisonment. Whosoever assaults any person, although not occasioning actual bodily harm, shall be liable to imprisonment for two years. The point I want to make in relation to that is that assault can be occasioned by using words and by putting someone in fear. I suggest to people participating in, and listening to, the debate that the penalties we are bringing in through this legislation are not over the top. We are adding an extra element. We are not doing what the heroes in New South Wales are doing with their Community Protection federal Bill. Cop this: the Community Protection Bill that is currently lying on the table South Wales parliament deals with preventive detention. It means· that people can be dewhile tained in a prison for two years if a court is satisfied that they are more likely than not to function.'! commit a serious act of violence. That twoIt year imprisonment can be renewed. People can be put in prison for what they think. People can be put in prison on a civil stancommit dard; namely, on the balance of probabilities rather than for any crime being proved against them beyond reasonable doubt. That is not what this legislation does. retains the criminal standard. Each the offence has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and the prosecution bears the like burden. It is not reducing the standard. In my opinion, there is no doubt that, to some exthat? tent, its conduct is picked up in existing state legislation. But I suggest that this is alternaof tive legislation and that we are adding aggrait vating features. . Some states do not have legislation in existence. If people paint a synagogue or paint this parliament, they can be dealt for malicious damage. But surely racist slogans and swastikas are aggravating features that can be taken into account not only by sentencing judge but also in the sort of offence people are charged with. Here you would have a situation where-providing but there is sufficient evidence-if slogans incitattract ing racial hatred are displayed and people are brought before the courts, they can be charged with alternative charges. It is the best form education. We have just had· a press release from the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, which says this: . . . ""No fair-minded Australian will tolerate public expression of racial vilification or racial hatred. Australia has had many successes promoting tolerance within its diverse population, but public inquiries over the past few years have revealed a problem of sufficient significance in many parts of Australia to justify the development of a more effective national remedy."" Since legislation in this area was proposed at a level two years ago, the Commission has received many expressions of support from a wide in the New range of communities. Sir Ronald said: ""The Commission recognises that legislation alone will not change attitudes it has, among other things, an important educative says to the community that this behaviour will not be tolerated and can attract criminal sanctions. It does not mean that, if you this offence, you are automatically going to be put in prison-it is not one of those pieces of legislation-but it does allow for a gaol penalty. It is a matter that, under It the Commonwealth Crimes Act, a sentencing element of judge can take into account. But from the coalition we hear, 'We don't your legislation. We're going to introduce alternative legislation.' How is it going to do It is going to rely on both the external affairs power and our signature on a number covenants. It is the only way that it can do in terms of bringing in national legislation. It needs to use the external affairs power. What else do they say? The member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) said, 'The coalition is with committed to the introduction of a $10 million educational package to assist in combating racism.' That is just conscience the money. The best education system is to enact legislation not reducing the standard of proof or the burden of proof or the criminal onus saying that this sort of behaviour should a criminal sanction. We do it all the time. Oodles of legislation attracts criminal penalties. It does not mean that they are of automatically imposed, but it says to the community, 'This sort of behaviour is not on any more.' Section 59 of the proposed act says that a person must not threaten to destroy or damage property other than property belonging to the person. That certainly is already an offence the and attracts a period of imprisonment of only in one year under the proposed legislation. It then goes on to add another element, 'because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any other person or any group of persons'. Again, that is an essential element of that particular crime: there needs to be sufficient evidence and it needs to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. We should not walk away from this. There was an excellent article by Ron Castan in the Australian of 15 November 1994. He says: It is simply not the case that existing laws always adequately cover racist acts that clearly amount to threats of violence, harassment or incitement, especially in those states still without racial vilification laws. So I make no excuse for supporting legislation that carries with it criminal sanctions. It will be a matter for the sentencing judge or magistrate to exercise his discretion, given the nature of the matter with which he is dealing. We are not in my view diminishing the criminal standard to that extent. The opposition needs to reassess its !tituation. It is a pity that this bill is not going through with bipartisan support. That is the best education campaign. That is the best way to stop racial vilification and to maintain racial harmony in this country.",99
175,Mr ABBOTT,COMMITTEES,"Warringah) (5.12 p.m.)When I was at university I met a white South African exchange student. She seemed like a most charming, pleasant and delightful person until she started a part-time job where she had to make tea and coffee and do the photocopying. One day she came home in great disgust and said, 'This is work for blacks.' On cross examination, she said that the Bible said that blacks should be forever hewers of wood and drawers. of water. This was the first time in my life that I had ever come across sheer racism; the view that people were lesser human beings simply on account of their skin colour. The experience was all the more ugly because in nearly every other respect this young lady seemed so much like an ordinary Australian. The fact that someone such as me, from a classic middle-class Australian household, already out of my teens, had to wait that long to find real racism and, when If-nd it, to have found it in an overseas person says something about our society. It says that we l,lfe not a racist society. Sure, we are not perfect. We were not perfect in 1788. We .are not perfect today. But our. society on balance is one of the freest, the fairest and the most tolerant on earth. When Governor Phillip came to these shores, his instructions from his political masters were to live in amity with the native peoples. Back in the 1830s, there was the Myall Creek massacre. It was a terrible event, where white men were hanged for the murder of Aborigines. The Chinese had a rotten deal on the goldfields, but that did not stop Thomas Bakhap from becoming a senator in one of the early federation parliaments-and a senator, I might add, for the Nationalist Party, one of the forerunners of the party I represent. Italians were present in our country from the very beginning. There was an Italian with Captain Cook, and an Italian on the First Fleet. There was an Italian at the Eureka Stockade. An Italian bishop of Armidale was once stabbed and shot in the middle of saying mass. He picked himself up as if nothing had happened and went right on with the mass, which strikes me as a very Australian attitude. The point is· that in this great country of ours people from the four corners of the earth have been able to come and make a life for themselves. The differences between us are always dissolving into something called 'Australianness', which is always in the process of being created and recreated. We do not have 'your Australia' and 'my Australia'; we simply have 'our Australia'. I have one paternal grandfather from England and a maternal grandfather from Holland, yet I do not believe I should say that I am a Dutch Australian or an Anglo-Australian, simply an Australian. I do not normally agree with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but one instance where the Prime Minister is right is in his dislike of hyphens. I am very proud to be standing here today and defending the record of my country, our country. I am also pleased to be defending the record of the Liberal Party, my party. The Liberal Party was the first party to put into the federal parliament an Aboriginal, ex-Senator Neville Bonner. The Liberal Party was the first party to put into an Australian parliament-the New South Wales parliament-a Chinese born person, Helen Shamit He. The Liberal Party ended White Australia at a time when the Labor Party was led by sary. Arthur Calwell, who said, as we remember, 'Two wongs don't make a white.' It was the Liberal Party that began large-scale Asian immigration to this country with the Vietnaseen mese boat people at a time when the Labor Party was led by Gough Whitlam, who position, described those self-same boat people as 'effing yellow BaIts'. The Liberal Party has a proud record of opposition to racism in .allits Australia has a proud record of opposition to racism in all its forms. The basic problem with this legislation is that no-one can really demonstrate any clear demand for it. There is nothing which should be illegal which is currently illegal. Assaults motivated by racism are currently illegal. Graffiti motivated racism is currently illegal. Arson motivated racism is currently illegal. The most outrageous and reprehensible example of racism in our country is the perpetrated by Jack Van Tonga in Western words. Australia. He is serving a very long gaol sentence, as he should be. If we look at New South Wales legislation-legislation which is unobjectionable-we see that there have been something like 400 complaints in the last five years. In that time there have only been three attempts to bring a prosecusomeone tion under that legislation. So either the legislation does not make a huge difference there is not a huge problem. So many reputable people in our society believe that this legislation is unnecessary. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody thinks it is unnecessary. The Australian Law Reform Commission tank,that thinks it is unnecessary. Joe Wakim, a nent member of the Arabic community, said that it waS unnecessary. Phillip Adams, great small 'L' liberal and supporter of the Labor Party over the years, believes that it unnecessary. He said, 'Wrong country, wrong time, wrong law.' Even ex-Senator John Button has said that it is unnecessary. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) says not suppression. that it is unnecessary. The Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) says that is unnecessary. The member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) says that it is unnecesThe majority is not always right. Certainly in this instance very possibly all those people are wrong, because we in the coalition have that the law can be a moral teacher. Sometimes we do need laws to take a moral and just possibly this is one of those incidents. But, whatever the position on the principle of racial vilification, the fact is that this is a deeply and fundamentally flawed bill forms, just as for four reasons. The first reason is that, unlike the New South Wales legislation, which says that to be a criminal offence the incitement must be to an act of violence against persons or property, not this law makes mere incitement a criminal offence. There does not need to be any inby citement to violence against persons or proby perty. In other words, as Phillip Adams has said, this law turns mere words into a criminal offence punishable by one year's imone prisonment. You can go to gaol for mere The second reason this bill is gravely the inadequate is that, unlike the New South Wales legislation where a civil offence is created only if a person incites hatred-and that is very strong-under this bill all that is necessary to create a civil offence is for to feel offended, insulted or humiliated. In other words, all that is necessary to or create a civil offence under this bill is for someone to have hurt feelings. In this parliament just last week the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) admitted that, if someone stood up and called the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) a septic could very possibly cause a civil promiaction and a judgment could be entered against that person. That is not to say that a people should run around calling American persons or people of American origin in this is - ountry septic tanks, but it is to say that the best argument against bad taste is not to make it illegal. What we need to combat racism is argument, not censorship; we need exposure, The third argument against the bill as currently drafted is that it creates an offence of vicarious liability. The employer of someone guilty under this bill of inciting racial hatred can be liable just because the person who has actually done the deed did it in the course of his or her employment. In other words, when Ron Casey attacked Chinese restaurants on 2KY a few years back, Michael Easson and Graham Richardson, as directors of 2KY, would have been liable for the same offence· of racial vilification. Frankly, that is just not fair. The fourth reason this bill is grossly inadequate is that racism does not have to be the dominant motivation. It simply has to be a substantial motivation. As we know, what constitutes a substantial motivation is entirely in the eye of the beholder. If, for argument's sake, a World War II veteran protesting against a Japanese development somewhere in our country should make the throw-away line, 'Well, you know, the Japs were just as bad during the war and they haven't got any better in all these years,' that relatively harmless throw-away line could result in a civil action for racial vilification. In other words, under this bill we have the prospect of people facing heavy fines or even going to gaol simply for making stupid statements. A person could be fined many thousands of dollars by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission-a non-court - for something that someone else has done but did not really mean. What has this country come to if people can be fined on so flimsy a basis? The real problem with this - legislation is the government's double standards. It had 11 public meetings around the country to gauge the real need for this legislation. It has been reported in the press that at only one of those public meetings was there genuine agreement that the legislation was necessary. Then there are the Prime Minister's double standards. Quite frankly, if the Prime Minister had said of other nationalities what he said about the British, he would very well have been hauled before some of the various tribunals in this country. There is then the difficulty)?f making martyrs of these people. None of us had heard of David Irving until this government denied him a visa. All of a sudden, he· became a martyr to free speech. Let us not make racists martyrs to free speech. The fifth reason that this bill is inadequate is that it is more likely to hit the people whom it is supposed to protect. For instance in the state of New South Wales, some ethnicommunities have used the New South Wales vilification legislation as a weapon against other ethnic communities. An article in the Australian of last week reads: . . . Father Frank Brennan's fear that federal racial hatred laws might be used as a weapon to inflame inter-ethnic rivalries is well founded. Several complaints have been lodged with the NSW AntiDiscrimination Board alleging vilification of Greeks by Macedonians. One involved an article in a newspaper which they say accused the Greek community of terrorist acts. Another was a petition to Parliament said to accuse Greeks of killing and robbing Jews and migrating on the spoils to Australia. The Macedonian cOInmunity has lodged its own complaints against Greeks as a '!defensive measure"", says spokesman Victor Bivell. ""People bec-me quite annoyed· at the complaints lodged against them and (decided) those lodging the complaints were more worthy of being the defendant than them."" In other words, racial vilification legislation can actually make things worse. We in Australia are insulting our migrant people by saying that they 'are not capable of tolerating the same robust standards of debate as the rest of'us can tolerate. That is what this bill says. This. bill says that we have to put our migrant communities in glasshouses, in humidicribs. We cannot touch them because they are not capable of acting in the same way that ordinary Australians act. That is a slander on our migrants and it is something that this government should be ashamed of. Let me conclude by quoting from ex-Senator Peter Walsh, who said: Some people say the Government knows its actions that is, in launching this legislationare indefensible, but proceeds with this type of legislation hoping it will split the Opposition ... I would like to believe the Labor. Party has not sunk that low. But. . . ? I say shame on the Labor Party that it is using the migrant communities in this country as political pawns.",101
176,Mr KATTER,COMMITTEES,"Kennedy) (5.28 p.m.)I probably have stronger feelings about this issue than anyone else in this place and I have a stronger aversion to the proposal than anyone else in this place. I come here as a person of dark complexion. I am from Cloncurry and have had to put up with racial slurs most of my life. Many of those slurs came from the ALP in the Queensland parliament and can be found in the Hansard. Whilst some of those slurs might be regarded as humorous, some of them are a gross reflection upon the people who made them. I also represent probably the only electorate in Australia that has ethnic minority groups as the majority. People who migrated from Italy in the early part of this century, the first Australians, the Irish who are in Mount Isa, and the Yugoslavs and central Europeans who are on the Tablelands would comprise a majority. I have had my back patted by people in all the parts of my electorate that I have visited since I have taken a stand on this issue. The last thing that people from ethnic minority backgrounds want is for people to become more conscious of racial differences. Every time you pass a law in this place that makes people out.there more conscious of racial differences, you drive this country backwards. That has been done most successfully. I think the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who' is sitting in the chamber, would agree with me that things are not as pleasant now as they were when we were young fellows--""-and· he may still be a young man. I recently spoke with two senior people in Mount Isa, One of them is a very good friend of mine. In fact, we were in business together at one stage. Ron Page, who is the head of Aboriginal affairs in the state govern- ling. ment at Mount Isa, and Mona Phillips, were both saying that things are worse now for people of Aboriginal descent than they were 15 years ago. I said, 'Hold on; you have decent jobs.' They said, 'No, there are more important things than that.' There is a big difference between creating jobs for people of Aboriginal descent and having a job as a foreman on the main roads, as Ron Page did. I recently left early to go to the funeral of Charlie Ah Wing, who was one of the pallbearers .at my father's funeral. My father had great admiration for Charlie Ah Wing. He got national publicity at odd times. Charlie was a descendant of one of the first Chinamen to cOine to Australia. They went out to find gold, like my family and so many other families did. They found no gold and were trapped in the middle of nowhere. They were not the sort of people that sat around feeling sorry for themselves. They dug in the riverbed, they found water, they set up winches that used horses to utilise a primitive but very effective form of irrigation and they set up market gardens throughout northern Australia. The Chinese in Far North Queensland built Seven Mile Canal, near Cooktown, which carried water at a very high level and meant they could deliver water through hoses at great pressure and mine for gold. They built that canal by hand, and there were not that many of them. These people were truly remarkable. Charlie Ah Wing's mother was of Aboriginal descent and his father was a Chinese market gardener who also helped on the stations in the Camooweal area. Charlie went to work at Mount !sa Mines. When I worked at Mount Isa Mines Charlie Ah Wing was my foreman. I regret to say that there are not a lot of foremen in the main roads department like Ron Page or at Mount Isa Mines like Charlie Ah Wing. Unfortunately, the laws that have been passed that emphasise the differences between races have had very great subtle and tragic effects out there. Those great achievers were moving up through the ranks and doing wonderful things. That is not the direction in which their children are travelWhen Charlie Ah Wing left Mount Isa Mines he set up his own, mining operation. If a company attempted to do what he did it would probably have to look at raising about $11 million on the stock market. He sunk all of his superannuation into the operation. Like so many copper gougers-and I was a copper gouger just before Charlie Ah Wing-he did not end up making his fortune. But, undoubtedly, at some future date a mining company will make a packet out of the ore body that he opened up. In his latter years, he set· up· an alcohol rehabilitation centre in Mount !sa. That was one of the few such projects in Australia that was successful. Charlie was a superachiever. He is not with us now but there is not the slightest fraction of a doubt in my mind about what his verdict on this legislation would have been. Maybe he was a superachiever. and expected other people to be superachievers. He believed that when we give people the image of themselves as losers who need special assistance and special protection we break the thing in those people that makes them capable of achieving great things, as he did in his lifetime. His lifetime was a flashing neon light and advertisement for that point of view. In my homeland I saw w-th yery great pride what was achieved not only by people like Charlie Ah Wing but also by people in the community who were courageous enough to act against the brutality that· existed. The founder of my home town of Cloncurry, Ernest Henry, fought tenaciously to protect the Kalkadoon people, who were waging fairly effective warfare upon the white population in the area. He adopted a very courageous attitude in defending and protecting the people of Aboriginal descent in the area. The first thing my father did when we bought the picture theatre in Cloncurry was to take out the steel rails which separated the black area of the picture theatre from the white area. That was in the early 1960s, and was regarded as a very courageous move. It was noted in all of the valedictories to my father in the western areas of our electorate. People like Dr David Harvey Sutton also took courageous stands against some of the excesses of some of the people in those areas. If we are going to emphasise differences and create laws that emphasise differences then we must look at them carefully. In North Queensland, and certainly in my electorate, we have a very large population !rom the former Yugoslavia. I was recently WIth one of my good friends in Mount !sa who owns a late night takeaway and is a successful businessmen. Alex, who is of Moslem descent, said to me, 'What is happening over there is really dreadful.' There are Serbians and Croats in North Queensland, ·and to start emphasising racial differences and handing them this .sort of bludgeoning machinery is very dangerous. To hand this sort of machinery to people from southern Ireland and Northern Ireland who live in Mount Isa, to people on the coast from northern Italy and southern Italy-it is nowhere near as bad there-and to people from the Aboriginal communities on the peninsula at places like Edward River where they put the Anglican Church between the Mookens on one side of town and the Tyoris on the other side of town, would create problems. Most unfortunate incidents have occurred at Edward River as a result of the extreme racial differences between the two tribes that live in that community which is now called Poomperau. I will refer to one of my first experiences in Aboriginal affairs. We never knew about 'Aboriginal affairs' because that was not part of our lexicon in the west. We were brought up to mix with whoever was at the school and we played football with whoever was there to play. We were not conscious of the differences. I was asked to go to a conference that was held in Charter Towers because I was the local state member of parliament. The brilliant Catholic priest·there, Father Lancini, absolutely insisted tha(I attend this conference, I was very angry when they started an 'All Blacks' football team in Cloncurry. I say with some degree of pride that I played A-grade football in Brisbane. I played for the black team; because I was considered to be white that beggared up the all black idea. They could not look a gift-horse in the mouth and knock back an A-grade footballer. In Cloncurry's history of four teams we never fielded an all white team and never fielded an all black team. That was a statement in itself. I went along to this conference and said what I believed. I had a young lady from Redfern spit at me and tell me that I represented everything that she detested. Four Catholic nuns and one priest came up and actually cried. They said, 'We !ire so ashamed to be of the same faith as you.' I was feeling very embarrassed and self-conscious at this stage. After these people had finished crying and weeping, Clarrie Grogan, a very prominent person in black affairs and a man of Aboriginal descent, came up to me and said, 'What are you doing, mate? Can we go for a beer.' I went with him and he brought about 10 of his mates. We sat talking about old times for the next two or three hours. I noticed that all these bleeding hearts sitting by themselves. They had nothing to talk to these black people about. They had no common ground. They had no real interests. They sat by themselves in a comer. These people could feel sorry for black people and cry for them; they loved black people because they believed that black people needed someone to look after them. I remember vividly the advice offered to me by Eric Law, who was the brilliant deputy head of the department of Aboriginal affairs when I was minister in Queensland. Eric Law was appointed by the Labor government as head of QATSIC. He is a very prominent and successful man in every respect. He is now the director of the ACC in North Queensland. He said, 'The first piece of advice I want to give you is that these bleeding hearts club people love me.' Eric Law is a person who believes strongly that people should stand up on their own two feet. I said, 'I very much doubt that they love you, Eric. In fact, I don't think they'd like you at all.' He said, 'No, they love me, but they love me on my knees because if ever I stand upright I do not need them.' I completed the sentence-I said, 'They won't have a job.' He said, 'No, you do not understand. If you say that they won't have a job, you don't understand. It is far deeper than that. They'd lose their identity. Their identity comes from the fact that they are looking after the poor. That is how they see themselves in life. If you take the poor away from them and make the poor rich and have them standing on their own feet, you destroy their very identity. So it reaches far more deeply than you think.' I will conclude that aspect of the matter. We set up self-management in Queensland. All of what were the Aboriginal reserves became self-governing local government communities, with powers that I suppose were far more extensive than those of local government. It was called self-management, and it is one of the things for which I still enjoy accolades today, and so does Eric Law-one of the architects of that particular happening in Queensland. We were very pleased when the Pope was out here that Father Frank Brennan proposed in the Pope's speech that were what had been done in Queensland be done in the rest of the Australia. When we launched into that program, a very famous person called Greg Wallace became the first town clerk of Aboriginal descent of the Aboriginal community of Weipa South. Eric Law trained him up and sent him out there. He started to get people of Aboriginal descent to work for the dole. This was revolutionary stuff. Then 60 Minutes did a whole segment on him. The 60 Minutes program received an avalanche of pro-mail from people who were so excited and so thrilled at what this young bloke had achieved. It was the only time in the history of 60 Minutes that it did a second segment. This was one of the famous happenings of that period. I wanted to stay right away from what had happened. It had nothing to do with me. Lawsy had done it; the black people had done it. There was no credit due to me whatsoever. I went there three months later. Greg Wallace picked me up at the airport. I asked him how things were going. He mumbled to me-grumble mumble. I said to him that obviously things were not going too well. I said, 'Let me tell you what has happened here. The federal government has sent in a development officer. The development officer has slowly undermined your position, and he is continuing to undermine your position.' He said, 'How did you know that?' I said, 'Because they're doing it everywhere. lam getting the story back everywhere.' I remember another very famous figure in Aboriginal affairs in North Queensland, Robbie Demal, coming into Eric Law's house when I was over there one Sunday afternoon. He said, 'Dh, Lawsy-the great saviour of his people. Self-management: we run our own affairs, terrific. Self-management: quick, quick, quick, where is the white bloke to come in and run everything for us?' Whilst Demal was saying things that were humorous, I did not really think they were humorous at all, because that was what was happening. What was happening was coming from this place. It was the policy of this chamber and this government. The story of Greg Wallace is a very sad story. A fellow, Darvel Long-I want to mention his name, because he is still there is, of course, a white bloke. He would go along to the chairman and say, 'There have been a few mistakes here. I think I'd better handle this. You might get into trouble here.' He slowly undermined the confidence of the council in Greg Wallace. For the first time in four months, Greg took a weekend off to go and have a break. He was pretty disgusted with what was going on. When he came back, Darvel Long had changed the entire code on the computer, so he could no longer access the computer. He rolled his swag and left. It is a story that cuts at the very heart of thinking that has come from Canberra and that has been such a disastrous failure. We are now spending $2,000 million a year on Aboriginal affairs in Australia. Every family is entitled to $55,000 over and above what they are entitled to as Australians. Where has it got us? Ron Page, one of the leading people - now a great success story-is saying 'We are worse off now than we were 15 years ago.' Fifteen years ago they were getting virtually no money at all. People like me-coming from that sort of background-have an automatic reaction to this sort of legislation. The last thing in the world we want is to make people conscious of the differences. It is important that we do not see the differences. Every time we pass legislation or make administrative fiat that emphasises the differences, we are back in this situation. Let me change subjects. I was horrified to hear of the burning of synagogues in Australia. This is really terrible stuff-e,en worse, in the bigger scheme of things, than the tragic death of John Newman. As the honourable member for Herbert will agree, we have problerns of violence in North Queensland that we have never seen before. On-rushing poverty breeds racism. Turning back to the Jews, if ever a group of people has been persecuted throughout the ages, it is people of Jewish descent. Sometimes the Christians say, 'They killed Jesus.' That has to be the quintessential stupid argument. The good Lord was a Jew himself, and all of the founders of Christianity were Jews, so that has to be the most stupid argument. If we look at the last two centuries, we see that there is a reason for what happened. The church banned usury. The Christian church then prevented any Christians from participating in banking. The only people in Europe that were allowed to bank were people of the Jewish faith. So all banking was controlled by the Jews. We had people like the Rothschilds. If you were to read a book on them, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would find a picture of a really terrible family. These people were really dreadful people. There is no doubt that the they sewed the terrible seeds that were reaped years later in the pogroms and in all of the terrible things that happened in Europe in the following 200 years to people of Jewish descent. To blame people of Jewish descent for the actions of a single family or for the actions of half a dozen of these super rich oppressive banking families must be the height of stupidity. ;f"" A lot of people here have condemned Israel-people from the right, people from the left. So it is all right to start condemning a little tiny country of 3 1/2 million people surrounded by 200 or 300 million people who are dedicated and committed to the utter destruction of each and every one of them! There is no doubt that they in part took their land off someone else; they were pushed. Every single race on earth, at some time or another, has been pushed from somewhere. The Teutonic Knights virtually created the German race, and they were pushed. We are here-almost everyone in Australia todaybecause we were pushed. To pass judgment on people in that situation and to apply the same rules to them as those which are applied to other countries is simply not on. In fairness to people of Jewish descent, IQ tests indicate again and again that the people from Levant have superior IQs. I suppose that that in itself is a racist remark. But people like the Kamslers and the JoeIs-'-no-one could measure their achievements. (Time expired)",104
177,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"I am very pleased to join this debate on the Racial Hatred Bill as a member of the coalition. I strongly reject the legislation. Racial vilification laws are aimed at suppressing outward manifestations of racism, but unfortunately they have proven to be a bandaid solution, covering but not curing. It has been suggested that these laws are an easy way to fight racism but, like most easy solutions, it will be an ineffective way. These laws will not eliminate racism but may possibly suppress its expression. Racism will still exist, but it will be silent. David Allen from the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties said: Where it exists it will not disappear. because we think it too ugly to be expressed in public, continue to fester and corrode but be disseminated anonymously. Perhaps those less committed to combating racism and more interested in a populist, quick-fix solution will find this cosmetic legislation attractive-out of sight, out of mind. But how are those who are truly committed to the fight against. racism going to continue that fight when racism becomes underground and unidentifiable? While racists are free to express their ideas, they can be identified and challenged. They can be shown to others for the irrationality they represent. Surely, as members of this place, we would acknowledge that laws are completely ineffective in changing the way people think. Racial vilification legislation, such as the bill we are debating, will do no more than hinder long-term solutions to people's racism. The ALP is absolutely hypocritical on this issue. We should remember that only a few short years ago racist views now considered outrageous were actively supported by the ALP and other organisations. The ALP was a strident supporter of the White Australia policy, and many trade unions dabbled with anti-Semitism. Last century the Bulletin openly argued that a Jewish bankers' conspiracy existed. It is clear today that these arguments have been consigned, as they should be, to the dustbins of history, and great progress has been made. The racial vilification legislation is a legislative attempt to further their demise. It will not do this; rather it will give racists a mainstream platform and will make them martyrs in the eyes of many. When a vilifying comment is made, it will be reported widely because of the potential·legal consequences. When someone is charged, that will be reported. When someone is convicted, that will be reported. Racists will gain more coverage then they could ever hope for. Freedom of speech is a profoundly important policy in this nation and arguably a vital ingredient in our democracy. Our freedom of speech enables us to promote change. The reason racist views are today on the outer is not through a stirring of consciousness, as it will promoted by legislation such as the Racial Hatred Bill, but because individuals have made a convincing argument for change through the forum of free speech. Freedom of speech is essential even when we do not like the message. The following quotation has been attributed to Voltaire: I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. Adlai Stevenson, writing in the New York Times in 1962, also hit the nail on the head when he said: The first principle of a free society is an untrammelled flow of words in an open forum. Over 40 years earlier, Theodore Roosevelt agreed when he said: Free speech, exercised both individually and through a free press, is a necessity in any country where people are themselves free. The introduction of racial vilification legisla. tion by this government is a lazy option. By attempting to silence our opponents, we question our own commitment to the cause and acknowledge the strength of our opponent's position. Instead of having faith in our own ideas and our ability to express them, what we are doing is enlisting the state to determine what is right and wrong-not just to reflect but to shape our moral values. We need to have faith in the strength of our arguments and a personal commitment to further them. There can be no effective substitute. We should all be concerned with a state which seeks to regulate opinions and which declares the truth and then seeks to suppress any deviation. A look overseas will show that racist groups are strong where they have become 'victims' of the state. Banning only ever seems to increase the popularity of an illicit activity. Again, as I said earlier, it turns people into martyrs. Freedom of speech and the vitality that it produces in our society is the mechanism that we must use to eliminate racism. Tampering with this elementary right can only bode ill. The government has been rejected by newspaper editorials throughout the nation. The Herald-Sun stated: The new Racial Hatred Bill approved by federal cabinet yesterday may destroy freedom of speech and is a misguided bid to eliminate racial intolerance. . The editorial in the Adelaide Advertiser stated, referring to the need to examine, the bill carefully: · .. there are two principal grounds for such critical examination. The first and most obvious is what impact it may have on the principle of free speech · . . Second. is the extent to which it is necessary at all. The editorial went on to point out quite accurately: Australia has been transformed into a remarkably tolerant. multicultural. multiracial society without this legislation. There are already laws banning racial discrimination. The Sydney Morning Herald stated: · .. because the legislation seems to favour groups rather than the community as a whole. it may in fact run counter to the interests of a tolerant society. The Brisbane Courier-Mail stated: The argument in favour of the Racial Vilification Act is very unconvincing. That is what members on this sfde of the House are saying. The Canberra Times also points out that the opposition should oppose 1 the legislation, and that is exactly what we are doing. Perhaps the greatest flash point for racism in our society at present is conflict among various ethnic groups. Australians have shown a great deal of understanding at a time when our society has been dramatically changed by high immigration levels. The only real condition popularly desired by Australians has been that the conflicts of the old world should be left behind, understandably remembered but not rekindled. Racial vilification legislation presents itself as yet another flashpoint to rekindle such conflict. These laws could well be used by one group against another as another weapon in an ongoing conflict. The greatest concern is that it will be the larger, better resourced and more politically powerful groups that are the victors in any legal dispute. Given the historic antipathy in the Balkans and in many other parts of the world, including Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, the Indian sub' continent, Africa and Tibet, there is incredible capacity for great social discord in this nation. Interestingly enough, a good half of the ethnic communities is totally opposed to the government's Racial Hatred Bill. They do not see that this sort of legislation is necessary in a free and democratic society. We ought to recall that many people from these ethnic communities left their homelands to come to this nation so that-they could have the freedom of speech and tolerance that we have always displayed in Australia. It should be noted that the coalition is on very sound ground in opposing the Racial Hatred Bill. We have found that some people who normally have not been public supporters of ours are coming out and saying that the Racial Hatred Bill is a gross invasion of the right of free speech. I cite an example of a well-known Jesuit, Father Frank Brennan, who suggested that the Mabo debate in this country could not have taken place if the Racial Hatred Bill were law. The civil liberties lawyer in Queensland, Terry O'Gorman, is opposed· to it, as is Phillip Adams. Ian Macphee, a former Liberal member of this place, has said that he remains to be convinced that racial vilification legislation is necessary. There is a very real danger that our legal system, adversarial as it is, will be called upon to judge who is right and who is wrong with regard to a matter that should be completely alien to our society. The message sent by any decision will not be that of the judge but the message of the victor, seemingly endorsed by the law. Surely our laws should promote hannony among Australia's ethnic groups rather than institutionalising conflict. The law in Australia already outlaws most matters covered by this bill. We must therefore examine whether it is appropriate in Australia in 1994 to outlaw offence. Any perusal of the law will show that most serious manifestations of racism-I cite the examples of damaging shrines, threatening language, indecent language, incitement to violence,et cetera-are already against the law. These laws protect the physical well-being of the person and property as well as reputation. Racial vilification laws aim to protect people from being offended by racism. The question is: does the hann of offence, and nothing more, justify the curtailment of other rights and is it fair? There is no doubt that many 'people are seriously affected by being offended. Many people in our society take offence easily, and many are susceptible to suffer from it. However, people take offence at a variety of things, racism being only one.·I- it right that somehow offence caused by racism is worse than other offensive behaviour? ,Are we justified in treating such offence as being more serious tha- derogatory beliefs 'concerning women, a persOIl's physical attribu,tes, someone's mental capaei-y or secular beliefs? Should merely insulting someone be actionable? I certainly say no .. The coalition believes that it is very importgimes. ant to have an active and adequate education program to make sure that racism in Australia is shown up for what it is. I was very pleased to hear that $10 million will be spent over two years on an education program. We believe in education rather than compulsion. Over the last 20 or 30 years, Australia has become a very tolerant soCiety and, in this respect, we are the envy of countries throughout the world. With education, programs can be devised which have a real effect in eliminating racism. I cite community announcements, school packages and workplace information as some areas which could be looked at. This bill is absolutely deficient. It is more about politics than policy. The government very cleverly thought that it could divide the opposition on this bill. I have a message for the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch):. the coalition is 100 per cent opposed to the Racial Hatred Bill. The Attorney-General has totally failed in his attempts to divide us on this issue. The government stands condemned because it has sought to create confrontation among different sections of Australiari society. On our side, we have widely consulted with ethnic communities, and half the ethnic community is opposed to this legislation. Unfortunately, the government is seeking to use the external affairs power, yet again, to legislate in areas that have traditionally been the responsibility of the states. It is appalling that people in Australia"" if this legislation is passed and becomes law, will be able to be gaoled for what they say, as opposed to what they do. The thought police are to be set loose. This government will be setting up a type of offence which will see political prisoners created in Australia. I think that is absolutely disgusting and it should be rejected by any reasonable person. In conclusion, the Liberal Party and the National· Party are totally opposed to racism in all forms. Our colleagues in earlier speeches have indicated, our excellent record in this area during' the time this country has been a nation. This is bad legislation. It is not needed. The legislation is reminiscent of what we would normally expect in totalitarian reThe infringement of a .very basic right - the right to free speech in a democracy-in one of the most tolerant countries in the world is something we cannot accept, is something we oppose and is something we condemn the government for. I am hopeful that, if the government looks at the enormous range of opinion throughout Australia against what it is doing, sooner or later it will get the message. This legislation is unnecessary. It is opposed by the coalition and many ethnic communities. It is not supported by civil libertarians or fair-minded Australians opposed to racism. The government stands condemned.",108
178,Mr CLEARY,COMMITTEES,"The propaganda accompanying the introduction of the Racial Hatred Bill would have us believe that this is an act designed to eliminate the practice of racial hatred and the practice of inciting people to racial hatred. According to the script, those who oppose or are critical of the Racial Hatred Bill either lack a commitment to multicultural Australia or fail to acknowledge that this is a bill essentially directed at racism on the extremities. The latter argument has prompted critics to argue why, if, as the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) claims, the legislation is hardly likely to effect the status quo, the government has actually bothered to draft such legislation. Those in the ALP who argue that opposition to the bill is opposition to multiculturalism might be surprised to know that groups such as the Australian Arabic Council have expressed their unequivocal opposition to the legislation. Unlike those who oppose the bill on the grounds that it stifles free speech, the Australian Arabic Council focuses on the complex relationship between racism, everyday life and those institutions and people who fashion dominant ideas. Free speech, of course, no matter what civil liberties groups and the High Court say, is a fantasy in an Australia where the production of ideas is in the hands of a privileged few. All the High Court did in the political advertising case was enshrine the rights of the economically powerful to bludgeon the rest with their particular perspective on politics. It did nothing to increase the power of those less economically powerful to engage in the kind of debate that would truly amount to free speech. Nothing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) says about superhighways and CD-ROM suggests that he understands the role economic, soQfal and political factors play in fashioning free speech and culture. It is not about how many pay TV stations are available to the consumer; it is l about who owns and controls what those stations produce which determines whether free speech exists and culture flourishes. Some members on this side of the House or the opposition side really need to think about exactly what they mean by free speech. The Australian Arabic Council argues that the dependence of its community on federal government resources has had the effect of making its criticism of the legislation far more circumspect. Notwithstanding this political consideration, members of the Australian Arabic Council have expressed their disappointment at the lack of opportunity made available to them to engage in a debate about what racial hatred means and how it should be countered. The Australian Arabic Council had this to say: The Council welcomes measures aimed at reducing the incidence of racism' in Australia, so long as they address the causes (ignorance) and not just the symptoms. Hence we have always advocated for multi-pronged and hard-hitting educational strategies which can affect socio-cultural change in attitudes and behaviours. Legislation should be introduced as a reinforcement measure of these, and not the other way around. With the limited resources available, we believe they are better invested in education than on litigation and lawyers' fees. So why did the government not heed the wishes of the Australian Arabic Council and look seriously at the context in which racism occurs and the }lleans by which racist myths might be challenged? Does the government have a political aversion to engaging in a serious critique of the way racism is used to defend the economically powerful against the less powerful? Why have the government and members of this House not had more to say about the manner in which some of our most treasured institutions, including our monopolistic overseas controlled media, have manipulated ,racist stereotyping in the interestS of sensationalism. and - arket advantage? Was it more palatable, for the government to run the line that it is neo-Nazi skinheads with swastikas on their heads, rather than the respectable, who engage in the practice of racial vilification? As we. all know, it is a lot easier to put,the wind up a few skinheads than to bring Murdoch or Black into line or subject them to the kind of competition that members of the Labor Party argue all public enterprises should endure. Unfortunately, as Conrad Black indicated in his skirmish with the government in what should have been a salutary message to members of this House, media barons are much more powerful than elected politicians. So who is going to control Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch? Not this legislation, it seems. A proud anti-communist and defender of free speech, Robert Manne, in the Age this morning put it this way: His Billthe Attorney-General's billtells us of certain exceptions. While it would be unlawful for Joe Citizen to offend or insult racial or ethnic groups it will remain lawful for someone who's regarded as a scientist or an artist to Being a conservative, it did not serve Robert Manne's purposes to point the finger at the real source of the problem-the unequal distribution of power and influence within our class based society. Roland Jabbour,Chair of the Australian Arabic Council, in a letter to the Age on 2 June 1994 took Robert Manne's proposition a step closer to the core of the matter when he said: The same mediums (such as the media) that are instrumental in promoting racist stereotypes should be persuaded to address their ignorance about many Australian groups. I wonder if anyone at the Age thought of asking Roland Jabbour to write a column in its opinion analysis page. The Australian Arabic Council continued with the argument that unequal access to free speech and influence was the real problem when it noted that: ... a handful of well-resourced individuals have dominated the ethnic platform and it is these same resourceful groups who have benefited from widespread access to the media and are the very groups who will benefit from legislation for the same reason. Criticism of the government's approach from the Australian Arabic Council should force those oil the Labor side who have chosen to score a political point at the expense of an equivocating coalition to reassess their position and acknowledge the deficiencies of a fundamentally legalistic approach to combating racism. Notwithstanding the Australian Arabic Council's arguments,it is an unfortunate .fact that the coalition is gripped by political ineptitude and does not have the will to jettison those antiquated ideas· which at present make the party so unpalatable to the Australian community. . Rather than expose the philosophical shortcomings of the legislation and the bill's inability to confront the real and varied sources and uses of racism, the coalition, with a couple of exceptions, chose to hide behind the banner of free speech and focus on the alleged mechanical deficiencies and complexities of the bill. So, when it has the opportunity of looking and sounding progressive, the coalition decides to plant the stamp of reactionary politics on its forehead. Instead of arguing for a stronger and more courageous do so. approach to combating racism, the coalition chooses to do nothing. Everyone knows that the Racial Hatred Bill is as much about marginalising the coalition as it is about combating racism. So why did the coalition not grasp the nettle and gamer the support of those ethnic groups who were dissatisfied with and cynical about the legislation? History tells us it is materialistic factors, work and the social interaction it brings and changed economic and social circumstances, not middle-class legislators, which bring about the erosion and dissipation of racism. When Australia rode gung-ho into the Gulf War on the tails of the Americans-much to the delight of our present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), so he bravely tells us after the event-there was a distinct dearth of antiracial vilifiers out there in the northern suburbs of Melbourne sticking up for the local Middle Eastern population. Despite requests and pleas that Labor ministers and heads of government bodies address the victimisation exactly of the Arabic community, which was occurring and being inflamed by the media, a solution was lost on those legalistic minds who believed that the law offered all the protection a local Arab needed. Writing in the Bulletin. on 25 September 1990, former federal minister Barry Cohen said: There seems to have been a media competition to see who can win the prize for being the most offensive to those of Arab descent. I'm appalled at the lack of sensitivity of some Australian journalists.. What we have witnessed in recent days has been a mixture of arrogance, ignorance and outright racism. One waits expectantly for the more unctuous sections of the media to doshock/horror studies of attacks on the Arab community which they, more than anyone else, have helped to promote. On 6 September 1990 the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) issued a press release saying of anyone who supported Saddam Hussein: . . . their best place of residence is not Australia. That was a very honourable stand to be taken by the member, I must say, given the racial tensions which existed at the time. This is the same bloke who said of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill: It strikes at the root of the real freedoms that we accept. Being an Arab, it appears,.do-s not qualify you for too many rights, according to the honourable member. In the same speech he said: Would we like the human rights conditions of Egypt, where people are persecuted and killed for religious belief? So much for the member for Mitchell calling others bigots. Could it be the honourable member has watched too much CNN or Arnie Schwarzenegger? It took former Prime Minister and member for Wills Bob Hawke five months to find his way clear to make a statement about the discrimination that was occurring in the wake of the Gulf War. Joe Wakim, at that time spokesperson for the Committee on Discrimination Against Arab Australians-now the Australian Arabic Council-was quick to acknowledge that the strong public statement issued by Bob Hawke when he was Prime Minister had the desired effect. The problem was, according to Mr Wakim, it was a constipated statement. Mr Wakim was far from happy about various other organisations that failed to grasp the level of racism, subliminal and overt, in CNN's and the Australian media's cSlverage of the Gulf war. There were statements such as, 'Australia may be a. target of the large force of terrorists assembled by Saddam l Hussein', by Colin Rubenstein, Melbourne Herald, August 1990. There was the statement, 'It's about time the Arab community started. treating Australia like their country', by B.ruce Ruxton, Herald-Sun, October 1990. There was the statement, 'Sydney Moslems may pass around the hat for Hussein', in the Daily Telegraph, August 1990. There was the statement, 'The Middle East game-why we don't understand their rules', in the Bulletin, January 1991. There was the statement, 'Fears of a fifth column-the prospect of war in the Gulf and Australia's military participation there has dramatically increased the threat of terrorism at home', by Norm Lipson, Bulletin, January 1991. All of these would certainly have offended, insulted, humiliated and. intimidated Arabic people in Australia. Under section 180 of the bill, such statements will continue to be exempt from civil action. Whether they qualify as likely to incite racial hatred and thereby criminal action remains to be seen-but I doubt it. It is instructive that one of the anti-Arab Gulf War protagonists, Colin Rubenstein, was quoted by the member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) today-and it was quite a reasonable speech from the member for Reid-as giving his wholehearted support for the legislation. It seems that in 1990, when he suggested we would be the hunting ground for Saddam Hussein's terrorists, Mr Rubenstein may not have been thinking too rationally. In fact, his article carried a sarcastic reference to the same Yasser Arafat who, in recent times, has been embraced by the Israeli government. The racial and religious vilification inherent in the media's gluttonous· approach to the Gulf War, including statements such as those by Rubenstein, make the film Lawrence of Arabia look like a tribute to Islam. What was needed was for the government to take a stand against those who created those images which served the purpose of the US war machine and US hegemony. The irony in all of this. is that the very people who have the power to construct the kind of racially discriminatory images the Australian Arabic Council find so humiliating will be exempt from civil action under section 180 of the legislation. As we all know, genuine academic discussion, artistic works and reporting on matters of public interest which includes the kind of distorted pro-US propaganda disseminated by CNN will continue with impunity, no matter how much they insult or humiliate selected racial groups. Accordingly, people such as Professor Charles Price, a consultant on migration, will be able to trot out drivel of this kind. The following is taken from a magazine, People and Place, published by the Monash University Australian Forum of Population Studies: The Arabs like to concentrate, marry within· their own group, they have a religion which is very different from the religions of other Australians. is not the type of religion that encourages inter marriage. Can you believe that? It makes you wonder how the bloke actually became a professor. The fact that the majority of our first probably second and third generation migrants throughout our 200 years of white history have tended to marry within their own culturorganisations al and religious grouping is lost on this bloke. So too is the fact that a high proportion of migrants from the Middle East, in particular in the Lebanese community, are Christian. As for the claim that Arabs have a religion that does not encourage intermarriage, has professor ever studied the rules and customs of Catholicism? The old Pope is not exactly a libertine on the issues of Catholic morality; and it was not so long ago that a Catholic marrying a Protestant was virtually not only would run. ex-communicated but ruled out of the family will. Professor Price's stereotyping is the that produces a fertile ground for racial vilification-but it will be exempt. What we really need are rules or a means by which to stop the likes of Professor Price producing ignorant and humiliating statements of this kind. So much for your free speechby maybe it is education. You might even argue that a decent newspaper should not run them. Professor Price's pearls pale into insignifibetween cance when Arnie Schwarzenegger wacks the liniment on, grabs the Arrnalite in the and takes on the rich, ugly terrorist Arab the film True Lies. Professor Jack Shaheen from the Southern Illinios University said the film would: Probably stand the test of time as one of the most racist movies Hollywood has ever produced. Director James Cameron was not phased and said: I just needed some convenient villains. It could have been anyone ... The Australian Arabic Council had this to say about the film in the context of the Racial Hatred Bill: Australia's Federal government needs to consider this movie in light of the Racial Hatred Bill. There is no denying that such movies through the popular media reinforce racist stereotypes, both on overt and subliminal levels. The real consequences on It vilified groups in terms of employment discrimination, religious persecution, and hate crimes has been well documented in Australia and elsewhere and should not be underestimated. The problem is, as we in this House all know, 20th Century Fox is-and the baby of the and Minister for Communications and the Arts, Hollywood on the Harbour, will be-a bit more powerful than the average punter. If of this kind choose to construct images or produce subliminal messages which denigrate or vilify on the basis of race, there is nothing anyone can do. That is what is wrong with this legislation. Arnie Schwarzenegger's film and CNN will not qualify, no our matter how many Muslims are abused, as acts inciting racial hatred. Racist, imperialistic and subservient to vested interests these works of art might be; but designed to incite racial hatred they are not, so the legal argument In the explanatory memorandum it is said kind that the bill closes a gap in the legal protection available to the victims of extreme racist behaviour. Unfortunately, the memorandum seems to assume the extreme racist behaviour is only found in the jackboot and that the propaganda produced, for example, Goebbels in the 1930s to accompany the jackboot was of secondary significance. Retrospectively, we know what the connection the propaganda and the incitement to racial hatred and racial violence was in claw Germany in the 1930s. But who saw the in connection at the time? Certainly not Bob Menzies or the royal family. Robert Manne says: In the rise of popular anti-Semitism under the Nazis the artistry of the film Jew Suss played a not insignificant role. Goebbels, of course, would have told us that his was a work of art or a scientific. study done in good faith-a bit like Professor Price from Monash University, I suppose. Given the lack of and tardiness of official objection to the racial discrimination and subliminal racial hatred contained in the media's handling of the Gulf war, one could comfortably arrive at the conclusion that. drawing a connection between an act of racial violence and the source of racial hatred is not easily established. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) touched on this problem in his speech last night when he listed a series of incidents and attacks on Melbourne's Arabic community during - the. Gulf war. What the honourable member for Melbourne did not acknowledge was that the very person who supplied this information, Joe Wakim, has expressed his opposition to the legislation. With all due respect to the member for Melbourne, I think he should have at least examined the Australian Arabic Council's opposition to the legislation. Among other things, Mr Wakim argues that the issue has been approached the wrong way around by looking at legislative responses before fully debating or understanding. the causes of racism. The problem with this bill is that it says nothing about the real causes of racism and fails to acknowledge the role economic and social inequality plays in denying particular ethnic groups the capacity to counter racial humiliation. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) towards the end of his speech last night quoted a line 'There is no greater injustice than treating unequals equally' from the American jurist Mr Justice Frankfurter in defence of the legislation. I would argue, in fact, that the bill makes the mistake of treating unequals equally. I am sure that the member for Melbourne Ports, a la-er himself, would agree that social class and influence are important factors in determining one's access to the law-and the name John l Elliott springs to mind immediately. This is exactly what Joe Wakim and the Australian Arabic Council meant when they said: Most advocates for the law were prominent members of well established ethnic communities such as the Italian, Chinese and Jewish communities who had the literacy and education to take advantage of the law. Class questions are important. I would have thought people on the Labor side would understand that. The claim that everyone is equal before the law or that this legislation enshrines free speech is pure fantasy. The bill enshrines .free speech by the powerful, in what the American philosopher Herbert Marcuse would have described as an act of repressive tolerance. What it does not outlaw, rather than what it does, is the real problem. Because of exemption 18D, it turns a blind eye to those with the greatest capacity to marginalise people according to their ethnic or political persuasion. It is instructive that throughout the debate very few members have drawn on theexperiences of people during the Gulf War. Robert Manne talks of the rise of a peculiar mood of progressivist intolerance, as if the radicals are stealing the march on conservatives and instituting their own brand of political correctness. Manne likes it both ways. Political correctness, as Robert Manne knows but never admits, has always been the preside of the economJcally and socially powerful. After all, it w- Robert Menzies, not the ALP, and conservative forces in America, not radicals, that attempted to institute political correctness in the 1950s. The truth is there is nothing particularly radical about the bill. Robert Manne should not worry. He and his conservative mates, whether in academia or the media, are pretty safe. It is the ordinary punter who has something to worry about.",111
179,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"Fairfax) (6.21 p.m.)I will be fairly brief in speaking to the Racial Hatred Bill. It has been covered by members on both sides and has been covered virtually clause by clause. I rise today because I think I am. the only person on this side of the House who is of non-Anglo-Saxon birth. I was born in Hungary, in eastern Europe. My parents came 10 this country as refugees after the Second World War in 1949. I grew up as a migrant in the 1950s and 1960s in the Hawkesbury district of New South Wales, which is now part of the western suburbs. It was .a tough life. It was very different. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) raised an interesting point. He said that ethnic communities oppose this bill because it draws attention to the differences when they are trying desperately to assimilate into this community. That struck a chord with me. We were migrant children. We were out in the bush. We did not have contact with anybody. When we turned up to school on the first day we could not speak the language, but within a week we could. It was very important to us to minimise the differences. The fact was that we were different. We spoke a different language. We dressed differently. We held different beliefs. But one thing that I learnt from my parents was the value of freedom. My parents were raised in a country in which they were no strangers to oppression, no strangers to censorship, and freedom of speech was not enjoyed. It was not a right. Freedom of speech was exercised in whispers, not in a loud voice. That was a background against which I started my early life and we started to learn to become Australians. I could see my father learning to become an Australian. I do not think he ever went a day without working. My father held two jobs for many years while he educated his family and gave us a very good start in a magnificent country. The family got used to this freedom. It does not happen overnight. It takes time to realise that this is something new. I remember when I was living in Canberra-I was at the Australian National University studying political science-my father came down from Sydney and came to my home. He was absolutely shocked that I had on my bookshelf Kafl Marx's Das Kapital and the Communist Manifesto. I was studying international politics-communism, fascism, democracy-and there were these textbooks on my shelf. My father, as a young man in eastern Europe, grew up at a time when communism was in its embryonic stages. The reaction was that any documents, any books, were censored. I was 24 or 25 years of age and that was the first time my father had ever set eyes on two books which were fundamental to communism, the form of government that existed in the country and the very thing that he fled from. He never read the book. He did not want to read it. This is the sort of background against which I learnt the value of freedoms. I know that it takes time to appreciate these freedoms. The greatest freedom of all is the freedom of speech. That is why I oppose this bill. My colleagues have spelt out to the House why the legislation is flawed. But there are adequate provisions in state law that can cover these things. I cannot find one commentator in the media who supports this bill. I will refer to a few commentators. Kavanagh writes for the Courier-Mail. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) would know that Kavanagh is very widely read in Queensland. I do not always agree with him but I value his opinion. Kavanagh says: You cannot legislate against hatred. You can pass laws commanding people to accept something they might find abhorrent in their twisted hearts but you cannot make them practise what you preach. You could try to fight prejudice and bigotry through education but that has been given a good work-out over the years and has not succeeded. Despite centuries of efforts by many dedicated people, we still are killing each other in every corner of the globe, probably at a greater rate than the dark ages thanks to commendable progress and weapons of mass destruction. Further on he says: So about the only thing the Attorney-General, ' Michael Lavarch, will achieve with his Racial Hatred Bill will be to win a few bleeding heart votes and maybe stifle a little free speech. Most Australian states already have adequate laws to punish the racial bigots so why the duplication? As a colleague pointed out this week, isn't it amazing that at a time when the former Soviet Union is abolishing its restrictions on free speech this federal government is about to further restrict ours? Under the heading 'Bad Law', the Courier Mail states: There might be more value for the Oppositiontelling us our businessand there would certainly be a bigger benefit for the country-if the federal coalition simply called the Racial Hatred Bill for what it is (a nonsense) and refused to have any truck with it at all. This is a Bill in which the thought police and the behavioural monitors have had altogether too great an influence. It is the first step on a very slippery slide into censorship and thought control. I say it is consistent with the practice of this government being the social laboratory producing bad results and unintended results. The member for Wills (Mr Cleary) referred to the leader of the Australian Arabic Council, Mr Joe Wakim. It is interesting that the leader of such an influential community in Australia has publicly opposed the n-w racial vilification bill, claiming the legislation is divisive and ignores the concerns of the most vulnerable groups. He said that most vocal advocates for the law were prominent members of well established ethnic communities-such as Italian, Chinese and Jewish communitieswho have the literacy and education to take advantage of the laws. He was inferring that other communities do not have equal access to this law. Then we have Phillip Adams, who I do not think is a friend of the coalition. In an article in the Australian, he wrote: I hate bigotry. And I also hate finding myself in bed with the likes of Bruce Ruxton, Peter Costello and B.A. Santamaria. He made the point that he is no friend of the coalition but admitted that, in his opinion, we are right. He went on to write: But I'm convinced this is the wrong law at the wrong time in the wrong country. Not only does it take another bite out of the masticated notion of free speech, but I feel it will prove provocative and counter-productive. To add a bit of humour, he wrote: Good heavens, I'm about to quote - argaret Thatcher. ""Let us deny the terrorist"", she said, ""the oxygen of publicity"". Right on, Baroness. But let us also deny the professional bigots the oxygen of this Bill. Far from suffocating them, as is its intent, l it will make the flames of hatred burn more fiercely. I do not often quote Phillip· Adams, as he does not often quote Bruce Ruxton, Peter Costello or B.A. Santamaria, but I believe that on this occasion he is absolutely spot on. A headline in an Australian editorial, as every other editorial that I could find clearly said, reads: 'Race hate Bill is unnecessary'. Further on in the article was the subheading 'Laws may inflame ethnic tensions'. The article reads: The Federal Government's Racial Hatred Bill is an exercise in legislative overkill. It is a misconceived attempt to regulate the way Australians think and speak, even though we are one of the most harmonious multicultural societies in the world. The Bill gives rise to questions about whether federal racial vilification laws are needed ... and whether their potential merits outweigh their likely encroachments upon free speech rights. On both counts, the answer is no. I will quote again from the Courier-Mail, because I am a Queenslander. Its headline reads 'A blunt axe-Freedom is much more valuable'. In concluding its editorial, the Courier-Mail wrote: In Australia, where the dominant group (a peaceful and laudable one) has for years now been told-by Those Who Know Best-that it is neither dominant nor a ""real"" culture, there are already far too many barriers to free expression. Racists are at least stupid; sometimes they are evil. But the law already proscribes criminal conduct. And in the end, the most powerful weapon against vile cant is communal contempt and derision. We do not need to legislate for that.",115
180,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"In the spirit of shortened addresses, I will keep mine somewhat short. However, I would like to touch on a few points in the Racial Hatred Bill, because it is central to where Australia is going. As I have said in the past, I have great objection to the use of the external affairs powers. I recognise that we must have laws of the sea, laws of the air, laws of extradition, laws of immigration and so on. They are sensible. I accept feeling somewhat ambivalent about certain laws regarding national parks, world heritage areas and so on. But I object strongly when external affairs powers start to intrude into the social fabric of Australia. That is where I draw my line in the sand. I have three objections to the Racial Hatred Bill 1994. The first is its name. The very title is used to evoke the strongest possible community reaction and gives currency to the impression that there is a pervasive aura of hatred in the Australian community. We all know that is not so. As other speakers have said, this is not a perfect nation, but we are not dripping with hatred from end to end. So one questions why there should be such a bill and why it should have such a repugnant name. The term 'racial vilification' is repugnant enough, but the term 'racial hatred' is even more so. Against this atmosphere we are again presented with a bill that appears to rely on the external affairs powers under section 51 of the constitution-but more ridiculously so than previous efforts by the government. As previous speakers have outlined in this racial hatred debate, redress is already available in the criminal codes of the states. How ridiculous it is that a citizen charged and successfully prosecuted under the New South Wales Crimes Act could attract a five-year sentence while another, for a crime under the Commonwealth bill, could attract only a one-year sentence. As honourable members are aware, two commissions of inquiry have recommended against this type of legislation. You would think that, if this legislation were going to be promoted, it would be promoted by these two inquiries. The first was the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the second was the Australian Law Reform Commission into multiculturalism. The fact that 'hatred' is such a subjective term leaves extraordinary latitude in interpretation. As such, as one speaker said, it will be a lawyers' field day. To illustrate the point, there are two examples in the Bills Digest. Firstly, a 17-year-old boy in the UK was convicted for leaving an anti-black immigration pamphlet at the door of an MP's premises. He was convicted, but on appeal was acquitted because the appeal judge said the distribution of a pamphlet was not an attempt to stir up hatred but an attempt to change an MP's opinion on policy. Secondly, a group of defendants who used in a speech terms such as 'wogs', 'coons', 'niggers' and 'black bastards' were arraigned before the courts. It was argued, though we might say capriciously so, that the terms might evoke sympathy for the abused groups, not hatred. Believe it or not, the jury accepted that and the defendants were acquitted. It shows you the sort of nonsense that these hatred bills come up against. They become almost a laughing stock of themselves. While I abhor the conduct of the perpetrators of the acts that were illustrated in these two excerpts from the Bills Digest, I wonder whether, at the end of such a board of proceedings, the community heat level had been raised or lowered. I would think that in both instances the level of community heat-the level of resentment about a racial tauntwould have been higher. I will expand this to give the basis of my second objection, which flows from the first. There are in the laws of the land adequate remedies for all sorts of radically motivated acts: violence, disruptive behaviour, abuse, defacing property, arson, unlawful assembly and so on. I believe this bill may well excite the very sentiments it seeks to suppress. If you like, the legislative identification of the forms of racial outrage may in themselves become self-fulfilling prophecies. It is interesting to note at that point what Father Frank Brennan said. A few people have referred to Father Brennan in this debate, but I do not think I have heard anyone yet use these two of his quotes. I think they should go on the record because they have something to say. Father Brennan said: The fact you have a problem in society doesn't mean you make a criminal law against it. The criminal law is a very blunt instrument for reshaping the hearts of racists and clearing the air of racist sentiment. He went on to say: At this time, in this part of the world, thought police armed with criminal sanctions are not the answer. So say all of us on this side of the House. I feel that in this legislation the government denigrates the ethnic community. If you like, it virtually says, 'You people cannot look after yourselves. In your integration with the broad mass of Australian people we will have to look after you.' When I mention that to people of ethnic extraction, they take the greatest possible exception to that sort of patronising effect. This is patronising legislation against the broad raft of people of ethnic origin. Australia is a homogeneous society. That homogeneity has not been static. We have evolved from convicts, soldiers, free settlersa wide range of various financially resourced and social and religious groups, albeit in the early days of a heavy northern European extraction. At various times we have absorbed immigration influxes: of the free settlers of the 1830s, from the various gold rushes, the postwar settlements and, more recently, the intensive migration of the post-World War II era. These bursts have toltl us two things: firstly, people come to this nation for its lifestyle, its opportunity, its safety, its institution and the protection of its laws; and, secondly, successive homogenous groups of Australians have continued to develop these laws. People came to this country from nations with appalling records of conduct in civil rights, liberty and matters as fundamental as safety in the streets. They came here because of what we had to offer. Ostensibly, they left behind their previous lives, hatreds and unhappinesses. Certainly, that concept has changed the way we now do things. But even in multiculturalism, as Hawaii found in the blending of the various racial groupings, the end product of this era of multiculturalism will be a new homogeneity. There will be a new Australia and a new, distinctively Australian character. It will be a blend of the old that we are familiar with now and the various off-shoots from this multiculturalism. If as a result of these hatred laws and their application by one ethnic group against the other-in other words, taking the very institutions that people came to this country to receive and having cast off the ones c1f their own countries-we set one ethnic group against the other, then I believe long standing divjsions will be fostered. There is ample evidence in some of them that these laws may be used. The authors of this legislation-I speak of the current Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the government in general-will bear a heavy responsibility. We may well find that this marvellous, continuing, ongoing homogeneity that we have developed right from our earliest days in this country has stalled and that permanent divisions may be instituted in this country. This leads me to my third objection: the duplicity of the government. The Attorney General has said that aspects of this bill may never be exercised but the fact that they are on the statute book will have an educ.ative effect. What a lot of nonsense. I remind the Attorney-General that that is precisely the argument I advanced on the privacy bill. I will repeat what I said then because it is relevant to tJIis bilL I said that I have never been one for kicking down doors or jumping through windows with cameras to catch consenting adult homosexuals in private. It is years since consenting adults in private have been prosecuted in Tasmania. However, the laws, though they had not been exercised, laid down the parameters of acceptability. If the Attorney-General is going to advance that proposition in respect of the Racial Hatred Bill, why would he not accept the same proposition in relation to the privacy laws?",117
181,Mr LAVARCH,COMMITTEES,I did. It was the wrong message with tve privacy laws. This is the right message.,119
182,Mr NEVILLE,COMMITTEES,"You are drawing a very long bow and you have been caught out by your own smartness, frankly. In exercising these external powers, if we accept the educative argument on one bill we should accept it on the other. Not accepting it in either would satisfy me, but I do not think you can be just a little pregnant on issues like this. I believe that open debate has always been the way to expose extremists for their paucity of moral credibility. Clowns like David Irving are condemned out of their own mouths and all the legislative process does when these people are around is give them a standing they do not deserve. It is interesting that the four members of the coalition whose backgrounds might reasonably suggest a sensitivity in this matter as they have come from fairly recent but quite diverse and different ethnic backgroundsI do not normally, especially in this current atmosphere, talk about the party room, but 1 think I might be allowed this little latitude in this case-were the four most outspoken in the party room in condemning this legislation. It is very interesting that the people most recently attached to ethnicity were the ones who least wanted this legislation. A raft of people have spoken out on this issue-from Archbishop Hollingworth, to theologian Frank Brennan, to civil libertarian Terry O'Gorman, to all sorts of commentators. Some have mentioned Phillip Adams, Wallace Brown and Alan Jones. All of them have said that this is bad legislation. One said that it was bad law. I would like to close my contribution to this debate with an excerpt of what I believe to be the best of the editorials on this whole debate. I congratulate the Courier-Mail upon this editorial and I hope it sends a chilling message to everyone in this chamber and to anyone who is listening to this debate. The last paragraph of this editorial states: It is a powerful thought that here, in trenchant opposition to this misguided Bill, may rest chance for Australians to put a stop to mind control. The activities of a few maladjusted people can be curbed without laying on another raft of New Age law.",119
183,Mr ATKINSON,COMMITTEES,"I do not intend to detain the House for a lengthy period. However, I believe that a contribution to this debate is necessary. As the previous speaker has indicated, the Racial Hatred Bill, by its very name, conjures up a lot of concerns in people's minds. When one looks at some of the areas of incitement to racial hatred, one really has to ask what the word 'incitement' means. What type of approach are we going to place on incitement? I have a great deal of difficulty in determining the difference between incitement and hatred when we are talking about racial groups and people of the same racial background. Many people born in Australia would experience incitement against others born in Australia to the point of reaching hatred. There are good and decent people in this country from all racial backgrounds. But some of us at some stage could say that we have not really been impressed with the behaviour of people from the different racial backgrounds who have come to this country. People of an Australian background who confront people from overseas because they are unhappy with their behaviour and detest the way that they think or operate could well fall under the offence provisions of the Racial Hatred Bill for all the wrong reasons. When I go to naturalisation ceremonies, I regularly talk to the people there about what I believe are some fundamental things that should be done. Firstly, if they have come from a country that does not have English as its first language, they should look at retaining their language to enable their children to communicate with grandparents and the people from where they have come. In the multicultural blend that we have in this country, it is important that they have those links and ties with where they have come from. Secondly, I also tell them it is important that they recognise that they are making a statement about becoming an Australian citizen and that they need to recognise their the last obligations under Australian law. To me, of fundamental importance to this country is one set of laws for a group of people who choose to live in this country and call Australia home. I recognise that, from time to time, there will be the odd-and I would think very odd-circumstance where people are disadvantaged by coming here from another country. Perhaps the laws that we have at present do not protect those people in the way that we would like. But I believe that establishing a particular bill that looks at this is totally inappropriate. If we are going to bring people together in this country and develop an interest as Australians for Australians, we should not introduce legislation that enables racial qualifications to be placed in front of them. There should not be the opportunity to develop a case whereby somebody of a particular racial background is taken outside of being an Australian citizen and of being part of our community. I believe that this bill, in the way that it has been framed, does exactly that. When people claim that they have been disadvantaged for racial reasons, a counterclaim will be made. For every claim and counterclaim that is made in this country, there will be a build-up of dissatisfaction either on the part of those Australian citizens who feel that they have been disadvantaged by the penalties that have been imposed upon them or on the part of the people who have come from an overseas country who, as a result of putting up a claim and its not being recognised, feel that they have been disadvantaged. Every claim and counterclaim will work against what we should be looking at doing in this country, which is trying to unite every person as an Australian citizen behind one set of laws and values. I have a major concern with what this law is going to do for people in our community. Ultimately, it may disadvantage individual racial groups. As claims come forward-as inevitably they will under this legislation, if it is passed-individual racial groups and communities will see themselves being, if you like, ostracised for making particular claims. I would like to think that the overwhelming number of people with racial backgrounds who have spoken to me in the community of their concerns about this bill will make sure that they speak to the senators in the other place to ensure they realise that a large number of people in our community are very concerned about this piece of legislation. I expect that, on the basis of numbers, this bill will pass through this chamber. Their only way of blocking this legislation will be to speak to people in the other place who will be able to stop its passage. I am a little concerned that this debate was brought on in such haste by the government. But I suspect that it was done for purely political purposes. I am also concerned about the time that we are spending on the information contained in this legislation when many other issues in our community are far more fundamental and important to peoplIf you want to look at the rights and opportunities and areas of disadvantage for people who have come from overseas, it is far more l important to get the employment problems of this country into order and to give those people a job. That is where they are being disadvantaged. If you want to sort out the problems in this country, it is far more important to make sure they get the opportunity to learn the language and to lift the literacy levels in this country than to pass this piece of legislation. If you want to look after those people in this country, it is far more important for us to talk about making them part of this community and making them part of one set of laws in this country than it is to introduce this piece of legislation. But I expect that, irrespective of how many words are said in this place, this legislation will pass on the numbers. I very much regret that. But I can assure you that I will not sit idly by. I will speak to the people in my community who have major reservations about this 'and ask them to speak to the people in the other place to ensure that, at least where there is some equilibrium, the representation of those people is actually recognised.",120
184,Mr LAVARCH,COMMITTEES,"in reply-I will not detain the House with any sort of lengthy summing up. There has been a long and very thorough debate here. A whole variety of views has been put genuinely, and passionatelyon occasions. J'he Racial Hatred Bill invites that sor.I;o of scrutiny. I want to 'take lip one point which the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) raised and which I have heard repeated in a range of other contributions and seen in some commentary in newspapers. He alleged that there is an inconsistency in our saying that any law can have a statement or educative effect when we did not say the same thing about the laws regarding homosexuality in Tasmania. He questioned whether the government-and particularly me-was being inconsistent on that point. There is no inconsistency. I have always recognised-and, in my view, it is one of the objectionable things about the law in Tasmania-that it did very well have statement and educative effects. But that statement was wrong and, in my view, the educative effect it was trying to send out was very wrong. If you talk to the people in Tasmania whom that law was directed at and ask what they thought of the educative effect, statement effect and the impact it was having on their lives, they would tell you very clearly that laws do have statement and educative effects. My objection to the Tasmanian law was not that it did not have such an effect, but that the effect it had was wrong. I think that the effect of a law like this would be the right effect, the right statement of education. I will not detain the House further, but thank members from both sides for their contribution. This matter will attract considerable debate in the other house and will probably' go through a committee process in which we will hear a little more about it. I hope that the rationed and reasoned debate we have experienced in this chamber can accompany the debate in the other house, as in the broader community.

185,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise an important matter with the House. It relates to the Inglewood hostel in my electorate. In July 1991 a formal application for 20 hostel beds was lodged with the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health. I organised a deputation from the hostel committee to go to the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and Community Services in October 1991. In May 1992 an announcement was made by Senator John Button on behalf of the minister that a grant of $702,833 would be allocated towards the Inglewood 20-bed hostel project. The committee then swung into action with its fundraising, which was extremely successful. We have to remember that this was in a period of extensive drought and very hard times for the rural community of Inglewood. The appeal raised $400,000 from the local community, an outstanding effort. In August 1993 the committee raised another $60,000 to help provide furnishings and equipment for the hostel. On 21 August 1994 the honourable member for Calwell, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), deputising for the minister, arrived to open the new hostel after construction had been completed. It was decided that the government would give an additional $45,000 to the project because it had reneged on its earlier commitment of $702,833, reducing it to $657,194. The parliamentary secretary announced this and left noone in Inglewood in any shadow of doubt that the further $45,000 would be made available to the hostel committee. The local people had done their part; they had raised over $460,000. Senator Button had made a promise of $702,833. Then the government reneged. The parliamentary secretary, on behalf of the minister, made a commitment of $45,000 for an extra bed for the financially disadvantaged. It is now three months since that promise was made to the people of Inglewood. That commitment has not been honoured. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, to take note of this because the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health came with the authority of the minister and on her behalf opened this 20-bed hostel, made a commitmentMr Snowdon-It wasn't me.",153
186,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"No. One of your colleagues, the honourable member for Calwell, made this commitment for the extra $45,000. The government has reneged on that money. It made the initial promise, then withdrew it and then made the promise again, but there is still no $45,000 three months later. That is a typical response from the government. Port Hinchinbrook",154
187,Mr DODD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in the adjournment debate to endorse the action of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) in proclaiming the Hinchinbrook Channel at Oyster Point under the World Heritage Conservation Act. Despite the efforts of the developer to continue bulldozing old growth mangroves, even under floodlights in the early hours of the morning, there still is hope for regeneration because the root systems have not been damaged. The decision by the minister was made to protect World Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The Valentine report commissioned by the federal government identified 15 specific impacts on World Heritage. What is of major concern is the threat to the seagrass beds which are the breeding grounds for turtles and other marine life as well as dugongs. The minister has made it clear that he has taken this action only as a last resort after exhausting all other options to secure a halt on the mangrove clearing which was continuing on the site. The next step is further necessary scientific investigation. I have a copy of a letter by up to 50 scientists which was sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) supporting the need for further evaluation. The letter reads: We, the undersigned scientists, express our deep concern with the process of evaluation of the Port Hinchinbrook development at Oyster Point. We are concerned about the lack of scientific input and the virtual absence of baseline data for impact evaluation. It goes on to say: Hinchinbrook Channel is an important habitat for a suite of wildlife of high conservation status. If the works were allowed to continue, there was a strong possibility that the turbidity created by the site work would impact on the seagrass beds, which are an integral part of the World Heritage values of the Hinchinbrook Channel. The Hinchinbrook Channel forms part the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area. I am concerned about jobs and I understand that others are too. I am concerned about those people in my electorate, particularly Far North Queensland, who are still out of work. But if the integrity of the Great Reef World Heritage area is threatened, as the support. scientific assessment seems to suggest, then there will be a long-term effect on unemand, ployed people in Far North Queensland and the rest of Queensland. If the integrity of Great Barrier Reef is threatened,. that means that jobs in tourism in the Great Barrier Reef will be threatened. In the last week there has been a world conference on ecotourism in Tasmania. What effect would a threat to the Great Barrier Reef have on the world, let alone Australia? Those who talk about jobs ought to think about the long-term effect of the integrity of World Heritage areas, such as the Great Barrier Reef, being threatened. No-one is saying that there should be no resort at Oyster Point. People are saying that, if there is a resort at Oyster Point, it be an appropriate development. There is no doubt that there are appropriate developments in Queensland and other parts of Australia. There are developments that are designed to fit in with the natural environment. But the scientific opinion seems to suggest, at least terms of the impact of this development the Hinchinbrook Channel, that there certainly is not that sort of cohesion with the natural environment. I have no hesitation in saying-I will not use the word 'congratulations' - that Senator Faulkner has done the absolute right thing here. He has had no choice on this matter. constituent. The advice that he got was that the World Heritage values were threatened anB he to act to protect them .. He had to act because he had an obligation to act not only for the people of Far North Queensland and Australia but also for the world because the Great Barrier Reef is a World Heritage area. Banking Industry",154
188,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"We have all heard many stories of incompetence of and arrogance by banks, but I have come across few more disgraceful cases than the experience of my constituent Mr Gerry Powell of Proston. He has been appallingly treated by in the Commonwealth Bank. The worse part of this case has been the failure of the banking Barrier industry ombudsman to intervene in his  in his view, unsatisfactory litigation which resulted in a judgment against him with  appealed the judgment and was required to lodge his record book with the court of appeal by 4.00 p.m. on ·11 February this year. The case involved allegations of legal malpractice  to act on his behalf. Finally, a Brisbane firm, Stockey and Co., said it would act and lodge  amount of $1,000 by 1.30 p.m. on that day,  monwealth Bank, in Murgon, which advised that it could make a telegraphic transfer to meet that deadline. He drove for over an hour should into Murgon, paid a fee of $23 and was advised by the., bank that the money had been transferred. However, the bank made an error. Instead of transferring the money as cleared funds, as it should have, it was sent as unclear. As a result, the Brisbane branch did not in transfer the money to Stockey and Co. The on documents were not lodged and it was not until 14 February that the mistake was discovered. It was too late by that time to intervene.  maUer, the appeal was dismissed because the record book had not been lodged. A judgment of almost $100,000 was awarded against my  had the money earlier, but the bank offers a service. It advertises that it provides a service. It charges a fee. The ultimate insult in this case is that the bank actually charged him a second fee to bring the money back as the money was no longer useful because of its error. The Commonwealth Bank has acknowledged that it made the mistake, but it has offered nothing by way of compensation. On 15 February, my constituent complained to the ombudsman firstly by phone call and then in writing. He requested an urgent response as the appeal was to go to court on 25 February. When he had not heard from the ombudsman by 22 February, he contacted my office. I phoned the ombudsman and emphasised the urgency of the case. It was not until 1 March, after the appeal had been heard, that the ombudsman even acknowledged that he had received the case and advised that it would be six weeks before an investigator was able to devote time to the case. This is really disgraceful. Despite many letters, phone calls and faxes from me, includit ing one letter in which I reminded the ombudsman that justice delayed is justice denied-and that was particularly true in this instance-and despite newspaper coverage of the case, it was not until 5 September that ombudsman finally reported on the case. In an incomprehensible conclusion, the ombudsman said that, in spite of the fact that the bank admitted the error 'there appears to be no maladministration by the bank'. I have to say that I was shocked by this finding and the denial of natural justice. I admit that Mr Powell may not have won his case in court but, because of the bank error, he was denied his day in court and denied an opportunity to put his case. By this time, creditors were pressing my constituent for bankruptcy. He appealed the ombudsman's finding and it was not until 25 October that the ombudsman confirmed the original decision. It took the ombudsman eight months to deal with this urgent case. How can the public have any confidence in the processes of the banking ombudsman? The situation now is that the Commonwealth Bank continues to trade and charge fees for services not provided. The banking ombudsman continues to claim to independently examine cases brought to his attention.  was declared bankrupt. Banks and other creditors will now take the last of his possessions. This is an appalling abuse of the system. The bank has failed to act correctly, but it has not taken any responsibility for its actions. The system set up to protect clients has failed to act on his behalf. There really needs to be a thorough review of these processes. (TIme expired) Enterprise Bargaining",155
189,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"The success of enterprise bargaining depends on one key concept laid down in the act, and that is the concept of bargaining in good faith. Bargaining in good faith is clear enough to anyone who has even a minimum grasp of the English language. To bargain means to give and take on both sides. It means talking and means negotiation. It means a discussion where precedent and comparison are part of the process.' It means negotiation on both sides, between the employers and the employees, with an industrial relations manager or the his equivalent representing the company and the representatives of the employees, selected by free choice, all coming together to make their agreement, taking into account the laws of the land and the fact that we have evolved, over generations, a safety net of conditions accepted in the community. Good faith means that there are rights and responsibilities on both sides. CRA, one of Australia's largest companies, is involved in a fundamental attack on enterprise bargaining. It wants to ensure that bargains are one-sided affairs, putting the might of the company against each individual worker. It wants to collectively bind and gag its work force by ensuring that each individually negotiated contract, in terms of the long term outcomes, is akin to a boxing contest between an Australian heavyweight champion and a first-time bantamweight. In such a context there can never be a fair contest let alone a bargain involving negotiation. There can be no negotiation or bargaining in the circumstances that CRA is seeking to impose upon its work force. Success in Australian business happens for those who have invested in their work force, reorganised themselves and recast their relationships with their staff. Those who have put the boxing matches behind them and talked and worked cooperatively with their work forces are achieving success, particularly in exports. In the Australian Financial Review on 10 November, Peter Roberts said: Last week Leading the Way, a study of best manufacturing practices released by the Australian Manufacturing Council, shows clearly that companies adopting best practice are outperforming those that are not. Page 28 of that study states: An enterprise agreement is unlikely to be successful if the ingredients for co-operation-open and honest communication and trust-are not there. Clearly, those ingredients are not there for CRA. Mr Roberts went on in his article to observe: The study, of 1,400 companies in Australia and New Zealand, suggests that the main factors in improved business performance are internal to the enterprise. Improving people practices is seen as the key issue for companies boosting competitiveness. Old-style dictatorial management and confrontational industrial relations policies are simply incompatible with focusing enterprises on delivering quality products and services to satisfy customer needs. According to the Australian Manufacturing Council survey, 83 per cent of best practice companies in Australia suggest leadership involves encouraging change and implementing a culture of trust, involvement and commitment. As I said earlier, if a culture of trust, involvement and commitment is so necessary to highly productive and successful firms, why is it that such a large and important Australian company like CRA is moving its industrial relations policies in the opposite direction. The answer is CRA's fanatic ideology and desire to rigidly and ruthlessly implement plan X, the details of which I outlined in this House last week. CRA has an ideology that has .nothing to do with the process of discussion and bargaining in good faith. Bargaining in good faith means that there must be rights and responsibilities on both sides. The take it or leave it contract in plan X, such as that advocated by not tfnly CRA but also those opposite, is usually a scrap of paper which employees are given only days to consider. It says nothing of conditions, it offers only a token carrot of cash and it is subject to unilateral review by the employer at any time. That is not bargaining in good faith. It is simply the procedure of doling out some extra cash, which is like feeding a goose for a short time before killing it. The problem with CRA is that its form of enterprise bargaining and the prospects that it holds for this country will prejudice growth. What CRA is doing is prejudicing the capacity of firms to become more highly productive and to grow. There is no use the Business Council of Australia or the Industry Commission mouthing platitudes about flexibility in industrial relations when we have a company which wants to smash the whole nature of enterprise bargaining-that is, enterprise negotiation based on good faith, underpinned by the award safety net. CRA, through plan X, has demonstrated that it will use and abuse any offer of good faith and any willingness to negotiate by a sly and vicious manipulation of the work force. (Time expired) Family Day Care",156
190,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"We often hear the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, talking about family day care schemes in a rather self-congratulatory manner. I want to read into the Hansard record tonight an extract from a letter, which I hope will put her comments in a more balanced perspective. I received this letter only last Friday. It says: As head of an organisation that sponsors three Family Day Care Schemes, an Occasional Care Centre and other services for families I most strongly feel the need to express my concerns regarding the lack of increases in Family Day Care places in Toowoomba and the rural region it services. Perhaps I can best illustrate that there are unmet needs by sharing some anecdotes from my desk this week alone. Monday 7th November a supporting parent (a father) rang me at 8.35 a.m. in tears of frustration. He finally had found full time work but living 15 kms out of town was unable to find child care places for his three children 5112, 4 and 2 years. Commencing work in Toowoomba at 6 a.m. means he wanted to place his children in Family Day Care. Even trying the newly opened centres in Toowoomba did not ease his stress since they only had spaces for the pre-schoolers and were not open at 6 a.m. He had by the time he phoned me discovered that we could not help him within Family Day Care either city or regionally. The last additional E.ET. 's in our Regional Program came at the commencement of 1993 when we received 25 E.ET. 's (1f4 of the estimated need we had submitted for). All of the rural satellite towns are experiencing high growth particularly in terms of first home buyers and young families. Transport is a great problem in these areas and hence travel into Toowoomba may be impossible even if care in town became available. I knew of nowhere I could send him. Tuesday 8th November 9.30 a.m. A young mother phoned me urgently needing four days a week care for her baby now 5 months old. The baby has been going to work with her since her return from maternity leave le. since he was 6 weeks old. However now approaching 5 months he is not taking kindly to life under a desk. The young mother has had her son on our waiting list since the day he was born-in fact she rang me in an attempt to arrange care 5 months before he was born. Baby places in this town are still an issue particularly as the new centres prefer parents to book for 5 days per week. The father of this baby is home on Mondays and prefers to have his sone with him ... and why not? Tuesday 8th November 7.30 p.m. State Advisory Committee Meeting. Two city Day Care Providers met me at that meeting and at its end spoke to me most dejectedly about their future in Family Day Care. They are hard pressed after 6 years and 8 years in the industry to see many benefits in providing care through a system that is so heavily regulated but yet does not through periodic growth allow for consideration towards earning capacity of its ""coal face"" workers. Some of the changes in funding seem to have been made with due regard to centre based care arrangements but with little or no regard to the operation of Family Day Care let alone with regard to the needs of families or carers. The two carers concerned felt that their sector of the industry had NOT been consulted about the October 1 changes at all. Friday 11th November. I have today come from the funeral of two little girls who were tragically killed in a· late Monday car accident. The girls normally use Family Day Care and are cared for close to home. They were killed in a car accident on one of our rural roads, on this occasion the travel did not relate to child care usage. However, the question arises-if the government expects the current gaps in child care to be filled by private child care centres do they then realise the following:. That private operators expect to make profits and they therefore normally build in more populated areas. · That regions such as ours are being told that all future child care needs will be filled by private Long Day Care Centres. · That parents are heing denied choices in terms of areas where child care is available and of child care type. · That rural parents especially who are unable to find child care near their homes will have to travel long distances with their children in order to access care. I shudder to think of the implications of the family'S situation described above if they had been forced into that rural travel to access child care. Won't someone in Government hear our plea and answer some questions about lack of E.ET. for Family Day Care in Queensland. Surely in the International Year of the Family someone must care enough for Family Day Care to be seen as a service of value for many families. Yours sincerely, Lee MCCarthy, NA Racial Discrimination",157

A couple of weeks after that, we all got to speak on the Native Title Bill. One thing has not changed: the opposition is still opposing these basic social justice pieces of legislation. I was very pleased to hear the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) today remind me of something that I researched when I was in Western Australia last yearincitement the infamous Ridge v. Bridge court case and the outrageous racist actions of the former those Western Australian .Liberal government .in is attempting to deny Aboriginal people the would vote. If that is not inciting racial hatred division, I have not seen something that is. In the Northern.Territory this year, a ernment campaigned for re-election on the basis of race. It ran a divisive racist campaign to get itself re-elected. It attacked Aboriginal communities and the amount of money that supposedly spent on Aboriginal communities; Once again, that is an example not only of portant it wasinciting racial hatred but also of inciting it for electoral gain, which I think is even worse.

202,Mr NEVILLE,ADMINISTRATOR,"I rise tonight to place on record my concerns about the alarming erosion of our nation's valuable breeding stock in the wake of the current drought which has devastated much of the eastern seaboard. Recent reports suggest that up to 70 per cent of the animal stock in Australia could be wiped out, such is the severity of the drought. Critical to the immediate survival of our breeding stock, in particular our beef herd, .is ted. the supply of molasses. For the uninitiated, molasses is a sugar industry by-product that is a vital drought feed supplement used, by much of the northern beef industry. Molasses is a form of liquid energy for starving stock. Fed with urea, the medium supplies nitrogen supplementation to this stock. Despite the record 35 million tonne cane crop harvested this year, molasses supplies have already disappeared due to the increasing demand for drought feeding. The situation is especially tight from central Queensland to central western New South Wales. Over the last two months or so, I have tried to bring the looming crisis. to the attention of both the Queensland and federal governments. In return, I have been described as a panic merchant and have basically been told that molasses is a commercial reality, and not one for government. Let me give the House a few facts on molasses. Queensland produces 95 per cent of the nation's sugar and approximately the same proportion of molasses-about a million tonnes. North Queensland, from Mackay north, produces 85 per cent of the Queensland sugar crop and hence 85 per cent of the molasses. This year Queensland will have exported approximately 430,000 tonnes of molasses, or approximately half of our production. The rest is used domestically, either contracted by regular molasses consumers such as feedlotters, dairy farmers, feedstock manufacturers or, as has been the case over this drought period, purchased by spot sale. The 1994 sugar crushing season has now virtually come to an end. No more molasses will be produced until June next year. The Northern Hemisphere production does not commence until early December. Looking at the current molasses demand and supply situation, the estimated demand for drought feeding is running at approximately8,500 tonnes of molasses per week. .Spot sales of molasses at both Bundaberg and Mackay district mills have virtually ceased. Bundaberg Sugar, through its subsidiary Bundaherg Molasses, has arranged for three shipments from North Queensland; The first arrived last weekend and is already commitFurther, Bundaberg Molasses has been the first company to import molasses this year: A 6,000 tonne shipment is due to .arrive in January from Thailand at a cost of $130 a tonne-approximately twice the normal price. Producers can claim half the sea freight, approximately $47 a tonne, or $23 under the state government's freight subsidy scheme. The shipment has also been forward booked. A second 6,000 tonne importation by Bundaberg Molasses is under consideration. Mackay Sugar has just 10,000 tonnes of molasses left, much of which is already contracted out. Last week, orders in Mackay topped 2,500 tonnes alone. There is a possibility that it could be out of molasses by Christmas. For the other sugar mills, the story is the same. With the 1994 crushing season now complete, molasses spot sales are now non-existent. A crisis is looming and the government has denied its leadership role in alleviating the problem. In early October, I wrote to both the state and federal ministers in a bipartisan spirit. I was labelled a panic merchant on ABC radio by the Queensland minister, Ed Casey. He claimed that he had his finger on the pulse and was confident about supplies. Finally, he called a meeting of interested groups to discuss the. issue along the lines I suggested, for only to be clear that it was not a government problem but a commercial one, and that producers should plan ahead and forward' book their supplies. Even when groups like· the Cattlemen's Union-through the efforts of Queensland chair, Hazle Marland....,...was able to source supplies in North Queensland, the state government was able to lllakeavailable only four to five r(!,n wagons to transport thi,s molasses to southern ports. The response from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator. Collins) was slightly more sympathetic. After stating that there would be sufficient supplies to satisfy demand until the end of the year, he agreed that alternative supply sources will be required, but he disagreed about a subsidy. However, in a letter to me this week, he ruled out the suggestions for the Commonwealth to assist with the redirection of export bound molasses. But I am heartened that the minister has said that he will look at the New South Wales Farmers Federation proposal to retaim our core breeding stock. (TIme expired) Corlis, Dr William",159
203,Mr KNOTT,ADMINISTRATOR,"I rise to pay homage to an Australian who has quite sadly passed from our midst, Dr W. L. Corlis MBBS, FRACGP. He was a recipient of the Order of Australia Medal, the Rose Hunt Award and the ANZ AME award. Dr Bill Corlis, a person whom I came to know through my position as the. fe-eral member for Gilmore, was a resident of the Sussex Inlet community. Dr Corlis spent a large amount of his time working towards the development of the community in which he lived. This community, Sussex Inlet, is a small community based on the south coast of New South Wales. Like many small communities in New South Wales, it suffers from poor and low levels of health facilities primarily due to the New South Wales Fahey government. Dr Corlis embarked on a program of selfhelp. He enlisted the support of many people within the area. The patron of the Sussex Foundation for Community Development organisation is Sir Richard Kirby AC. But it was not only the likes of Sir Richard Kirby who came to the fore in assisting Dr Corlis in what became an impassioned dedication to delivering primary health care to the people of Sussex Inlet. Because of Dr Corlis's high degree of integrity, he was able to encapsulate the aspirations of the people of Sussex Inlet. The people of Sussex Inlet have felt deady the passing of Dr Corlis because he was one of those Australians whom we hold up And acknowledge as being one of those who care for people around them in the community. He was a person who put the community ahead of his own personal ambitions. He was a man who had foresight and who worked tirelessly to provide adequate health facilities for the people of Sussex Inlet. This weekend at Sussex Inlet RSL club a memorial service will be held for Bill Codis. I believe that it will be well attended by the community. I intend to be there to represent· the Australian parliament. Dr Codis had a vision to provide home care and primary health care to the people in regional Australia. His vision was not just for Sussex Inlet but for the whole of regional and rural Australia. To coin a phrase that may be familiar to Queenslanders, we understand that those people in regional and rural Australia get the rough end of the pineapple in terms of the delivery of health care. Dr Codis devoted himself to addressing the needs of these people and went a long way towards achieving that end. Sadly, in the week that he died, I had arranged a delegation consisting of Sir Richard Kirby, Sue Kirby and him to see the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). Unhappily, Bill Codis never made that meeting. Dr Codis's dream of providing health care to regional and rural Australia will not die with him. I make a commitment to this House that I will champion with the minister the ideals that he stood for and which he envisaged would be of benefit to the communities in regional and rUral Australia. Hopefully, Bill Codis's life and the work and effort that he Inlet put in will be remembered throughout Australia when the quality of the thought process and the programs which he envisaged is realised. I hope that his wife and family(TIme expired) Ballarat Primary School Essay Competition",161
204,Mr RONALDSON,ADMINISTRATOR,"Ballarat) (7.55 p.m.)I am most grateful that Mr Speaker has again done the students of Ballarat a great honour by judging my primary school essay competition. The theme this year was appropriately 'What my family means to me'. As Mr Speaker is aware, all entries were of an excellent standard, which I am sure made the judging very difficult. The 422 entries from schools throughout my electorate are all winners in that they have realised the valuable and important role that families play in their lives. Families for these young people encompass more than just biological parents. They also include step-parents, foster parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents and pets. These entries have captured the heart of what it means to be a family in the 1990s. The winner of the senior prize is Stella Wilson, who is in grade 6 at Saint Patrick's Primary School, Ballarat. The winner of the junior section is Hana Cleary, who is in grade 2 at Sebastopol Primary School. Mr Speaker also made special mention of Rose Slorach and Catherine Read from Concongella Primary School as well as David Parkin from Stawell State School, all of whom have put an extraordinary amount of effort into presenting visually what their families mean to them. I will now read these essays to the House. Stella Wilson wrote: My family means the world to me. They are caring, kind, loving, and understanding people. There are eight people in my family so we must all do our part, whether it may be cleaning, looking after others or just playing around having fun. We are all treated fairly and if we are bad or when we are good we get our just desserts. At our house our pets are treated as part of the family. We have 2 rabbits and 2 guinea pigs, which is a big responsibility to look after, but everyone helps so it isn't such a hard job. I would say our family seems very noisy during the day compared to other families, with children fighting over silly things, 'laughing, talking and things like that. The only really quiet. times are when we are all asleep, snuggled warm down in our beds. We all have good times such as when its someone's birthday, or just going out for tea. But we have our bad times too such as when someone is sick or when someone who we love has died. One really important thing about my family is that I don't have to show-off to make them think I'm special because they already do. Some times I get so frustrated I'd wish I was away from everything and everybody, away from all the noise and distractions forever. But deep down inside I know that can't be true, because I could not think of any better place to be than with my mum, dad, brothers and sister. The winner of the junior prize, Hana Cleary, wrote: I go to the basketball with my family and to the tennis. I do most activities with my sisters, Nicole and Ashleigh. Most of the time my family stays at home and watches videos. The game I like to play is Teddy Boy. It is fun with my family. Sometimes my mum and dad have fights. On Friday we get pocket money. Ashleigh and I get two dollars and my big sister gets five dollars. Mum and dad let Nicole stay up and Ashleigh and I go to bed at 8:30 pm. I am glad that I have a family that cares for me and that loves me. They give me presents and food. I love them back. If I didn't have a family I would be scared and' sad. I would be hungry and thirsty. I would not like it if I didn't have a family Mr Deputy Speaker, you will excuse my obvious, yet understandable pride in the quality and standard ,of the competition entries. The entries show the vital role families of all types play in strengthening the community that I so proudly represent. These children have not only done themselves, their families, their schools and teachers proud; from such an early age they have shown us the indispensable role that families play in our lives.

205,Mr LES SCOTT,ADMINISTRATOR,"Oxley) (7.58 p.m.)I rise ,to speak about the issue addressed by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) at question time today regarding the Commonwealth Bank's attitude of putting fees on accounts and transa-tions that do not go through automatic teller machines. I think this action should be condemned. It is not just the Commonwealth Bank's action but the action of all banks which impose fees to encourage people to use automatic teller'machines instead of supporting their own staff in the banks. There is not much doubt about the fact that this measure has been coming for a long time, but there is certainly nothing better than having the support and assistance of bank employees on a one-to-one basis. It should be a great concern that institutions such as our banks, including the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, the ANZ, et cetera, are reducing staff numbers. Increasing opportunities for technology will only result in a continued downslide in the employment area. I believe that the banks should be brought to heel on this very important issue of employment and assisting people by providing good services to them. Those services clearly cannot be provided through a hole in the wall called an automatic teller when human beings can provide them. I think the measure should stand condemned.",162

It was a very rewarding business is happening in the insurance industry today: representatives throughout Australia, there is one reason for the fall in numbers is the superannuation disclosure has forced the insurance companies I had an AMP agency in Mount Isa, we had 17 out of that office.

That in the House on Monday and here today. Debate (on motion by Mr Sawford) adjourned. 3653 Overall, I certainly enjoyed participating in was particularly reflected in their comments Main Committee adjourned at 2.29 p.m. NA j j j j j j j j j j j j j j The following answers to questions were circulated: Defence Force: Right to Dismiss (Question No. 1004) Mr Woods asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 22 March 1994: Did the Minister's predecessor propose in the answer to Senate question No. 1477 (Senate Hansard, 9 May 1990, page 175) that a prerogative right to dismiss at pleasure from the Australian Defence Force co-exists with the statutory right to dismiss only for cause; if so, upon what legal authority did the Minister rely for that proposition.  honourable member's question is as follows: The answer to the honourable member's question which was published on 4 May 1994 in Hansard on page 279 contained incorrect information in the last sentence. The amended answer is as follows: Officers of the Australian Defence Force hold appointments at the pleasure of the Governor General under section 16(1) of the Defence Act 1910 in the case of Army officers, section 12(1) of the Naval Defence Act 1910 for Navy officers and Air Force Regulation 72(1) for Air Force officers. The holding of an appointment at pleasure also provides the power to the appointing authority to terminate that appointment. It is the practice that an officer's appointment will not be terminated without written notification of the reasons and the officer being given the opportunity to show cause why such action should not be taken. As was indicated in the answer to Senate question No. 1477, the termination of an appointment is an administrative procedure and should not be confused with the punishment of dismissal from the Defence Force which may be imposed by a service tribunal upon conviction for certain offences under the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. Conservation Council of Victoria (Question No. 1171) Mr Cunningham asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 30 May 1994: NA (1) What Commonwealth funding was allocated Members to the Conservation Council of Victoria (CCV) in. (a) 1989-90, (b) 1990-91 (c) 1991-92 (d) 1992-93 and (e) 1993-94 from the Minister's portfolio. (2) By what means does the Cornmonwealth Government ensure the CCV's accountability for funds.",262
236,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has asked that I correct the record in respect of the original answer provided to this question on 23 August 1994. The answer incorrectly showed the 1992-93 grant to the CCV from the Grants to Voluntary Conservation Organisations Program as $92,107 and omitted two grants paid to the CCV from the Greenhouse Information and Education Program Grants Scheme ($32,000 in 1989-90 and $28,000 in 1990-91). The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following amended answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am able to supply basic details of federal Government grants to the Conservation Council of Victoria only from my portfolio. The Council receives funding from three sources administered by my Portfolio, the program of Grants to Voluntary Conservation Organisations (GVCO), the National Estate Grant Program (NEGP) and the Greenhouse Education and Information Program Grants Scheme (GEIPGS). The GEIPGS (now discontinued) and the GVCO Program are administered by my Department and the NEGP is administered by the Australian Heritage Commission. The Council has also received a one-off grant administered by my Department. Since 1989, the Council has received a total of $573,588 under the GVCO Program. 1988-89-$74,600 1989-90-$84,076 1990-91-$88,279 1991-92-$90,301 1992-93-$102,107 1993-94-$134,225 Since 1989, the Council has received a total of $75,666 under the NEGP. 1988-89-$26,666 1992-93-$33,000 1993-94-$16,000 Since 1989 the Council has received a total of $60,000 under the GEIPGS. 1989-90-$32,000 1990-91-$28,000 The Council also received a one-off particular purpose grant of $25,000 in 1993-94 from the Department for coordination of an education project to encourage reduction in urban air pollution and greenhouse emissions from vehicles through better use of public transport. (2) The Conservation Council of Victoria is accountable to grant administration authorities in the Environment portfolio and therefore ultimately to the Minister. Accountability is secured through the acquittal and reporting procedures developed for each grants program and the exclusion from further participation in programs where acquittal or performance is deemed unsatisfactory. Details of the grants are included in the annual reports of the administering authorities to the Minister which are tabled in Parliament. Service Pensions (Question No. 1547) Mr Thckey asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) Did he state in a letter to the Minister for Human Services and Health dated 25 July 1994 that service pensions are income tested rather than assets tested. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No, I did not say that service pensions are income tested rather than assets tested. The letter in question referred specifically to the service pensions paid to a particular veteran and spouse. In all service pension assessments, both an income and an assets test are applied. Service Pension is then paid under whichever test results in the lower amount of pension. As the value of the assets held by this couple are within the assets free area, their service pensions are assessed under the income test, not the assets test. Therefore assets held by the couple do not affect the rate of their pension. For ease of understanding, it is customary to refer to the pension as being income tested. In fact, the majority of service pensions are paid under the income test, and only approximately 3.5% are paid under the assets test. Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories: Stress Counselling (Question No. 1601)",265
237,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: Did the department or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility spend any sum on stress counselling services for Commonwealth employees or their families in 1993-94.",266
238,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. The department and portfolio agencies each run an Employee Assistance Program which provides counselling services to staff on matters related to career and personal concerns, including stress. The cost of the Employee Assistance Programs is shown below but it is not possible to identify with precision the component of this expenditure which relates to stress counselling.

(b) The detailed information referred to in the honourable member's question is not readily available and much of the information requested is not able to be identified separately.
