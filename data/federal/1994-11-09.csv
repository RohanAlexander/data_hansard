What we need to take account of here is that necessary and we want to have an open process to the parliament, we have got the agreement changes and they seem to have been reasonably also said that we want to see this reviewed in they are the way we go, we think, but we are principles.

I might just mention at the end the issue somehow terrible that the minister might have MAIN COMMITTEE 2979 to section 30 of the act will permit documents exchange service from one location or another not between different exchange networks. another Australia Post.

So why do I the second reading speech the government trumpeting Amendment Bill 1994 is a monument to competition? be the case? I disbelieve this rhetoric because, results in a widening of Australia Post's monopoly. examples provided by the government. The states: Competitors will be able to carry letters that are a reduction from ten times. Well, bully for him! In its submission to the indicated that its gap of 35 per cent, less than room from its potential competitors to allow words, it was able to maintain its community at less than twice the standard letter rate. In its 1992 report the Industry Commission services rate, below which it has a monopoly and thereafter be reduced progressively by recommendations been instituted by this government, much the same competitive situation as New in November 1994 and the enabling legislation Not only that, but when Labor's reform mirage monopoly threshold will be $1.80, four times provision for progressive reductions. For any business which wants to compete to charge at least $1.80 for the carriage of destination. That is hardly an inducement for the government is saying one thing-that it it has an ideal opportunity to get its act in order. Another area highlighted in the Hilmer report is the reference to public utility monopoly to a situation whereby the existence of a dominant competition. Of particular concern is the opportunity utilities, such as Australia Post, to cross-subsidise where they currently enjoy a legitimate natural monopoly. Australia Post justifies its monopoly largely community service, and for this it has the privilege to charge what it likes. I take up the point for Charlton. Perhaps the government should obligation and then throw everything MAIN COMMITTEE 2989 interconnection arrangements. The bill also when considering a change in the rate of standard obligations, sets out circumstances in which details when postal information may be disclosed. feel more than a little sceptical when I hear in that the Australian Postal Corporation Why should we not believe this to in reality, I believe that the bill in some ways Let us take a look at one or two of the second reading speech made by Senator Bolkus charged at four times the standard letter rate. This is Industry Commission inquiry, New Zealand Post twice its standard letter rate, gives sufficient it to provide a universal letter service. In other service obligations whilst maintaining the gap recommended that Australia Post reserved of carriage, be reduced to $1.20 in January 1994, lOc a year for five years to 70c. Had those we would have seen Australia Post in Zealand Post has been since 1992. Here we are has not even been passed by this parliament. finally comes into effect, the commencing the standard letter rate, with absolutely no with Australia Post this means that it will have every item of mail, regardless of size, weight or competition. This is a classic example of where supports competition-but is doing another, when which has direct relevance to Australia Post structures which restrict competition giving rise public utility provider severely curtails for these major public enterprises or a potentially competitive area from an area by claiming that it is taking on an unprofitable of a monopoly which virtually allows it of the previous speaker, the honourable member pay Australia Post for its community service else open to market competition. NA 2990 Sadly, there are more of these mirage reforms interconnection arrangements is another clearly amendments will address. By interconnection someone other than Australia Post carries mail Post costs. In relation to the necessity for Industry Commission stated: The conditions of such interconnection must be fair interconnection. The Industry Commission recommended that be allowed under fair terms and conditions to the location of final sort before delivery interconnection arrangements which, for some deliveries and the interconnection discount of Australia Post's bulk mail centres. The point has been raised before by the coalition why an interconnection discount should apply, but not between Perth and Broome just because nonsensical. Therefore, to correct what I believe coalition has drafted an amendment. We support the bill, but our amendment is there to ensure interstate and intrastate mail. With regard to other amendments that we are areas have already been expanded on at Australia Post community service obligations of two roadside delivery services a week to Issues with regard to contracting out and example, an organisation called Ausdoc, a national that the provisions applying to document exchanges to continue to provide its current level of said that Ausdoc should not have been doing it there; it is in the marketplace, and if Ausdoc is also concerned that it will no longer its clients' offices and its document exchange service definition of 'organisation' contained in the government and private business with a courier Finally, it is concerned that the requirement in the satchel according to the reserved services competitive bulk mail courier service. In all restrict it from continuing to provide services aimed at preserving existing practices at least. In terms of the carriage of mail, we have definition of the term 'organisation' which, if the non-Australia Post carriage of mail between subsidiaries, or interdepartmental mail of in particular, has some concerns on that front.

It seems to be a silly error in the legislation, the the interconnection provisions generally in that the interconnection discounts apply to putting forward, postal services in rural remote length by previous speakers.

(nme expired) Main Committee adjourned at 12.58 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Rwanda: Australian Defence Force Staff (Question No. 1348) Mr Taylor asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) How many Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel from each service are involved in the (a) advance party and (b) main body of Australia's Rwandan operations. (2) What ADF equipment is being used. (3) What usage of the ADF's aircraft resources is involved. (4) What mode of travel is being used by the (a) advance party and (b) main body. (5) Did the UN task the airlift of ADF personnel; if so, is the UN accepting financial liability. (6) What is the anticipated (a) cost to Australia of the operations and (b) refund of the costs from the UN. (7) Will the Department of Defence receive a supplementary appropriation to meet the additional costs of the operations.  member's question is as follows: (1) The ADF deployed a total of 73 personnel in the advance party comprising 72 Army and one RAAF. The main body comprised 235 personnel consisting of six RAN, 213 Army (including five Army Reserve) and 16 RAAF. (2) The contingent deployed with 43 vehicles (including six ambulances), four armoured personnel carriers, communications equipment (including satellite communications), power, refrigeration and water purification equipment. Equipment to support a 50 bed hospital with surgical, intensive care, preventive medi9ine, pathology and dental facilities has also been deployed. (3) Two RAAF C130 transport aircraft were dispatched on 28 July 94 to transport urgently needed relief supplies to Rwanda. This mission was flown in support of AIDAB's humanitarian relief effort and not UNAMIR. As at 12 September 94 no ADF aircraft have deployed in support of Australia's contribution to UNAMIR II. (4) The advance party deployed by United States Air Force (USAF) C5 aircraft. The main body deNA ployed by a combination of USAF C5, C141 and USAF hired 747 freighter aircraft. (5) The UN tasked and accepted financial liability for the airlift of ADF personnel and equipment. (6) The indicative cost of the proposed twelve month commitment to UNAMIR II is AUD$25 million. At this stage UN recoveries of AUD$1O.5 would be expected. (7) Defence has been granted supplementation of up to AUD$25 million, with UN recoveries being returned to consolidated revenue. Department of the Treasury: Electronic Information (Question No. 1359) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What services does the Minister's Department, or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (1) be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries to house the services and foster public access.",154
22,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A. Department of the Treasury (1) & (2) In conjunction with the Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS), an electronic version of the 1994-95 Budget papers was produced on floppy disc in May this year. This version (Budget Statements 1 and 2 and the Budget Overview and Economic Outlook) was sold through the AGPS bookshops and the Department is looking to produce more information electronically in the future. In addition, the Treasury/Finance library will receive electronic copies of future publications for release through its normal networks. (3) As yet, the Department has not considered distribution of electronic information through the municipal library network. B. Australian Bureau of Statistics (1) and (3) The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has established the Library Extension Program (LEP) which uses the public and tertiary library networks to distribute ABS publications for public access at no charge to those libraries. A range of electronic products containing statistics is also available from the ABS, but with the exception of certain products (eg CLIB91-a CDROM product containing the full published output of the 1991 Census), electronic products are not supplied free of charge. The ABS is monitoring developments in electronic dissemination of information, including within the library sector. At this stage, few libraries offer public 'hands on' access to remote electronic information sources, due in part to an inability to provide sufficient appropriate public access technology. As more equipment becomes available in libraries, the ABS will be seeking to deliver more of its products electronically via the public library network. (2) The ABS will continue to make use of emerging technology to improve its products and the delivery of those products. For example, the ABS is aware of 'touch screen' technology being deployed recently in some public areas of some jurisdictions for making government, and other information electronically available. The ABS is monitoring developments with this technology for possible future use for electronic delivery of ABS products to the public. C. Australian Taxation Office (1) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has been working with the tax profession for the past 4 years to provide the Electronic Lodgement Service (ELS) network. During this time, the ATO has continued to expand the capabilities of the ELS system. Trials have also been conducted with a tax agent electronic bulletin board and an external electronic mail link. These trials have indicated that substantial benefits appear to be available with the provision of these services. The ATO is beginning to look at new methods in providing direct electronic information to the community. The ATO is conducting a trial of electronic touch screen 'kiosks', known as AUSTOUCH for use by the community. (2) The AUSTOUCH kiosks are currently located in the country districts of western NSW and in the Parramatta/Penrith regions of Sydney. The AUSTOUCH kiosks have been placed in suburban shopping centres, local government centres, community clubs and municipal libraries. These kiosks are stand alone units designed to provide taxation information to the community using multi media (audio, video, text and graphics). The information provided includes general income tax, Higher Education Contribution Scheme, superannuation and small business taxation matters. The results of the trial will be evaluated and a report on the viability of a national implementation will be available towards the end of 1994. (3) The ATO recognises that the continuing evolution of computing and communication technologies (such as AUSTOUCH) offer opportunities for new and better ways of providing a range of services to the community. One of the central themes of the ATO's Modernisation Program has been the provision of these services. As a consequence, the uses of municipal libraries have been included in the current trial. D. Insurance and Superannuation Commission (1) The Insurance and Superannuation Commission (lSC) has operated a 'Public Access Database' since December 1992. It was introduced as a result of the Superannuation Ouarantee (SO) arrangements. The database contains contact details and the most recently available compliance status details for each superannuation fund that has lodged an annual return or registration form with the ISC. It presently contains details for in excess of 80,000 funds. As SO contributions can only be paid into complying superannuation funds, the database can be used by employers to verify a fund's compliance status before making their contributions. (2) Access to the database can be achieved by any of the following methods: direct access for the cost of a local telephone call for those with appropriate computer hardware and software (most PCS and moderns are compatible); and by telephoning the ISC on its toll free number, 13 10 60, and requesting advice on the compliance status of a particular fund(s). (3) Oiven the nature of this database product, there is no requirement to make use of additional library networks to make it more accessible. E. Other Portfolio Agencies No services are provided using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. Opportunities, if applicable, for doing so in the future will be kept under review. Disability Support Pension (Question No. 1530) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 20 September 1994: Has the Secretary of her Department communicated with the Secretary of the Department of Social Security on the issue of Disability Support Pension payments to sheltered workshops; if so, (a) what was the nature of the communication, (b) when did it occur and (c) what was the response.",159
23,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: An Interim Report of the Strategic Review of the Disability Services Program was published in August 1994 as a basis for eliciting comments and suggestions. One of the interim recommendations is that the Secretary of the Department of Human Services and Health raise with the Secretary of the Department of Social Security the practice of payments of Disability Support Pensions to sheltered workshops. Although no formal communication between the Secretary of this Department and the Secretary of the Department of Social Security has occurred to date, the Interim Report has been referred for the consideration of the Disability Task Force, which is chaired by the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Social Security. I am advised that the Department of Social Security is sending a formal response to the Interim Report direct to Professor Peter Baume, principal consultant to the Review. Foreign Service Pensions (Question No. 1546) Mr Thckey asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) What exchange rate mechanisms have been used to calculate the Australian dollar value of foreign service pensions. (2) Have the mechanisms changed between 1984 and 1994: if so, what (a) were the changes and (b) was the net financial effect on recipients in each case. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The exchange rate mechanism used to convert foreign pension depends on the source of the foreign pension and the purpose of the conversion. The mechanisms used are: (i) For a small number of Veterans the United Kingdom Government shares with DVA the liability for the payment of Compensation pensions. In these cases the exchange rate used to pay these pensions is set by the UK Treasury. (ii) For pensions received in a currency other than Pounds Sterling, the conversion to Australian dollars for Service Pension assessment purposes is based on the published buying exchange rate applicable on the day of grant of pension and subsequently on the day on which a review of the service pension is made. (iii) For pensions received in Pounds Sterling the conversion to Australian dollars for Service Pension assessment purposes is made at a uniform base rate. The same exchange rate is used for all cases where pension income is received in Sterling. (2)(a) There have been no changes in the mechanisms used for pensions described in l(i) and I(U) above. The mechanism used to determine an exchange rate for the Pound Sterling has undergone a series of changes designed to make it fairer and more responsive to changes in market rates. Prior to May 1990, a 'notional' exchange rate applied to Sterling. The rate was set by administrative process and was varied when the trend in the average market rate varied from the notional rate by 5 cents or more. In the period May 1990 to November 1992 a 'base'exchange rate was applied just four times a year. The base rate was determined by averaging the previous 3 months market rates. In November 1992 the quarterly mechanism was seen as unresponsive to variations in market rates and was replaced with a mechanism that takes the average of daily market rates over a fortnight and applies that rate for the next possible pension payday. If the average rate for any subsequent fortnight varies by plus or minus 2.5 per cent then that new rate is applied from the next possible payday. (2)(b) The net financial effect on recipients varies with the amount of income received, the frequency of payment, the bank to which it is paid and the day on which it is paid. British pensions are paid on 12 different paydays a month. Comparison of the market rates and the Department's base rates over the last four years shows that the net effect of the constant rise and fall in the exchange rates has evened out with the recipients neither gaining nor losing as a result of the exercise. At all times the Department of Veterans' Affairs has used the same exchange rate as the Department of Social Security. The more responsive fortnightly average method shortens the time between gains and losses. The recipient gains financially when the value of the Pound rises relative to the Australian dollar and is disadvantaged when it falls. Department of Human Services and Health: Stress Counselling (Question No. 1602)",161
24,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: Did the Department or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility spend any sum on stress counselling services for Commonwealth employees or their families in 1993-94.",162
25,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As part of a commitment to the occupational health and safety of staff, the Department and the other portfolio agencies have Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) which provide a confidential advisory and counselling service on a range of work related and personal issues. It is not possible to separately identify costs attributable to stress counselling. Pathology Services (Question No. 1630) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 11 October 1994: Are the current regulations governing public pathology services and entitlements to the Patient Episode Initiation Fee consistent with the national competition policy guidelines for competitive neutrality; if not, when will the Government ensure that public laboratories can pursue non-hospital private work on the same basis as private laboratories.",162
26,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth Government employs a number of complementary funding mechanisms to subsidise pathology services provided by public hospital laboratories and private laboratories. visions for the payment of Medicare benefits for pathology patient episode initiation (PEl) fees are in keeping with the Government's pathology funding arrangements. Funding of public hospital pathology services is the joint responsibility of the Commonwealth and States and Territories. The Commonwealth contributes to the costs of these services through the Hospital Funding Grants paid to States and Territories under the Medicare Agreements. These grants enable Medicare hospital patients to receive pathology services at no charge and include a contribution for the equipment, overhead and other infrastructure costs associated with the provision of services in the hospital setting. Pathology services provided by private practitioners to private patients, whether in or out-of hospital, are subsidised by the Commonwealth through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). The MBS arrangements for pathology provide for the payment of Medicare benefits for a PEl fee, to cover the administrative cost elements associated with a pathology episode, and for individual tests undertaken within the episode. These arrangements recognise that overhead costs are incurred on a patient episode basis rather than on an individual test basis. Public hospitals are not eligible to claim PEl fees for the services they provide to private patients as the Commonwealth has already contributed to these overhead-type costs through the Hospital Funding Grants to States and Territories. The current Medicare benefits arrangements for pathology replaced, in February 1992, the former two tier pathology fee system. Under that system, two schedule fees applied to all pathology tests listed in the MBS. For tests provided by specialist pathologists in private practice, a 'Specialist pathology' (SP) fee applied, while for tests provided by other pathology providers, including tests provided to private patients by public hospital laboratories, an 'Other pathology' (OF) fee applied. SP rates were set at higher levels than OF rates to take account of the overhead-type costs incurred by private providers and for which public hospitals were reimbursed through the Hospital Funding Grants to States and Territories. Therefore, the current arrangements for the payment of Medicare benefits for PEl fees are consistent with the previous SP/OF system and complement the contribution the Commonwealth provides for these types of costs through the Hospital Funding Grants to States and Territories. Charitable Organisations: Industry Commission Inquiry (Question No. 1638) Dr Wooldridge asked the Treasurer, upon Pronotice, on 12 October 1994: Will the Department of the Treasury make a submission to the Industry Commission's inquiry into charitable organisations; if not, did the Commission invite the Department to make a submission.",162
27,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of the Treasury does not intend making a written or oral submission to the Industry Commission's inquiry into charitable organisations. The Commission did not invite the Department to do so. The Commission does not normally invite Departments to make submissions. The Commission's normal practice is to issue a general invitation to interested parties to participate in an inquiry by making written submissions and attending the Commission's public hearings. Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefits (Question No. 1642) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 12 October 1994: (1) How many carers of aged and disabled persons received domiciliary nursing care benefits in 1993-94. (2) What was the total actual cost of the benefits referred to in part (1). (3) How many carers will receive the benefits in 1994-95.",162
28,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As at the end of the 1993-94 financial year there were 37,167 Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit (DNCB) beneficiaries caring for 37,634 patients (a beneficiary is allowed to care for up to 2 people at one time). (2) The total expenditure for the DNCB in the 1993-94 financial year was $49.886 million. (3) The current estimated growth rate in beneficiaries is 5%. This would result in approximately 39,025 in 1994-95. Aged Care Assessment Teams (Question No. 1645) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 12 October 1994: (1) How many aged care assessment teams (ACATs) were operating in (a) Australia (b) each State and Territory and (c) each locality and district at 1 July 1994. (2) How many ACATs serve (a) regional or rural and (b) metropolitan areas. (3) How many (a) applications for admission to nursing homes were assessed and (b) admissions were approved by ACATs in (i) 1992-93 and (ii) 1993-94. (4) How many (a) applications for admission to nursing homes and (b) approvals are projected for 1994-95. (5) What formal and in-service training is available to members of ACATs. (6) To what extent is the provision of funding for training ACATs the direct responsibility of the Commonwealth.",163
29,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There were 123 aged care assessment teams operating in Australia at 1 July 1994. The location of these teams by State and Territory, and by area, is shown below: New South Wales (51 teams) Randwick, Waverley, Inner West, Camperdown, Hornsby Ku-Ring-Gai, Ryde, Manly/Warringah, Lower North Shore, Mona Vale, Lady Davidson (Northern Sydney), Sutherland, Canterbury, St George, Camden, Lidcombe, Liverpool, Westmead, Blacktown, Auburn, Penrith, Blue Mountains, Homeleigh (Wollongong), Shoalhaven, Port Kembla, Milton/Ulladulla, Kiama, Gosford, Hunter, Clarence Valley, Tweed Heads, Lismore, Coffs Harbour, Port Macquarie, Manning Valley, Tamworth, Tenterfield, Narrabri, Broken Hill, Dubbo/ Mudgee, Bathurst, Orange, Albury/Corowa, Griffith, Wagga Wagga, Deniliquin, Young, South Coast, Goulburn, Wingecarribee (Bowral), Cooma and Pambula. Victoria (18 teams) Bundoora, Western Hospital (St Albans), Gippsland, Eastern Suburbs, Mooroopna, Mt Eliza, Kingston (Cheltenham), Caulfield, Northwest, Victoria Parade (Collingwood), Henry Pride (Kew), Barwon, Queen Elizabeth (Ballarat), South Western, North East, Southern Mallee, Mallee and Heidelberg. Queensland (15 teams) South West, Cairns, Maryborough, Nambour, Rockhampton, Gold Coast, Townsville, Mackay, North Brisbane, South Brisbane, City, Mt Isa, Ipswich, Central West and Greenslopes (Southern Brisbane). South Australia (17 teams) Eastern Metropolitan, Southern Metropolitan, Western Metropolitan, Northern Metropolitan, Riverland, Murray Mallee, Whyalla, Mid North, Lower North, Adelaide Hills, Mt Gambier, Yorke Peninsula, Upper South East, Flinders & Far North, Kangaroo Island, Lower Eyre and Barossa. Western Australia (15 teams) Royal Perth, Fremantle, Sir Charles Gairdner (Nedlands), Osborne Park (Stirling), Northam, Kalgoorlie, Geraldton, Mandurah, Albany, Bunbury, Bentley, Armadale, Swan, Kimberley and Pilbara. Tasmania (3 teams) Southern, North Western and Northern. Northern Territory (3 teams) Darwin, Katherine and Alice SpringsjTennant Creek. Australian Capital Territory (1 team) ACT. (2) 44 Assessment Teams serve primarily metropolitan areas and 79 serve primarily rural or regional areas. Some of these serve a mixture of both metropolitan and rural or regional areas. The large number of regional and rural Assessment Teams reflects the fact that assessment workloads are determined by both the size of the population in the catchment area and the geographic size of the catchment area itself. This is because a large number of assessments are done in the client's home. As a result, a metropolitan Assessment Team usually serves a larger client population than a regional or rural Assessment Team. (3) Assessment Teams have delegated authority to approve individuals as eligible to enter nursing homes. It is, however, nursing home managers who approve or decline applications from eligible individuals to enter a nursing home. In 1992-93, Assessment Teams conducted 129,900 assessments of clients seeking a wide range of aged care services. Of these, some 26,800 resulted in recommendations for nursing home care. Full year figures for 1993-94 are not yet available but, in the first six months of 1993-94, about 73,400 assessments were conducted of which 15,400 led to recommendations for nursing home care. (4) Currently, the number of assessments made per year is running at about 145,000 to 150,000. About 20% of these assessments might be expected to result in recommendations for nursing home care. (5) & (6) Assessment Teams are funded under the Aged Care Assessment Program which is a joint Commonwealth-State program. The resourcing of the Assessment Teams is therefore a joint responsibility. Training available to ACAT members varies from State to State and reflects local needs as well as the professional expertise of individual team members. A proportion of Commonwealth funds provided to States is available to be used for staff development purposes. Its use is decided locally to enhance the flexibility of managers to respond to local staff needs. Some States also set aside a proportion of Commonwealth assessment funds for centralised State assessment training. The Commonwealth funds a national conference and workshops for Assessment Teams on various issues from time to time. Nursing Homes and Hostels (Question No. 1647) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 12 October 1994: (1) What sum was (a) allocated in the 1993-94 Budget for, and (b) actually spent on, the construction, extension, purchase and upgrading of nursing homes and hostels for the aged. (2) Is there a significant discrepancy between the allocated and actual expenditures; if so, (a) what factors account for the discrepancy and (b) were savings allocated to other elements of the Aged Care Program.",163
30,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The amount allocated under the Aged Care Capital Program in the 1993-94 Budget for the construction, extension, purchase and upgrading of nursing homes and hostels was $139,444,000. Of this, $134,802,204 was expended and the remaining $4,641,796 was returned to consolidated revenue. $6.631m was allocated in the 1993-94 Budget to be committed in the 1994-95 financial year under the Additional Recurrent Funding Programs, which are administered under the National Health Act 1953. This provides for upgrading, building and rebuilding nursing homes. Under these Programs, the subsidy is paid recurrently over 10 years, with payment to commence when the project has been completed. Current commitment from previous approvals is $9Om, representing expected annual expenditure of $9m when all approved projects are completed. In 1993-94 expenditure was $1.02Om, with the shortfall carried forward to the next year. (2) The discrepancy between the allocated and actual expenditure for the Capital Program was due to some projects being incomplete or not meeting the Commonwealth's conditions for funding. The funds were returned to consolidated revenue.",164
