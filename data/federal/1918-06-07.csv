2,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Accordin g to .this morning's newspaper, Private Gordon MCDonald, to whose case I drew attention last week, has had his passage paid to Sydney, and there has been found wearing the ribbons of the D.C.M., the M.O., the Croix de Guerre, and the D.S.O., showing clearly that his case is a mental one. Moreover, he wassent to this country as a mental case. I ask the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt), therefore, if ho will see that this man, instead of being confined in a civil prison, is sent to a hospital or other institution where he can be treated as a mental case?",20
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I was not in the chamber throughout the delivery of the speech made by the honourable member last week, and therefore missed most of his remarks on this case, though from what I did hear, it appeared to me that he had not gone the right way to get it properly considered, and perhaps the case has been, to some extent, prejudiced in consequence. When this morning, I read the newspaper report, to which the honourable membeT bas referred, it occurred to me that the man must be bordering on insanity, or, at least, suffering from temporary aberration. I propose to ask the Minister for Defence to consider the case with me as early as possible.",20
4,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Will the Acting Prime Minister ulso ascertain the names of the persons from whom the ribbons were obtained which it is alleged the man was wearing? It was impossible for him to make them himself, and those who supplied him with them are the persons who should be punished.",20
5,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Department does its best to prevent the improper use of military symbols and badges. The subject of the honourable member's question may form part of the inquiry. ANZACs on Furlough. [7 JUNE, 1918.] Later:",20
6,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr Wise) informs me that immediately on the matter being brought under his notice this morning, he communicated with the Defence Department in New South Wales, asking the Commandant there to have the case dealt witli as a mental one, and all the steps necessary to do that will be taken. ANZACS ON FURLOUGH. SUSTENANCE ALLOWANCE.",21
7,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Will the Defence Department consider the advisability of giving to the ANZACs on furlough, to whom reference is made in this morning's paper, at least a sustenance allowance?",21
8,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I cannot answer the quesFrench tion off-hand, because I do not know what a promise would involve.",21
9,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Will the Acting Prime Minister have the matter referred to the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) ?,21
10,Mr WATT,Unknown,Yes . IMPORTATION OF FIREWOOD.,21
11,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Recently it was announced by advertisement in the Morning Herald that a supply of pine had been received from America, and was available for firewood, of which there was a shortage. Will the Honorary Minister  is being imported from America, and if finds that that is being done, will he take steps to insure that in future the cargo space on board vessels shall be used for the carrying of more valuable comvalided modities ?  thing about the matter, but I shall have an inquiry made. NA INSURANCE. .",21
12,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPULSORY NATIONAL,"Some time ago the subject of compulsory national insurance was considered by the House, which came to an indefinite conclusion regarding it. Has the matter been considered by the Acting Prime Minister and his colthe leagues ?",21
13,Mr WATT,COMPULSORY NATIONAL,I have no recollection of the matter having been considered by Cabinet during my term of office. Returned Soldiers. 5657,21
14,Mr BEENNAN,COMPULSORY NATIONAL,The Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) knows all about it. He circulated a Bill.,21
15,Mr GLYNN,COMPULSORY NATIONAL,"The Bill has not yet been prepared, though I have a digest ready. COMMONWEALTH BORROWING.  Minister consider the advisability of emulating Great. Britain and Canada by endeavouring to raise in the United States of America loans for war purposes ?",21
16,Mr WATT,COMPULSORY NATIONAL,"I do not propose to follow the course suggested. Great Britain has raised loans in the United States of America, not because of her poverty or newsher inability to borrow from her own people, but, in conjunction with the nation, chiefly to provide exchange value which was running heavily against her Allies ou the Continent of Europe. Canada, on the other hand, is the neighbour of the United States of America. But Canada, in addition to raising loans from her own people, has become, in one sense, a creditor of Great Britain. I think that Australia should, so far as her circumstances will permit, raise as much money as she needs for war Sydney purposes from her own people. RETURNED SOLDIERS. Sui'PLY OF LlQUOlt.",21
17,Dr MALONEY,COMPULSORY NATIONAL,"I am getting rather he timid in regard to the wowsers. I ask if it is today, and in honour of the soldiers who are returning today, that a badge of blue is to be worn on the uniforms of inmen to prevent them from getting drink? As it seems to me that the regurequiring this badge to be worn brings the men almost under the Aboriginals Protection Act, I ask whether the Minister for Defence has considered the advisability of having their faces painted black? I have been requested by soldiers themselves to raise this inatter. NA COMMISSIONER.",21
18,Mr FOWLER,PUBLIO SERVICE,"In a recent report of Acting Public Service Commissioner, attention is called to the fact that several of the principal positions connected with the administration of the Public Service Act have been vacant for periods ranging from one to two years. Does the Acting Prime Minister consider that this state of affairs is in the best interests of departmental efficiency, and can he state what are the reasons for the remarkable delay in filling the vacancies ?",21
19,Mr WATT,PUBLIO SERVICE,"I do not think that important administrative offices should, as a practice, be left vacant, or put in charge of acting officials for any length of time. Broadly speaking, if men suitable for the vacancies present themselves, or are available, they should be appointed as promptly as possible, so that the responsibilities of the administration may fall upon permanent officials who are properly qualified to carry them. The chief reason why this and former Governments have delayed the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner is the need for an amendment of the Public Service Act, and the consideration incidental thereto of the advisability of commissioning the Post Office. If it - were decided to put the Postal Department under a permanent Commission of administration, the work of the Public Service Commissioner would be materially lessened. But until the question has been analyzed in the light of all the facts, it has been considered advisable to delay the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner. PRICE FIXING . NA AFFECTED.",22
20,Mr FENTON,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"This is part of a munication that I received yesterdayThe dizzy limit in price fixing! Pint bottles tomato sauce, lOd.; not a pint tomato sauoe! Will the Honorary Minister see that when a regulation is made fixing the price of a particular commodity, the quantity and quality of that commodity shall be accordance with the price fixed?",22
21,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"I think that the regulations fixing prices govern quantities also, and, if they do not, they can be made to do so. The quality of foodstuffs is matter Will the administration of the glad Pure Poods Acts of the States; it is for the State authorities to look after.",22
22,Mr TUDOR,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"Is it not a fact that Commonwealth has complete control, .so far as quality is concerned, over goods manufactured in one State and sent to another?",22
23,Mr MASSYGREENE,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"That may be so, but the Pure Poods Acts of the States provide the legislation under which the quality of foodstuffs sold in Australia is regulated. AUSTRALIAN AVIATORS.",22
24,Mr KELLY,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"In relation to the policy of preference to returned soldiers, and to the possible organization of a scheme for the aerial defence of Australia, I ask the Minister representing the Miuister for Defence if he will have prepared a return for early submission to Parliament, showing the number of Australian aviators in the Australian flying units on service and returned, and giving an estimate of the number of Australians-it is a large number-flyin g with the Naval A i r Service and the Royal Plying Corps at the Front?",22
25,Mr WISE,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"I shall convey the request to the Minister for Defence, and no doubt the return will be supplied. NOTE CIRCULATION.",22
26,Mr WEST,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"Accordin g to this morning's newspaper, the note circulation has been increased by an issue of Â£2,357,704 worth of notes. Has this increase been made to meet the interest on loans falling due ? If not, what is the reason for it?",22
27,Mr WATT,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"The increase is not to meet interest, which is paid out of'revenue, not out of loan money nor out of the Note comFund. The expansion of the note issue has been inevitable, and has been due chiefly to the necessity of properly financand not ing our primary productions. Later:",22
28,Mr WEST,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,Did I understand the Treasurer to state that the proposed inin crease in the note issue was designed to meet the position of primary producers ?,22
29,Mr WATT,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"No . It is not an easy matter to explain, but if the honourable member, who is interested in this question, a would call at my Department I 'should be to show him the exact position. The arrangements we have made for financing one the primary products is the chief cause for the present expansion of the note the issue. I think I have explained to the House that the obligations which we feel we have to undertake in regard to wool, wheat, butter, and related products amount tosomething like Â£76,000,000. All these arrangements have to be dealt with by the banks, and in some cases shipments cannot be effected. the main cause for the expansion of the note issue.",22
30,Mr WEST,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"I wish to ask the Treasurer whether any refunds from the sale of primary produce will be devoted to the reduction of the loan account, or to what account the money realized in that way will be placed?",23
31,Mr WATT,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"In the event , of there being a refund from realization or exchange tliere will be a corresponding shrinkage in the note issue. DISTURBANCEAT ORANGE. RETURNED SOLDIERS AND A CLERGYMAN.",23
32,Mr BRENNAN,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"H as the attention of the Assistant Minister for Defence been directed to a report in the press that in the salubrious town of Orange, New South Wales, certain soldiers made an attack upon a miuister of the Gospel, that they dragged him from his pulpit and were guilty, so it is stated, of other acts of violence, and even sacrilege? ",23
33,Mr BRENNAN,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"I desire-and this may satisfy my interjecting friend-to ask whether the Minister will be good enough to furnish us with a report from the appropriate military authority at Orange, who may be taken to be responsible for the conduct of soldiers there, and whether he will also ask that a report be volunteered by the minister of the Gospel upon whom this outrage is alleged to have been inflicted ?",23
34,Mr WISE,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"My attention has not been called to the report, but I will convey the honourable member's request to the Minister for Defence. Later:",23
35,Mr NICHOLLS,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"H as the attention of the Acting Prime Minister been drawn to a paragraph in the Age newspaper reporting that a riot took place in a church in Orange, New South Wales; and, if so, will he take the necessary steps to preserve law and order in the House of God?",23
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"Order ! A similar question has already been asked and answered this morning. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. EMPLOYEES OF ENEMY ORIGIN .  That is tions to, and the positive danger involved in, the continued employment of Germans in the Defence Department, and having regard to a report that there arestill employed in that Department thirty-one persons of enemy origin, including one G. A . Ampt, whose employment wasrecently denied by the secretary of the Department, I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will request Mr Barnett, S.M., who has been appointed to inquire into the employment of persons of enemy origin in the Public Service, to direct his attention first of all to the military Department ?",23
37,Mr WATT,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"The honourable member, as his question indicates, knows that the Government have appointed a stipendiary magistrate to inquire into Jthe position of persons of alleged or proved enemy birth or descent in the Public Service.",23
38,Mr BRENNAN,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,It is an impertinent question.,23
39,Mr WATT,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"What appears to the honourable member to be impertinent might be quite reasonable in the view of the ordinary loyalist. The object of the inquiry is to ascertain if men of doubtful loyalty are employed in any Department, and particularly in the Navy Department and the Department of Defence. I endeavoured to induce the magistrate to in quire at an early date into one case which, upon representations made to me, seemed to be needful of more despatch; but he has laid out his programme of work in a very systematic way and rather objects to any interference with it . I shall see how far the honourable member's suggestion can be met.",23
40,Mr FENTON,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister a question relating to a gentleman whose case has to be inquired into by the magistrate. He came to this country when two and a half years of age; has been thirty years in the Public Service; and has been under suspension from 1st January last, since when he has received no salary. He is the only public servant in the list of persons of enemy birth who is in this sorry plight. Will the honourable gentleman expedite the consideration of his case so that he may know what his position is ? At present he is not allowed to earn his living in his ordinary capacity.",23
41,Mr WATT,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"I apprehend, from the honourable member's statement, that he is referring to the very case which I brought under the magistrate's notice. On the facts becoming known to me, I was induced to ask him to facilitate in quiry and decision in respect of this man. Mr Barnett is carrying out a very dimcult"" work in the best way he can, and he feels thab to be called on to deal with individual cases here when he is pursuing his work in a particular State is calculated to seriously interfere with the discharge of his duty. Por that reason he objected to deal with this case before others",24
42,Mr FALKINER,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"So m e time ago, in reply to representations that I made to the Prime Minister's Department, I was informed that Lieutenant-Colonel Bolle, a German,, had been removed from his position. I understand the removal conhowever, sisted of his promotion to another posiliability tion. Will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence state whether that is correct ?",24
43,Mr WISE,QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOODS,"I do not know. The case occurred before I went into the Department. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr Watt ) agreed toTliat the House, at its rising, adjourn Tuesday next, at 3 p.m. NA TRAINING. NA TH E AUSTRALIA NIMPERIAL FOROE.",24
44,Mr WISE,POSITION OP MENW HO HAVE SERVED WITH,"On the 19th A p r i l last, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr . Bayloy; asked meWhether those men who have served with the Australian Imperial Force abroad, and who would, under ordinary circumstances, be liable for training in the Citizen Forces of Australia, will be relieved from that obligation, on the grounds that their military training and experience abroad more than fulfil requirements ? I replied that the matter was receiving the attention of the Department, and a decision on the subject would be arrived at shortly. I am now in a position to furnish the honourable member with the following answer:This matter has been dealt with by Australian Military Regulation 788A, which prescribes as follows:(a) Any person who has, beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, served on war REPRESENTATIVES.] Training. service in connection with the present Avar, shall be exempt from the training prescribed by Part XII . of the Act during the period of the war, and during the period of twelve months ending on the 30th June next following the day on which the war ceases; and (6) Any person who has, within the limits of the Commonwealth, served on war service in connection with the present war for a period of three calendar months or more in any year ending on' the 30th June, shall be exempt from the training prescribed by Part XII . of the Act for that year; and any person who haB so served for a period of less than three calendar mouths, shall be exempt from any training required under Part XII . of the Act, which has been performed during that period by the unit of which he is a member. The exemption granted under this Regulation, does not exempt persons from their to notify change of address. SOLDIERS ON FURLOUGH. SUSTENTATION ALLOWANCE .",24
45,Mr WISE,POSITION OP MENW HO HAVE SERVED WITH,"In answer to some in quiries that have been made by honourable members in regard to the position of returned soldiers on furlough, I desire to until announce that the Minister for Defence has approved of the payment of a sustentation allowance of 3s. a day to all non-commissioned omcers and privates in the Australian Imperial Force returned, on duty, for furlough; and has decided that such allowance shall be retrospective as from 1st May last. BOARD OF TRADE . APPOINTMENT OF SECRETARY.",24
46,Mr MATHEWS,POSITION OP MENW HO HAVE SERVED WITH,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister - whether it is a fact that, notwithstanding the statement made in the Melbourne Age of 21st ultimo that applications from both inside and outside the Public Service would be in vited for the position of Secretary to the newly-appointed Board of Trade, an acting secretary has been appointed; and whether it is intended that his appointment shall be a permanent one?",24
47,Mr WATT,POSITION OP MENW HO HAVE SERVED WITH,"I know nothing about the matter; but if the honourable member will give notice of his question, I shall have inquiries made. PRISONERS OF WAR, NA",24
48,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether, in connection witli the representations which have been made to the Imperial authorities in re exchange of prisoners of war, consideration has been given to the unfortunate position of civilians from Australia interned in Germany? 2. If so, what arrangements aro being made for their release or relief? 3. If not, will the Minister urge that their case receive favourable attention?",25
49,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Attention is directed to the reply given by the Prime Minister to the honourable member's question of 25th January last in this connection. It may now be added that, in a despatch dated 7th December, 1917, the High Commissioner, London, stated that the case of the Australian civilian prisoners at Euhleben had all along been kept closely under notice, and everything possible had been done to meet all reasonable requirements, and to obviate, as far as possible, irregular supply of food and clothing. The High Commissioner also stated that, despite their best efforts, the lot of the civilians at Euhleben must continue to be irksome and hard to bear, and it might be quite reasonably expected that there would be a certain amoiint of dissatisfaction and complaint; but every tiling possible was being done to alleviate their condition. With a view, however, to obtaining the latest information in regard to both military and civilian prisoners of war, the High Commissioner was asked, on 23rd May, to furnish full particulars in regard to the conditions at present governing repatriation and exchange of same; but no reply is yet to hand. 2 and 3. In March last, the Government approved, on the recommendation of the High Commissioner, of the Australian Red Cross taking over the care of the Australian civilian prisoners of war at Euhleben, at an estimated cost of Â£2,000 per annum.

She is perfectly content that the islands adjacent to Australia shall be held by friendly Powers?"" (See daily press, 5th June, 1918.)",25
51,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"The Government thoroughly endorse the statement by the taken ? Prime Minister. Australia is not seeking territorial reward or extension, but strongly desires that former German PosGERMANY. sessions in the South Seas shall not revert to Germany, but shall be retained in the control of Britain or a friendly Power. VICTIMIZATION OF UNIONISTS.",25
52,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"the Acting - Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether he will confer with the Premier of Victoria and the chairman of the Employers Federation, with a view to stopping the alleged victimization of unionists on the wharfs, wheatstacks, and at other places by the foremen who have the engaging of men? 2. Is it a fact that men are refused employment unless they leave their original union and join the new union created by the Government und private employers? 3. If so, does he believe the above methods will bring about the amity so desirable at the present juncture?",25
53,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I know nothing of the facts concerning the alleged victimization, but shall endeavour to ascertain them from the Premier of Victoria. EMBARGO ON PHOSPHORUS.  Minister, upon noticeSeeing that phosphorus, used principally in Australia for rabbit extermination, is said to he almost unprocurable, and, seeing that it is alleged that there are big stocks of this commodity in England for which there is no demand, will he arrange with the Imperial Government to remove the embargo which prevents phosphorus from being exported to Australia?",25
54,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,The census taken in February last showed that there were considerable quantities of phosphorus and rabbit poison in the Commonwealth. A request has been made to the Ministry of Munitions to permit the export from the United Kingdom of phosphorus if not detrimental to war supplies. MEMBER'S TELEGRAM.,25
55,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether, in view of the fact that officials of the post and telegraph service delivered certain telegrams addressed to him (Mr Consiis dine) to officials under the control of MT. Speaker, subsequently obtained possession of them again without his (Mr Considine's) knowledge or consent, and then detained them for about twenty-one hours, the Minister will inform the House what steps he has taken, if any, to ascertain who was responsible for this detention, and the reason for such action being",25
56,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"On inquiry, I find that the telegram referred to was released for delivery without submission to the Censor. To enable this to be done, the Despatch Clerk sent the same delivery messenger to Parliament Honse to ask for its return. It was then handed to the Censor, and subsequently released for issue. LISTS OF FOOD PRICES .",26
57,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"for Dr asked the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I.

Regulations are being prepared requiring the fixed prices to be exhibited in the shops themselves. 2. Yes. I NCO ME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL . In Gdmmittee (Consideration of Senate's amendments): Clause 4Section 9 of the principal Act is amendedSection proposed to he amended(2) Any officer who acts in the execution of his office before he has made the prescribed declaration, or who, after making the declaration, divulges any information relating to the affairs of a taxpayer except in the performance of his duty under this Act, shall be guilty of an offence Senate's amendment - After "" amended "" inmovesert the following new paragraph:"" (oo) by inserting in sub-section (2) thereof after the word ' declaration' (second occurring) the words 'makes a record of or'"".",26
59,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.35] move That the amendment be agreed to. Cases have arisen where temporary officers while in the employ of the Department have made notes of decisions in reference to the affairs of taxpayers, and both beestablished fore and after the termination of their employment have sought to make use of those notes against the Department. The amendment will make it an offence for any person in the Department to make a record of any matter except in the performance of his duty as an oflicer of the Taxation Office. As it should be our endeavour to preserve inviolate the secrecy of the office, the amendment should be acceptable to honourable members. Motion agreed to. Clause 6MOONEY) Section 11 of the principal Act is amended(d) by adding at the end of sub-section (1) thereof the following paragraphs:"" {)) the income of an agricultural, horticultural or other similar society or association, not carried on for the purposes of the profit or gain to the individual members thereof, established for the purpose of promoting by means of exhibitions and demonstrations the development of the agricultural, pastoral, horticultural, viticultural, stock-raising or industrial resources of Australia.""

60,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.37] - I That the amendment be agreed to. It will not alter the principle of the clause as we sent it to the Senate. We granted an exemption to societies which held demonstrations or exhibitions in con- I nexion with the development of the resources of the Commonwealth. The l i m i tation we imposed has been removed by the Senate, and if the amendment be made, a society which is not promoted for the purpose of individual gain, but is for any of the objects alluded to in the proposed new sub-section, will not be taxable. No considerable sum of money will be lost by the extension of the exemption. Motion agreed to. Clause 7Section 13 of the principal Act is repealed and the following section inserted i u its stead:"" 13. This Act shall not apply to the income derived from personal exertion hy any person who is on active service outside Australia during the present war with the Naval or Military Forces of the Commonwealth or any part of the King's Dominions, or of an ally of Great Britain, from the date of his departure from Australia until the date of his discharge from, or the termination of his appointment with those Forces, nor to the military pay of that person from the date of his enlistment in or appointment to those Forces."" .Senate's amendmentLeave out proposed section 13, and insert in lieu thereof"" 13.

61,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.39] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. The clause as it left this Chamber has been recast in order to provide for cases in which Australian taxpayers may have enlisted for active service outside Australia. The Government see no reason for granting an exemption from taxation in respect to incomes derived from personal exertion to members of the Australian Imperial Pbrce, and not extending the same privilege to other Australians who have enlisted for any reason whatsoever with the Porces of any of the Allied countries. Motion agreed to. Clause 8Section fourteen of the principal Act is amended{ f ) by inserting at the end of paragraph (e) the following proviso:"" Provided that when the taxpayer Section proposed io be amended14. The income of any person shall in clude(e) five per centum of the capital value of land and improvements thereon owned and used or used rent free by the taxpayer for the purpose of residence or enjoyment and not for the purpose of profit or gain: Senate's Amendment - After "" value "" insert "" to him "".",27
62,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.40] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. The proviso, as amended by the Senate, reads as follows:Provided that when the taxpayer is an employee, and premises are occupied by him for purposes of residence in connection with his employment, the taxpayer's income shall include the annual rental value to him of the premises or part thereof used by him for the purposes of residence. This amendment will cover the case of a man who may possibly be obliged to live in premises much larger than he needs. It is better to assess the value of the premises to him so that he may not be paying more than he ought. Motion agreed to. Clause 12Section seventeen of the principal Act is amended by inserting after paragraph (b) the following paragraph:"" (bb) as an alternative to the deduction allowable by the last preceding paragraph, there . shall, at the option of the taxpayer, be deducted so much of the income of the financial year as is appropriated for development (the cost of which is not deductible under section eighteen of this Act) and for new plant: Provided that any of the money so appropriated which has not been expended for that purpose at the end of the year in which it was appropriated shall be liable to tax as income of that year;"" - Section proposed to be amended'17.

63,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.41] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. This amendment must he read in conjunction with the next, which proposes to add nt the end of clause 12 the wordsProvided further that no deduction under paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of section 18 of this Act shall be allowed on any new plant to which this paragraph applies. "" It deals with the question of deductions from the incomes of m in in g companies. As amended by the Senate, p a r a g r a p h bb will readAs an alternative to the deduction allowable liy the last preceding paragraph, there shall, at the option of the taxpayer, be deducted so much of the income of the financial year as is expended in that year for development, or is appropriated for development (the cost of which is not deductible under section IS of this Act) and for new plant.",28
64,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,What will happen if the amount appropriated is not spent?,28
65,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"That is another matter which is dealt with in the Bill, but not in this particular amendment. The principle of the Bill is to allow mining companies to set aside a certain amount of money out of their income for development. Wealthy companies generally pursue that policy. If the money is not used it is brought to account in the following year, and income tax is paid upon it. That is a perfectly feasible scheme of mining development. The Senate's amendment is to apply to companies who spend their money as they earn it. Small companies are not able, as a definite act of policy, to say that they will set aside out of an income of Â£50,000 earned during the year, a sum of Â£20,000 for development in the following year. As the money comes in they spend it on development work, and at the particular moment it is not earning income.",28
66,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,What check have we over that expenditure?,28
67,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"The check is to assume that a certain amount of wisdom will be displayed in controlling the operations of these companies. They will not put money into the ground unless it is used for dedeductions velopmental work. They would just as soon pay it to the Income Tax Commissioner as spend it on unnecessary and useless work. The proposal contained in the Senate's amendment is a perfectly sound one. It will help smaller companies in a way which Parliament has already decided to help larger companies. Another phase of the matter will be covered by the next amendment.  As a primary producer, I protest against this amendment, because I cannot see why mining should be placed in a more advantageous position in this regard than all other industries. Why should mining be favoured in this way?",28
68,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"It is not favoured. In come taxation seeks to gather a certain percentage of income that is beneficially enjoyed. This is not beneficially enjoyed, but is spent with the object of earning further income; and, if it is wise expenditure, there will be further income.  every primary industry. In the case of pastoral pursuits, the war-time profits tax takes up the whole of the profits of a man who developed country just before the war.  assets to show after he has decided to close up the business. What have the mining people got?  have the public to live on, and we have only to walk down Collins-street to see it. Now that ores and metals are at such a price, mining companies, by reducing their output, as a great many are doing, escape their share of taxation. I must protest against this amendment.",28

As the clause left this Chamber it offered a great protection to the big companies who are in the position to appropriate money at the end of the financial year for expenditure in the next year, whereas the small owner or company was not able to make an appropriation as defined by the Commissioner.",28
70,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,How is it denned?,29
71,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"The Commissioner has decided that the appropriation must be made at the annual, meeting. This provision will be a protection to the small company, which may be earning Â£400 or Â£500 a month, and expending about Â£700 in development work, with calls for the purpose of providing the balance. .Without the amendment, the Commissioner w i ll not allow for this expenditure, because it has not been appropriated at the end of the financial year. . Mr LYNCH (Werriwa) take no exception to some concession being given to mining companies or parties for developmental work. I had a few years' experience as a working miner, and I know that such a concession is essential. A very vital difference can be drawn between a man engaged in farm ing or grazing, and the man engaged in - developmental work in mining. Notwithstanding the fact that we have very able men, including geologists, in the employ of the Government, to tell us where we may hope to look for success, I have found very often, as a working miner, that their knowledge does not extend far beyond the point of the miner's pick. major part of the greatness of Australia is due to the mining industry, and it is one to be fostered, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) is, I think, on perfectly safe ground in calling attention to the fact that some consideration should be shown to the man on the land. No doubt tliere are high prices for wool and stock and so forth, and we producers are earning, perhaps, better incomes than we did before the war; but it shquld be remembered that, under present circumstances, we are compelled to neglect the work of permanent improvement and maintenance, owing to the fabulous prices of fencing wire, and all we require in this connection. So far as I am aware, we are not allowed to set aside a certain proportion of our incomes to provide for these necessaries in the years to come; and in this direction we deserve consideration. Galvanized iron is Â£ 1 0 0 to Â£120 a ton in small quantities, while fencing wire is almost unobtainable; and we ought to be allowed to withold a certain amount or portion of our income today in order to be able to face the lean years and maintain our present standard of production if not of prices.",29
72,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"East Sydney) [11.52] The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr . Lynch) has presented a somewhat good case, but I am always loath to make any exemptions of the kind in a taxation measure. There are other industries besides farming which are burdened with high prices, and the whole subject is a very "" t i c k l is h "" one. Of course, the mining community has, perhaps, the most pugilistic of representatives in this House, aud possibly to that is due the proposal to extend this privilege. In a business witli [11.48] - 1 which I am connected in Sydney it was proposed to set aside a certain sum for the purpose of realization in the following year, and it was hoped that some allowance in taxation would have been permitted ; but when I interviewed the Commissioner I found there was no hope at all, although the money was for developmental purposes. Once we ""start making exemptions in an Income Tax Bill we never know where we shall be able to stop'.",29
73,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"The big company is able to make an appropriation at the end of the year, but, unless this amendment is accepted, the little company will be destroyed. While the Mr WEST - All the same, the Government ought to be extremely cautious in granting exemptions.

We, on this side, offered some objection to the exemptions in the War-time Profits Tax Bill , but Ave were outvoted; and I suppose it is only human nature for vested interests to see only oue side. I have no desire to discourage developmental mining, if only for the reason that I believe on this will depend the future prosperity of the Northern Territory, if a proper policy is adopted. There is a fear, I am told, that development in the Northern Territory might diminishland values in the States, and this may be the reason why mining in that part of Australia is being kept back. Under the circumstances, I shall offer no opposition to the amendment, leaving the Government to take the responsibility for their action.",29
76,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Wentworth) [12.0] There is a great deal to be said for the view put forward by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner). At the same time. I cannot help feeling that the safeguards asked for by interjection by some honourable members while the Treasurer was speaking, would be very difficult to apply in connection with the general exemption, although I admit that if we are to have an exemption at all, this amendment must be made. The Treasurer says that we are safeguarded against a mining company throwing its money into the ground by the fact that the company would sooner give the money to the Treasury. That is just what such a company will not do. If the Treasurer were managing a gold mining company, and had the choice of paying Â£10,000 into the Treasury or spending Â£10,000 on another hole in. the ground-whic h might yield something, but in which he would not invest unless he were required to pay the Â£10,000 to the Treasury as an alternative - it is certain that he would apply the money to the new speculation.",30
77,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,We have decided that question in the main principle of the Bill. The amendment proposes to extend the same principle to small companies as to big companies.,30
78,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I have already said that if we allow an exemption at all, we cannot very well deny the force and justice of this amendment. But I am dealing with the general question of exempting mining companies. Much has been heard in this House from time to time regarding the value of the mining industry to Australia. So far as our legislation goes, that industry boils down to gold mining because, in another measure that was dealt with by the House recently, the only exemption granted was to that industry. The statistics prove that for every Â£1 worth of gold taken out of the ground; 25s. is put into the ground. It is quite true that the 25s. does not all come from Australia, and that whilst the English investor has paid heavily to get the pound's worth of gold from the ground, the Australian investor has not paid nearly as much. We must remember, however, that money for speculative ventures will become scarceindeed, Western Australia experienced the scarcity before the war-and in future money for mining purposes will have to come from Australian sources. That being so, I cannot see why we should give any policy encouragement to such an industry. There is a reason for giving a policy encouragement to the primary industries, and those other industries which are endeavouring to convert the primary products into manufactured articles. If that were done, we should greatly benefit Australian production and increase our wealth.",30

I am not arguing in favour of ""any exemptions, but if we give them at all, they should go to the industries that are likely to be of most benefit to the country. The mining industry is only a tithe of the importance of, firstly, the pastoral, agricultural, and other big primary industries; and, secondly, the industries which aim at turning out our raw products ih manufactured form. Australia has never had a policy which aimed at encouraging those industries. . Mr Fenton - The mining industry 'represents a production of at least Â£25,000,000 annually.",30
81,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,What wouldthe wool industry represent to the country if the wool products were sent out of Australia in manufactured form?,30
82,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,The mining industry was the making of Victoria.,30
83,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Yes , and it has already failed in Victoria. It was the forerunner .of other industries. The trouble with the mining industry, as contrasted with other industries, is that the more money that is made out of it, the more is the national wealth depleted. The revenue from that source is of the mushroom character. Production from other legitimate industries increases the wealth of the country.",30
84,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,How could the country have big manufacturing industries without mining?,31
85,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"It is possible that the Western Australian members may be able to defend this extraordinary exemption for mining, not so much by the force of their arguments as by the fact that they are solid on the question.  amendment embraces a very proper principle, and later I shall ask the Government to extend it to other primary industries. What is proper for one industry is proper for others. The honourable member for 'Hume claims the extension of the exemption to the pastoral industry. claim the same advantage for farming. The expenditure on rabbit destruction is an instance. The poison carts may go over the country week after week, and have no appreciable effect upon the rabbits, but an allowance is made for that expenditure. Yet if a man operates in a business-like fashion, digging out the ' rabbits, destroying all cover, and eventually exterminating the pest, he gets no allowance for his expenditure.

At present a deduction is allowed in respect of gifts in cash to such but not in respect of gifts in kind. It is perfectly clear that that is inequitable.

This practice of purchasing and presenting gifts in kind to these funds secure collections. is the means very often of greatly lessening the.work of administration of the funds. I think that this kind of thing should be enoouraged, and the object of the amendment is to provide that those who purchase gifts and present them at once to a patriotic f u n d should receive the same consideration in the matter of deductions from in come as those who pay actual cash into one  in purchase gifts which he presents to a fund .",32

They probably thought that if the Government could offer contributors' to the funds some inducement in the way of exemption from income tax, it might possibly lead to better subscriptions. Personally, I believe that the prospect of an exemption from income tax in respect of a gift to one of these funds does not weigh at all with the average contributor. When a man is asked to subscribe to a fund, and writes out a cheque for the purpose, it does not occur, I believe, to one in a thousand that by making the contribution he will secure a deduction from the amount of his income tax.",32
105,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,That is no reason why we should not recognise these gifts.,33
106,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,I think there is a reason. It is a very easy matter to make .a deduction in respect of a cash contribution. The income tax officers will have no difficulty in dealing with a stated amount. But take the case of a man who gives a motor car. I remember the case of a man who presented a motor car to the Defence Department. It used up so much petrol that it cost about 9d. a mile to run it. The man was glad to get rid of the thing. It was given for patriotic reasons; but it would have been better for the Defence Department if they had never accepted the gift.  buy the car as a new car for the purpose of making the gift ?,33

116,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I was chiefly concerned about gifts made in connection with repatriation, and, as I remember, the arrangement made was that gifts in kind for the purpose of repatriation would enjoy the same exemption from income taxation as gifts in cash.

How could we have immediate delivery of the gift in a case like that?",33

RODGERS - I am not so much concerned about the amendment here proposed ns about the provision which is to apply to gifts in kind made for repatriation.  agreeing with the principle embodied in the Senate's amendment, I think it should go further. I fail to see why a man who purchases something which he afterwards gives to a patriotic fund, should be exempted from taxation, whilst another man who donates something to a similar fund should be taxed upon his gift. I have in my mind the case of a man who purchases a horse for Â£25, and presents it to a patriotic organization to be raffled. Under this Bill he will be exempted from taxation on that amount, whilst another gentleman who donates a horse which may be worth Â£50-a n animal which he has bred himself-wil l be granted no exemption.",34

He will secure an exemption to the value of the gift, whereas another person who owns a much more valuable piece of land and donates it to the same organization will not obtain exemption. I know of a case in which a piece of land was raffled in the in terests of the Red Cross. Very much to his credit, the land was donated by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who received no exemption in regard to the gift.

In my opinion, however, there should be no exemption. A f t e r all-as was pointed out strongly before-on e man who donated Â£.1 out of his small means might be giving relatively more generously than an individual who presented Â£100. I hope the whole question of exemption in this respect will be kept out of the Bill. should make no distinctions. If , however, the Minister deems it necessary to re-enact the provision, and to amend the Senate's amendment, as he has proposed, T shall feel bound to support the Government. I trust that that will not be necessary. I desire briefly to refer to an incident mentioned by the honourable member for  never claimed exemption npon the kind of gift in question, and I did not desire to do so in the present case. When I raffled a block of land for the Comforts Fund I was aware that I ran a risk of being prosecuted by the Crown. But I did not object to that so much, because I thought that that would be a good advertisement for the raffle.",35
133,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"And not a bad one for yourself, either. Mr AUSTIN"" CHAPMAN - When _ I wa3 informed that I could not get permission from the Crown Law Department, I went on with the raffle just the same, out that permission, since I believed that a large number of people would learn that the raffle was being conducted, upon reading press reports of the Court proceedings, which, of course, would be a farbetter advertisement for the charitable object itself than I could secure by paying for an ordinary announcement in the usual way. I might add that the block in question was worth only about Â£50; but the public subscribed, in sixpences, Â£430 net for the benefit of the fund. Would it not have been a. rotten position if I had claimed exemption on that Â£50 gift in such circumstances?",36
134,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"After all, this amendment does not deal with that inatter. Mr AU STI N CHAPMAN - I am aware of that; but I am merely answering the honourable member for Calare, because I find it necessary to reply to some of the statements that that honourable member makes in this Chamber. . I seriously suggest to the Acting Prime Minister that this is a time when we need to secure nil the revenue possible. By Assessment Bill. agreeing to his motion, we shall be drawing an undesirable distinction.",36
135,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Yarra) [2.21] - I object to the proposed exemption for another reason besides that which the honourable We member for Eden-Monaro has stressed; and it is for exactly the same reason as that we are not granting the benefit of interest to future subscribers to war loans. If the exemption stands, it will amount to this: that the people best able to pay will receive the greatest benefit. The charities will get the money in any' case, if the whole principle is done away with.",36
136,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"It is very doubtful. Mr TUDOR,- I take it for granted that we all give to the best of our ability, and we do not stop to ask whether we are going to get exemption from income tax upon our donations.",36
137,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Charitie s are having a very bad time all over Australia, because patriotic funds are encroaching upon their ordinary sources of receipts.",36
138,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I realise that; but, to insert the amended' amendment will not bring in any more money for charitable purposes. When the Bill was before the Committee originally it . was almost with- unanimously agreed that it was an invidious distinction, to grant an exemption of this character, seeing, also, that the people best able to bear taxation would be the most extensively relieved; and, moreover, that philanthropic people generally were not looking for exemption.  introduced the amendment originally, I remind honourable members that I pointed out that discrimination was being given in favour of patriotic funds; but not in connection with gifts to charities, such as hospitals. I also stated that it was relatively ns much for a poor man to give Â£1 as for a rich man to give Â£20; and, therefore, that there should be consistency, at any rate in the matter of exemption.",36
139,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"But that was not agreed to.  being re-enacted by the Government's proposal. The concession should be the same, whether in relation to. charitable ov patriotic funds. Hospitals require as much consideration as patriotic funds.",36
140,Mr CORSER,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Look at the trouble it would give the Taxation Department.  the Commissioner by securing a receipt from the hospital authorities, when one can obtain the deduction without trouble. The intention of the Committee originally was that the exemption should be granted, whether for charitable or for patriotic donations.",36
141,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,The intention of the Committee was to make no deduction or allowance of any kind. That was the effect.  Committee arriving at its ultimate decision was that Mr Glynn told us there would be a loss of revenue.,37
142,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"No . There were two crosscurrents in the Committee. First, there were those honourable members who objected to any deduction for charitable gifts; and then there were those who thought the exemption was not low enough. The two forces joined for the excision of the whole paragraph.  of Mr Glynn, that it would mean a loss in revenue of Â£50,000, honourable members would have accepted a compromise, and have done away with the wrong principle.",37
143,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"They did not compromise; they struck out the provision.  fact that but for the statement of Mr. Glynn the Committee would have allowed the matter to go through; but as that could not be done, honourable members did away with what was deemed a wrong principle, namely, in giving a rich man a concession to which a poor man was not eligible. I advise that the principle should be the same in connection with charitable gifts as for patriotic donations.",37

145,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.27J - There appears to be a conflict in the Committee upon this matter. First, there are some honourable members who believe we should put this deduction on exactly the same footing as that in connection with a gift to a patriotic fund. That is one school of thought-if I may so put it.",37

148,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Bather , T am the professor.",37
149,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"The main objection appears to be as to the difficulty of satisfying the Taxation Commissioner with respect to the verification of donations, because, in country districts, for example, many working men do their bit towards the upkeep of country hospitals by paying their half-crowns into the funds. Those persons, in many instances, come within the ambit of taxation. The idea has been to fix a minimum, which would be easy of verification by the taxation officials; and that is why I have proposed that the sum should be Â£5. The main objection comes, however, from quite a new school of thought within this chamber.' I refer to those honourable members who say, "" Why grant any remission of income taxation at all?"" I may say that I have had experience upon this subject. We introduced an amendment of this kind into the Victorian income tax laws many years ago. It was the first of the nature in Australia; and I assure honourable members that it had a pronouncedly harmful effect upon contributions to charitable institutions. The Crown thereupon took the attitude that in granting deductions for donations of that kind it could afford to lose the revenue providing that the destination of the money was the coffers of the charitable institutions of the State. If that held good at that time, it is even more emphasized today. Charities are having a very bad time with respect to their funds. State revenues, if they have not been depleted altogether, are, at any rate, shrinking. The incomes of private'individuals are having more and more demands made upon them for patriotic purposes. Altogether, honourable members should not resist the proposal of the Government. From the stand - point nf expediency it has been found advisable, because it has acted as an inlcentive, inducing people to give more generously to charitable institutions. I hope, therefore, that the amendment before the 'Committee will be considered in this spirit, and that honourable members will accept the suggested amendment with the amendment I have made.",37
150,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Maribyrnong ) [2.31]. - I hope the Committee will not adopt the amendment of the Treasurer (Mr . Watt) , because it will have the effect of granting an exemption to a person who makes a charitable g if t of Â£ 5 , whereas another man who may give Â£ 1 to twenty different institutions and therefore contributes four times as much, will not be permitted to make the deduction. I am quite with the honourable member for Ed'en-Monaro (Mr Chapman) that the sense of the Committee is against the Treasurer.",38
151,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I am satisfied with the explanation given by the Treasurer, and I shall back him up in his amendment.",38
152,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I think that if exemptions are to be allowed, the poorer man, who may be able to contribute a guinea to charitable institutions, should be in exactly the same position as the man who gives a donation of Â£ 5 . me take the case of a member of Parliament as an illustration. that, in some of the large country constituencies, with a number - of hospitals and other charitable institutions, the ordinary member could not afford to put down his Â£ 5 here and Â£ 5 there all round, but he could give a guinea here and a guinea there and thus spread over the whole of his constituency a very wide charitable vote.",38
153,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Y o u do not call giving bribes to a constituency a charitable vote, do you?",38
154,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I do not regard it in that light. I merely mention the case of a member of Parliament as an illustration of any individual in the community. The - position of any member of a shire council is very much the same. I learn that the member for Eden-Monaro is now going to back up the Treasurer in has proposal, but I am quite certain he was on better ground on the last occasion.",38
155,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,But the Treasurer has pointed out that the charitable insfiitu tions will be benefited; and he ought to know.,38
156,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,I admit that the temporary embarrassment-and I regard it as only temporary-d n regard to our charitable institutions throughout Australia is certainly caused by the diversion of charitable donations from one object to another.,38
157,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"It is not temporary in all cases, because debts are being piled'up, and the institutions will take a long time to recover.",38
158,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"That may be so. For a long time. I have held that our charitable institutions have not been on a proper basis, and I believe that in every State today there is in contemplation legislation which will have the effect of placing the burden of supporting these institutions upon the shoulders of the whole community. I regret to know that the position is not satisfactory with regard to them, but if I can get another member to call for a division with me I shall vote against the proposal of the Treasurer, because I think it will have the effect merely of wiping out one system and putting in its place something worse.",38
159,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I am not wiping out one system. The present provision is for Let Â£20. I am making it Â£5 and upwards. We all know Mr Fenton - In my judgment, the most equitable thing to do is to recognise everybody who is prepared to give Â£ 1 ls. to charitable institutions. I would like to see the provision wiped out altogether, because I think that those who contribute to oiir patriotic and charitable funds will always be big-hearted enough to do their duty by the community so far as they have been prospered by it .",38
160,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Wannon) [2.37] The Treasurer (Mr W at t ) has, in my judgment, put his finger on the value of * the concession which the Act allows by pointing out that if funds are not raised voluntarily, there will be an obligation on the Commonwealth and States for the support of the funds of institutions referred to. In the many public appeals that I have made, I have found it was a great incentive to the people when I was able to say that no tax would be levied on the amount of gifts. There is another reason for the proposal, namely, to influence, if possible, the man who is not in the habit of making contributions. Unfortunately, this class of man is to be found everywhere. He sits back and never assesses his own conscience as to what he owes to our patriotic movements or war movements; but I am bound to say that, right throughout Wannon and Corangamite, tliere are very few of these men. 1 remember, however, that on one occasion, when I was. appealing to the people of one town to beat a neighbouring one which had raised Â£ 4 7 5 , and I wanted only a few more pounds, that, alalthough almost every man, woman, and child in the town had contributed, there was one, the wealthiest man in the whole community, from whom I could not get a ""bob."" In a sense, this amendment will give a small relief to the generous giver, and the other man will have to make up a little more by way of taxation. : L am son;y to know that, in .all of our taxation proposals, we have never yet been .able to - devise a scheme which would particularly h it the man who will not give voluntarily to (charitable institutions. Some time ago, we did bring down a Bill i m posing certain financial obligations on a section of the community; but it was so completely distorted in this House, that finally it took the shape of a bachelor tax- a proposal which was advocated onmore than one occasion by the ex-member for Oxley (Mr Sharpe). do not want to pursue that subject f u r ther. I think the Committee would be well-adviaed ,to accept the proposal submitted by the Treasurer.",38
161,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Brisbane) [2.42] It seems to me a remarkable argument that we are going to inspire gifts to the charitable institutions by' granting exemption from income tax upon the amount fixed by the Treasurer's amendment. If that reasoning were sound, then I say that the lower the amount is fixed the wider will be the inspiration to give. B y the exemption from income tax on gifts to charities of over Â£ 5 , a comparatively small section of the community will be affected, but if exemption is made allowable in respect of gifts of Â£ 1 Is., the field will be widened.",39
162,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,Nobod y suggested that. Mr FINLAYSON . - That is the argument of the Treasurer (Mr W at t ) .,39
163,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"He simply said, in effect, that the amendment would act as a, stimulus to those who gave of their own free will .",39
164,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"The Treasurer said that it was based on the experience of Victoria in regard to contributions to charitable institutions, and that, with the remission as provided for in the amendment, gifts to charitable institutions would be accelerated. Personally, I take the view-and I think it was the attitude of the Committee when the Bill was previously under discussion-that donations to charitable institutions should be regarded .as a legitimate charge on every individual in the community.",39
165,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"On the taxable income ? Mr FINLAY i SON - ^ No, on the gross income. I cannot imagine that the sources of charity are going to be dried up, because the givers will not be permitted to make any deduction in respect of them in .their income tax returns. I cannot imagine that this consideration will determine the size of any man's donation to charitable institutions. Mz-. BOYD -.Suppos e a man with Â£1,000 a year had determined to put aside Â£100 a year for charitable donations, and his taxation subsequently became Â£100 a year, would you expect him to put by another Â£100?",39
166,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"In that case unHowever, I doubtedly charitable institutions would suffer. He would not give a donation.",39
167,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,That is what we want to avoid.,39
168,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I say that the proposal will grant relief to the man least entitled to it , and I point out that the charitable institutions of this country do not derive thoir revenue so much from large donations as from a large number of small givers. It is this multitude of donations .which is so much to be desired, because it widens the constituency of charitable institutions, and awakens public interest in their welfare. I think that the Government's intention will probably be misunderstood, because it does appear to be a concession to the man who is able to give a big donation as against the man who is not able to give so generously. Probably few honourable members will be prepared to go, as far as I am, because I take practically the same view with regard to all patriotic donations. I know that many people would consider it contemptible to include their charitable donations in their income tax returns, in order to get relief from income taxation, but in this amendment an inducement is being held out to men who are able to contribute a larger amount to do that. think men estimate the size of their contributions to charities by the extent of their prospective freedom from injcome tax.",39
169,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Why , then, allow the reduction in the case of contributions to patriotic funds?",40
170,Mr FINLAYSON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I do not agree with it in that case either, but the patriotic funds are temporary and the others are permanent institutions, which will always appeal to us. The man who gives Â£5 deserves the concession perhaps less in proportion than the man who can - give only Â£ 1 ls. I should like to see the whole thing wiped out, and no deduction allowed for donations to charitable institutions.",40
171,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Werriwa) [2.47] - I am inclined to support the view of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) as regards donations both to charitable institutions and patriotic funds. I do not believe one man out of a hundred thinks about a possible exemption from income tax when giving a charitable donation, but if the argument of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) is correct, then the wider the field is extended the greater the benefit conferred. The only argument put forward by the Acting Prime Minister was that certain experience in Victoria went to show that donations to charitable institutions were multiplied because they were recognised by the Land Tax Commissioner. I am sorry Â»- that those people were not willing to trust the recording angel rather than the taxation authorities to keep the accounts for them. I hope the chastening effects of the war, together with that development of the higher virtues which privations always bring to nations as well as to individuals, will evolve a higher standard among Victorian taxpayers. I trust that their example, as quoted, will not set the standard for the rest of Australia. Let us at least show that we have the grace to be ashamed of ourselves, and not put forward selfish reasons to buttress people's promptings towards right-doing.",40
172,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,Are you speaking for New South Wales?,40
173,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,I am speaking for the sense of right. I hope the honourable member is not altogether a stranger to it. I therefore ask the Acting Prime I do not Minister if ho cannot conform to the higher standard of virtue which it is our duty just now to inculcate.,40
174,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,When did you adopt it ?,40
175,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I hope I ' inherited it. If the Committee cannot go so far as I would like, I trust the Senate's amendment will be agreed to rather than the proposal made here, which, I am afraid, right-thinking people will consider condemnatory of us as a people who ought to be alive to our responsibilities.",40
176,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"East Sydney) [2.50] The Acting Prime Minister has a large reservoir from which he can supply a great amount of plausibility, by means of which he seems able to electrify honourable members on the other side to such an extent that they break away from principles to which they originally adhered. I oppose this proposal, not on account of the plausibility of the Acting Prime Minister, but purely on principle. When the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) was speaking, the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) made a remark about honourable members giving donations as a bribe. I may inform the Committee that I gave donations long before I ever sought a seat in this House. I was a prospective candidate for over thirty years, for, in the opinion of a large number of people in New South Wales, I was fit to hold the position of a member of Parliament. However, I always refused their request. Every honourable member who has spoken on this question has tried to show the ActingPrimeMinister that the person who gives a guinea may be just as deserving of the concession as the person who gives Â£5, and yet will get no exemption from taxation. I do not think the Acting Prime Minister will be very pleased with himself when he comes to review his decision on this point, because there are many people in the community who continuously give small amounts to hospitals out of their small means purely for the sake of charity, while a large number of people who give larger donations have an ulterior motive.",40
177,Mr WIATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"That argument means that virtue lives only in the pocket below Â£3 per week, which is absurd.",40
178,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"The - Acting .Prime M i nister's mind is very small on this matter, but I have a large and open mind. The public outside will view the question in much the same way as I do, because I do not think there should be any exemptions at all for donations of this kind. An y person who is in a position to give Â£5 ought to do so without any other motive than that of pure charity. No reason has been put forward for increasing the amount from 21s., as proposed by the Senate, to Â£5, other than what is running through the mind of the Acting Prime Minister; but {here are people with bigger .minds, who cannot see that the alteration is going to be of any benefit. My view is that no taxation benefit should accrue to any one simply because he gives a donation to charity. American once defined charity to me as the raising of Â£ 1 , taking 17s. 6d. f o penses, and giving the remaining halfcrown to charity. The Acting Prime Minister seems to think that this concession will make some people in the community more liberal, and there may, perhaps, be something in that point, especially in the case of those whose incomes are taxed on the higher scale. If the war goes on we may see our income tax as high as 10s. 6d. in the Â£1, and, if that happens, a man who gives Â£5 to charity and gets credit for it in his income tax schedule will really only have given about half. The Acting Prime Minister will be in accord with the mind of the people of Australia if he gives way to the arguments which have been advanced here today. We are advocating a sound principle, and, although sentiment is very good at times, Parliament should in all its actions be governed by some principle. The proposal to exempt only amounts of Â£5 and over undoubtedly does an injustice to the man who can afford to give no more than Â£1 l s. The Acting Prime Minister will be wise in his day ai\d gene- Jensen, J.

(Mr West) asks for a principle. principle has already been given by the Higgs, W. G. honourable member for Wannon (Mr Lamond, H.

The Committee accepted that principle when it agreed to allow deductions from the taxable income for contributions for patriotic and war purposes. I want to put the point of view of hospitals, particularly country hospitals. They have performed, and are performing, magnificent service, and it is owing largely, I understand, to representations made by the managers of those institutions that the Senate has tried to replace in the Bill An the provision which was struck out in this Chamber in a careless moment, and r exwithout real intention.

(2) For the purpose of this section "" tax "" includes "" additional tax "" required to be paid in accordance with this Act.""",42
181,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.12] - This amendment by the Senate incorporates the provisions of proposed new sections 50A and 50B for which the Bill, as it left this House, provided. It practically contains nothing new to the provision passed by us; but it modifies in some respects the general effect and area of the original clause. The object of the amendment is to embrace the agency provision with the employer's provision, to which we 'agreed. The notice which honourable membersand particularly honourable members of the Opposition-aske d should be given is now embodied in the amalgamated provision inserted by the Senate. I think it will be useful and workable, and will not inflict hardships on either employers or employees. It will enable recovery of the tax in certain cases where the whereabouts of the .taxpayer are difficult or impossible to ascertain. In such a case the responsibility of obeying the order of the Commissioner will be thrown, after due notice, upon the agent for the taxpayer, I move That the amendment be agreed to.",43
182,Mr CHARITON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Hunter) [3.14] This question was discussed at considerable length when the Bill was previously before us. As the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) has pointed out, the amendment made by another place modifies, to some extent, the proposed"" new section passed by us. During the discussion in Oommittee it was pointed out that it was most unfair to throw upon an employer the responsibility of collecting income tax due by a defaulter. I do not know how the .Senate's .amendment will work in practice, but it seems remarkable that we should provide that, where the Taxation Department does not know the address of a defaulting taxpayer, after due notice has been sent "" to the last known place of address"" of that taxpayer, any person making payment to, or owing money to him, shall be regarded as his agent, and be required to retain from his earnings the amount due to the Commissioner.",43
183,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,We have already decided that principle.,43
184,Mr OHARLTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"^I admit that; but I opposed the principle, and it was chiefly as the result of my opposition that the discussion took place. While this Amendment modifies, to a certain extent, the original provision, it is difficult to understand how an employer can be expected to locate a defaulting taxpayer when the Commissioner cannot.",43
185,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"The Commissioner might know where the man was employed, and yet be unaware of his private address. He might see his name in a list of employees furnished to him. The notice might be sent care of the employer.",43
186,Mr OHARLTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"And the Government say that, because the Commissioner sees a certain name on a list of employees furnished by an employer, he is to assume that that person is liable to income tax.",43
187,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Not necessai'ily. It might appear, from the list furnished by an employer, that a certain employee was prima, facie entitled to pay income tax; but after deductions had been made he might uot be so liable.",43
188,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,But the Department will consider that a prima facie case is made out where the employee has not furnished an income tax return.,43
189,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Not at all. I promised the Committee, when the Bill was before us on a previous occasion, that the Commissioner would not assess such a person without first asking him to send in a return. In that return an employee would set out his own deductions.",43
190,Mr OHARLTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Le t us assume that a return is sent in. The Commissioner does not'know the man's ^addresshe merely knows that he has been working for a certain person; but, on the issue of the notice, for which this amendment provides, the employer is to be held responsible for the payment of the tax due.",43
191,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.17] - That is not the procedure. The honourable member would be entitled to make these deductions from this amendment if he were not aware of what took place when Â» this question was last considered by us. I showed then that what was already the practice of the Department would operate in cases of this kind. I pointed out that employers, under the present law, furnished lists of employees receiving over a certain amount per annum. The Commissioner, looking down these lists, sometimes sees the names of what appear to be prima facie taxpayers. I promised, however, that, before taking any of the stfps for which the clause provides, he wculd issue a notice requiring such persons, who were primd facie taxpayers, to furnish returns. I said that when such a return was submitted, the Commissioner would assess the amount of tax payable, and that this machinery ""would then come into operation. If , on the other hand, after demand to send in such a return, default is still made, this provision will provide the Commissioner with a lever to secure the amount at which the taxpayer is assessed. Tliat is the procedure followed in many case3, and it will facilitate the collection of the tax in a number of instances without duress or hardship to any individual.",44
192,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Hunter) [3.19] If the intention of the Department is that' just set out by the Acting Prime Minister, there is much to be said for it ; but the wording of the Senate's amendment would hardly heal the construction he has placed upon it.",44
193,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,I admit that.,44
194,Mr OHARLTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I had to be guided in my criticism by the wording of the amendment. If the amendment read that - notice shall be sent to the employer of any person who is a defaulting taxpayer, pointing out that he is a defaulter, requiring the employer to deduct from his wages the amount of the tax due, could understand it ; but the amendment, as it stands, does not provide for thing of the kind. It says* that a copy the notice shall be sent "" to the last known place of address of the taxpayer.""",44
195,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"*-It is-dimcult to draft amendment at the table while the Commity mittee is sitting, but I will undertake draft a special provision in the regulations in regard to that matter.",44
196,Mr OHARLTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I shall be satisfied with such an assurance. The statement of the Treasurer shows clearly, I think, that ' I was justified in drawing attention to this matter. Motion agreed to. Clause 35After section 52 of the principal Act the following sections are inserted:Senate's amendment - At end of clause 35 odd-5"" 52c. Where ""any income of any person outside Australia is paid into the account of that person wit h a banker, the banker shall be deemed the person's agent in respect of the money so paid so long as he is indebted in respect thereof, and shall be subject to the provisions of section 52 of this Act, and entitled to the benefits conferred by that section.""",44
197,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.20] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. This is an amendment which is somewhat similar to the preceding one. It enables a banker who is the agent for any person to pay the tax for that person and deduct it from his account. This provision has been agreed to by the banks. It will facilitate prompt payment of the tax on behalf of absentees. Motion agreed to. Clause 38Section 57 of the principal Act is amended by inserting before the word "" Fifty "" the words "" Not less than Five pounds nor more than "". Section jrroposed to be amended57. Any person who obstructs or hinders any officer acting in the discharge of his duly under this Act, or the regulations, shrill be guilty of an offence. I'unalty: Fifty pounds. Senate's amendment - Leave out the clause.",44
198,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.21] - This and is one of five amendments to which I propose that we do not agree. It is not an I absolutely vital matter, but it appears to me that the House of Representatives anytook the wiser course in providing miniof mum penalties in this Bill for the first time. The Department's view is that there should be minimum penalties fixed, in an order to give an approximation to uniforin the matter of penalties in minor to cases. In one State a magistrate may inflict a nominal fine of 5s. for some offence, whereas in another State the penalty for the same offence committed in exactly the same circumstances may be fixed at Â£5. The Department has information showing that there is an extraordinary and inexplicable disparity in regard to penalties, probably arising out of the idiosyncrasies of magistrates throughout Australia.",44
199,Mr HIGOS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"As a matter of fact, does that not occur in all Court proceedings?",45
200,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I think it does. At any rate, the States are recognising it more and more by providing minimum and maximum penaltiesI n making provision for so wide an area as we have in Australia, it seems to me that magistrates, in adjudicating on cases of default, ought to be guided by the Legislature as to the gravity of the offence. We provide a maximum to show how far he can go, and we consider that there ought to be a minimum, to show that he cannot go below a certain amount. In one provision of the Bill we have made the minimum Â£2 and the maximum Â£200, and in this particular case we made the minimum Â£5 and the maximum Â£50; and, as it is desirable to preserve some due relationship between the minimum and maximum penalties, I propose to amend the clause as it left this House by reducing the minimum penalty from Â£5 to Â£1. With that object in view, I move That the Senate's amendment be not agreed to; but Jhat in place thereof, the clause be amended by omitting ""Five pounds"" and inserting "" One pound."" Motion agreed to. Clause 39After section 57 of the principal Act the following section is inserted:""'57A. (1) Any person who fails or neglects to duly furnish any return as and when required by this Act or the regulations or the Commissioner shall be liable to pay, by way of additional tax, on demand by the Commissioner, a sum of Â£1 for each month or part thereof during which the failure or neglect to furnish the return continues. (2) The Commissioner may, in any particular case, for reasons which, in his discretion, he thinks sufficient, remit the additional tax imposed by this section or any part thereof. (3) If tlic Commissioner considers that the circumstances of any case warrant action being taken to recover the penalty provided by the next succeeding section, such action may be taken by the Commissioner, and in that case the additional tax payable under this section shall not be charged."" Senate's Amendment - Leave out the clause.",45
201,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister ancl Treasurer) [3.24] - I move That the amendment be agreed to. This clause, which deals with the penalty inflicted for a minor default, caused a good deal of debate in this Chamber. A large? number of senators opposed it, and as there was no hope of carrying it, the Minister compromised by agreeing to delete it, and effect an amendment in clause 41, which would render a delinquent in the matter of lodging returns liable to a penalty of Â£1, or 10 per cent, of (he tax, whichever should happen to be the greater.",45
202,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,Capricornia) [3.25] I am much interested in the attitude of the Treasurer. It shows that if honourable members will only bring sufficient pressure to bear on the Government they will back down very quickly.,45
203,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,The honourable member should not make an insulting observation of that kind without some reference to the merits of the question.,45
204,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,The Senate have decided that a penalty fixed by the' Governmentshould be struck out.,45
205,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,They objected to this type of penalty-Â£ 1 per month-for a certain class of default.,45
206,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"On this side we raised our objections to the same thing as emphatically and clearly as we could, but honourable members opposite took no notice of us. The action of the Government would appear to support the contention of those who consider that there should be a second Chamber to supervise legislation passed by what some people .term the Lower House.",45
207,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,The honourable member's argument is that we should get our own way every time against the other House. This is a question of give and take.,45
208,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"My argument, I hope, will induce the Ministry, and those honourable members who follow them so faithfully and so blindly wherever they care to lead them, to pay some attention to the attitude and criticism of honourable members on this side of the House. If honourable members will really be serious about an amendment, and stick to it , they will get their way from the Government. The principle in the clause is a new one. I am afraid that if we attempt to insist that a magistrate must inflict some penalty, the provision will prove abortive.",45
209,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,That has nothing to do with this clause.,46
210,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,It is proposed to make the penalty Â£ 1 .,46
211,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Yes ; in cases where fines are inflicted by the Commissioner, but not where there is a prosecution.",46
212,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"The idea of providing a minimum penalty is a wrong one. The Bill is not consistent. In the provision dealing with employers who fail to carry out a garnishee, no minimum is provided.",46
213,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,This is not a prosecution; the Commissioner levies this penalty.,46
214,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,Why have more confidence in a Commissioner than in a magistrate ?,46

Honourable members will recollect that we had some difficulty in determining whether a man who does not w i l full y make a false return shall be prosecuted. The Senate has taken the middle course of allowing a prosecution although the Department .may not be prepared to' prove that the offence has been w i l f u l , and to put the onus on the defendant to prove that he has acted through inadvertence, a fact which in most cases he will be able to show. The new clause has apparently been copied from the Industries Preservation Act . This is not, perhaps, a very desirable principle of legislation or jurisprudence, but in certain cases it has been found desirable, under the Customs Act, for instance, and the factory laws of the States.

232,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Bass-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.41] - This is the first year of many in which there has been no export of apples from Australia. For many years past the Commonwealth is has been exporting from. 1,000,000' to 1,250,000 bushels of apples, but this year, owing to the lack of shipB ill ping space, tliere is no outlet for The Prime Minister (Mr . acting in conjunction with the Ministers of Agriculture in the apple- I think growing States, represented to the I m authorities that this industry was practically crippled, and offered to supply the Home Government with evaporated apples. The Imperial authorities agreed to take so many tons of evaporated apples at a price of 7d. per lb. Fifty pounds of apples are required to produce six pounds of evaporated f r u it , and the fruit-growers throughout Australia represented to the Government that the price offered by the Imperial authorities was not sufficient to enable them to carry on their industry. The Government, therefore, having regard to the position in which the f r u it exgrowers are placed through being unable to _ export, decided to assist the industry the by offering a bonus of 10 per cent, on dried f r u it .",47
233,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,Will the growers get the bounty ?,47
234,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"The whole of it will be given to the growers in all the States that are interested-no t to the evaporators. Attached to the bounty are certain conditions regarding labour and wages. The bonus is to be paid only for the current season, and must be applied for three months after the date of the shipment of the dried f r u it .",47
235,Mr HEGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,Will people put their money into an industry that may last for,47
236,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,They have already in facts vested their money. At present appledrying is only a struggling industry.,47
237,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"If people choose to put their money into machinery for the evaporation of fruit, that is their concern. Already evaporating machinery has been erected, and I think hundreds of thousands of bushels of apples have been treated in Tasmania. Even with the assistance of the bonus, the price of '7d. per pound will not pay the apple-growers. The last season has been for them the worse on record. Good apples were obtainable in the market at 3s. and 3s. 6d. per case. I believe that there is no precedent for such prices at this time of the year. The representatives of the applegrowing States asked the Prime Minister for some assistance for their industry, cause they have been unable to export the untreated fruit, and because the price offered by the. evaporators is so small, and the Government thought it necessary to give them some help, if only to the extent represented by the bounty.",47
238,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,In how many States are there evaporating plants?,48
239,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"So far as I know, only in Tasmania.",48
240,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Ther o is one at Hurstunder bridge, in this State.",48
241,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,There have been evaporating plants in South Australia for years.,48
242,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,I know that evaporathave been very low. ing plants have been established in Tasmania because of the serious position the fruit-growing industry during the last two or three years. This bounty will be for the benefit of every State which duces apples for export.,48
243,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,Has the Minister guarantee that the evaporators will not reduce the price paid to the growers by the amount of the bounty?,48
244,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,I am certain of because a price was agreed upon before the Government had promised to give bounty. The growers are only to receive Is. 6d. a bushel for their apples.,48
245,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,Has the Minister any idea of the quantity to be dealt with?,48
246,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I know that there has been a good moderate crop in Tasmania Western Australia. this year. One advantage in the evaporation of apples is that second class, or spotted, fruit may be utilized. apples are peeled, and are just as good as the best quality apples'.",48
247,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,If they have bitter-pit codlin moth they cannot be evaporated.,48
248,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,The codlin moth has been almost stamped out of Australia. I wish I could say the same of bitter-pit.,48
249,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,What is the estimated amount involved by the bounty?,48
250,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I think the quantity of fruit to be evaporated on Imperial account is 300 tons, and the bounty will amount to about Â£12,000.",48
251,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"If this is a good proposal, can the Minister explain why its operation is to be limited to twelve montlis 1",48
252,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Yes , because next be- year there may be shipping space available.. I am one of the biggest apple growers in Tasmania, and if I could ship apples to England I would never dream of sending them to the evaporators. The Government are proposing this assistance only to meet the very serious circumstances that have arisen in connection with the industry owing to the want of shipping space.",48
253,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Can the Minister say what will be the return to the growers this provision, as compared with the return to them from the shipment of apples in the ordinary wayl I am aware that, although only the very best apples have previously been shipped, the returns",48
254,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Many growers in Tasof mania have shipped apples to England year after year at a loss.

There are many who have sent fruit to London who have realized splendid prices, and yet the same fruit by a different shipment has that, brought a very poor price.

I understand that the Prime Minister consented that if their frui t did not realise a certain price the Treasurer would come to their assistance to the extent of 9d. per case, the difference in freight between Tasmania and Sydney and Fremantle and Sydney. But this Bill does not deal with that matter in any way.",48
257,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,Will not some financial measure be necessary to give effect to that understanding?,49
258,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,That will have to be submitted later on.,49
259,Mr FALKINER,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,Is the Minister aware that the oversea freight on fruit from Western Australia is probably less to Sydney than is the road and rail freight from the Batlow fruit area in New Soutli Wales?,49
260,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,I am now aware of that.,49
261,Mr FALKINER,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"We have a soldier settlement at Batlow, and it seems extraordinary that the Prime Minister should make a concession to fruit-growers in Western Australia which will place soldiers settled at Batlow at a disadvantage.",49
262,Mr JENSEN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"All that I have to say with regard to this proposition is that even if the bonus be agreed to the fruit growers will derive but very little assistance from it. The position is that the growers must evaporate their fruit or let it rot, because they cannot obtain shipping space. They are forced by the stress of circumstances to send it to the evaporators at ls. 6d. per bushel, and the proposed, bounty of 10 per cent, on that will amount to a mere nothing.",49

He neglected to do so then, and, as the Bill to which his. notice refers is likely to come up for discussion on Tuesday, he desires leave to give notice now. As there is no objection, leave is granted. ADJOURNMENT. RETURNED SOLDIERS: VOCATIONAL TRAINING-FIXIN G OF MEAT PRICES. Motion (by Mr Webster) proposed - That the House do now adjourn!",49
268,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Yarra) [3.57] - In connection with the repatriation of returned soldiers, I wish to mention a matter which has been brought under my notice, and, perhaps, under the notice of honourable members on both sides, by returned soldiers in Victoria. A number of them have been sent, under the provision for vocational training, to the premises in Collins-street of the Australian Estates and Mortgage Company.. They were sent there for instruction in wool classing or wool sorting; they have been there now for a. fortnight, and all^ that they have been doing is picking burrs out of wool and piece picking. They have asked for instruction in wool classing and wool sorting, and have not so far received any such instruction at all. They are not receiving a penny in wages, and as they are doing work for which the company would otherwise have to pay they feel that the company is receiving an advantage for which they receive no corresponding return in being taught any part of the business of wool classing and wool sorting..",49
269,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,The men are being paid by the Repatriation Department.,50
270,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Yes ; they are getting a sustenance allowance, inclusive of their pensions. The man who spoke to me on the subject is a constituent of mine, who was away at the Front for two years.",50
271,Mr WEBSTER,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,-Coul d not the honourable gentleman ask a question on the subject of the Minister for Repatriation?,50
272,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I promised the men concerned that I would bring the matter under the notice of the House. I could not put a question to the Minister for Repatriation until next week. The men feel that advantage is being taken of them, and, if that be so, the sooner it is put an end to the better.",50
273,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,A large number of men are involved.,50
274,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"That is so, because this training will, no doubt, be sought not only in Victoria, but throughout the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner), who knows all about this business, will recognise that if these men are engaged only in picking burrs out of wool and piece picking, they are not learning wool classing and wool sorting.",50
275,Mr FALKINER,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,They cannot pick burrs out of wool.,50
276,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,They say that that is what they are doing.,50
277,Mr FALKINER,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,Then they say what is not correct.,50
278,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"It is quite possible that, from lack of knowledge of the business, they have not accurately explained what they are doing. They feel that advantage is being taken of them, because they are doing work for which they are not paid, by the company, which would have to be done by ordinary tradesmen if they were not employed. At the same time, they are not learning anything.",50
279,Mr FALKINER,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"As a matter of fact, is not every available piece picker and wool sorter employed now?",50
280,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,I do not know. MT. FALKINER - I think the honourable member will find that that is so.,50
281,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"I wish now to refer to the report of the Inter-State Commission upon the question of fixing meat prices. We have been told that Cabinet will meet tomorrow morning, when it will probably arrive at a decision on this matter. But it must not be forgotten that the question of the fixation of the prices of meat was referred to the Inter-State Commission on the Sth August last year, and that on the 3rd October of that year the Inter-State Commission furnished their first report dealing with prices in Victoria. On the 20th December of the same year Messrs. Piddington, Swinburne, and Mills made a report upon it, dealing with New South Wales and Queensland. Yet these reports were not made available until the 25th April of the present year. Now, there is a feeling abroad that this all-important question is being utterly lost sight of by the Government. It will be recollected that at the inquiry conducted in New South Wales a very strong Bar, consisting of eight or ten members, represented the interests of those persons who are concerned in keeping up the prices of meat, whilst the consumers were not represented at all. The people feel keenly upon this matter, and I ask the Postmaster-General to urge upon the Acting Prime Minister the necessity for early action being taken by the Government, particularly in view of the present extraordinarily high prices of meat. As a matter of fact, the report of the Inter-State Commission conclusively proves that today the meat producers are receiving Â£27,000,000 per annum more than they would receive if they were obtaining pre-war prices.",50
282,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"Melbourne) [4.3] - I think that the first matter referred, to by the Leader of the Opposition is worthy of prompt attention. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) and myself have been interviewed by several of the returned soldiers who are employed in this city by the Australian Estates and Mortgage Company. In two instances the men have been station workers for most of their lives, and they thought that the present afForded them a splendid opportunity of learning wool sorting and wool classing. But they say that they are only being employed in picking burrs out of the wool. I trust that something will he done for them. Mr Glynn,- I know some of the students, who are making great progress in that particular work.",50
283,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA NCIVILIANS INTERNED I N,"But , under existing conditions, the men are not receiving a dog's show. Is it worthwhile employing men for eight hours a day to pick burrs out of wool? I would further point out that these returned soldiers aTe only receiving 42s. per week, less their pension of 15s - i h other words, 27s. per week. I do not think they should be kept upon their feet for eight hours a day, especially in view of the fact that the majority of them have been wounded. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.5 p.m.",51
