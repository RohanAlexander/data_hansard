7,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," Is it intended to go on with the recommittal of the Publio Service Bill now ? Because, if so, I would point out that there is a great deal of misunderstanding, and possibly some ignorance, in regard to the provisions of the measure as they have been amended, and I would suggest that it would be better to postpone their reconsideration until honourable members can have a reprint of the Bill in their hands, showing the exact scope of the amendments which have been made.",14
8,Mr BARTON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," The Bill was printed, be a bywith the amendments made up to within a day or two ago embodied in it , and PAPER . although it was not delivered to honourable members as soon as we desired, it has now reached their hands, and the amendments made since then are not numerous enough to justify the postponement which the honourable member suggests.

9,Mr MCCAY,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," The AttorneyA General promised to reconsider clause 6, in connection with the grounds for removto ing the commissioner and inspectors. ' promised, too, to alter the verbiage of graph (u) of clause 7, because I pointed out to him that it apparently enlarged the powers of .the Governor General in contradiction of the limitation placed upon them in clause 6. Then, in clause 28, the word "" appointment"" is used instead of "" employment."" I would ask the Minister for Home Affairs to consent to the recomI mittal of those clauses.  the Minister to agree to the insertion of new clause, which is already in print, dealcipate ing with appeals and the hearing of comI plaints, and I should hke clauses 19 and to be further considered.",15
10,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E, I wish to know if the amendments which it is now proposed to make in Bill are in print. This is not the that we have had to complain of amendments being thrown at us almost without notice.,15
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,We are not proposing to insert new provisions ; we are simply giving effect to promises we have made.,15
12,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"In any case it would be better if a halt were made at this stage, so that we might have or two in which to reconsider the whole measure. I am sure that if that course taken it would, in the long run, save The Bill has been very much hacked about to the present time, though I do not say offensively, because no doubt the Bill has been improved.

I am perfectly certain it would n save time in the long run if the Minister would agree to the course I have suggested. good many members have been away, unfortunately, and they desire to do justice the Bill and prevent any further, recomHe mittal. I suggest that the matter be postparaponed until next week, so that in the meantime we may have an opportunity of seeing exactly what we are doing.",15
15,Mr WINTER COOKE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth that it was quite impossibletofollow the proposed amendments yesterday, and it will be still more difficult to follow them today. am one who does not trouble the House with many remarks on the Bill, but I like to follow what is being done. In that I a found great difficulty yesterday, and I anti-' I shall have equal difficulty today. clo not think this House should send up a 71 Bill to another place which has not been thoroughly well digested, and we should what we are doing.

20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Most of the again. amendments are amendments which have been promised, and there is really nothing new. If there was anything really new there would be reason in the suggestion to postpone the Bill, but the amendments are only designed to put the Bill into the shape it was understood it should be put into on recommittal as we went through the various clauses. I shall include in my motion the additional clauses suggested by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and the honourable member for South Australia, ",16
21,Mr SPEAKER,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Ineednotreadthenuni bers of the clauses the recommittal of which was previously moved by the Minister for Home Affairs.

22,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," Migh t I suggest that the Minister give the committee time to get copies of the Bill. I understand the reprinted copies will be here in a few minuses, and if that be so the Chairman might leave the chair for the time being. Mr - DEAKIN - There are some verbal amendments which ma}' be made first. Clause 1(a) "" Minister"" means the Minister of State for the time being charged with the administration of this Aot, or the Minister of State-administering the department of the public service whereinis emploj'ed the officer in connection with whom the term is used or is applicable, as the context may indicate. (e) ""Officer"" - means any person employed in any capacity'in the public service of the Commonwealth, whether appointed or transferred thereto before or after the commencement of' this Aet.",16
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I m o v e That the definition of the word "" Minister "" be omitted. This is provided for in' the Acts Interpretation Act, and therefore is not - necessary in the Bill. Amendment agreed to.",16
24,Mr MCC AY,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," Migh t not the of "" officer "" in sub-clause (d).give rise to claims to privileges under the Act by can- ]personstemporarilyemployedin.anycapacity?",16
25,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I do not think so, in view of - clause 3, but I will look into the matter Clause, as further amended, agreed to. Clause 5(6) Out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth there shall be payable to the commissioner a salary at the rate of pounds per annum, and to each inspector a-salary at the rate of pounds per annum; asrid the Consolidated Revenue Fund is to the necessary extent herebj' appropriated accordingly. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LVNE) agreed to. That in the first blank the'words ""fifteen hundred "" be inserted. Amendment (by Sir ' WILLIAM LYNE ) proposed'That in the second blank the words ''eight hundred"" be inserted.",16
26,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I do not want to move an amendment, but it is very questionable to me whether the salary paid 'to the inspectors ought not to be £1,000. I dare say the committee would be against - increasing the salary of the commissioner, although it may be very difficult to get a suitable man for £1,500. I do not intend to oppose the proposed salary for the commissioner, but I would point out that the inspectors - will' have very important'work to do. Por such A-position we want a man of the calibre of one of' the best accountants' to be obtained, and a man Of that kind'cannot very well begot under £1-,'0OO a year. These officers may be taken from the civil service, but at the same' time there ought to be the fullest possible discretion in making the appointments. While I am in favour of exhausting the civil service, I do tliink that in this ' sort of appointment, if exactly the man or the whole of the men which we want cannot be obtained from the service, the Executive ought to have the freest possible hand. Each of the inspectors will really be the commissioner for the particular 'State to a large extent, 'although objection has been raised to the term ""sub-commissioner."" I do not know whether there will be 'any opportunity, - should it be found difficult ' to get men tit the price, to bring the matter before 'Parliament again and have the salary'altered elsewhere; but I would - ask the Minister to consider whether a salaiy of £1,000 would not be better than £800. Amendment agreed to ; clause, as further amended, agreed to. Clause 6(J) The commissioner or any inspector majbe supended from his office hy the Governor General fov inability incapacity misbehaviour or incompetence bub shall not be removed from office except as hereinafter provided.",16
27,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I moveThe words "" for inability, incapacity, misbehaviour, or incompetence "" be omitted. A full statement of the ground of suspension has to be laid before Parhament, and a resolution of both Houses is necessary before the officer can be removed. It is pointed out that there might be argument which would Ukely take us to the law courts, whether the grounds of suspension' were included in the grounds set forth-whethe r there was precisely inability or exactly incapacity. Under the circumstances, as this is only power of suspension subject to the will of Parliament, it is certainly safer to omit the words. Amendment agreed to j clause, as further amended, agreed to. Clause 7(c) If except on leave granted bj' the Governor General he absents himself from duby for fourteen consecubive daj's, or for twenty-eighbdays in anj' twelve months or becomes incapable of performing his dubie3; or",17
28,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I move That before the word "" incapable,"" line 4, the word ""permanently"" be inserted. The word "" permanently "" was inserted in another part of the Bill, and this will make the clauses agree.",17
29,Mr BEID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I rsgret that in other parts of' the Bill there is anytliing which makes it necessary to put the word ""permanently"" in here. Whether a man is permanently incapable becomes sometimes a very difficult question. A man may be practically incapable, and yet not permanently incapable. It may be certified perhaps that in two or three years the oflicer-may recover his vigour and capacity, and it could not be said then that he was permanently incapable ; while for the purpose of the duties of his office he would be permanently incapable. I do not-know whether questions cf law could not be raised in this matter even against the Government. Suppose a man is, under tliese words, deprived of his oifice by the Government, under a certificate that he would be incapable for two or three years. Such a man would not be permanently incapable, and we ought to avoid the proceedings .of 'the Executive being brought in-any way under the notice of che law courts. I see the awkwardness of the matter, and therefore I do not press an amendment. The Government may have a further opportunity to consider the matter, and the Minister for: Home Affairs must see that this is an awkward expression which might be usedagainsttheGovernment. Amendment agreed to ; clause, as furtheramerided, agreed to. Clause S1 (2) After considering any such report the commissioner maj' propose to the Governor General any particular disposition of officers and rearrangement or (improved mebhod of carrying out any work which appears to the commissioner necessary or expedient for the more economic efficient or convenient working of any department, and such proposal shall be considered and dealt.with by the Governor General. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYXE) agreed toThat after the word "" officers, ""line 3, the words "" and Offices, and the division, class, subdivision of class, and grade of every officer "" be inserted. Clause, as further amended, agreed to. Clause 9(1) The commissioner shall determine the division, class, subdivision of class or grade of every officer, and shall keep a record of all others showing with regard to eaoh officeihis age and length of service, the office he holds, and his division, class, subdivision of class or grade and Salavy under this Act.",17
30,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I m o v e That the words "" determine the division, class, subdivision of class or grade of every officer and shall"" be omitted. These words properly go in clause S, instead of in this clause, and that is the reason why I propose to omit them here.",17
31,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," It seems to me that our innocence is being taken .advantage of in this relation. The work Of determining the division, class, subdivision of class or grade of every officer, - by the proposed transposition of these words from this clause to clause 8, has been taken from the absolute control of the commissioner and placed under the control of the Ministry.",17
32,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Will the honourable member look at sub-clause (2) of clause 8.,17
33,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Quite so. That subclause states that the commissioner may propose any changes of officers or rearrangement of work. But it is subject to the approval of the Minister. In the other case no such approval was necessary. I took it for granted that what the Minister for Home Affairs was proposing was merely formal. But it is certainly much more than formal.,18
34,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"It is a most vital thing. Mv? WATSON - It seems to me a big power to take away from the commissionerthe determination of actual detail work-and make that determination depend upon the approval of the Minister of the day. That is breaking into the authority of the commissioner to a very large extent, and I do not agree with such a proposal.",18
35,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E, I pointed out when the Bill was being considered previously that we should insist upon the principle of the commissioner being invested with as much power as possible. I trust that there will be no alteration made which will in any way impair the position of the commissioner.,18
36,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,It - has been made.,18
37,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,We inserted the words in clause 8.,18
38,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E, I should like to know from the Ministry whether they intended to effect the alteration that has are been made.,18
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I intended, in accordance with the promise made by the Attorney-General, that the words included in clause 9 should be transposed and placed in clause S. I do not wish to alter the determination vested in the commissioner at all. I do not know that the alteration matters very much, because the commissioner must recommend.",18
40,Mr AVATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"But in the other case he had the power to decide. Sir AVILLI *LM LYNE - Now he must that recommend, and the Governor General decides. But the Governor General cannot decide without the recommendation of the agreed tocommissioner.",18
41,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,There was no intention to lines make any change.,18
42,Mr AVATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Will the Minister promise to recommit the clause t,18
43,Sir AVILLIAMLYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I can assure the honourable member that if it is not altered here, it will be altered in another place.",18
44,Mr AVATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,I suggest that the Minister should consent to the withdrawal of the present proposal.,18
45,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,I have told the honourable member that I will see that it is put right.,18
46,Mr AVATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,But the quickest way to put it right is to do as I suggest and withdraw the amendment.,18
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Then I withdraw the amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Clause agreed to. Clause 10 (Power to summon witnesses and take evidence on oath). Sub-clause (3) amended (on motion hy Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) to read as follows : If without reasonable cause any person, not being an officer summoned pursuant io this section after being paid or tendered his reasonable expenses, neglects or fails to appear, or refuses to be sworn, or to answer any question pufc to him by the commissioner or an inspector, or a member of a board of inquiiy, or to produce all books, documents or writings pursuant to such summons he shall be liable to pay .a penalty not exceeding Twenty pounds, to be recovered by an authorized officer in any court of competent jurisdiction in the State in which such person resides, provided that no person shall be compelled to answer any question which would tend to incriminate him. Clause, as further amended, agreed to. .Clause 13(2) The chief officer of a department shall have and may exercise, and perform such powers, authorities, and duties as are prescribed, or as assigned to him by the permanent head of such department. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM . LYNE ) agreed toTliat after the word ""perform,"" line 2, the words "" under this Act"" be inserted. Clause, as further amended, agreed to. Clause 19The clerical division shall be divided into five classes ; each of such classes shall be subdivided, as set forth infchethird schedule to this Acfc, and the rate of salaiy of an officer, whether male or female, in a subdivision of any such class shall be assigned to such subdivision in such schedule for males or females, as the case may be. ' Amendments (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) That the words ""whether male or female,"" 4 and 5, be omitted, and that the words "" for males or females as the case may be,"" be also omitted. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 20(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act the Governor General may, on the recommendation of the commissioner, fix the rate of salaiy to be paid to an officer at any sum within the limits of the class ov grade of his office, sum shall be the salary attached to such office, ancl such ollicer shall not be promoted to a salary within such class or grade whilst he holds such office.",18
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I m o v e That after the word ""oflicer,"" line 4, the words ""occupying any particular office"" inserted.",19
49,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Perhaps the Minister - would not mind telling us the object of the posed amendment, because ""an officer"" seems wide enough for anything.",19
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"When this whether, clause was under discussion previously i was pointed out that if an officer in Postal department, who was located in the interior, had his salary fixed at a certain amount, there was no particular power that given to increase that salary. The object of the proposed amendment is to give the commissioner power, where it is considered desirable, from any particular reason such as bad climate and so on, to vary or crease an officer's salaiy. Mi"". WATSON - Is there not another provision by which the Government can make special allowances to officers who are in such places?",19
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Yes . point was taken on this clause, and i harmonizes with the other, and, in order that there should be iio conflict, I am advised that it is better to have these words serted.  is a clause regarding the meaning of which a number of the officers of the Commonpower wealth have grave doubts. We were told officer just now that it was for the puipose of ticular raising salaries, but it might also be used a means of lowering salaries, and what the officers fear is that it may be used stultify what we have done in clause 21. should certainly like to know whether the clause could be used for that purpose ? I given to understand that there are certain powers given under the Victorian A c which have been used for many years for that the purpose of reducing salaries, or keeping them down, as the Governor may decide. I would ask the Attorney-General if there any danger of the clause being used for purpose'f",19
52,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Clause 20 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Act, the Governor General may, from time the to time, on the recommendation of the take and Such commissioner, fix the salary to be attached to any particular office, and at first sight it higher looks as if that might be held to override sub-clause (6) of clause 21 as amended Personally, I think the specific provision would override the general provision.",19
53,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The purpose of this be amendment is to meet a difficulty to which attention was called during the discussion of the Bill. It was pointed out that if we propermanently fixed the salary of an officer, and afterwards desired to increasethat salary, the question might be raised having once fixed it, we should have t the power to raise it, and it was urged that the in nearly every case it was not the salary of the officer but that attached to the office that it was desired to fix. It was mentioned in post-offices, where the business is . not growing, there are positions which may be worth £150, or £200, or £ 2 5 0 per year, and are never likely to be worth more, and that a man would have to leave those positions inancl take up one to which a higher salarywas attached in order to gain promotion. _ The salary of the office is fixed, and no increase of salary could be .given to himwhilst heoccupied a particular office. In order that there might be no confusion in regard The to that, the words ""occupying any particular t office"" are now introduced, so that thesalaiy of the officer is fixed only whilst he occupies a particular office. If the inofficer is promoted, as he ma}' be, to a much higher position, then the fixture of -, salaiy no longer obtains, so far as he is concerned. This amendment limits the general of this clause, so that the salary of an-. is fixed only while he occupies a paroffice, and the provision is a very de- as sirable one in the interests of the officers themselves. The question asked by the to honourable member for Bland is whether this I provision will conflict with the provisions of clause 21. As far as the increases of salary am are concerned-the regular increases that are given on the recommendation of the t commissioner-it might. That is to say, if the salary attached to a certain post office is fixed at £ 1 4 0 a year, and a man acting as postmaster obtains that £140, in is order to secure the next increase that this would be given, it would be necessaiy for him to be moved to a position in which he could earn £160, or if any alteration had taken place in the circumstances post-office might be reclassified. I should it that under this clause either one of these courses Would - probably be followed. It ix possible for us. to fix office, andyet place no limitation that would exclude an officer from coming under the operation of clause 21. It applies all cases where tliere can be a .fixture of the with. salary, and, as a matter of practical effect, it applies only to the post-offices of that sort where the offices have a fixed value.  fixed at less than £ 1 1 0 ?",19
54,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,That is another point.,20
55,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Coul d the wordsNotwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the Governor General may, from time time, fix the rate of salaiy to be paid to an ottictsr, &c, in clause 20, be held sufficient to jusThat t if y the Governor General, - on the mendation of the commissioner, in oveiv riding clause 21, and fixing anothersum than £110-? The words I have quoted seem to give power to the Governor General to override clause 21 to that extent.",20
56,Mr TUDOR,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"And;claus e 25, too ?",20
57,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Yes .,20
58,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Certainly ; it is in conflict with it ; it could be used in conflict with,20
59,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The question, is, which of. these two would prevail? If-the Governor General wanted to fix a salary, of- £ 9 0 for a man who had been in the service three years aud had reached the age ofr 21, - i would he have the poweito do it ?",20
60,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,The words the honourable member have quoted show that what he has - stated iscorrect.,20
61,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"^-J think the Minister might insert something that woulcLmake quite clear that the Governor General have no power to override the provisions clauses 21 and 25. We are satisfied with the amendment itself, but, drawn, we cannot deal with the previous part of the clause.",20
62,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The difficulty I this. It is not a difficult matteito plish the object of the honourable member, but I do not like, without more knowledge, to accept.the proposal, for this reason-tha in some of the outlying country districts there might be places at which thejwould fix. the salaiy at less than £ 1 1 0 per and I do not know that; the honourable member would go the length of' saying if the service rendered is only wonth we are still to pay £ 1 1 0 per year. Mr WATSON,-That is just what we the value of;an decided yesterday.",20
63,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"We decided that persons should have a minimum wage, but these are to special cases which we now have to deal",20
64,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Does that apply to conand places tract post-offices ? ' Mr DEAKIN - No , it does not. I do no.t know that, there are any post-offices of the kind I have referred to, but I should not think there are,  offices-that are worth less than £ 1 1 0 .",20
65,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"But are they managed to by officers, or by people who. are not members of the public service in .the full sense ? is a question I - would like to inquire recominto. No one desires to weaken the effect of sub-clause (6) of clause 21, and I do not think, it ought to be done; but I would hke to have an opportunity of obtaining from the post-office,, which is really the difficult department in this connection, a statement as to the circumstances of these post-offices, before we adopt the course suggested. My lionorable colleague, it . the Minister for Home Affairs, will liimself' make personal inquiry as to how the alteration of this clause will affect the post-office service, with a view to giving the House another opportunity of considering the question, and-so that we may take care that whilst the operation of sub-section (6) is not interfered with, we may recast this clause so as to include all cases that it is desired to include. At present we cannot foresee whattlie effect of this operation will be throughout the post-offices distributed over it this vast continent. I can assure the honshall orable member that the amendment now of proposed will not weaken sub-clause (6), and that the matter will be brought before the unless it is withHouse again.",20
66,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The better course will be feel is not to pressthe amendment now, and I accomwould.suggestto the Minister that, onreconsideration, much ofi the confusion that surrounds the clause that is proposed to be t amended might, be removed by changing the wording. It is clear that the office, ancl not the officer, isaimed at, and the wording year, ""shall pay any officer"" brings the eye upon the. officei-, whereas if the words "" with that respect to any particular office"" were used £ 9 0 , they would take the eye - away from the officer and bring it to the point in question. Aftei what theAttorney-General has said we can rely on .having anotheropportunity of considering, the matter; ofcourse we understand that.inip]dcitiy,andl"" will not: say another word about it now.",20
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,I will not recommit anything; we can- .avoid.,21
68,Mr RE OX,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"No one wants that, but there is no avoidingthe performance of the promise-of-a Minister-that , does not coma within the category ofthings that cau;beavoided.",21
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I . will ask the committee to agree to this amendment, and will promise that if the words inserted bear the interpretation that the honourable member foi-- Bland has placed upon them',, of-: if they are not absolutely clear, I will reconsider the clause. If -1 leave the clause, as it stands .1 must recommit it , but not want to do that if there is no necessity ing. for it. There will be no harm in'altering the clause now. in the way I propose, as we agreed fco. can recommit it afterwards if it is found necessary. I will take advice and see that it does-not give the power to reduce the £ 1 1 0 minimum. I do not want to do that. If t clause is amended, I give a promise that if i should be-found to conflict witli the other or provisions. of the Bill I . will recommit i but I do not want to leave the clause - as it stands, because that will involve absolute recommittal. Mir. REID - I am only suggesting to the Minister a course which' I think will be i furtherance of his object. I believe now that if he alters the words in the way I have suggested it may help him to avoid the recommittal of the clause. The substitution' of-the words "" the pay with respect to any"" particular office "" would make it veryclause much clearerthat-the office only is inview, as and riot the individual.  for the purpose, of doing what has recently heen done.in. Yictoria, where a male-officer was receiving £24.0 a year in a particular office, which is now managed by a lady, who re has ceives £84 for doing the same work ? Could of that sort of thing be worked under this partwelve ticular clause 1",21

71,Mr BEID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," The provisions of this, clause - will have to be carefully considered by. the Government. In looking, at it, again, it seems to me.more and more clear that it may be used,, in a way that the Miuister does-not. contemplateto deprive oflicers of increases of .salary. A man might, by reason of increases, arrive at a certain salary, and. the Executive might suddenly reduce his salary to the minimum of his class. Then, undei--the clause, he could not have liissalary increased again so long as-he remained in that office, although, he might be there for some years. I would suggest to the Minister, who I am sure is anxious that the measure should work satisfactorily, to look*, at these provisions againvery carefully.",21

73,Mr TUDOR,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," It is-thought by many that sub-clause (6), as it now. reads, must be taken as applying only to persons the word who may join the Commonwealth service afterfchepassing of this Bill.

74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"If the honourable member will look at the definition of the word ""officer"" in paragraph (d) of clause he will see that the sub-clause needs no amendment.",22
75,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," It seems fo me that the words "" such oflicer"" evidently refer to officers who have joined the service in their youth after passing the entrance examination, and who have worked their way up in the service, starting at the salary of £ 5 0 per annum.",22
76,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I think that if the able member looks at sub-clause (4) he see that there is nothing amiss. The words "" such officer"" in sub-clause (6) refer "" each officer in the fifth class,"" mentioned in service t sub-clause (4).",22

78,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"No ; an officer will get £ 1 1 0 salary. a year under the operation of the minimum wage provision. The effect of the new clause is that the year after he arrives at the minimum wage, his increase of salary shall be only £ 1 0 instead bring him into line with others whose salaries have been increased from £ 1 0 0 to £120.",22
79,Mr MCCAY,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,I am aware that that is the intention; but I doubt if the sub-clause carries it into effect.,22
80,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," There may be some doubt upon the point raised by the honourable member for Yarra, as to whether oflicers already in the service and of years of age will be entitled to a salary of £ 1 1 0 a year.

94,Mr HUME COOK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," The transferred 1 Attorney-Genenal has made provision for a minimum wage of £ 1 1 0 for those who passed from the general division to the clerical division. That is to say, that though their salaries may be more in the division. general division than £110, they will have to be content to take the reduced amount £1.10, until tliey can rise by natural gradathe tion to the amount they were previously receiving. The proposal, I understand, only affects those who come into the service the passing of this Bill. What I desire know is, seeing that the question has been sion. raised by a number of other honourable members, whether the provision also affects those servants transferred to the Commonwealth.",23
95,Mr CROUCH,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Look at clause 6.,23
96,Mr HUME COOK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I am asking the Attorney-General to answer this question them. because it is very important. A number tliose men passed the clerical examination some time ago, and the Attorneylast night introduced a clause giving them the right to go into the clerical division, because they had passed the examination. A number of them are getting considerably more than £ 1 1 0 a year, some of the them as much as £ 1 4 7 , and under the Victorian law they had the right to carry salaries with them when tliey went from the general to the clerical division. I want to know whether such of those men 25 as have been transferred to the Commonwealth service will continue to carry their salaries witli them into the clerical division? Under the Victorian Act 1133 this provision Every person so transferred shall, so far as for promotion is concerned, be placed afc the bottom of the class to which he is transferred, but he shall be entitled to the same salary as which he received immediately before such transfer, and after a period of twelve months 5 in the clerical division he shall be entitled (if such salary be less than the maximum of the class to which he has been so transferred) to the ordinary annual increments of such class until the maximum has been reached.

107,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"And the honourable gentlesorry man was the man who used to worry me most. The. point raised by the lionorable member for. Bourke is one of .very great imConstitution securesto every portance, apart-fiom the fact that I to allude to it . Perhaps I am taking, a been transferred. to liberty in referring to the matter, but it would really be most inconvenient if. the different laws and conditionsregulating promotions-andsalarieswhich prevailed inthan the different States were to followthe officerstransferred to the Commonwealth. AVe would then have several sets of laws working in different ways in reference have different' officers. Tinder one lawa man would get a.certainadvantage whichiajnan That transferred from another State would not get, and that would cause endless trouble: and confusion. There should be some clear statementon. the point.

108,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The sooner the point is understood the better. I believe a number' of persons are clinging, to the belief that-undei-: this Bill thej' will, get the exceptional adthey secured underthe Acts of the different States. It cannot be - too clearly .that the Commonwealth service will he administered on. rules which' apply equally .to - every man, no matter-from what' State he - conies, and .that had. better be understood as soon as .possible. On the other to hand the words in the Constitution Actreserving, all accruing rights are words susceptible perhaps of legal interpretationwell by-and-by, in a sense opposite to that-, in I employ it ; but these are difficulties will have to be worked out. The a sooner it is understood throughout the whole service of the Commonwealth that: a,, once a.man becomes an officer of the Commonwealth .'he is under a uniform .law, and: does not carry with him exceptional, advantages gained in the particular., part-of the continent from which he comes, the better it will be for. the service, and I think for-the .Mr ISAACS (Indi . ) - I should be very if the words of' the honourable and learned member for East Sydney went out withoutany quaUfication. I think the State venture officer in anj' department who has the Commonwealth all his existing, and. accruing, rights; and if in one State he happens to get a higher salaiy at the time of the transferis provided for officers underthis Bill, he still retains that' higher salaiy. That must-beunderstood, it seems to nae* .others wise we clo not give effect to the provisions to of the Constitution securing to transferred officerstheiiexisting nnd accruing rights.. If an officer changes his position under the Public Service Act'of> the - Commonwealth, then of course he takes liis new position with all the surrounding circumstances, but as long ashis positionis not changed, it is impossible to saj' that he is to fall into line with others who come into the Commonwealth-with lowersalaries. Whatever an officer's rights may be in a State, those lights come undiminished into the Commonwealth. But. if men in the general division of the States have these rights preserved 'as appertaining to - the general division, can get further privileges, come under different rules, with newrights ofadvancement under the Public Service Act,' then I do not see that they can say that their rights are infringed when they voluntarily come under an altogether different regime. Tliat is the distinction:.: W it h regard to the officers who have been referred to, it seems to me that there is one consideration that ought to be borne in mind. There are officers in the general division, who have come overfrom the States. Sub-clause -(6) of 'clause 21 provides that every such officer shall be - entitled, upon - reaching-- the age of 21 years, to a salaiy of £ 1 1 0 per.annum, provided that he has been employed for not less than three years in the public service, and shows by passing.the prescribed examination that, he iscapable of doing ithe work. All , therefore, that we. require are three things-age ; length, of service, and capability. Now, there are a. number of officers who under the State laws have already proved' their capability, by reason of having passed, the clerical examination in the States. Having proved that upon one occasion, the Government ought not to .require them to prove it again.",24
109,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,We do not,25

113,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Salary , is not provided in clause 61. M,r. ISAACS' - No ; that, clause relates to the right of promotion or transfer, and does no't speak of salary.",25
114,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"But the honourable and learned member was discussing the examinasurelj tion question. Mr ISAA'GS - Yes , but-I am speaking now of this salary of .£110. I would suggest to the Attorney-General that aftertlie word "" and"" - , in sub-clause (6), the words ""and either has passed the clerical, examination in a State"" should 'be inserted. Mi-: MOGAY - Thos e officers who have passed the clerical examination in the various Statesare getting more than £ 1 1 0 per year, and, if they come overto the 1 clerical division of the Commonwealth, they will carry with them, their higher salaries.",25
115,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"That is another question. I want to make sure of-their right to get at least£110 . I think, as the Bill now stands, it might bo urged - that before an officer is entitled to the £ 1 1 0 per annum he must proveby a future examination his capability of* doing the work. I quite agree that an examination-.should beheld in - a ll cases where men havenofc proved their capability. But where they have shown their fitness by passing the-clerical examination in a State, I do not tliinkthey should be required to submit to a new examination. I suggest to the Government that they should make it perfectly clear that an officer must either show that he has passed the clerical examination h i the State, or must submit to thisexamination.",25
116,Mr HIGGINS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"(Northern Melbourne) I wish to ask the Attorney-General a question which was referred-to the other night by the honourable member for Bourke. I am afraid that after-all-that has been said, an-'offieer who is getting £ 1 3 2 per year in the general division, and has passed an-examination for the clerical division, must be at a great loss fco understand the position which he reallyoccupies. He wants to know whether, if he is transferred to the clerical division after this Bill comes into operation, he will get £ 1 1 0 or £ 1 3 2 . It is a simple question, and one that ought appear? to be answered in this Bill.",25
117,Mr HUME COOK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The other question, iswhether the Constitution preserves to him",25
118,Mr HIGGINS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"That is incidental to it . A man in the general division, who is in for receipt of £ 1 3 2 per j'ear and passes the examination which entitles him to be transferred undei' the existing, law of a State to the clerical division when thereisa>vacancjv wants to know whether he is to retain his present salaiy or not. That-is a question, -, that ought to be answered. If I 1 had to depend on the Constitution, I would not liave the least difficulty in answering it That is to say, having under attained the right to be transferred to the clerical division by examination, I should say that the officer carries with him his present salary. But I should feel a great difficulty in deciding that point having regard to sub-clause (4) of clause 23. Prom the provisions contained there j I should gather that if an officer i.s lucky enough to be appointed j nation to a vacancy in the. clerical division, will obtain only the salaiy which he has I been receiving up to the extent of £ 1 1 0 per year. ",25
119,Mr HIGGINS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Exactly . I think that word "" salary ""? a plain man asking this plain question would be rather between the devil and the deep sea, as between the Constitution and this Bill. It is one thing whether he ought be entitled to that salary, and quite another thing as to whether he is entitled to it. suggest that sub-clause (4) should be altered so as to make it clear that he is entitled his £132.",26
120,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," This is a matter on which I am tunate enough not to have the doubts of the salary. honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. Sub-clause (4) clearly points to the circumstance of a number of men who are at present in the general division, and who are hereafter to be favoured with a new and special method by which, if thej' qualify themselves, they can pass into the clerical division. The whole of the prothe visions in regard to that follow one after another in relation, it seems that particular class of person. For that particular class of person there is if they desire it from the provision of subclause (4). But in cases such as the honourable and learned member speaks of, in which an officer has passed a State seems examination and has qualified for the he transfer, I do not think, under any circumcase stances, that he would come within the sweep of that sub-clause. He has qualified himself already, and clause 61 supplies the only link necessary to make his position quite clear. In clause 61 we provide thatAny officer of a department transferred to Commonwealth and any person in the public railwaj' or other services of a State so transone ferred, who has qualified to take any other tion in the service of a State prior to such transfer shall, in the service of the Commonwealth, retain all the righbsfcopromotion or transfer . possessed in the service of the State at the time the State law of such transfer. That confers a right first of all to be transferred to the clerical division, and there will be no vacancies declared in that division ] until the men in the various States, who I have existing and accruing rights in the | shape of having passed examinations, have been dealt with. These men will be entitled i to priority without any competitive exami; and being entitled to that priority, he ' they take their new positions ou the same terms that thej' previouslj' enjoj'ed, and I am | inclined to think that they carry with them their pwesent salaries. M.r. HIGGINS - Coul d we not insert the",26
121,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I do not think that is necessary, because we have only to make a man's transfer secure by this Bill. Perto sonally I think that was secured under the Constitution. However, that was the one I questionable point, and this clause seems to me to settle the point in the man's favour. to Ifc makes his transfer secure. His transfer being secure, such transfer is governed by the conditions under which he qualifies. I fortake it that that covers the question o I do not know that that clause need be recommitted. I think my honourable colleague will have something to saj' upon that point when we come to the report.",26
122,Mr CROUCH,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," Seeing that this discussion has been allowed, it seems to me that in clause 61 the words "" promotion and transfer"" onlj' are used, while in clause 33 word "" appointment"" is used. I shall 'be very glad if the Attornej'-General will to me, to consider that point.",26
123,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,I will take a note of it ; I no escape quite see the bearing of it .,26
124,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," Wit h reference to the observations made by the honourable and learned member for Indi, it perfectlj' clear that the case to which alludes is not covered by this Bill--tli e of a man who has passed an examination in the State service which would, in that State, make him thoroughly eligible for a salary of £ 1 1 0 , or, perhaps, twice the amount--becaus e the word "" prescribed "" shows that the examination must be one the under this Bill if it becomes an Act, and, therefore, cannot be a State examination or which an officer has previously passed. posiI n a matter of this sort we ought to try to make the position for the officers as he easy as possible, because a man, yeavs after tin examination which he has passed, might he thoroughly efficient, ancl yet be unable to pass a prescribed technical examination, however simple. It is well known that Such cases have occurred, and it would be very hard to subject an officer to another examination in the federal service if he has already passed one in the State service of a sufficiently high standard. Perhaps the Government may be able to consider whether they cannot deal with this matter. I think that the Attorney-General might consider the point. I clo not expect him to do so just now; but it would be well, if possible, to put something in the Bill which would not make it necessary for an officer who had passed an examination in the State, of a sufficiently high standard, to submit to another examination.",26
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"That is in the Bill, if the right honourable and learned member will only read it .",27
126,Mr BEID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"-Well , I have been reading (4) runsthe sub-clause we are on just now.",27
127,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,It is not there; but we been get over that point in a later clause.,27
128,Mr BEID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"If that is done, I am That satisfied.",27
129,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I clo not wish to trouble the Minister too much, but I want to emphasize the point that sub-clause (6) clause 21 does not relate to the quesofficers tion of promotion or transfer, but only to the rights of promotion or transfer. Subare clause (6) assumes that a man is allowed to retain his position on being promoted or transferred. It secures to him the minimum wage, and it sets forth the conditions under which he is to get the minimum - wage. He is to be entitled to it on satisfying three conditions. At the same time, it may impossible for some officers to satisfy these three conditions without further examinareceiving tion, which I say they ought not to be subject to ; ancl i would really press upon to readMinisters the necessity of making it clear that those persons who have passed the salaries clerical examination i u a State require to pass the examination prescribed under the Bill. Clause, as amended, agreed to.",27
130,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I have been misapprehension. I did not' have a new print of the Bill, and when the new clause 21 was mentioned, I thought the whole of stood as it was last night. I mated to the Honourable the Attorney General yesterday that I intended to move an amendment in sub-clause (4), not of clause 21, as it is now numbered, but of clause 23. Perhaps, with the consent of the committee, - I can ' have the clause considered now. Clause 21 was what was before the committee last night, and as no change in the numbering of the clauses was agreed fco in committee, it seems to me that what we had last night as clause 21, we should have had before us as clause 21 now.",27
131,The CHAIBMAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"There are two prints of the Bill before the committee, and clause 21 is the same in both Bills; there is no difference h i the denomination of the clauses.",27
132,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Perhaps , with the consent of the committee, we could deal with the matter now, as I wish to move an amendment on what is really clause 21, but is now numbered in the print before the committee as clause 23. The latter part of sub-clause Such omcers shall be paid the salaries they have receiving up to, but not exceeding, £110 per annum. refers to vacanciesfchafcare filled up in the clerical division, and the Governor General is to have the power to declare the number of vacancies in the fifth class of the of - clerical division, which may be filled by who have served for afc least two years in the general division. The vacancies to be filled by the successful candidates at a competitive examination, and it is then provided that they shall be paid the salaries they have been receiving up to, but not exceeding, £ 1 1 0 per annuni. What I want to do is to avoid the inevitable construction of this clause as it now stands. At present it be is a provision using negative words which would prevent any officer in the future from more than £ 1 1 0 per annum ; and I want to alter the latter part of the clause Such omcers shall on such transfer be paid the they have been receiving up to, but not will not exceeding, £110 per annum. And then I propose to add the wordsAnd thereafter the provisions of this Acfc relating to officers of the clerical division shall under some apply to such officers. Under that provision an officer will start with £ 1 1 0 on the transfer, and then take it promotion the same as any other officers of think I intithe. clerical division.",27
133,Mr DEAKIN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I think that this is observing abundance of caution, because it seems to me that the elause would not have the effect that the honourable and learned memher anticjpates. Having been aware of his doubts,-however, I had (prepared an amendment, but the Chairman was doubtful as to his capacity to submit it under the reference. I am veiy ,glad he is able to submit the amendment now. Motion (by Mr ISAACS) agreed toThat after the - word ""-shall,"" line 1, the words "" on such transfer "" be inserted. Amendment (by Mr ISAACS) 'agreed toThat the following words be added'to subclause (4):-""And thereafter the other provisions of this Aot relating to officers of the clerical division, shall apply to them."" Clause, as'further amended, agreed to. Clause 28(2) No person shall be appointed to the general division whose age at his last birthday previous to - appointment was less than-16 years or (except as hereinafter provided)more than 50 years unless such person is at the time of his appointment already in the public service. In cases Of-special duties the Governor General may, however, on the recommendation of the commissioner extend the age from 50 to 55 years. But nothing in this sub-section shall be taken to prevent the arjpointment of boys of any age above the age of 13 j-ears to be message boys or junior messengers. Amendments (by SixW ILLIAM agreed toThat the word ""appointment,"" in line 5, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""employment."" That the words ""of any age,"" line 11, be omitted. Clause, as further amended, agreed to. Clause 40(1) If any officer is guilty of a breach of the provisions of this Act or any regulations thereunder ; or is guilty- . . of being inefficient or incompetent and such inefficiency or incompetency appears to arise from causes within his 'own GOIItrol: or of using intoxicating beverages to excess; or of any disgraceful or improper conduct: then such officer shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to such punishment as may be determined upon under the provisions Of this section. . . . .  That after the>-wond ""excess,"" line 9, the words ""the excessive use of drugs or"" be inserted.",27
134,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I am'not sure that it would be a wise thing to agree to this amendment. It is veiy difficult to say when a man who is using drugs-arrives-ab-a stage at which his use of them is excessive ; but it seems to me that if a man were in the habit of using drugs to excess he could be dealt with under the provisions of the clause which .gives the Governor General and the commissioner power to dispense witli the services of any officer who - is incapable or unable to perform Ms duties. - Mr MCCAY - The-word s "" bemginefficient from causes within his own control"" would cover the - cases with which the honourable member wishes to deal.",28
135,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," No doubt the object of the honourable .member is a veiy good one, but it would have-been well if he had attempted to deal directly witli the evil which he evidently has in view-the opium habit. I do not think that tliere are likely to be many people in the public service who would come under - a provision of this kind. Then, too, people-have such different ideas about the use of drugs. Persons have been killed by the excessive use of drugs, though taken on the best advice. Men constantly take drugs because of some constitutional delicacy or ailment, or for - some fancied derangement of their constitutions. But the commissioner might be a homoeopathist who would cashier an officer for taking drugs at all.  sume that the commissioner will be a sensible man. I do not propose this amendment without having a precedent for it i u other Acts which I have looked through; but, as the matter is uot one on which it would be wise to take up mucli time, T shall witlidraw it , as there seems to be considerable opposition to it . Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Mr .PIESSE (Tasmania) - We have . . already considered the question of dealing with officers who have become involved hi debt and against whom judgment has been recorded. The honourable member for Bourke discussed this matter at consider^ able length on a previous occasion. I think that it would be a convenient thing to deal with such officer in this clause. I therefore move- That after the word "" or,"" line 9, the following words be inserted :- "" Of having judgments or a judgment given *igainst him for a total sum equal to not less than two months salary which' remain unsatisfied for three months or."" Under tins amendment the chief officer can deal-with any case that may 'arise, instead of it beingnecessary, as it - would have been necessary under some other proposals which have been put forward, to have it referred to a board of inquiry; and, unless he discovers that it is a mafcter of very great moment, he will beable to deal with it at 1 once without'further trouble.",28
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I think it is going too: far to try to harass these individuals in this - way. Public servants are likely to 'get'.into difficulties hke ofcher people. And unless there has been some improper conduct, I do not think they should be placed under this ban. We-provide for the punishment for - misconduct, wilful disobedience, disregard of lawful orders, negligence, carelessness, inefficiency, incompetence, the use of intoxicating beverages, and any disgraceful or improper conduct, so'that they are pretty well hemmed in already. I think that the 'amendment would harass them too much, and therefore I shall oppose it .",29
137,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," Whil e I prefer the amendment <3f which notice has been given by the honourable member for'Echuca, I do not know why a public servant who is charged with persistently refusing to pay his debtsshouldnot berequired toexplainhis conduct. ' Surely we should expect that persons who are in every way safeguarded against the ordinary buffetings of the world should conform'to the first principles of honesty, and pay the debts which they have incurred.",29
138,Mr MCCAY,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Debt s due in most Gases to persons who ai'e not so protected.,29
139,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Quite so.,29
140,Mr MAUGEK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Is tliere not power - now to compel them to do so ?,29
141,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"No ; and unless there is an understanding that the amendment of the honourable member for 'Echuca will be passed I shall vote for this amendment. While doing all we can to prevent injustice to the public servants, we should insist that they shall see that the finger of scorn is 'not pointed at' them because they do not j>ay the debts that they have incurred. In New South Wales, I know of public servantsthough they form a very inconsiderable proportion of the whole service - whose na/mes are a reproach and a by-word where ever' they are located by the State Government. Notwithstanding that* they are in receipt of good .salaries, they persistently fuse ""to discharge their just debts, and we should not allow a similar stain upon the honour of the Commonwealth publio service. - Mr CROUCH (Corio) - I am surprised to-hear the Minister say he willnot'aceept tins clause because he regards it as going too far. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE --We are going too far in-manyways. '",29
142,Mr CROUCH,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I would like to know how far the.Minister proposes to go. When the matter was discussed on two previous occasions, we were informed by the Minister in charge of' the Bili that he was ready to accept some such clause, and this clause has been modified time after time to meet the Government's desires. The Government will not introducea clause; and though the present clause does not meet with the approval of the committee, it might be passed as it ' is , and the Government left with the responsibility, as they have the opportunity on the third reading of submitting a proposal which will meet th© desire of honourable members. I understand that the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca was withdrawn only on the distinct understanding of sympathetic treatment by the Government. ""J| TS'Ir. MCCOLL - On the understanding that it would be accepted.",29
143,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAEN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,I thought the clause was in the Bill.,29
144,Mr CROUCH,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The honourable member for Melbourne says he is under the impression* that the clause was in the Bill. In regard to the words "" disgraceful and improper conduct,"" it was pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Indi that they would not cover the case of a man who refuses to pay his debts. We specially protect public - servants against creditors, and we should give creditors that inside protection which would be secured by some clause similar' to that proposed. Amendment' negatived.",29
145,Mr MCCOLL,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I m o v e That the following words be added fco the clause, to stand as new sub-clause (7)If any officer shall have a judgment or order made against him in any oourt for debt, he shall report the same to the permanent head of the department, with a statement of the facts. The permanent head may if he think fit direct an inquiry before a board of-inquiry as to whether the officer incurred the debt through recklessness extravagance or dishonesty and thereupon like proceedings shall be taken as in the case of an inquiry under this section into a charge of a breach of the re- provisions of this Act. This clause relates to the same matter we have just now been discussing. The subject was discussed at some length the other day, and, though amendments - were suggested, the"" principle - was accepted all round the committee. After considerable discussion the matter was postponed, on the understanding that it would be brought up at a later date, with the entire concurrence of honourable members. The clause does not allow any officer arbitrary power to deal with any public servant, but simply provides that inquiry shall be made whether the public servant has been guilty of misconduct or recklessness.",29
146,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," The essence of this proposal is very much the same as that submitted by the honourable member for  tween the two is that the last proposal made the existence of a judgment for a certain sum, and the fact that it was not satisfied for three months, an offence in itself. That, of course, is not intended, and therefore those who desire to see some such principle in the Bil l did not press it . But the present proposal is merely that if there shall be a judgment or order against an officer for debt, and he reports the same to the permanent head, the latter must look into the matter. If the permanent heads think it is a trifling matter, or one that is not deserving of being sent for inquiry, it will not be sent for inquiiy, ancl the public servant is not necessarily harassed at all. Tf, however, ^the permanent head thinks the circumstances such that tliere should be an inquiry, the public servant in question has the advantage of a board before whom he may defend himself as in any other case.",30
147,Mr MAUGER,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I am most anxious that public servants and all other servants should pay their debts, but I am also anxious that they should not be unduly harassed. I should hke to know from the Attorney-General, or from the honourable and learned member for Indi, how this clause would affect judgments already recorded ?",30
148,Mr AVATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The words "" shall have "" mean "" in the future,"" after the Bill comes into operation.",30
149,Mr MAUGER,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"If that is quite clear, do not see the same objection as I did to the clauseBut I think society and the Government are largely responsible, because civil servants are badly paid, and paid under conditions which encourage rather than discourage debt. Low paid civil servants will be just as much affected as highly paid civil servants.",30
150,Mr RONALD,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Southern Melbourne) I sincerely hope the amendment will not be accepted by the committee, because it makes an invidious distinction. It puts a brand on the public servants which I do not think they deserve, and it will hit the small men as well as the large men. It places an invidious distinction on people .who do not merit it, and I hope the power will not be given to place the permanent head in the position of a magistrate, to sit and adjudicate in cases already decided. The permanent head has already too much power.",30
151,Mr AVATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The permanent head does not adjudicate, but sends the case for inquiry if he thinks it serious enough.",30
152,Mr RONALD,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The permanent head has to adjudicate upon the question whether there is reason for an inquiry, and I saj' that too much power is placed in the hands of one man. If the permanent head has a ""down,"" to use a vulgarism, on a particular man, he will be only too glad to take advantage of this opportunity, and we ought not to place such weapons in the hands of any man.",30
153,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The public servant has to report the matter himself-h e has to be informant, defendant, and occupj' several other positions.",30
154,Mr RONALD,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"If the public servant didnot report the case himself it would be reported in the newspapers for him. It would get to the knowledge of the permanent head, and if the public servant had failed to report the matter-whic h is a delicate thing to do-it would go against him as prejudicing his case. I sincerely hope the amendment will not be adopted.",30
155,Mr TUDOR,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I hope the clause will be accepted by the committee. It places no brand on public servants, but merely asks that they should be put on a similar footing to persons in private employ.",30
156,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,No .,30
157,Mr TUDOR,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The wages of a person working for a private employer can be garnisheed, but the wages or salary of a I public servant cannot be attached. It is only fair that pubhc servants should be made to pay tlieir debts. They are in a better position to do so than 90 per cent, of the persons working outside, and the clause proposed is only a safeguard to tradesmen and others to whom public servants become indebted.",30
158,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,South Australia). - I do not know that a public servant as a debtor occupies a different position from that of any private person.,30
159,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,The Crown cannot be garnisheed.,31
160,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Surely the - ordinary procedure for the recovery of debt in our courts is good enough for public servants, if it be good enough for private people ?",31
161,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,They are not on the same plane.,31
162,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I agree with those who are of opinion that this clause places a stigma on the public servants of the Commonwealth. It is proposed that public servants shall n it only be liable in courts of law as ordinary men for debt-liabl e to the judgment of the court and the seizure of their chattels, whatever they may be-bu t that in addition-they are to suffer certain pains and penalties, and be liable to a board of inquiry and to subsequent dismissal.",31
163,Mr AVATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"If the board finds, as the clause proposes, a public servant deserves dismissal.",31
164,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I am afraid we are overweighting the Bill a little. In trying to provide for ail minor and greater Offences public servants may be liable to, we shall make the Bil l a very unworkable measure. I oppose the proposed new clause. Sir AVILLIAMMCMILLAN (Wentworth) - If I understand theargument of honourable members who are :n favour of this clause, it is that under his general powers the commissioner cannot take cognisance of a matter of this kind. Is that a fact?",31
165,Mr CBOUCH,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,The honourable member for Indi says so.,31
166,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLIAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"If that is a fact, there may be some reason for introducing this clause, although it is a clause I am instinctively averse to. I do not know that it is in any other Public Service Act.",31
167,Mr AVATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,I think there is a similar provision in the New South Wales Act.,31
168,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"No , there is not.",31
169,Sir AVILLIAMMCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"It seems to me that all through this Bill it would be better for us to leave extreme cases for the future. AVe do not want to anticipate this particular kind of thing. To cause fishing inquiries from time to time, even if there be a judgment against a man, must give rise to a great deal of persecution and unnecessary scandal. I think we had better leave this clause out of the Bill. - [132] Although there is no absolute provision by which the commissioner can punish this kind of thing, I take it that the commissioner, in regard to any conduct that is reprehensible in a public servant, can reprimand and warn him.",31
170,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,There is not the slightest doubt that that can be done.,31
171,Sir AVILLIAMMCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I think it would be far safer in the present stage in this new Commonwealth pubhc service to leave the clause out entirely.

By the adoption clause the Government will be able to whether a system of assurance carried on by the State, or the system adopted in South Australian Educational departmentwliich was referred to the other night-i the better. It will be remembered that during the long discussions of which extended over two nights, the matter was thrashed out to the very last straw, and tion. those who voted against the original Government proposal, I understood, would be satisfied with this provision, which leaves the question open for further consideraSociety tion.",32
173,Mr HUME COOK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I must con- "" fess that this clause does not quite harmonize with what we were led to believe we sliould receive from the Government. The Governwithin ment originally proposed a set of clauses, which after a good deal of discussion, they decided to withdraw, with the object of substituting some other provisions which were member not trust the Government, more in accord with the wishes of the comthat the word "" approved"" mittee. But I doubt very much if the wishes of the committee are being carried out under the proposal now submitted.",32
174,Sir WILLIAMLVNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I read these words the other night. - Mr HUME COOK - But 'we did not have them in print at the time, so that could not study them. Witliout wishing annoy the Minister I want to get for the committee what they ask. to insert certain words in lieu of others. The words proposed to be inserted seem to me to give the right to civil servants to assure with any kind of company doing business in Australia-no t merely a. mutual society, but a society which may be partly mutual and partly proprietary, or indeed wholly proprietary. My first objection is that if any compames are to get any of this business, they should be wholly mutual, having then head offices in Australia, and 1 carrying on their business here.",32
175,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Does ' not the amendment in lieu thereof the provide that ?,32
176,Mr HUME COOK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I clo not think so. Sir .WILLIAM LYNE - The word ""apon business in proved "" comes in.",32
177,Mr HUME COOK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Eve n that would I do not believe in the word "" approved "" at ail. It seems to me that the words ""Australian Mutual L if e Assurance Society"" would give any proprietary or foreign companies a chance tothey do business.

Mr HUME COOK - I clo not thinlc we .we should allow any business to go to through a proprietary company when all these profits are earned in Australia. It is proposed I am not here to help anything that is not Australian, and under these circumstances I propose to ask the Minister to accept the words suggested in lieu of those he is proposing. I do not wish to annoy or worry him, but there is such a vital - principle at stake that we must ask for further consideration of the subject. I am making these few remarks prior to the words being omitted, so that the Minister may amend the form of the words he proposes to insert.",32
182,Mr OMALLEY,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I earnestly hope that the Minister will not adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Bourke. The honourable member desires that the civil servants should have no scopej but that they should be prevented from assuring with any companies who have their head offices in foreign countries. There might be only one Australian company that could be approved of, and, in that case, civil servants would be bound to insure witli that company. A few years ago, nearly all the inter-State banks, that had not head offices in London from which they could draw money in times of crises, had to reconstruct.",33
183,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Not nearly all. There was the Bank of New South Wales, in Sydney.",33
184,Mr OMALLEY,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,W it h its head office in London?,33
185,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,No .,33
186,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The head office has been in Sydney for 70 years. ' Mr OMALLEY - The Bank of Australasia"" has its head office in London.",33
187,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,And the City Bank of Sydney was another which did not reconstruct.,33
188,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The only two banks, with their head offices in Loudon are the Union Bank and the Bank of Australasia.",33
189,Mr OMALLEY,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The Bank of Australasia and the Union Bank, which had their head offices in London, poured monej into Australia by eveiy ship ; but the banks that were tied up here could not go to England life assurance. to get any money, and they had to reconstruct.",33
190,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Not at all.,33
191,Mr OMALLEY,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Le t us, in trying to justice, avoid becoming tyrants. We invited these foreign insurance companies to come Australia and to put up their deposits, and they have invested large sums in buildings that are ornaments to the southern hemiswhich phere. If tliese companies can comply with the conditions that the Minister has spoken about we shall have them that they cannot do business with Honourable members call themselves Britishers tralian banks did not reconstruct. and lovers of fair-plaj', and everywhere we hear British fai r-play spoken of and applauded, but I would ask if this is British fair-play ? It seems to me that it is Australian tyrannj'. We should, tell these companies that thej' are not fi t to do business at all, and shut them out, or else let them come here smd do business with the same freedom as do local companies. We have no right to restrict the civil servants in their choice of an assurance company, or to saj' that thej' must not insure their lives with a companj' having its head office outside the Commonwealth. Supposing that one of the Australian companies removed their head' office to London, would it be said that the civil .servants would have no right to insure with them. I hope the committee will deal with this matter fairly, so that we shall have no reason ever to get on the stool of repentance and wish that we had never been born, because we had done an act of injustice.",33
192,Mr WATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I trust the Government will see their way to amend their suggestion. I understood from the Home Secretary last night that, although he could not then give a definite expression of opinion about restricting assurances by civil servants to mutual life offices, he would consider that aspect of the matter, and I was hoping that this afternoon he would have seen his way clear to adopt that view. I would not care to register a vote in favour of civil servants assuring with any proprietary concern.",33
193,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Will not the words in the proposal secure that object ?- "" Australian Mutual Life Assurance Companj'"" ? - Mr WATSON - Then there are the words, ""or as may be prescribed.""",33
194,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"--Thos e words are' not intended to apply to anj' societj', but are designed to give us another .method of 7 dealing with the matter b j ' means of State",33
195,Mr AVATSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Unde r those circumstances I am inclined to concur with the Government proposal. Ini regard to what do has been stated by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, I would like to to say that there is no analogj' between the Australian life assurance societies and the Australian banks - even if it were true, it is not, that all of the Australian banks reconstructed during the big crisis.",33
196,Mr OMALLEY,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Nearly all the interno right to tell State banks did. us - Mr WATSON - No , several, of the AusApart from that, however, tliere is this big distinction, namely, that the assurance societies make advances only on freehold properties, - whilst the banks carry on bill discounting, make advances on other securities, and do a business which is necessarily more risky than that carried on by the assurance societies. I shall support the Government in this matter.",33
197,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I understand that what we are doing in this matter is entirely provisional. At the same time. I see a great difficulty in determining the class of offices to be approved of. There are some societies which are to a very small degree proprietary, but which are really mutual, and it would be a very difficult thing to give a definition which would include the strong societies without also including some very weakkneed ones. In voting for this clause we should take the assurance of the Government that it is simply intended to bridge them over the intermediate period, and that they will take every care to introduce, as soon as possible, legislation to deal with these life assurance institutions. If legislation is passed in the future, and tliere are offices with head offices abroad which have practically located themselves here, and have practically become numbered among our Australian institutions by giving every possible safeguard to the public in the form of putting up deposits and showing that they have assets sufficient to provide for every possible claim, they should be treated, so far as our business is concerned, on exactly the same footing as the purely Australian societies. I think that for present purposes we shall be proceeding on safe lines if we restrict our operations to the mutual offices, leaving the Government to do justice by introducing legislation as soon as possible to any of those stable foreign institutions whose fame is world-wide. Mr Reid(EastSydney) - I endorse what has been stated by the honourable member for Wentworth. I would most strongly object to this limitation to Australian societies if I did riot take the same view as the honourable member-that at present the societies which have not their head offices here, are not under a sufficiently regulating law, whilst our own societies are to a certain extent. Our own societies, from the very fact that their head offices are here, carry on business under better conditions for us than do societies whose head offices are in foreign countries, and, therefore, in the absence of any law relating to such societies, I think we might accept this proposal, but on the distinct understanding that when other societies which have offices abroad are placed under a proper law which will safeguard the people who do business with them in Australia, they will be brought in on the same terms.",34
198,Mr HUME COOK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,What is the honourable member's view as to the words proposed-as to whether they restrict us to mutual societies ?,34
199,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The Government will be in a position to practically interpret these words as - they like. They will be in a position to accept policies which may not strictly come within this meaning. I should think it was most difficult to say what sort of arrangement as to proprietary interests would take a. society outside the words of the clause. If the dominating principle of the society is mutual, the fact that"" a few persons have a proprietary interest in it would not deprive that society of the right to be registered. That is not; however, a matter we are called upon to decide at present. The society contemplated here must be a society whose dominant character is mutual.",34
200,Mr WILKINSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I cannot see my way to assist the honourable member for Bourke to bring about a monoply such as he has proposed. It appears to me that there is another difficulty confronting us, and that is that some of the officers who are appointed to the public service may have already become assured, and it would be manifestly unfair, if, in the event of these people being assured in a society of which the Government did not approve, they were made to surrender their policies, in order to take out fresh ones in societies approved by the Government. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - This is only for the new men.",34
201,Mr WILKINSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Some of the new men may be already insured.,34
202,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"That could be satisfactorily arranged, and no hardship will be inflicted in any case.",34
203,Mr WILKINSON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,I hope tliere will be no possibility of that kind under this Bill.,34
204,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," The honourable member has raised a question of great importance which did not occur to me. The words are mandatory. They apply not only to probationers but to every officer"" every officer shall effect.""",34
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,The provision sufficient elasticity to pi-event hardship in this respect.,35
206,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I am sure that the Government would not compel a man to assure twice even though they had to go to the length of breaking the law ; but the expression is arbitrary and speaks for the future, and it pays no regard to the fact that a man may have already assured.",35
207,Mr OMALLEY,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I rise to bore you again, Mr Chairman, to take exception to a statement of the Minister, that local assurance companies stand in a much better position than do companies whose head offices are out of Australia.",35
208,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I knew the position of local assurance companies, but that we could not know the position of foreign companies.",35
209,Mr OMALLEY,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Will you permit me, sir, to say in my humble, democratic way that my honourable friend is suffering from a multiplicity of delusions in regard to assurance companies. Before an assurance company whose head office is not in Australia can commence business here, it must deposit a certain amount of money with the State Treasurer, and must bring from the country in which its head office is situated a statement as to its standing there, which secures an independent valuation of its position which we clo not get in regard to Australian companies. I admit that the directors of the Australian companies are all honest, saintly men, but in 1893 I saw institutions, whose operations had upon them the stamp of these Australian saints, go down, and, consequently, I now like to have the statements of these saints endorsed by other saints.",35
210,Mr HIGGINS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Northern Melbourne) l f honourable members look at clause 43 they will see that .this part of the Bill which deals with life assurance does not apply to existing officers or to transferred officers. It applies only to future officers. I think, therefore, that there is no danger that existing or transferred officers will be prejudiced by the clause.",35
211,Sir WILLTAMLYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,But what the honourable member for Moreton was referring to was the possibility of an officer being appointed to the service who is already assured in some company not prescribed by the Government.,35
212,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"What does the Government propose to do in such a case ? has Sir WILLIAM LYNE - In my opinion, if the Government was not content to accept his assurance with another company, and it would not be possible for the man to transfer his policj' to a prescribed office, the Government should assure him",35
213,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"And how does the Government propose to meet the case of men transferred from the service of a State who, by contributing 4 per cent, of their salaries, are entitled to certain allowances upon retirement ?",35
214,Sir WILLTAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,Thos e cases are dealt with in a clause which I inserted yesterday.,35
215,Mr HIGGINS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I was referring to a said that we difficulty which, I understood, was raised by the leader of the Opposition, who seemed to be afraid that the clause will affect existing officers. I do not think that it will.",35
216,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,But what about new officers?,35
217,Mr HIGGINS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The clause affects only new officers. I think, however, that the form of wordswhich is used is not such as should satisfy those who have expressed themselves strongly upon this matter, because the clause as it is framed practically gives the Governor in Council power to prescribe any assurance office, even though it may not be an Australian Mutual Office. It readsAn assurance on his life, either with some Australian Mutual Office or as may be prescribed.",35
218,Mr BARTON,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,I think that that provision is quite sufficient for what is re- .quired. The Governor General in Council would not dream of prescribing other than Mutual Provident Societies whose head offices were in Australia.,35
219,Mr HIGGINS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I think it would be better to put the provision into this formAn assurance upon his life with some Mutual Office having its head office in Australia as may be prescribed. I do not know what an Australian Mutual Office is, and I agree with the honourable member for Bourke that what should be insisted upon is that the head office of any prescribed institution should be situated in Australia. But it might be held that the term ""Australian Mutual Office"" did not apply to an assurance office carrj'ing on business whollj' in Tasmania or wholly in Yictoria. I think that a better expression would be- "" A Mutual Office having its head office in Australia."" Tliere would also be great difficulty in interpreting the expression "" Mutual Office."" There are many so-called mutual offices which are worked on nonmutual principles-proprietar y offices such as the honourable member for Wentworth has referred to. It is not the intention that offices such as those should be prescribed, but only offices whose operations are carried on solely upon the mutual benefit principle.",35
220,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I wish to say a word or two upon a matter which has not .yet been referred to. I wish to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the clause which we are now considering will leave the public servants of the Commonwealth in a position of danger such as has proved a great source of loss to the various State Governments. The Bill provides that officers must retire at a certain age, or that under exceptional circumstances they may he allowed to remain on a year or two longer, so' that where an officsr has not been transferred from a State service, bringing with him pension rights, he may be suddenly deprived of his income - Although his life will be assured, that gives him no provision for subsistence, and in the States i the experience that so many distressing cases arose under those circumstances that the Government Estiniates were filled with special allowances to old officers whp were practically out in the streets, and for whose support members were called upon to vote from motives of sheer humanity. The Bill, . as introduced, contained a provision under which officers would purchase annuities to take effect upon the event of their retiring at a certain age, but the Government have substituted for a provision for an annuity coupled with life assurance, a provision for life assurance only, so that the Common. wealth Government may in the future find - its finances exposed to derangements on account of grants to public servants which the experience of the States should have led us to provide against. It is too late now to go into the matter at any length, but I wish to express - my very great regret that the Government have dealt with the matter in such a way that no substantial good will accrue to the public from this provision. A provision for life assurance is a good thing for the wives and children of the public servants, and we are all very glad to see that something has been done in that direction ; but the Commonwealth Government will be exposed, as the States Governments were exposed, to the risk of having to provide for old officers who may be sent out into the world witliout means of subsistence.",36
221,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Do not the words "" provide for such benefits as may be prescribed"" cover the ground ?",36
222,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"That is a later phase of the matter. The present phase is "" an assurance on his life.""",36
223,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"""An assurance on his life,"" "" or as may be prescribed providing for such benefits.""",36
224,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,That points to a subsequent system.,36
225,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,No . It masses together all the benefits in the previous clause.,36
226,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"But does the honourable and learned member say that those later words do not referto the prescribed system, and the other words above to an assurance on life?",36
227,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"They refer to an assurance on life, with benefits as may be prescribed.",36
228,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I read the clause as refert was ring more to the. system which the Government has hinted at as one which they will establish- a Government system. Of course, if the Government under these words can prescribe tliose otlier benefits, then the words are rather misleading, to say the least of them. The ordinary'public oflicer will read those words to mean a Ufe assurance, because the benefits imply, in this case, sacrifices. That is to say, the person whose life is assured, if there be a right to an annuity, will have to pay a great deal more. The matter is left in a most misleading way for the public servant. I do not much care, so long as the Government can, under the words, include each object, even in life assurance with a society.",36
229,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,I should think that is the intention.,36
230,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"If that is carried out, I do not mind ; but the annuity is the thing we should keep in view.",36
231,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," All this debate shows that after this Bill has passed the Government will have to take the whole question of life assurance into consideration, and will also have to try to make a homogeneous system throughout the service. I do not know whether it is the same now in New South Wales as when I was in Parliament there; but then there was simply a pension, and if a man retired at 60-years of age and 4 died at 61, his wife and children got nothing. I understand that a transferred officer from New South Wales, say a man of 40 years of age, will be exactly under that system ?",36
232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,The Superannuation Act?,37
233,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"The moveSuperannuation Act. The Commonwealth will - simply debit the State, or the State will contribute a certain amount; but the man will be under that inherently bad system of New South Wales. All T have to say is that I think the Government will have to keep a very open mind after the Bill is passed, in the face of the discussion that has takenplace, to deal with the service and all its complexities as a whole, and bring about some homogeneous system. - Mr CRUICKSHA NK (Gwydir) - There is one point on which I would like to be clear. Does this clause affect the old-age pension scheme? Would an officer 65 years of age, who had an annuity, receive an old age pension ?",37
234,Mr FE MCLEAN,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,If he were otherwise entitled to it.,37
235,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"If the man is in the possession of ah income of a certain amount, from whatever source, he will not get an old-age pension.",37
236,Mr CRUICKSHANK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,But suppose he were otherwise entitled ?,37
237,Sir WILLTAMLYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"If a man were otherwise entitled to an old-age pension, he would not be in the service. If he were in the service, and receiving pay, he would not get a pension.",37
238,Mr HUME COOK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I m o v e That in the proposed amendment, the word "" Australian "" be omitted. I propose to further amend the proposed amendment by inserting after the word "" society"" the words ""having its head office in Australia and.""",37

244,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"I suggest to the Minister that in- the proposed words should be inserted after sub-clause (2), because that sub-clause has close reference to sub-clause (1). Sub-clause (2) provides that whenever any of the holidays set forth h i sub-clause (1) falls upon a Sunday, they shall be observed upon the following Monday; and it would be well to make a new sub-clause of the words proposed, and insert them after sub-clause (2).",37

247,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I think it is a - very bad form to adopt to refer to any particular section. In the passage of the Bill through the two Houses it is more than probable that the numbers of the clauses will be altered. If the Minister by the words ""section 4 4 "" means to refer to "" l if e assurance "" it would be better to insert the words. Sir AVILLI AM LYNE - Perhaps that would be better. I therefore move That the words "" section 44 "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" this Act relating to life assurance."" Amendment, upon the amendment, agreed to. Clause, as further amended, agreed to.  That the following stand a new clause in the Bill :Any oflicer feeling aggrieved by anj'determination made under this Act affecting such officer's position infcheservice, or his paj', or any promotion or transfer, to which he may consider himself entitled and desiring to appeal from, or to make anj' complaint in respect of anj' such determination shall make such appeal or complaint to the commissioner in such manner and within such time as maj' be prescribed. I think this provision will carry out what many honourable menibers are desirous of seeing in the Bill. That is to say, it will provide a means whereby any officer who feels himself aggrieved by any determination under the Act can have recourse to an appeal to some constituted authority. Bufc while this new clause will give the opjiortunifcy which any aggrieved oflicer should havej hope it will have the further effect of preventing officers from travelling outside that constitute'd authority to air their grievances. If such a provision is adopted it will be a part of this Act, andany departure from its terms will be a breach of the Act, and will bring the offending officerunder the penalties which such a breach imposes.",38
248,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,What does the Government say to this proposal ? SIR WILLIAM LYNE - I accept it .,38
249,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I should like topoint out some practical difficulties whichsuggest themselves to me. Does the honourable gentleman allow an appeal to the commissioner from the Governor General,, because that is what this proposal means ?",38
250,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"No . My objectlast night was to allow of an appeal to the commissioner before the commissioner made his recommendationfcothe Governor General. If the clause is not worded to carry out that, intention we must alter its wording. I thought that that was the idea which the honourable and learned member for Tasmania,  allowed an appeal to the commissioner after the Governor General had dealt with any matter that would be allowing an appeal from the Governor General to be decided by the commissioner, which of course was. never contemplated.  suggested would be a very awkward one nodoubt, but we are in that posifcion at present.. If civil servants appeal to the commissioner,, after the Governor General has dealt with move- their cases, they will be met by the commissioner saying-""This has been the subject of an appeal to the ' Governor General and I cannot consider it . "" . Civil', servants ""now have an appeal from the determination of the Governor -. General. They can bring political pressure to bear even after the determination of the Governor General, so that by adopting the proposal which I have submitted we should not be * giving any more liberty to civil servants than they at present enjoy. The answer to the honourable and learned member for Indi is that whenever an appeal is made against the Governor General's decision.a commissioner would say-""Icanno t re-open the matter, the appeal is decided."" But other appeals, which would not come under that objection, would still be open to the public service. Without some such provision we shall still allow civil servants, who have grievances by reason qf any executive determination to come, as they hitherto have done, to Members of Parliament, and the whole trouble we are trying to prevent will still be open. I hope that the clause will be accepted as it stands.",38
251,Mr HTJME COOK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," I think I am largely responsible for this suggestion regarding an appeal, and I understood that the Ministry were going to put forward a proposal of their own. If the new clause submitted by the honourable and learned  the case, well and good; but I think that the honourable and learned member for Indi has raised a very serious point. - It appears to me that the new clause is somewhat adverse to what, we desire to carry out. Like the honourable and learned member for Tasmania, I want the members of the public service to have a right of appeal which will obviate the ear-wigging of Members of Parliament, and our having individual grievances ventilated upon the floor of this chamber. I have seen hours and liours wasted in this House upon a discussion of the grievances of some railway porter, simply because he had no decent tribunal to which he could appeal. If a proper tribunal were established to which oflicers with grievances Could appeal, we should save an immense amount of time, - and when Members of Parliament were approached, they would be able to say to the civil servant- "" Use the machinery provided for you in the Public Service Act, and when you have exhausted that, let us hear what you have to say."" Sir WILLIAM .LYNE - What is the honourable member's proposal ?",39
252,Mr HUME COOK,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,I have no proposal; the question is too complicated for me as a layman.,39
253,Mr REID,COMMANDANT FOR TH E," The object of the clause is so good, that we should try to remove the objection that has been raised against it . Really, it is only in point of form that the Governor General may be said to have arrived at a determination. It would be well, perhaps, to amend the form, to prevent incongruity. I should prefer the use of the word "" dissatisfied"" to that of '' aggri eved,"" in connection with any determination or recommendation of the commissioner;",39
254,Mr ISAACS,COMMANDANT FOR TH E,"Instead of "" determination,"" why not use the words ""report or recommendation,"" which will mean either the permanent head or the commissioner %",39

Clause agreed to. Bill reported with further amendments. NA RECOGNITIO NBILL . SECOND READING.",39
256,Mr DEAKIN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," T move That the Bill be now read a second time. This is perhaps the simplest Bill that has been, or is likely to be, brought beforo us. It provides for the recognition throughout the Commonwealth of"" the laws, the public Acts and records, and judicial proceedings of the States. As such it is practically an Evidence Bill, and is introduced under the specific power conferred by section 51 of the Constitution, sub-section (25), which empowers the Parliament to legislate in this direction. In this one particular we are authorized to determine in part, at all events, the procedure of State courts, and hence this measure relates to the whole of the proposed federal courts of the Commonwealth, from the High Court downwards. Generally speaking, we should have no power to deal with State courts, but in this measure they also are introduced. As honourable members will see, the Bill ciiibraces clauses which have heen taken from the English and State Acts, and, in one case, I think, from an A ct of the United States. We provide for judicial notice of certain documents, of certain signatures, and of other matters. The measure is one purely for consideration in committee, because, beyond the fact that the clauses are collected together for a common purpose, they necessarily embrace Separate subjects or separate stages and matters of procedure, - and under these circumstances I should . be detaining the House if I were now - to speak upon points which, if debated at all, will require to be discussed in detail in committee. The marginal notes will help to indicate in most cases the sources from - which these clauses have been derived. - The measure, though very short and comparatively simple, will be found extremely useful, especially as it provides for a uniform recognition of laws and records - throughout the whole of the Commonwealth, by courts of the Commonwealth or courts of the State.",39
257,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," This will no doubt be a very useful measure in many respects, but, although it is true the clauses are taken in very many instances from existing sections in other Acts, it seems to me that very grave doubts will exist as to whether some of these sections, as they at present stand, are constitutional. Attorney-General has pointed out that this Bill comes under a particular power-and that is perfectly true-whic h authorizes the Commonwealth to pass legislation to secure the recognition throughout the Commonwealth of the laws, public acts and records, and judicial proceedings of the States. That is the extent of the power given by the - Constitution, but this Bill will be found to - deal with many private acts, documents, and records. It seems to me, therefore, at first sight, that it trenches toiy, and exceeds the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. In other respects the clauses are adopted from some of the - existing sections in terms which, although perhaps not intended to be so, are departures from the original, and which, as far as I can see at present, - leave behind the original intention of the - section. For instance, it is quite right to say that in one State where a public record is evidence that record should be judicially noticed in another State or proved in a particular way, and that a copy certified to in a particular way shall be evidence of that j>ublic record. That is what is done under existing Acts, but this Bill goes so far, in some cases, as to make a copy of such records evidence' whether the original would be evidence or not. In that respect some words have been' omitted from the existing sections, which keep strictly to the pointI have mentioned. I have no doubt that this has been done by inadvert. ence, but when we come' to debate the matter in committee some light may be thrown upon it .",40
258,Mr DEAKIX,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I will be able to show the honourable member that it is intentional.,40
259,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I need not prolong my ob- servations at this stage. My view amounts to this, that except where these doubts arise as to the powers under which the Bill is framed, the measure seems to be a very useful one indeed.",40
260,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I also look upon this Bill as one which will be a great convenience in all judicial proceedings in the States. A similar point to that raised by the honourable and learned member for Indi occurred to me, but it was more in reference to the use of one word here-the word "" arbitrator."" Of course, where arbitrators act under certain references of the courts, their acts and their proceedings will probably be well covered The by this Bill ; but it is a loose expression, because the word has a good deal more meaning than that. It is capable of referring to arbitration of a voluntary character, and not an arbitration through the courts. I only mention that as a further matter which might engage the attention of the Attorney-General. It seems to me that the Bil l is very well drawn indeed, and will be a very good measure. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and committed upon State terri1>ro fot-md. CUSTOMS BILL . SECOND READING.",40
261,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I moverrThat the Bill be now read a second time. In moving the second reading of this Bill I feel that I am dealing with a very important measure. Though possibly it is not a measure which possesses many attractions to . the general public, it is undoubtedly a measure of the greatest consequence to the mercantile community; and I desire to gratefully acknowledge the various suggestions which I have received in regard to it from representative commercial men. The Government feel that it is essential in connection with the adoption of a uniform Tariff that there shall be a uniform system of administration, for a uniform Tariff might be rendered practically worthless by the absence of uniformity in administration. Uniformity of administration depends upon uniformity - of legislation, which at the present time is, - of course, conspicuous hy its absence. It will be necessary that we shall at the .earliest possible date put upon our statute book laws dealing generally with these questions. ""Various laws will be required for the purpose, but the chief of them is the Bill with which I am now dealing. I have seen it stated that the measure is an exact - coj)y of the Victorian legislation; but I can assure honourable members that it is nothing of the sort.",40
262,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,What harm would be done if it were 1,41
263,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"What harm would be done if it were ? At the same time, it would be strange indeed to find all the wisdom of Customs legislation concentrated in the measure adopted by one of the half dozen States included in the Commonwealth. That cannot be said of the Customs regulation legislation of Victoria, so far as I know. For the purpose of framing uniform legislation, recourse has . been had to the Customs laws of the different States-to the New South Wales Acts equally with the Victorian Acts ; and Canada has not been forgotten, nor has the legislation of New Zealand, and of the United Kingdom. The Government have . been singularly fortunate in being able to command in connection with this measure - the services of the chief Customs officials of - the various Australian States. It is to - them that any credit for the form of the legislation which we propose to adopt will attach, and we cheerfully assume {ill the - responsibility for whatever faults the - measure may possess. In Dr Wollaston, - the Collector of Customs of Victoria ; in Mr Lockyer, of New South Wales; in Mr. - Irving, of Queensland ; in Mr Stevens, of South Australia; in Mr Mason, of AVestern - Australia ; and in Mr Bernard, of Tas- mania, we have found gentlemen capable of - giving us the sagest advice. They met ,- in conference for the purpose of deliberating upon the subject, and the - duty of framing the measure has - been discharged' by them with an intelligence and industry which I am delighted to acknowledge. I - have thought it well in - dealing with this matter not to slavishly - copy any of .the existing systems. These systems have been handed down to us from ' time to time without much modification of the form which they originally possessed. In some instances they have struck us as cumbersome; in others we have found provisions which there is little or no necessity to apply to the circumstances of today ; and we have done what we could to make the Bil l as clear and readable as possible, so that Parliament may place in the hands of the community a measure which will not require legal assistance for its interpretation, but will be' intelligible to the ordinary lay mind. We feel it necessaiy, as a matter of principle, to provide in the fullest imaginable way, consistent with fairness, for the protection of the revenue; but at the same time we have endeavoured to avoid, as far as possible, unnecessary harassing of the mercantile community. AVe feel that the security of the revenue and the protection of the honest merchants who form the great bulk of our mercantile community, against thedevious ways which lax legislation might permit, iind which might subject them to unfair competition, are proper objects to pursue; but where those objects are attained, we desire, so far as we can, to avoid unnecessary interference with the ordinary commercial operations of the community. AVe feel also that the Bill is one which can be more properly dealt with in committee, and one in respect to which no long second reading speech is necessary. Having done our best, we present it for consideration in committee, not with any slavish attachment to line or letter, because we happen to be responsible for its present form, but, despite the jocular criticisms which have been heard from the other side of the chamber, with the intention of welcoming any real amendment which may be suggested, in order that we may do the best we can in respect to a measure which is undoubtedly not a party measure. AAe wish to place on r the statute-book a measure under which all can work, and which, in due course, will be a suitable accompaniment to that uniform Tariff which we hope shortly to introduce, and in respect of which it ' is most likely there will be more room for differences of opinion than exists in respect to this measure. The Bill contains, to be precise, 263 clauses and three schedules; but, for the comfort of honourable menibers, I should like to mention that the clauses are very short, and the Bill more condensed, and, I hope, more intelligible than the legislation of the States which deals with similar matters. It is intended that it shall commence upon a day to be fixed by proclamation. That is provided by clause 2, and honourable menibers can well understand that there will be no unnecessary delay in bringing it into force. It should, of course, precede the final adoption of the uniform Tariff, however much we may and will labour to bring that into force at the earliest possible date. The fourth clause is the interpretation clause, and honourable members will note that a large definition is there given to the term '? Answer questions and produce documents ""-obligation s which in various clauses of the measure are cast upon persons in connection with Customs transactions. Por the security of the revenue, it is highly desirable that the Customs authorities shall be in a position to obtain all necessary information as regards the value of goods and a variety of other matters. This information. cau be secured in two ways-by questioning, and by insisting upon the production of documents. It is to this end that these obligations are cast upon persons transacting Customs business, and the extended meaning which is given to the term is practically this:-That , as regards answering questions, the party questioned shall impart to the best of his knowledge all information which the Customs authorities have a right to know; and as regards the production of documents, he shall similarly produce whatever documents are required relating to the goods in question. The "" Customs "" for the j>urposes of the measure is defined as the Department of Trade and Customs. The next clause to which I wish to call attention is clause 5, which enables me to avoid the necessity of providing time and again, in connection with offences against the measure, that in the case of any contravention of the Clause, on the conviction of the offender he shall be subject to this, that, and the other penalty.",41
264,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The device in the Bill is a very good one.,42
265,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I am glad that the honourable and learned member approves of the arrangement. I think that the repetition which is indulged in in statutes, although hallowed by precedent, is altogether unnecessary, and is something appalling. We have attempted in this connection to make the Bill as plain as can be, by putting at the end particular clauses "" penalty so and so,"" indicating by clause 5 that that is the maximum penalty which attaches totheircontravention.",42
266,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Ye t I see that by clause 34 the honourable gentleman proposes to charge a duty on condensation.,42
267,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"We think that condensation is a duty, that is the reason; but I believe this little innovation will not-at . least, I hope it will not-fai l to commend itself to the good sense of honourable members, and we shall be delighted indeed if by their approval in this particular case they establish a precedent which can be followed hereafter. Clause 5 makes the matter perfectly plainThe penalties referred to at the foot of sections indicate that anj' contravention of the section, whether by aot or omission, shall be an offence against this Act, punishable upon conviction by a penalty not exceeding (except as hereinafter provided) the penalty mentioned. When in the light of a clause of that sort we find, as we do on various occasions at the foot of a clause, a specified penalty, we shall know perfectly well what it means, and there is no need for the idle repetition to which I previously referred. It is quite as effectual and more clear, and it saves time, and strikes the eye as we want the eye to be struck, giving as it does the gist of the provision. The second part of the Bill deals with the administration of the Department of flustoms. Probably it will interest honourable members to know that the Department of Customs, as at present constituted, is responsible for the collection of between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000, and that there are between 1,100 and 1,200 persons employed in the department, or, to be precise, 1,133 persons, while the total expenditure, including cost of collection,' salaries, and everything else, does not amount, though - it very closely approximates, to £250,000. The first clause of Part 2, relating to administration, simply declares that the Customs Acts shall be administered by the Minister of State for the Commonwealth administering the Customs. ""Of course, so far as Ministerial heads are concerned, they come and go. But we make the provision we have already made, so far as this House is concerned, for permanent heads, and on the excellence of the selection of the permanent head of the Customs department much depends. There must be one central controlling head to secure that of uniformity which is so highly desirable in all federal matters. Provision is made for the appointment of this permanent controlling head in clause 7, which declares that there shall be a Comptroller-General of Customs, who, under the Minister, shall be the permanent head of the Customs, and shall have chief control of the Customs throughout the Commonwealth. Here 1 would like to inform honourable members that, subject of course to parliamentary approval, a selection has been made of the gentleman who will first occupy this highly responsible position. When I mention the name of Dr Wollaston as the gentleman who, subject to the conditions I have previously mentioned, will receive this appointment, I believe I mention the name of a gentleman whose appointment will be as acceptable to all who know him, and all who are accustomed to Customs affairs, and have the interests of the department and of the public of Australia at heart, as I know it is to the other collectors of the different States which constitute the Commonwealth. He is a gentleman who will bring to bear in connection with his duties a ripe experience, a keen intelligence, and, it seems to me, all those qualities that should be possessed by a gentleman appointed to a high and important post of the character to which I refer. Here I would like to say that in different clauses reference is made to the Minister, but we hold that.in matters requiring expert knowledge and permanent uniform control, the Minister .should interfere as little as may be necessary-absolutel y necessary. While, of course, the Minister should retain the power which must accompany responsibility to Parliament, he should not at the same time unnecessarily interfere with the permanent head. I do not think that in connection with Customs matters the charge has ever been made, or, if made at all, sustained, that there has been any political influence. It seems to me - such influence would be impossible under the provisions contained in the Bill, and any amendment necessary to prevent it the Government will welcome, so long as the true constitutional position is secured-that those who are responsible to this House should have the necessary power to protect themselves in the proper execution of their duties.",42
268,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Has there not been pressure as to penalties sometimes 1,43
269,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I believe there has, and I think I have seen something of it myself.",43
270,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Not as to penalties, but as to remission of them.",43
271,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I accept the correction. I think that the yarious State Ministers for Customs have experienced the same pressure. I have never previously had the honour of discharging the duties of Minister for Customs, but during the short time 1I have had that honour pressure of the sort has not been unknown to me. At the same time, I should not refer to it with the degree of pleasure and confidence that I do, had I yielded to it in the slightest degree; and I venture to consider and hope that others who are similarly circumstanced have taken the same course.",43
272,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,That would be rather personal pressure than political pressure,43
273,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I do not know what sort of pressure it was, and it is unnecessary to inquire. It did not succeed, and I venture to say that in Australian politics it has hardly ever succeeded. I am pleased to think that, as regards the administration of public affairs, Australia holds a place - and properly so-in the respect of the civilized world for the honest discharge by the public Ministers of all the duties which properly attach to their offices. In clause 8 it is provided that there shall be a .Collector of Customs in each State, called in the clause the, chief oflicer, subject to the Comptroller. The system of the administration has been built up on this: The Minister controlling all, and responsible to Parliament; subject to the Minister, the Comptroller; and, subject to the Comptroller, a chief officer or Collector of Customs for each State. In clauses 15, 17, 20, and 21 fchere are various provisions made for the appointment of ports, wharfs, boarding stations and places for the examination of goods, and for the licensing of carriages and lighters for the conveyance of'goods, subject to the Comptroller of Customs. These provisions are usual ancl, of course, are necessary for the protection of the revenue. Clause 28, which is also to be found in Part 2, relating to administration, declares that the working days ancl hours in the Customs department shall be as prescribed by regulation. Except when working overtime, as permitted by the collector, cargoes shall only be received, loaded, worked, or discharged from any ship on working days, and during working hours. There is further provision that when overtime is permitted, overtime charges shall be made. So much as regards Part 2 of the Bill, relating to administration - Part 3 is of a general character, and, to my mind, gives a bird's-eye view of the scheme which is' properly the foundation Of Customs Acts, and which may be shortly stated. Por the protection of the revenue, imported goods shall, for a certain time be subjected to the control of the Customs, liable to examination by the Customs, for. the purpose of ascertaining their nature, and whether tliey are dutiable or not, and what the amount of duty may be. These goods are to be dealt with by entries, which are practically memorandums exchanged between all the parties interested in the goods and the Customs authorities, and in certain cases the goods are to besubjectto securities, where securities are deemed necessary to be taken by the Customs authorities for the protection of the revenue? These four principles are practically embodied in Part 3 of the Bill-control, amination, entries, and securities. As to control, it is of course in the highest degree important to define when that commences and when it ends, and in clause 30 we find that attempted. It is declared that as regards all goods imported, thej - .shall be subject to the control of the Customs from the time of actual importation until delivery for home consumption, or until exportation to parts bej'ond the seas, whichever first happens : in other words, until the duties are paid, or until the goods are sent beyond the Commonwealth. If the duties are paid the Customs are no more concerned with the goods; if the goods have gone bej'ond the Commonwealth, they cease to be imports. As to goods under drawback, the control of the Customs commences from the time of the claim for the drawback until exportation into parts bej'ond the seas. If a merchant desires drawback in respect of particular goods the moment he makes the claim in respect of tliese goods, the Customs control commences to operate. The Customs authorities have a light to see that those goods shall not be dealt with except in a specified way, and thej' have the right to examine them, and to see that thej' are properly entered, and further to take security, if necessary, not only for their proper export, but in order to see that fchey are not reintroduced. third provision is as to goods subject to export duty. As regards export we have thought it well to make the Bill complete as Bills of this sort are generally made complete, utterly irrespective whether or not we or any one else will ever contemplate the imposition of an export duty. In this respect, the control commences from Mr Kingxtort. the time the goods are brought to a port or place for export, and continues until the paj'ment of the dutj'.",43
274,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,There is an export duty in Queensland.,44
275,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"There may be, but. I think it has been stopped. There wassome rivalry between the sister States of New Soutli ""Wales ancl Queensland, which resulted in some temporaiy expedient of that sort. Was tliere not an attempt to divert trade from the natural channels either one way or the other? Mr R.EID - There was some passing incident.",44
276,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"And I ask honourable members- I am not indicating, and cannot, ex- be expected to indicate one way or another - no t to attach importance to what thej' find, in the third paragraph of the clause. At the same time it is desirable to make the Bill complete in the first instance, in case it should ever enter the head of this or any. 1 other Government to impose anything in the shape of an export duty.. I hope and believe that the grouping in Part 3 of these general clauses relating to Customs, control, examination, entries, and securities generally, will enable honourable members to appreciate-as I can assure them it has enabled those who have been connected with the preparation of. this Bill, to appreciate-the chief underlj'ing principles declaratory of the precautions which are necessary for the securitj' of the Customs revenue. It is declared that when goods are subject to control thej' shall be. liable to examination. It is also declared that entries may be made and passed, and there is a further provision for taking securities for compliance with the Act, ancl a declaration that in regard to a matter in which a good many of us at one time or another have been interested-thoug h of course Inter-State matters will not be - of the same importance i i i the future fchafc thej' are today - passengers ' baggage may be imported or exported subject to any prescribed conThe ditions without entiy. Clauses 44 and 45 have been inserted at the suggestions of the duty Customs authorities, and provide for. a simple and general form of Customs, security, and endeavour to dispense, ofso far as is possible, with the varied and cumbrous forms of Customs securities which are at present in use. Part 3 gives a general vjurview of the provisions of the Bill. Part 4 deals with importations, and declares that the importation of certain goods shall he proh ibited. Honourable menibers generally are no doubt familiar with the usual provisions in this respect relating to the infringement of copyright, false money, obscene works, oleomargarine, butterine, &c. Then there is a general power over all goods which have any false warranty on them, and all goods the importation of which may be prohibited by proclamation. Exhausted tea is also a prohibited import, as is another class r f goods which of course it is more easy to provide against in the words of a statute than it may be to practically enforce-the importation is prohibited of all goods manufactured or produced, wholly or in part, by prison labour, or which have been made within cr in connection with any prison, gaol, or penitentiary. I 'believe that that provision is to be found in the Canadian Act. Mr AL . SOLOMON - But in none of the 7 existing State Acts ?",44
277,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I think not; it was taken from the Canadian Act.,45
278,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Is it not in the English Act?,45
279,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,la m not so sure about that. I know that it is in the Canadian Act.,45
280,Mr CROUOH,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It was passed in England two years ago.,45
281,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I am obliged to the honourable member for Corio for the information. After defining what goods are to be prohibited from importation, the duties of the ship master are declared. He is not to bring liis ship into any place other than a port. He is to bring-to when hailed by the Customs. Even if he is not hailed lie has to bring-to at the proper boarding station. He is liable to be boarded by the Customs authorities. The Customs authorities have full power of search. It is also the ship master's duty to report the cargo, the merchant makes entries in respect of the goods, and the goods are unshipped, landed, and examined in a specified way. They may be landed and entered for various purposes-for home consumption, which is the simplest form' of duty that is paid. Precautions are taken to prevent goods being smuggled in the course of transshipment. They may be landed also for warehousing, the duty not being paid, the goods becoming in the ordinary acceptation of the term bonded goods. If bonded they may lie bonded in a general warehouse to be used for warehousing goods generally'; in a private warehouse to be used only for warehousing goods, the property of the licensee : in a machinery warehouse, to be used only for warehousing machinery and similar heavy or bulky goods; or in a manfacturing warehouse, to be used for warehousing goods for use in any manufacture, trade, or process, and for carrying on in such warehouse any manufacture,, trade, or process which the M in ister may by Gazette notice declare that it is desirable to encourage. There are already in different States manufacturing warehouses in operation. It is proposed that the power of establishing these warehouses shall be extended and made uniform throughout the States. If established and utilized, facilities will be given for the use of the imported goods in connection with any local manufacture, which venture to hope and believe will be useful in the extension of Australian industry. Anyway, a large power is taken for the necessary purposes. Then there are provisions for the proper taking of the accounts of the goods before they are warehoused, and for giving a receipt to the party interested. It i.s provided that the duty of the licensee of a warehouse is to keep the goods secure, and to enable the Customs authorities at all times. to have access to them. Of course the fullest power is secured to the collector to do everything, at all times in connection with the examination of goods should he think it necessary. There is a further provision that as regards warehoused goods thej' maj' be cleared forborne consumption, or exported to parts bej'ond the seas, or removed for warehousing elsewhere. Division 2 of this part, comprising clauses 1.01 to 104, provides for the establishment of King's warehouses, which are more particularly under the control and ownership of the Customs authorities, and in which goods seized or unclaimed are stored if not otherwise provided for. So much for the importation and warehousing, of goods. Part 6 deals with the exportation of goods. The system is first to declare that certain goods are prohibited 'exports. This is but a small list, referring chiefly to aims, explosives, military and naval stores, which bj' proclamation maj' be' prohibited from being exported to anj' par-' ticular place, and provision is made for giving effect to the proclamation. Then the mode of exporting goods is provided for the outward manifest, the export entry, thecertificate of clearance, the dutj' of themaster to bring-to at the boarding station, and the power of the officer to require satisfactory explanations as regards goods on the ship, which it is possible may not be entered. Heavy responsibilities are easton the master in this last-named connection, so that all goods intended for export, except passengers' baggage, must be included in the outward manifest, and it is specially the duty of the master to take care that no bonded goods shipped for export sluill be relanded. Part 7 deals with the question of ships' stores. Honourable members know that at present the rule is that stores, which are consumed within a particular State, pay duty. But, on the other hand, stores, which are carried in the ship from one State to another, do not pay duty, because it is held that the stores are not consumed within the bounds of any particular State. By intercolonial free-trade the area of Customs control will be increased, and in this connection the position is this: That as regards stores consumed between Adelaide and Melbourne, they have to be free as tliey are today, and, if so free, similar freedom must be extended to goods between Adelaide and Port Augusta, which are not free. There must be uniformity of practice. There is nothing to justify givingstores free for consumption between Adelaide and Melbourne, and refusing that freedom between Adelaide and Port Augusta. Instead of having trade between the States with different Tariffs, we have trade in one Commonwealth, sind under these circumstances it appears to the Government that the proper courseseeing thsit the stores are practically consumed within Australia--is to provide for the payment of duty onthose stores for the benefit of the Australian revenue. That - will be the nsitursil effect of the Bill, and special reference is made to the msitter in Part 7. Mr V . L . SOLO JI ox - How will that affect oversea ships aftei they arrive at the first Australian port ?",45
282,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"In thsit case the stores will be sealed up. We cannot adopt in this connection si rule to the advantsige of the trader from oversea, and to the disadvsintsige of. the Australism trader. Mr V. L. SOLOMOX - Will the honourable smd learned gentleman sesil up at Perth or Albany the stores of ships whose destination is eventusilly Sydney ? I refer to the Orient bosits, for example.",46
283,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"They can pay the duty. I am obliged to the honourable member for interjecting according to the bent of his thoughts. It is difficult, of course, to get the stores free of duty. There is competition of various sorts. There is competition for the Australian trade, not only between purely Australian traders, but between them and the oversea ships. Mr V . L . SOLOMOX - But does not the right honourable smd learned gentleman recognise that they will be trading a long wsiy from the coast, and may therefore be outside our jurisdiction ?",46
284,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Are they not practically travelling within Australia? The laws of the Comnionwetilth are in force. If we give these ships their stores free when they sire travelling between Fremantle sind Sydney then we must ""do the same to the Australism traders. If we do not clo it sis regards the Australian trader from Fremsintle to Sydney, why should i the done as regards the oversea ship between the same ports ?",46
285,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAKX,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It is done now in the case of ships trading between Fremantle and Melbourne.,46
286,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Ye s ; ' because the stores sire not consumed in any particulsir State; but the honourable member I am sure will admit thsit if an Australian ship is simply trading from one port of Yictoria to another port in Victoria, the owner does not get his goods free of duty. The area and simbit of the Customs control is now extended. When the consumption of goods under the Commonwealth was within the ambit of the State control, dutj was 7 charged on the goods, sind now that that control is extended it seems to me thsit similar results must follow. At least it is absolutely impossible to adopt one course of treatment favouring the oversea ship, and smother to the disadvantage of the Austra- lian trader. Under these circumstances I say we should tresit all alike and charge all silike.",46
287,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"What , is the chief evil to be grappled with?",46
288,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I clo not know about the evil, but the chief duty' of the Customs is to collect the duties, which sire fairly right collectable on goods which are the subject of Australian consumption ; sind I venture to think that the Australian consumption practically commences-certainl y onr power commences-whe n the ship arrives in an Australian port, and whether hervoyage be continued from Fremantle to Sydney, or from Fremantle to Albany, she should be charged.",46
289,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Will this Bill make much difference to the amount of revenue collected ?,47
290,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I am not in a position to give any precise information on that point, but 1 believe it will be a matter of some importance.",47
291,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAKX,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It will mean a veiy large increase of revenue:,47
292,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I believe it will be a matter of :iome considerable importance; and I shall be delighted to supply honourable members with the fullest information that we can obtain ; and no doubt the matter will be fully dealt with in committee.,47
293,Mr EWING,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The object in view is that, any vessel trading on the Australian coastshould pay Australian prices for its commodities.",47
294,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I think so; that is about it - Mr Reid - 1 tliink we shall have to wait until we get into committee before we can go into that matter.,47
295,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I am inclined to think that the matter is one upon which there is something to be said on the other side ; but I am sanguine enough to suppose that there is a great preponderance of argument in favour of the provision contained in the Bill.,47
296,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,There is no use in discussing it at this stage.,47
297,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I quite agree with the right honourable gentleman, but, at the same time, it is my duty to indicate as clearly as possible the nature of the provisions of the Bill.",47
298,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Has the Minister considered the application of the covering clause of the Constitution Act with respect to this matter?,47
299,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"YeS j I have. 8 of the Bill refers to the payment and computation of duties generally, and clause 124 declares that no goods the property of the Commonwealth shall be liable to any duty of customs. Honourable members will recollect that the terms of the Commonwealth Constitution prevent the Commonwealth from levying any taxes on the property of the State. It is also declared that all import duties shall be paid at the rate in force when the goods are entered for home [133] consumption, and that where duties are imposed according to weight, or. measure the weight or measurement of. the goods shall be ascertained according to the standard weights and. measures by law established. For the encouragement of honesty, we have inserted, clause 129, which, provides that whenever goods are sold or prepared for sale as, or are reputed to be, of a size or quantity greater than their actual; size orquantity, duties shall be charged; according to the first mentioned size or-quantity. Then there are the usual provisions which it is unnecessary for me to refer to in detail; Clause 145 adopts the provisions which are generally found in Customs Acts, that if after any agreement is. made for. the sale ordelivery of goods, duty paid, any. alteration takes place in the Tariff before they are delivered for home consumption, the selleri shall be allowed, after payment of any increased .duty, to add the difference to the agreed price. On the other hand, in the event of the duty being decreased, the purchaser mayon. his part avail liimself of the reduction.' Clause 147 refers to ad valorem duties. I know that a good many of my honourable Mends op1 posite will hardly view any provision relating to duties of that description with particular favour. It is declared that the value of goods for the purpose., of computing duty shall be taken to be the fair market value of the goods in the principal markets of the country whence they were exported and free on board at the port of export, with 10 per cent, added. The 10 per cent, is the usual provision made for the purpose of covering freight and charges.",47
300,Mr VL SOLOMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Paragrap h (a) is not a new one.,47
301,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It is a provision that is generally adopted, but it is not so in all the States-ther e is an absence of uniformity, but I think I may well say that this is the general rule. Provision is Part made for the production of the genuine invoices, and power is given to deal witli special cases. Clauses are also inserted for the purpose of permitting a remission of duty in the case of goods being damaged. Further provision is made, undeiclause 158, for the settlement of disputes as to duty. In Part 9 drawbacks are provided for. Part 10 deals with the costal trade, which is mostly to be governed by regulation. Part 11 deals with agents, and Part 12 relates to the powers of officers, which are large, but not unusual. The second division of Part 12 refers to the protection of officers. Part 13 contains penal provisions, and provides for forfeiture in certain cases. There are provisions in clause 214 with regard to the forfeiture of ships, and in clause 215 with reference to the forfeiture of goods. In clause 217 various penalties are provided for, and chief amongst these is the penalty to be inflicted upon persons who may engage in smuggling. "" Smuggling"" is defined as the illegal importation or introduction of goods, and in clause 218 officers are cautioned against collusive seizures and entrapping people who would not otherwise be guilty of an offence against the Act. Clause 220 deals with offences generally, and clause 222 declares that anyone who aids and abets in the commission of an offence shall be deemed as guilty as the man who commits it, and also that an attempt to commit an'offence shall be equally punishable with the commission of the offence itself. Honourable menibers will possibly discover the fact that the penalties provided at the foot of the clauses are not specially severe ; and in this connection I would like to draw their attention to clause 226, which practically embodies the usual Customs practice of penalizing to the extent of three times the value of any goods which are found to have been wrongly dealt with. It is provided that if the penalty for any specified offence shall be less than three times the value of any goods in respect of which an offence has been committed, the maximum penalty shall be thrice the value of the goods. Clause 227 is one of some importance, and is, perhaps, new ; but it is framed having reference to this aspect of the case. There are two sorts of Customs offences ; one class of cases involving gross moral wrong-attempt s to defraud-and the otlier being cases in which we may not be able to prove any attempt to defraud, but in which the liability to loss of revenue is equally great. In this latter class of cases attempts may be made to excuse the fault by pleading carelessness, and in the penalties which we have put at the foot of this clause 'we have provided for proved breaches of the Act. If, however, in addition to the simple breach of the A ct the Customs charge and prove an attempt to defraud, it is provided that the penalty shall be double that inflicted in the other case.",47
302,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If I have smuggled toand bacco in my possession, which I have bought, Mr Kingston. not knowing it to be smuggled, I suppose I should be Uable to the penalty provided in clause 219 1",48
303,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I do not know about that. But if a man came on shore with a lot of cigars upon which he had not paid duty, and the circumstances were such that the Customs were able to prove only the breach, it being impossible to prove an attempt to defraud, the offender would pay only the penalty provided for the lesser offence.",48
304,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I think it would be very hard lines for a man to be at the mercy of the bench for smoking a cigar which he had bought without knowing that it was smuggled.,48
305,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I think honourable members will be inclined to say that we are doing well, whilst imposing a substantial _ penalty for the protection of the revenue against carelessness, in providing an additionally severe remedy when fraud is charged and proved. I have not had much Customs experience-and there are veiy few cases which come under one's notice at any time which are breaches of the Act-bu t the great percentage of the cases in which it is not the fault of the party benefited by the slip, but of some unfortunate junior or other employee, is striking. So that what we say is this : "" Where we cannot prove fraud, we shall, for the protection of the revenue at least, impress upon people the necessity of being careful, and where people are nob careful they w in have to pay the penalty. Where we can prove fraud they will pay double the penalty provided for carelessness."" As regards this question of slips, they are of various characters ; but there is a certain amount of uniformity amongst them, and the mistake is generally against His Majesty's revenue, and never against the individual who has the careless or reckless clerk. I do not wish honourable members to think that I am suggesting any general i m : propriety of conduct on the part of our mercantile community, because I consider that we have eveiy reason to be proud of it, and I have no doubt that, if the Customs slips in Australia were compared with the Customs slips in other Countries, Australian merchants would have no reason to be ashamed. But, I say, let us insist upon care being taken in the making out of entries, in the declaration of values, and in this, that, the other matter in wliicli the Customs are concerned. If persons are not sufficiently careful, let tliem take the consequences, to a moderate extent, so that others may be warned to be more careful. But where it is not carelessness, but fraud, that is charged and proved, let those who ai'e convicted pay a penalty which bears some proportion to the offence of which they have heen guilty.",48
306,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"What position of a master of a ship under clause 219, supposing a passenger is convicted of smuggling 1",49
307,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The clause provides for the conviction of any one concerned in such an act.,49
308,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,But master might not he concerned.,49
309,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I think that the words "" shall use or suffer "" show that there must be connivance on the part of the master.",49
310,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The clause saysNo person shall smuggle or unlawfully import, export, convey, or have in his possession any goods ; and no master of a ship shall use or suffer his ship to be used in smuggling or in the unlawful importation, exportation, or conveyance of any goods. Some connection of the master of the vessel with the act of smuggling will he required. The maximum penalty for the contravention of this provision is £100, but it is liable to be increased under the circumstances to which I have referred.",49
311,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It is the mum penalty too.,49
312,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,No ; tliere is a clause which declares that the minimum penalty shall be one - twentieth of any maximum penalty provided. Under these circumstances we need have no fear that the enforcement of the provisions of the measure will operate with unnecessary harshness.,49
313,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Ero m what Ac t did the Minister get the provisions of clause 214, which allows the forfeiture of ships ?",49
314,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"In that clause are gathered together a great number of provisions which occur in various Acts, and so gathered together they are of course somewhat striking.",49
315,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Under circumstances would a ship be forfeited 1,49
316,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I would forfeit a ship only when that penalty was deserved, and I would rely upon the courts which would be charged with the enforcement of the measure to exhibit the same discretion.",49
317,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The courts will he bound by the definition of "" offence,"" which occurs in the Bill.",49
318,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Yes , and the Crown can waive forfeiture if necessary. I thought that the leader of the Opposition or some other honourable member might be struck by the aggregation of the circumis the stances under which a ship will be liable to forfeiture specified in that particular clause, but I believe that I can satisfy the House that very similar provisions are to be found in nearly, all the Customs Acts of the various States, though they are hidden in such a wealth and waste of language that they do the not strike the eye so forcibly.",49
319,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Do not any of the sections, to which the honourable member refers provide an alternative for forfeiture ?",49
320,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Speaking from memory, I do not think so, but I shall be able to satisfy the right honourable gentleman on the subject later on. There are various provisions for the recovery of penalties from persons who have been convicted, and for the amplification. of penalties. I want especially to refer to clauses 238 and 239 as regards the protection afforded to witnesses on behalf of the prosecution, and as to the liability of a defendant to be examined. Clause 238 enacts thatNo witness on behalf of the Minister or col lector in any Customs prosecution shall be commini- pelled to disclosefchefactfchafche received or gave any information or the nature thereof, nor the name of the person who gave such information, and no oflicer appearing as a witness shall be compelled to produce anj' reports made or received by him confidentially in his official capacity or containing confidential information. That is really an embodiment of the existing practice, and I trust that honourable members will consent to it, because it seems to me to be an essential provision. Clause 239 declares thatIn every Customs prosecution the defendantshall be competent to give evidence. And it provides also thatIn everj' Customs prosecution, except for anindictable offence, the defendant shall be compelled to give evidence, and if called as a witness forfcheprosecution, shall be liable to cross-examination as a witness adverse to the prosecuwhat tion. I think that we should not disregard anyreasonable provision for getting at the truth in matters of this kind. The simple effect of the clause will be that the defendant may be called as a witness, and cross-examined, and the truth got out of him.",49
321,Mr VL SOLOMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,-That is a new departure.,50
322,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It is new.,50
323,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"But although the clause says "" except'for an> indictable offence"" it has the same effect asthough. it were applied to indictable offences, because a defendant may. not be able to pay a-fine imposed upon - hinv, ancl must then serve a year: in gaol.",50
324,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The criticism.:of the right honourable member is perfectly just. But it seems to me that""ifa-man'sguiltiis established out of-Iiis-own mouth he should suffer at leastall the minor penalties provided in the Bill. Clause 240, isan elaboration of the present' practice asregards casting the onus of proof upon the defendant. It is there declared thatThe averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information, declaration, or shall be deemed to be proved in the absenceof proof to the contrary. 'That, it seems to me, has been"" a provision in Customs Acts, almost since theyeaione. And in the Bill it is hedged - about with this safeguardWhen an intent to defraud the revenue is charged the averment shall not be deemed sufficient to prove the intent. 'The intention must be proved by direct - evidence, and againIn all proceedings for an indictable offence, the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence.",50
325,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,That is a very considerate provision.,50
326,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I am sure that the right honourable gentleman, and all honourable members who have filled the position of Minister of Customs know that the practice - I had almost said from time immemorial - in connection with Customs prosecutions, has been the reverse of the English practice in regard to other prosecutions ; the guilt of the defendant being assumed until he proves the contrary.",50
327,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"But in the Bill, where an - offence does not reach a serious degree of - depravity, the assumption is made against the defendant, whereas, in more serious - cases, the guilt must be estabhshed by evidence. Why should a person entangled in the less serious class of offences be treated with less consideration than.persons charged witli more serious offences?",50
328,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I suppose it is out of slavish regard for the old-established English practice in regard to indictable offences. But there is a good deal in the suggestion of the right honourable member, and I promise to consider: the clause again from his-point of view. Those'are the provisions with regard to offences. Part 15' provides for the settlement of' cases by the Minister, but the whole of'the jurisdictonu provided for' there is dependent upon the consent of the defendant: If he does-not consent,- nothing can be done' undertliis paft'of'the - Bill Ltliink that if the powersconferred by.'the clauses in Part 15 are exercised, they will not be ; exercised by the Minister; but by some one whom he hasappointed as his delegate, under the earlier clauses of the Bill. Mr VL SOLOMON^-The right' honourable member missed-a point: in . regard to clause 249-that is, as to the pohcy of allowing informersand Customs officers to claim, share a portion - of - any plunder. I believe that that is a policy which is frequently questioned.",50
329,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It is frequently questioned,-.but it is the: accepted practice under all Customs Acts.",50
330,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The unavoidable practice.,50
331,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The fact is, that in matters of this sort'we can very seldom get at the truth except through the - medium of informers. No one hkes informers, but the revenue must be protected; and the Customs laws enforced:",50
332,Mr VL SOLOMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,But the clause to which I refer allows not only informers but Government employees to benefit.,50
333,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,We must encourage the Government officials.,50
334,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It is necessary, to stimulate them to extra energy. The matter, however, is one with which we can deal in committee.",50
335,Mr VL SOLOMON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Scandalou s results have followed from this practice at times.,50
336,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Par t 16 deals with the making of regulations; and gives the Minister full power to make regulations, which may afterwards be Confirmed by the Governor General, and are to take effect from the date of publication, or from a later date to be specified in the regulations, and these regulations must be laid before both Houses of Parliament, and approved by resolutionsat any time within 30 sitting days. Part' 17 contains some important clauses. Clause 257 deals with the practice which has long been established of collecting proposed customs duties from the time the proposed Tariff is announced. In some of the States the course has been for the House, in which the Tariff isproposed, to pass a resolution authorizing the Minister to take steps for the protection of the revenue, while in other States no resolution is deemed - necessary. It is, however, the invariable practice, so far as I can ascertain, to collect these proposed duties from the moment the Tariff is:introduced.",50
337,Mr UKID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It is the safer plan, because otherwise a discussion might be. prolonged to defeat the object of the duties.",51
338,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I thoroughly agree with the right honourable member. In South Australia, and in some of' the other - States, it has not been the practice to pass a resolution, while in the House of Commons the resolution has been - carried as a matter of form, and I believe that a similar practice has obtained in Victoria. Mr Rum - There might be .a Jong discussion upon, thei passing of the resolution which would be very inconvenient.",51
339,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,That is so.,51
340,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I would suggest that the moment the duties are proposed they should be collected. That is .done - in New South Wales.,51
341,Sir AVILLIAM MCMILLAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,How can clo that under our Constitution?,51
342,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,B y having a provision to that effect in the Bill.,51
343,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,In Tasmania it has been the custom to pass a resolution.,51
344,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Yes , and it is the custom everywhere to collect these duties the moment the ;Tariff is proposed. Such a practice is essential to thei protection of ithe revenue. I have listened witli a. great deal of interest to the remarks of the honourable and learned member-for .Bendigo, and the honourable and learned member for Soutli Australia, Mr Glynn, in - this . connection. There seems to be some doubt as to the absolute legality of the practice, iand as to what the effect would be if, in a suit properly instituted, the issue was raised .as to the legal right of the Government to collect these duties or to retain the goods. The last case occurred in New - South AVales, and turned iupon the form of the proceedings. I believe that an-application was made for a. mandamus.",51
345,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The court would not interfere; it held its hand, ancl in time-the mafcter was put right.",51
346,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"On the ground that it was a prerogative writ, winch did not go as a - matter of right, and the J<udges held that the court had discretion to deny it , which they accordingly did. But there'has. been sufficient doubt cast upon the absolute constitutionality and legality iof the .practice, - apart from those proceedings, tojustify this Parliamentin giving legislative sanction to it.",51
347,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"-Is there not special difficulty under the. Constitution, as-States can still alter their Tariffs until thisBill becomes law ?",51
348,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I know that-difficulty,, but I do not propose to discuss it at the present timeif the honourable member will kindly excuse, me. It is with - fcheobject I have indicated that we. propose the clause, and it is framed on the lines of the clauses to which attention was previously called. I hope that before the Bill leaves our hands we shall have provided in the clearest possible terms for the position, so that no doubt can exist in the future as to the legality of the continuance offchepractice, if it be continued. Clause 258 simply provides forgiving administrative effect to the provision of the Constitution in regard to the collection of duties on goods which are imported we before the imposition of the uniform Tariif, and passed from one State to another. Clause 259 enables the necessary statistical information to be collected and .supplied to the Treasurer for the > keeping of accounts between the States. Possibly it is, or may be, a matter of. regret that those conditions are contained in .the Constitution; but finding - them there, we have to give effect to tliem, .and these clauses in the broadest possible way provide for the giving of that effect. These are shortly the provisions of the Bill. I am sorry'I have taken up so much of the time of honourable members in introducing the Bill to their notice. 'But this is a matter of importance in which I have found a very considerable .interest, and if honourable members desire any information in addition to that already given, we shall be only too happy to give it , our simple wish being-that this'Bill shall be a credit to the Legislature.",51
349,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"AVil l the right honourable gentleman, before he resumes his - seat, kindly say what clause - refers fco .the power to collect the first Tariff?",51
350,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Clause . 257.,51
351,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That clause refers onlyfcoan .increased Tariff"".",51
352,Mr KINGSTON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"No , it refers to the first Tariff.",52
353,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I do not wish to he taken afc present as speaking to the Bill which was laid on the table this morning, and a copy of which I received only a short time ago. I should like an opportunity of referring to the legislation in other colonies, and I moveThatfchedebate be now adjourned.",52
354,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Why do the notes not state from which statutes the provisions are taken ?,52
355,Mr B EID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The motion for adjournment might be postponed if honourable members - desire to ask a question or two. Motion agreed to ; debate adjourned. In CommiUee :,52
356,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I move-rThat a sum not exceeding £1,010,732 be granted to His Majesty towards defraying the services for the year ending 30th daj' of June, .1902. Houorable members will recollect that a few days ago Supply was granted, and the necessary Act passed providing for the expenditure up to the 30th June. Under that Act all expenditure has to cease on that day. According to the Constitution no money can be drawn from the Treasury - except under appropriations made by law, .and, therefore, honourable members will realise that it is imperative at the earliest possible moment that the Treasurer should be put in a proper position to expend the money necessary for carrying on the affairs of the Commonwealth. The Government are therefore now asking for Supply for the period of three months. I regret to say it is utterly impossible at the present time, or for some little time to come, to put before the House the full Estimates of the proposed expenditure of the present financial vear. When we are dealing with State affairs, it is somewhat difficult to the necessaiy information; but when we have to get information from the whole of the six States, and to put it into proper form, it takes some little time. Under these circumstances, I am not prepared at the present time to put before the committee the full Estimates for the whole year. But in the schedule which is 'circulated I have given sufficient details to enable honourable members to deal with any question which can arise. In the first place, we have followed, as far as it is possible, the Supply already granted. In those cases, I have not given an) further information than 7 simply to say, in the case of the first vote, for instance, "" The Senate, salaries, contingencies."" Honourable menibers must take my assurance that in those cases we are following the Supply exactly which has already been authorized by Parliament. In other cases it has become necessary to make further marginal appointments, and these are mentioned under the departments in which they have to foe paid. Por the House of Representatives, there have been provided salaries, including that of the clerk of the House of Representatives at £ 9 0 0 per year, and a junior clerk at £ 6 0 per annum, other salaries having been already voted, and those mentioned SUPPLY. not having been provided for in the Act which has been passed. In connection with the next item- "" Parliamentary Debates,"" it has been found necessary to appoint an extra reporter at £ 5 0 0 per annum, and a sessional typist at £ 1 8 per month. In connection with the Library, the Refreshmentroom, the water power for Parliament House, ParUamentary gardens, and the Federal Executive, the Estimates are the same as we have already adopted. Under the heading "" Administrative,"" there is an additional, messenger, but, as a matter of fact, he is not a new officer, he having been on the temporary staff and being now transferred to the permanent staff. Under the heading ""Miscellaneous,"" it has been found necessary to vote a further expenditure in connection with the opening of Parliament and the Royal reception of £2,000, and to re-vote a sum of £500. In the Attorney-General's department a chief clerk and assistant parliamentary draftsman have been provided for, together with a clerk at £ 8 0 per annum, and a messenger at £ 1 2 0 per annum. In the department of the Minister for Home Affairs, we have provided, in addition to what we get all have already voted, a secretary at £750, a chief clerk at £500, three clerks at £200, a messenger at ±'80, with five caretakers for this and other departments. We have also had to provide for some necessary repairs to public buildings, fittings, and furniture, amounting, with regard to the new departments, to £ 1 , 3 0 0 ; and with regard to the Post-office, the Customs department, and the Defence department, to £9,300, this expenditure being for repairs which it will be necessary to do during the current three months. Then we have also provided for the Public Service Commissioner's branch, which will have to be established as rapidly as possible, a secretary at £600, six clerks at from £ 1 0 0 to £ 2 0 0 per annum, two messengers at £ 1 0 4 per annum, and one at £ 5 2 per annum, with a caretaker at £52. It is necessary also to have a small staff in connection with the Electoral-office, consisting of a chief officer at £450 per annum, and a clerk at £ 1 5 0 per annum. We must also vote a sum of £12,000 in connection with the Federal Parliament elections. We voted some £20,000 reviously, but we were not able to expend the whole amount before the 30th J une, and this is simply a re-vote to enable us to complete the expenditure during the next few months. In the Treasurer's department, I find I am bound to increase the staff by one clerk at £ 2 1 0 per annum, and a junior messenger at £ 5 2 . The Government Printer requires, for the purpose of the necessary printing in connection with Parliament, and for providing some machinery, the sum of £10,500. ' The Minister of Trade and Customs had no provision made for him in the way of a central office on the other Estimates we submitted; and it is now proposed to appoint a Comptroller General of Customs at £1,200 per annuni, that being practically the salary which the gentleman who is to be appointed is receiving at the present time. There has also to be a secretary at £ 7 5 0 per annum. '",52
357,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,A private secretary ?,53
358,Sir GEOBGE TUBNEB,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"No ; the officer is called a secretary, but he will be practically the chief officer for Victoria. We have provided in this department for three clerks, one at £300 per annuni, another at £ 2 5 0 , and one at £200, with amessenger at £130. Then, the other expenditure in the Department of the Minister for Trades and Customs is the transferred expenditure, which, as I have mentioned, has been based on what we have been expending during the past year, and which expenditure has been endorsed by Parliament. The Minister for Defence requires a seeretaiy at a salary of £ 9 0 0 per annum, which is \ he present salary of the gentleman who will be' transferred to that position.",53
359,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Has the officer been selected ?,53
360,Sir GEOBGE TUBNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Practically , he has, and there is no reason why his name should not be mentioned. The gentleman is Captain Collins, the head of the Defence department of Victoria. The Minister c i Defence requires a chief accountant, at £ 6 0 0 per annum, a chief clerk at £540, five clerks at vaiying salaries, two messengers, and a junior messenger. Then, it is necessary to re-vote a portion qf the amount for the military and naval demonstration which we could not expend before the 30th June, and also to vote the expenditure for holding demonstrations in Adelaide, Hobart, and Perth. In the Postmaster-General's branch, it is proposed to have a seeretaiy at £1,000 per annum, an assistant seeretaiy at £ 6 0 0 per annum, together with six clerks and three messengers: the other expenditure being the necessary transferred expenditure. Now, the new expenditure-or , as it is called ""the other expenditure""-is shown in a column separate from the ordinaiy transferred expenditure, in order that honourable members may see the amount it is proposed to expend under this particular heading, and the total would appear to be £52,532. But, as a matter of fact, a portion of that can hardly be regarded as the current expenditure. £2,500, as i have already men-, tioned, is for the celebrations in connection with the opening of Parliament; £12,000 is a re-vote of electoral expenditure, and there is £9,000 in connection - with the demonstrations. If we take that amount, £23,500, from the amount shown as the apparent new expenditure, honourable members' will see that the total new expenditure asked for is £29,000. , In addition to that, there are the permanent appropriations for the Governor General, Ministers, and honourable members-the e months' proportionrepresenting £16,600, so that the total new expenditure asked for for the three months is £45,600. W it h regard to the various officers mentioned here, some have been practically selected. Many have not been dealt with, but they will have to be dealt with during the three months, and I can give the assurance to honourable members that it is intended to take the whole of them from the State services. Thus, while we are expending a certain amount of money for these services, we are taking officers from the various Sfcate services, and thereby enabling the States to make a considerable saving in their expenditure. It will be seen, therefore, that the whole of the new expenditure is not all new expenditure to the States, because they have the opportunity of making considerable savings by not filling up the. positions of the officers are transferred, or by filling them np by transferring other officers. Thus, while the whole of the salaries will not be saved, a veiy large proportion of undoubtedly will. That is the policy which - Parliament, I take it , would desire and which the - Government intend ment, to carry out. Wherever it is possible will make appointments 'fromfcheexisting public services of the States, and thereby enable the States to meet their the new expenditure.",53
361,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Is there any necessity take for a secretary to the post-office in addition to the Postmaster-General ?,54
362,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Whil e we The have the various heads to conduct the ness in connection with the various States, it is necessary to have the permanent head, and it is necessaiy also that the Minister should be supplied with some gentleman who, while acting as secretary .to be able to do other work connected with the department. I can assure the honourable member for Bland that Ministers havecareover ? fully considered the requirements of the new departments, and, under instruction from the Prime Minister, the number of gentleman to be - employed have been kept as low as is consistent with the working of - States fchey work the department through the various departments. I trust that this the military commandant. Supply will be granted as rapidly as possible, because honourable members that it is difficult to make payments and to provide for the-necessaiy expenditure i far-off States, such as Western Australia, when it takes some days to communicate ment with them. 'We must also realise' that it will not do to keep the publiccreditor withrun. out' his money. Trouble would 'arise ifthat were done, and under these-circumstances'I trust that the House allow a-Supply B i l pass as quickly as possible. Mr HuaiE COOK - Why is such a salaiy provided for the Secretary to the Minister for Defence, viz., £900, as against £750 for the Secretary to the Minister for Trades and Customs, who has to do more paymaster work 1",54
363,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The Minister for Defence is in control of a transferred department, and is taking one of the transferred officers at his former salaiy. same thing happened in the Customs departSecretary ment in regard to Dr Wollaston, who is getting the emolumentfchathe was receiving from the State of Victoria. Of course, who wherever it is possible we lay down the - principle that the .salary of a permanent head shall be fixed at-£750. That has been adopted - in the Treasury department, the them ""Department of 'the Minister for Home Affairs, the Attorney-General's department, - and also in the Prime Minister's departwhere, however, the secretary receives we £ 5 0 extra because he is the permanent head of the'Prime Minister's department. - Mr WATSON - It is the usual f r ill around portion of the military system.",54
364,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Where we over departments, we ought, if possible, to takeover the officers, because otherwise the State has to find employment - for them. Secretary to the Minister for-Defence is businow a permanent officer at £ 9 0 0 per - annum; and if we had not taken him over, the State concerned would have to-find some otlier position for him, ancl we should have had to put some one else in his present him, will posifcion at £ 7 5 0 a year.",54
365,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Tlier e are one or two military secretaries. Do the Government take them,54
366,Mr WATSON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"There are one or two in the different States, and they are all getting big salaries. Are we to continue them 1",54
367,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,In the other 1 >,54
368,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,There is a military secretary will-see in New South Wales.,54
369,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"lYes , but he n the is a military man. This gentleman will be the permanent head of the new deporti n each ""State, and I have no - doubt at allbut that it will prove a saving in the long",54
370,Mr HUJIE COOK,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"-Why is it that the 'accountant - and chief clerk . in the departl to ment of the Mmister for Defence are paid 1 * higher than are those officers in the departlarge ment of the ""Minister for Home Affairs 1 - Sir GEORGE TURNER - The.aecount 1 >ant is a transferred officer, and is transferred at his existing salary. He - was the in Victoria, and his former office will be filled up at a.salary of'£360, so that a saving of about half liis present emolument will be effected by that appointment. - Mr CBOUCH - Did not the reclassification The board recommend that the salary of the for Defence should be reduced 1",54
371,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Howeve r that may be, when we take him oveiwe have to clo so at his present salary. If we did not do so, we should be incurring'an extra expenditure of £750, which is not justifiable. : However, we shall deal with tliese particular items in detail, and the Minister of each department will be able to give anj' further hiformation that honourable .members may desire.",54
372,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"- I am sure we are all disposed to facilitate the Government in getting supplies to carry on the public service and pay the public creditor. But we must look to the Government to bear this matter steadily h i view-that they remember also the rights and duty of every honourable member to carefully consider proposals for public expenditure. T t is quite within the power of the Executive Government to forecast their liabilities, and to bring down their request for Supplj' at such a time that all these important considerations can be respected, and I am sure m j ' honourable unci learned friend the Treasurer, who has always-if I may say sobeen distinguished for his straightforward conduct hi dealing with these matters, will pardon me if I saj' that I really th ink the course which he has taken upon this occasion-wliil e fully respecting the obligations of the Government-doe s not fully respect the position of this committeej 1 would also suggest as a convenient practice - I do not know what the practice . is in the other States-that when a Supplj' Bill, is going to be dealt with some notice should be given to honourable members that such an imporant matter is coming on'. This Bill will involve an expenditure of something like £1,000,000 sterling, which is a very large part of the - whole .annual expenditure. Either the Government should give us special notice that the question of Supplj' is coming on, or thej' should hand the Governor General's message to the Speaker at an early period of the sitting, so that honourable members may know that it' may come on during that sitting. In the present instance my honourable and learned friend the Treasurer handed the message in onlj' a few - moments <ago at a very late period of today's sitting, when a considerable number of honourable members had no anticipation that this would be dealt with.",55
373,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Suppl y was at the top of the list, which is the onlj' waj' in which we can intimate to honourable members that it will be considered.",55
374,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"-Honourable members might - very easily miss such an intimation. It is simplj' impossible for us to perform our d u t j ' if a large Estimate involving a number of important considerations is passed - through as a matter of form. We must either pass this Estimate, crystallizing the arrangements in all the Government departments for all time to come-eithe r pass it as a matter of form or we must exercise our lights in the way of proper elucidation.",55
375,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"But my honourable ancl learned friend knows that Supply is alwaj's granted as a matter of form up to a certain amount, and that the items are considered afterwards on the Estimates proper.",55
376,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"-As a general rule Supply follows well-ascertained Estimates, upon a settled financial sj'stem. We know, in ordinary cases, what the Estimates of the preceding year have been, and the Supplj' of - a succeeding year, following on the same lines, we practically know what we are dealing with. But in this new system of finance, when we have before us for the first time a number of proposals of the Government with reference todepartments, with no well-ascertained estimates to guide us, the situation is entirely different. I am very anxious that a wrong precedent should not be estabhshed at thisearly stage in our history. In the other States, a very great amount of heartburning, complaint, ancl strifehave been, brought about b j ' the fact that Ministries perhaps from the' force of circumstances, have been compelled to do what is called ""force"" Supply through. That is always an objectionable thing, and I-know that my honourable and learned friend, the Treasurer, will never wish his name to be associated with anything of that sort. W it h every desire to help the Government through in matters of this kind, I feel that I must ask the Government to give me some little time to consider tliese items.",55
377,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,We can deal with the resolution to-night ancl take the Bill on Tuesday.,55
378,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"May I suggestagain that that clearly is not a proper course'to pursue, because the vital stage of this matter from a constitutional point of view, is that when we grant Supplj', the BDI is a mere coverput ing of the transaction in this committee. The representatives of the people are in a proper position to gain information on all these proposals before Supply is granted, and if we get into the practice of granting Supply, and then afterwards of looking at what we have done, I tliink we shall be adopting a wrong course of procedure. I think that both sides of the House are interested in establishing the proper method to be followed upon such occasions as this. What I am complaining of today my honourable and learned friend the Treasurer may have to complain of in regard to. some succeeding Government. It would be well, therefore, if we establish in a friendly way some more deliberate method of dealing with these matters than has been customary in some of the Australian States.",55
379,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Balaclava) I quite realise that there is some distinction between this Supply and the ordinary Supply for which the Treasurer asks at the commencement of each financial year. There is no desire on the part of the Government to prevent honourable members from having the fullest opportunity of discussing every particular item. There is force in the argument which - has been advanced that honourable members should have an opportunity of scrutinizing the various new items comprised in the proposed expenditure. It will not be necessary to deal with what we have passed in the previous Supplj' Bill. Under tliese circumstances I have no objection to allowing the mattei to be adjourned to Tuesday next, trusting that my honourable and learned friend the leader of the Opposition will help me to gel"" the Bill through as speedily as possible, so that it maj' be sent up to the Senate on Wednesday. Progress reported. AUDIT BILL. In Committee (consideration resumed from 19th June, vide page 1257) : Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 postponed. Clause 3 agreed to. Clause 4The Auditor-General shall receive an annual salary of One thousand pounds, and such salaiy shall be a charge upon and paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which to the necessary extent is liereby appropriated accordingly.",56
380,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," This is a matter that requires some little consideration. I think that we could not possibly fix the salary of the Auditor-General at a smaller amount, and the onlj' question is whether the Minister thinks there is a fair probability of getting some gentleman who will be a thoroughly fit and proper person for such a very high, independent, and important . position, for such a salary.",56
381,Sir GEOKGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I think so. It is certainlj' not too high, but we have so many of these positions to fill up, that we must not give too big salaries.",56
382,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If the honourable gentleman thinks the salary sufficient, I am satisfied. Clause agreed to. Clause 5 agreed to. Clause 6(1.) If anj' officer of the Commonwealth is appointed Auditor-General his service as Auditor General shall for the purpose of determining all his existing and accruing rights be counted as public » service in the Commonwealth. (2) If anj' officer in the public service of a State is appointed Auditor-General he shall have 'the same rights as if he had been an officer of a department transferred to the Commonwealth and were retained in the service of the Commonwealth.",56
383,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," This clause deals with a matter that will keep pressing on us in connection with the transfer of Officers from the States, and I feel sure that the Government must very soon face the situation. There are a number of more or less unsatisfactory pension laws in the different States. Perhaps in some of the States the law does not give the public servant enough for what he pays-thoug h I do not think that is likely-whils t in 1 other States the public servant gets a great deal more than he ought to for the contribution he has to paj'. Taking the case of New South Wales, I am sorry that I have to speak in a derogatory sense, because our pension system is greatly to our discredit, owing to its having proved veiy unsatisfactory. We have made two attempts to establish it on a proper basis, but the rate of contribution to the fund is absolutelj' insufficient to provide for the benefits which are secured to the officers, and when the matter is cleared up, the result practically will be that the State will have to pay an amount at least equal to half the principal. In that sense the Commonwealth is, in spite of itself, engrafting a pension system upon itself - Referring to this particular instance, the Auditor General maj' come from New South. Wales witli some pension rights, and the Commonwealth, from the daj' he begins to serve us, will have to stand in the shoes of New South Wales in reference to liis pension. He will pay his 4 per cent., as in New South Wales, to the Treasury of the Commonwealth, but he will get his pension from the Commonwealth. I admit that the question is a difficult one, but I believe that the Government will be compelled to take it up, because of the number of officers who will be taken over, and the number of pension systems with which we shall have to deal.",56
384,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"We cannot avoid that under the Constitution, except by going outside the service in order to make the appointment, which would not be very satisfactory.",57
385,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I admit that it is a great difficulty, but the Minister suggests an interpretation of the Constitution which may not be a sound one. I do not know whether the words in the Constitution cover pensions.",57
386,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,They certainly do; they were deliberately intended to cover pensions.,57
387,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Perhaps they would cover pensions, but the position becomes most unsatisfactory, because theoffiuer in thisinstance will be practically getting the pension from us as well as the salary. The contribution of a mevo 4 per cent, of liis salary to the Treasury will be a farce. I cannot see that the Minister could do anything more than he is doing, because he is simply carrying out the Constitution; but if there is any way of putting matters on a simpler footing, it should be availed of. As it is, I am afraid we shall have to pay a large pension bill.",57
388,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The States save it.,57
389,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Certainl y we have consolation.,57
390,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It would not fair to refuse to take over a good man from a State service simply because we have fco pay his pension.,57
391,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"My honourable friend is perfectly correct, and in some sense, of course, we shall be discharging the obUgations of the. States.",57
392,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I notice in this clause a provision similar to that which is in the PubUc Service Bill, ancl which is practically intended, as far as I can undersame. stand, to be a sort of placard to the effect that section S4 of the Constitution is being observed.",57
393,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The General may be a man from outside the public service.,57
394,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I do not think section 84 means ""public service"" as defined by the Public Service Acts of the various States.",57
395,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"But the Auditor General would not be in the Commonwealth public service. Mr MCCAY"" - He would be in the public service of the Commonwealth, within the meaning of the Constitution, 1 think.",57
396,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I inserted subclause (2) in order to remove any possible doubt on the matter.,57
397,Mr MGCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"In putting tliese placards or extra precautions in Bills, we cannot provide for any less than the Constitution guarantees. We cannot derogate from the Constitution as against the officers concerned, but we might be putting in something more than the Constitution intended. The only way in which we could differ from the rights given under the Constitution would be by giving the officer more than the Constitution provides for, because we cannot give him less, and as section .84 of the Constitution apparently gives ample protection, 1 would ask the Minister whether it is wise to insert subclause (2) ?",57
398,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I will reconsider the matter.,57
399,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"1I have a veiy strong opinion on this matter, and I think it much safer and wiser to rely oh the Constitution. We have clone the same thing as is proposed here in the Public Service Bill, and I am afraid we shall find conflicts and difficulties wil l arising there in consequence of it . I suppose it is practically certain that the that Auditor-General will be taken from the public service of one of the States, ancl, if be so, he will get exactly what the Constitution intends he shall get under section 84.",57
400,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," ! would point out, in support of what the honourable and learned member for Corinella has stated, that the expression "" shall have the same rights as if he had been the officer of a department,"" <tc, is a much larger expression than that used in the Constitution Aet.",57
401,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,If c is exactly the,57
402,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If that is so, there is absolutely no necessity for the sub-clause, and when a sub-clause is inserted in face of Auditorthat, there is always an idea that there is something more in it than the Constitution intended.",57
403,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I see the force of the objection.,58
404,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Tak e this case: Suppose adopted the Auditor-General comes*from New South Wales, and has a right to a free pass on the clause (2). rail ways by virtue of the local Act. When he comes over to the Commonwealth he it uniform. may claim that he has a - similar right over the railways of Victoria, and the situation might be productive of trivial disputes. I cordially agree with the honourable and deputy). learned member for Corinella that where the Constitution provides for is no necessity to repeat it in each, particular case. It does not add to the security of the officer. Cl ause agreed to. Clause 7(1) The Auditor-General shall hold his office during good behaviour and shall not be removed therefrom unless an address praying for such moval shall, be presented to by the Senate and the House of Representatives respectively iin the same session of the Parliament. (2) The Governor General may at any time suspend any Auditor-General from his office ability incapacity incompetence or misbehaviour and. when und so often.as the same shall happen Treasurer shall lay before both Houses of the Parliament a full statement of the such suspension within seven days after such suspension if the Parliament be then in session actually sitting, or if the Parliament be not then in session or not actually sitting within after the commencement of the next session or sitting. (3) The Auditor-General so suspended shall be restored to office unless each House of the Parliament within forty-two .clays-after the day such statement is laid before it, and in the session pass an address to the Governor General praying for his removal. Sir EDWARD BRADDON tors-General - The last sub-clause will surely have to amended. It is quite possible days period provided - might not elapse between the presentation of the statement and the close of the session. Sir GEORGI^TURNER - But that would be a matter for the Government to guard against. The Government must obtain - the ratification of Parliament before a prorogaState tion, or their own-action would lapse.",58
405,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Is there really any occasion for this ? I think that we should strike out the words "" in the .same session,"" because it seems to me they are not required. Parliament i might wish, tifter consideration, to insist on the removal of the Auditor-General.",58
406,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,.This is uniform with the Public Service Bil l which we are now pissing. 1,58
407,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"There is a difference between this clause and the clause as in the Public - Service Bill, because the word "" inability"" is inserted in subSir GEORGE . TURNER - I propose to make Clause agreed to. Clauses 8 and 9 agreed to. Clause 10 (Auditor-General may appoint",58
408,Mr FE MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," Does the a thing, there provision that- The Auditor-General may, with the approval of the Governor General, appoint any persou holding the office of Auditor-General or Commissioner of Audit in any State, or if such person is unable or unwilling to acfc, then some ofcher person to be his deputy mean that the Auditors-General of the States re- .are to have a prior right to be appointed his the Governor General deputies ?",58
409,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The object of the provision is to enable the Commonwealth for in Government to use any of them if we ; require anything done in his particular the State, and can thus save our own Auditorgrounds of General a-journey there.",58
410,Mr FE MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Is it desirable that and the Auditors-General of the States should seven days undertake these duties ? Sir GEORGE TURNER:-They are the persons best qualified to undertake them.,58
411,Mr FE MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That may be, but when if the clause were made to read that the same Auditor-General may appoint any person to act as his deputy, he would still have power to avail himself of the services of the Audiof the States, and they could be not be considered to have any prior right to - that the 42 be appointed.",58
412,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The intention of the provision is that they shall be appointed if they are willing to act. Mr FE MCLEAN : - But it might be found necessary to have a deputy in every to devote the whole of his time to the exercise of an effective supervision.,58
413,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Such .an officer will, not be a deputy in the sense in which the word is used in the clause ; he would be au ordinary officer of the department.",58
414,Mr FE MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It seems to rae tha* the Auditor-General would be given a wider scope if he had power to appoint any person to be his deputy, whether the Auditors-General of the State were or were not unwilling to act.",58
415,Mr DEAKIN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The Auditor-General of a Sfcate isfcheman fco whom the duties comtempi ated in the clause could best be assigned, because he would - be the officer most capable of' discharging them,' and could discliarge them without interfering with his ordinaiy duties. Clause agreed to. Clause 11 (Auditor-General may appoint persons to inspect).",59
416,Mr HTJME COOK,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," This clause'provides thatTlie Auditor-General may by writing under his band appoint any person to inspect, examine or audit. Do I understand that he is to have power to appoint any person outside the service to be an examiner' or an inspector? If'.so, will these persons come under the control of Parliament ?",59
417,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"-They cannofc be paid unless the money is voted by Parliament. The Government will ""have absolute control over the appointments.",59
418,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,When they have done the work we must pay them.,59
419,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,But if Parliament is to vote the salaries of these persons; why should the Auditor-General have the right to appoint any one he likes ? That would be irresponsible Government.,59
420,Mr HUME COOK,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That is the point I wishfcoraise. Would it not be advisable, and even necessaiy, in view of the extensive concerns of the Commonwealth, to appoint permanent inspectors or deputy auditorsto travel from State to State under the authority of the Auditor-General, inspecting and auditing the accounts offcheCommonweal fch?",59
421,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The object of the clause is to enable the Auditoi - General to appoint an oflicer-say , in the Customs departmentor in the Post-office departmentto make an investigation, or an audit, or some special inquiry; but I am willing, in order to get rid of any doubt as to the possibility of the exercise of patronage by the Auditor General, to insert the words "" with < the approval of the Treasurer.""  understood that the Auditor-General will appoint all his oflicers-that the Governor in Council will exercise no authority in regard to their appointment ?",59
422,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,No ; oflicers will be oflicers in the public service. Mi'. PIESSE - I think there is something in the - objection raised by the honourable member for Lang-that we should not tie the Auditor-General down to the appointment as deputies of the Auditors-General of the States.,59
423,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The clause that we are discussingdoes not deal - with the ordinaiy appointment of officers. Appoint, in the sense in which it is used here, means practicallv ""direct"" or ""require.""",59
424,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I think that very f u ll latitude should be given to the Auditor-General. He may have to inquire into a question of stores, or into some matter in regard to which he cannot find an absolutely unprejudiced officer in the service. I take it that he will keep only a staff for accountancy - purposes, and may therefore require, from time to time, the services of experts to make investigations into matters connected with the public service. That being so, I think it would be unfair, when he wants the unprejudiced opinion of the best expert available, to compel him to appoint a member of the public service.",59
425,Mr HUME COOK,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,But the appointment should have the approval of the Treasurer.,59
426,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That may be. We must recollect that the Auditor General is to be the guardian of Parliament, and a check upon the Treasurer - If we put a man in whom we have absolute trust into the position, we must allow him a free hand to safeguard us against maladministration in theTreasurv or any other department.",59
427,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Tasmania). I hopefchatfcheTreasurer will not insert the words he has suggested. We desire to make the Auditor-General as independent ,; as possible. He is to be supreme in all matters of accounts, and a check upon Ministers. That, I think, is how the office is regarded in every countiy where there is any system of audit. To say that any appointment which he reay make should be subject to the control offcheTreasurer seems to mefcoreverse the whole position of things, and to sap his independence by making him to some extent dependent on the Treasurer, on whom he is to be a check.",59
428,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I desire to give him the widest powers.,59
429,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Then the all his right honourable member sliould not insert in the clause any words which will whittle down his authority and independence.,59
430,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," We might have one Treasurer coming in after another who might desire to he too critical, or to disparage some of the operations of the Treasurer, but it would not be right to allow him to dictate to the Auditor-General as to what officer he should appoint to inquire into any matter that might have to be brought under the review of Parliament.",60

There is a great deal in what the honourable member for Wentworth, and the right honourable member for Tasmania have said, and I do not press the point. Clause agreed to. Clause 12 agreed to.

435,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," The clause provides that the Auditor-General shall be entitled to lay a case before the Attorney General, and that the Attorney-General the shall give a written opinion on such case. The ordinary course would be for the carried Attorney-General to give that written opinion Revenue Pund. to the Government; but if it is intended that the opinion should be given direct to the Auditor-General, the clause requires some amendment.",60
436,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Thaf c will be p.ro vided if we amend the clause so as to make to read "" give him a written opinion."" Clause amended accordingly, and agreed to. Clauses 16 to 19 agreed to. Clause 20 (Treasurer may agree to any bank in conducting business).",60
437,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Northern Melbourne) I should like to know if it is clauses 21 and 22 that the agreement therein provided for should be with only one bank at a ti me.

438,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Would not the Acts Interpretation Bill apply here ?,60
439,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It is not contemplated to have only one bank.,60
440,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Althoug h the singular number is used in referring to a bank, the plural number is used in clause 21 in refering to subdivisions.",60
441,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"We could not say "" under such subdivision.""",60
442,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"At any rate I think we should make it clear that the Treasurer may make agreements with more than one bank. I only make this as a suggestion to the draftsman, and have no intention of submitting an amendment.",60
443,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," It does not quite come within the scope of this Bill, but it is a matter of great public interest as to .the arrangements which the Government have made, or intend to make, in regard to the Government accounts. I do not want to invite the Treasurer to make a statement on the subject just now, unless some arrangement has been completed.",60
444,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I previously answered a question on the subject. Negotiations are pending, but they are not Clause agreed to. Clauses 21 to 29 agreed to.

445,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Northern Melbourne) I should like to know if this clause is on the same lines as existing Audit Acts, because it seems to me to involve a technical difficulty as to trust accounts. , The clause Says, first of all, that all trust moneys unclaimed for six years shall be carried to the intended by consolidated revenue fund.",60
446,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"There is a similar practice in all the States, though in some used in States the period is two years.",60
447,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"But suppose the Comtook land for any public purpose, belonged to an infant, and that infant for six years did not claim ?",60
448,Sir GEOROE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"An infant is protected,",61
449,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I know that sub-clause (2) deals with that, but the difficulty is that it usually happens there are trustees for an infant, and an infant ought not to be bound because the trustees have not claimed. The person entitled to receive is the trustee and not the infant.",61
450,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The trustee will have to be an infant to get the benefit of it .,61
451,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Exactly . I do not know , how the clause has worked. Governments are always honest and so forth, but it seems to me that some broader words in sub-clause (2) will be necessary, sucb asAncl no tine during which a person interested in such ,iiim shall be an infant shall be counted so far as regards his interest.",61
452,Sir GEOROE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If we left out word ""receive"" it might meet the difficulty. Sub-clause (3) will always be a safeguard, be. cause the money will be paid over to the person entitled, infant or no infant.",61
453,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I do not see that subclause (3) will meet the case. The clause is all right, except as to the words "" entitled to receive."" I do not propose any amendment, but simply ask the Treasurer to make a note of the point.",61
454,Mr BEID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Would the words "" entitled to the benefit of such sum"" meet the case 1",61
455,Mr CBOUCH,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I would like to ask the Treasurer if it is not the practice in England to put moneys received, in this manner towards the repayment of the national debt ? I understand that unclaimed trust moneys are there devoted to that purpose, and it might be a good thing to follow that example in the Commonwealth.",61
456,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"- I have not considered the question, but very few sums fall in in this way.",61
457,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Anc l only very small amounts when they do. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 1 No money shall be drawn from the Commonwealth Public Account except in the manner provided by this Act.,61
458,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Northern Melbourne) The words used in this clause are very like thoss of the Constitution Act ; but has the Treasurer considered whether they conflict with the Constitution ?,61
459,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,That is the mode of getting the money out. Under the Constitution no money can be got except under an appropriation made by law.,61
460,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I can quite understand the two things might be consistent, ancl that we might have the conditions of the Constitution A ct in addition to the conditions of this Bill.",61
461,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"This is the Commonwealth Pubhc Account, which consists of more than what is referred to in the Constitution Act. The Constitution Act deals with revenue, but this deals witli revenue, trust.moneys, and loan moneys.",61

465,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,I am speaking of the loan moneys to which the honourable and learned member for Corinella referred.,61
466,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I looked^ into this question, and in the first instance I thought that "" moneys "" covered all moneys ; but on looking further into it I satisfied myself that "" moneys "" means moneys in the nature of revenue.",61

469,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That is done with ordinary Estimates. These were not. Estimates we were dealing, with to-night, hut simply a schedule I circulated for the formation of honourable members. It will not: occur again, the plan having been-adopted to meet the exigencies of the situation.",62
470,Mr MCCAY,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," This clause seems to me to conflict with the practice we have already laid down as to Appropriation Bills in regard to the-relations between the two Houses. AVe declared in a recent Appropriation Act that the moneysweregranted by the House of Representatives, and this clause seems to contradict the decision of the House as to what is really done by us in Committee of Supply.",62
471,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The clause simply provides for laying the Estimates on the avoid table of the Senate, and giving honourable senators there a little more information than they get at present.",62
472,Mr FE MCLEAN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," It seems to me that the honourable and learned for Corinella is not quite correct, though I scarcely think he is serious. It is quite clear that it is after the passing of the Estimates by the House of Representatives that the Appropriation Bill is introduced, so that strictly speaking the clause upholds course we have already adopted.",62
473,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I point out that the clause goes very much further, and will invoke a deadly conflict between the two Houses if it be passed as-it stands. There is a provision that after the House of Representatives has passed the items of the Estimates, the amount thereof ""shall be included in an Appropriation Act."" I am afraid that would raise a very serious conflict between the two Houses. The expression "" Bill "" would have been better, because the clause as it stands would make it absolutely necessary that the item should be included in the AppropriaBut tion Act whether the Senate liked it or not.",62
474,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,It would not bind Parliamight m et.,62
475,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"No , but I say the expresby sio used is evidently the wrong one.",62
476,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Northern Melbourne) I had meant to refer to this clause, and would like to know whether it was drawn before or after the recent discussion tween the two Houses with regard to the practice on Money Bills.",62
477,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"It - was drawn before. It is the AVestern Australian practice, and that is the only State in which I know it to be the practice.  in- have the whole-Estimates as a schedule to the Appropriation Bill.",62

It is not the Act of the Auditor-General, but of the Executive, who naturally present the Estimates to the House.

480,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Jus t so, but I want to 1 friction if I . can. The clause provides the "" Annual Estimates-shall be submitted to the House of Representatives."" Is that the correct expression, seeing.that the Estimates . are always .put, not before the House; but member before a committee of the House ?",62
481,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"But-the committee report to the House. The Estimates are introduced in Committee of Supply, and reported to the House.",62
482,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The Estimates are submitted the to the. House by message from His Excellency the Governor General, and the House would sends them to the committee.",62
483,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I agree that the amounts, after we have' settled what they shall be, shall appear in an Appropriation Bill, and I apprehend "" Bill "" would be the correct-term.",62
484,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I put this clause in for the purpose of showing that it was the intention to .do whathas not been the practice in most of the States, namely, that at the same .time the Estimates were presented to the House of Representatives, a copy was to be placed on the table of the Senate, as is the law in AVestern Australia. the clause, with the verbiage, might possibly raise some difficulty. Another place think we were doing something which might infringe their rights and privileges saying that the amounts had to be placed in an Appropriation Act or Bill, and under the circumstances I do not think anything I would be gained by this clause. As a matter of courtesy, we can always lay a copy, beas I believe we shall, on the table in another place, and I think it would be wiser to omit the clause altogetlier. Clause negatived.

487,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," This clause raises some v e i y serious problems. I apprehend that it is intended to be an appropriation, and an appropriation for all purposes, for the ordinary annual services and all other services. Sir GEOEGE TURNER * - It is l i m it e d .",63

492,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"If it does satisfy section 83 of the Constitution, it ought, then, to But the W it h a view of preventing any d if f i c u l ty hereafter, I ask whether it is contemplated that the Senate may amend clause 36, because if it is an time in respect of all salaries, for appropriatio n - for the ordinary annual services, that Chamber has no right to amend These are interesting problems at of the beginning of our constitutional career, for but it is always well to look ahead and see j'ear and where we are going. These questions w o u l d not arise under a State Constitution at all . But we are placed in this difficulty. In the place, we can disburse money from the only by an A p p r o p r i at i on Act . This daj' is intended to provide for the absence of an for any o r d in a i y appropriation.",63
493,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,To enable us to c a n y on for one month with o u t getting Supply.,63
494,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"But still we have to obey the Constitution. If it is not an Appropriation Act ""we cannot draw money. If it is an Appropriation Act for the ordinary annual services, it must stand without any other provision, and if it is an Appropriation Act for the ordinary annual services, it must not be amended by the Senate, so that altogetlier this is a matter which requires a little consideration.",64
495,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I think that my honourable friend the Treasurer will see that the remarks of the honourable and learned member for' Indi, so far as the scope of sub-clause (c) is concerned, are well founded, because the provision is not that the items shall be confined to the clauses specified, but that the whole amount shall not exceed the equivalent amount for the services specified--tw o very difierent things. There is no doubt that this will be a permanent appropriation clause, when the contingency arises for which it provides, but so long as we confine it to the ordinaiy annual services, by making the provision clearer, then I do not see that the Senate, unless it disapproves of the clause altogether, will have any occasion to amend it . That House certainly would amend it if it went up in its present form.",64
496,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Would the Senate have the right to amend it 1,64
497,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"In its present shape this would not be an appropriation for the ordinary annual services of the Government, but something more, and therefore the Senate would have the right to amend it . Therefore, I suggest that it should be confined, as the intention is to confine it, to ordinary annual services, in which case they would have no right to amend it .",64
498,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Then there is another question which arises under section 54 of the Constitution, namely^ whether it should be joined with other provisions.",64
499,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"I think that all these pro- protection is accorded. visions must be read not so, much in a technical as in a constitutional spirit. This is an emergency. The object of this clause is to meet a public emergency, which will arise when, owing to circumstances, it is impossible to get parliamentary authority. If the Bill is passed with this provision in it, I fancy that there will be very little trouble over it , because we must read these things in ci constitutional way. It is a perfectly constitutional thing to provide fnr emergencies in the service of the Government. This is the only constitutional way in which that could be done, because the other alternative would be to pay money away and break the Constitution in a much more serious manner. Mr IsAACs.^There is another waynamely, to bring in a separate Bill containing this alone.",64
500,Mr REID,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That would meet a technical point in a technical way, and if it is insisted upon it may be necessaiy to do that. But I confess that I do not see the necessity for it.",64
501,Mr HIGGINS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"Northern Melbourne) I think that we should be very careful to have no further friction.. I do not say this in any disparaging spirit, but, unfortunately, the matter was .not sufficiently well thought out on a previous occasion. I would suggest that, having regard to the former difficulties that were raised, the Government might consent to report progress this evening. I do not think the adoption of such a course would involve any waste of time, as it is impossible, except in the quiet of one's room, to give this matter the calm consideration which it needs.",64
502,Mr DEAKIN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS," I was about to take very much the view which the leader of the Opposition would have taken if hehad completed the outline he gave as to the interpretation to be put upon this clause. I tliink that theargumentof the honourable and learned member for Indi is perfectly tenable, and that it is one which merits consideration. At the same time. I do not think it is by any means final. I take it that the proposed law which appropriates revenue or monej's referred to in the section 54 of the Constitution is what we all know as the annual Appropriation Act, providing for the services of the year all the sums of money, including those which have been previously advanced by way of Supply, and making provision for the definite payment of definite sums. To this certain That is a veryspecial measure each session, and it is surrounded with special protection and subject to special procedure. I do not think the provision in section 83, that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under an appropriation made bj' law, covers identically the same ground. The special provisions made in regard to the annual appropriation of the year do not necessarily cover all appropriations at all their stages, though at last thej' are all collected there. When honourable members look at the clause before them, they - will realise the gulf which separates it from the annual appropriation, with its elaborate schedules, its precise grants of money for specific purposes, at the conclusion of the parliamentary session, or at oil events finally allotted as the expression of the will of Parliament in regard to the maintenance of the ordinary annual services of the year. What is this? This is an Enabling Appropriation Act. It ' is an appropriation of a different class andcharacter from that which is specially referred to in section 54. This is, to use a word which I think the leader of the Opposition employed just now, on emergency appropriation, provided in advance, the amounts for which are not specified, although certain limitations arc imposed as conditions upon which this grant of power is made, as being exercised only in certain exceptional emergencies. But there is not and cannot be more than the general limitations here set down. There can be no specific amounts, no specific votes at this stage. Any sums expended under the authority convoyed by this section require to be again authorized by the Appropriation Act referred to in section 54. These sums are temporarily advanced, and temporarily expended, and will need to be authorized by the vote of Parliament afterwards - takin",64
503,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Supposin g that Parliament refuses to authorize them ?,65
504,Mr DEAKIN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,That is a case in which the Executive Government has to take the responsibility.,65
505,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,What is the use of getting an appropriation if it is not effective ?,65
506,Mr DEAKIN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"for ' the reason that on appropriation regularizes our procedure, and brings it into accord with the universal practice. This provision is only to be used on an emergency in which it is not possible to follow the ordinary practice, and when circumstances have arisen which otherwise render a breach of the law inevitable.",65
507,Mr FISHEK,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Does the honourable and learned member think that it is necessary at all?,65
508,Mr DEAKIN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Yes .,65
509,Mr FISHER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,Why not ask for three months instead of one month ?,65
510,Mr DEAKIN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"That is not our difficulty. The provision does not apply to ordinary times, but to a temporary appropriation at the beginning of a new financial year, or a time when for some reason or other Parliament is suddenly dissolved before passing an Appropriation Act, although the Estimates may have been partly dealt with. This is a measure which enables temporary emergency payments to be made until the new Parliament meets and passes an Appropriation Act.",65
511,Mr FISHER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,A month would not get over that difficulty.,65
512,Mr DEAKIN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"This helps over that difficulty. At all events that is the Treasurer's calculation, and he is responsible for it. He considers that this would meet certain emergencies that occur rarely and at long intervals in our colonial history, and also those repeated each year.",65
513,Mr FISHER,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,But we could not get an election - over in a month and have au Appropriation Act passed.,65
514,Mr ISAACS,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,The time is not the question at present.,65
515,Mr DEAKIN,STATE LAWSAND RECORDS,"The Treasurer considers that the term indicated is sufficient.' What I put to the honourable and learned member for Indi is that, although this is an Appropriation Act it is not an Appropriation Act within the scope of section 54, and that constitutionally interpreted, although it comes within section 83, yet, nevertheless g into account the fact that it is a temporary appropriation for a temporary emergency which is afterwards to be validated and regularized-w e need have no fear that its inclusion in this Bill will expose us to any' difficulty. That leaves one question that I have not yet touched upon, namely, that of policy. In dealing with a matter of this kind, in which possible differences of opinion may occur between ourselves and members elsewhere, the question is whether it might not be politic to follow a course which, at all events, may seem to them to be more considerate. It - may be of advantage to take a little while to consider that matter, and under the circumstances I shall be happy to fal l in with the request of 'the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and report progress, so as to afford members an opportunity of thinking over these interesting problems. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.17 p.m.",65
