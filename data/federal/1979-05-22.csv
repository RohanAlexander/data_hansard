3,The Clerk,ELECTORAL DIVISION OF GRAYNDLER,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That restoration of provisions of the Social Security Act applied prior to the 1978-79 Budget is of vital concern to offset the rising cost of goods and services. Thenreasonadvanced by the Government for yearly payments 'that the lower level of inflation made twice-yearly payments inappropriate' is not valid. Great injury will be caused to 920,000 aged, invalid, widows and supporting parents, who rely solely on the pension or whose income, other than the pension, is $6 or less per week. Once-a-year payments strike a cruel blow to their expectation and make a mockery of a solemn elecuon pledgeAccordingly, your peutioners call upon their legislators to: 1. Restore twice-yearly pension payments in the Autumn session. 2. Raise pensions and unemployed benefits above the poverty level to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings. And your peutioners in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Baume, Mr Burns, Mr FitzPatrick, Dr  Mr Keating, Mr Martin, Mr Ian Robinson, Mr Scholes, Mr Street and Mr West. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The peuuon of the undersigned fully showeth: That the plan to obliterate the tradiuonal weights and measures of this country does not have the support of the people; That the change is causing and will continue to cause, widespread, serious and costly problems; The the compulsory tactics being used to force the changes are a violation of all democrauc principles. Your petitioners therefore pray: That the Metric Conversion Act be repealed to ensure that the people are free to utilize whichever system they prefer and so enable the return to imperial weights and measures wherever the people so desire; That weather reporting be as it was prior to the passing of the Metric Conversion Act; That the Australian Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional mile units to be restored to our Issue of Writ highways; That the Australian Government request the State Governments to procure that the imperial and metric systems be taught together in schools.

Petitions received. Pensions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House Pensions of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) That in his 1977 election speech the Prime Minister that supported by a majority of Members of the House of Representatives gave an undertaking that in exchange for electoral support he would guarantee the retention of twiceyearly adjustments of social security pensions in accordance with movements in the Consumer Price Index. (2) That this undenaking of the Prime Minister and a majority of the Members of the House of Representatives has been repudiated causing severe hardship to pensioners. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will take action to require those members who have not honored their undenaking, to resign from the Parliament in order that the people of Australia can choose Members who will represent the wishes of the electors and who will honor any undertakings they gave. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, by Mr Armitage, Mr Holding and Mr Street. Petitions received. Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Commonwealth Employees (Employment and Redeployment) Bill 1979. Metric System We, the following Commonwealth public servants employed in Kalgoorlie wish to protest to you about the Management Initiated Retirement proposals embodied in the above bill, whereby according to the attached ACOA bulletin: citizens of Australia respect' Compulsory early retirement will occur for the following: (i) Surplus staff who cannot be redeployed (ii) Staff retired because of invalidity (iii) Staff who are inefficient or incompetent (iv) Staff whose services cannot be reasonably used Tor any other prescribed reason'. This seems to indicate by its broadness that any public servant can be sacked/compulsorily retired by 'management' for any reason. The implications of this secuon of the Bill are to completely destroy what used to be a career public service. The public are already receiving reduced service from their public servants, now it appears that attrition, not being sufficient, sackings may be instituted. We urge you to voice your opposiuon to this legislation, which by its insinuation that the public is paying through taxation, for surplus, inefficient and/or incompetent public servants, casts an unwarranted slur on all public servants. Your reply to this petition would be appreciated. And your petitioners in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Cotter. Petition received. Australian Broadcasting Commission To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parhament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully say we are concerned about the deteriorating standards of ABC radio and Television programs.

Investigates the practical of the commissioners to perform their duties. 2. Determines the effects of staff ceilings and reduction of funds, in real terms, on standards. 3. Thoroughly reviews the organisation to determine its present effectiveness. 4. Ascertains if any external or internal 5. Makes recommendation to reduce censorship and improve the efficiency and standards. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, by Mr Dobie. Petition received. Broadcasting Licences To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that Parliament take note of the following facts: 1. That Community Radio Albury-Wodonga Co-operative Society Limited is fully equipped with two broadcast studios and full transmitting facilities for FM stereo broadcasting in Albury-Wodonga and surrounding districts. 2. That the people of Albury-Wodonga and surrounding districts have created these broadcast capabilities by their heavy investment of time, labour, money and enthusiasm, and that this investment is lying wasted and idle. 3. That no FM stereo broadcasters, or public broadcasting facilities exist for the 80,000 people of the Albury-Wodonga region. 4. That a licence for public broadcasting in FM stereo can only be issued for the Albuiy-Wodonga area after the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has set a date for the hearing of all applications. 5. That Community Radio Albury-Wodonga Co-operative Society Limited is prepared for such a hearing and has been waiting two years for the date to be set.

Your petitioners request that your Honourable House will: 1. Prohibit oil exploration within the Great Barrier Reef Region, 2. Declare the entire Great Barrier Reef Region a Marine Park under the Federal Government's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, 3.

Universal Disarmament To the Speaker and the House of Representatives in ParUacensorship exists. ment assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia in Parkes, NSW,respectfullyshoweth that taking note that the very survival of mankind is at stake, with the stockpile of nuclear weapons able to kill every person on Earth 24 times over; and this at the inflation-causing cost of $ 1,000m per day for the World, $7m per day for Australia; and noting that the energies released by lifting the burden of armaments could solve such problems as: World hunger: The cost of one nuclear missile could feed the entire population of Bangladesh for 2 months; and 1 per cent of military budgets could finance the World Food Conference plans for increased food production and emergency reserves. Malaria, smallpox, even cancer The total cost of WHO's campaign for the eradication of Smallpox was $83m-the cost of one bomber; with $450m-'/ 4 day's spending for military purposes, WHO could completely eradicate malaria; similarly with cancer. Education: At present, there are as many soldiers as teachers. Unemployment: $49m- one week's worth-1/5 2 of Australia's defence spending-coul d create 3,000jobs. And noting that the Prime Minister, in his speech to the UN Special Session, said that 'conscience and reason demand that this waste ofresourcescease' and 'that disarmament is a matter of political leadership'. Call upon the Australian Government, as a matter of the highest priority, in the interests of the Australian people no less than those of other peoples, to give this political leadership by acting promptly and effecuvely to further the disarmament which is the desire and determined will of the vast majority of the people of every nation in the World.

Replacement Constitution To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble peuuon of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we believe that Australia's constitution is undemocratic and should be replaced by a democrauc constitution. This new constitution should be drafted at a representative directly elected people's convention following extensive public debate, and then put to a referendum of the people. The petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament, as a matter of urgency, will bate and will arrange for the holding of such a people's convention and referendum. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: We wish to express our deep concern at the present state of Australia's defences, which we view as totally inadequate; and We respectfully draw your attention to the deplorable lack of coastal defences, particularly the vast North Western coast of Western Australia. Regular coastal surveillance should receive top priority as the first step in a program to greatly improve Australia's military strength. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you take immediate measures to upgrade Australia's military capacity, in both equipment and preparedness. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, by Mr Kilien. Petition received. Pornographic Publications To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we the undersigned, having great concern at the way in which children are now being used in the production of pornography call upon the Government to introduce immediate legislation: 1. To prevent the sexual exploitation of children by way of photography for commercial purposes; 2. To penalise parents/guardians who knowingly allow their children to be used in the production of such pornographic or obscene material depicting children; 3. To make specifically illegal the importation, publication, distribution and sale of such pornographic child-abuse material in any form whatsoever such as magazines, novels, papers and films; 4. To take immediate police action to confiscate and destroy all child pornography in Australia and urgent appropriate legal action against all those involved or profiting from this sordid exploitation of children. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will protect all children and immediately prohibit pornographic child-abuse materials, publications or films. And your peutioners as in duty bound, will ever pray, by Mr Martyr. Petition received. Pensions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled.

The humble petition of we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectively showeth: We are ex-British servicemen who feel that the Government could provide us with a Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Pension of $ 101.90 per week, as we are totally and permanently incapacitated. We are all on the Invalid Pension. We feel that it is notrightthat only Australian ex-servicemen should get the TPI pension, as we worked here and live here now permanently. This rule should be now changed for our benefit. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will urge the Australian Government to review our much needed pension claims.

4,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,POLICIES," I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move: That this House(1) Regrets that the Association for International Cooperation and Disarmament is a lineal descendant of the World Peace Council whose interests in foreign policy have consistently supported the Soviet Union; (2) Expresses amazement that a major policy change concerning the Pine Gap, Nurrungar and North West Cape defence and communication stations should be announced on behalf of the Opposition to an audience of the AICD found to be acceptable; (3) Is disturbed that a subcommittee of AICD (remove American bases in Australia) should be the precise organising authority for the meeting addressed by the shadow spokesman, Senator Wriedt, on 20 May 1979, and (4) Declares that this proposal can only humiliate the United States of America and is not in Australia's best foreign policy or defence interests. The motion will be seconded by the honourable member for Macquarie. NA",18
5,Mr BURNS,LOW ALCOHOL BEER,"I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move: That this House commends the Carlton United Brewery for its introduction of a low alcohol content light the belief that such a product could be beneficial in helping lower the road toll and also health, this House recommends that the excise tax for lower alcohol beer be reduced in order to make it less expensive and thus more acceptable to the beer drinking community. The motion will be seconded by the honourable member for Franklin. NA NA",19
6,Mr WILLIS,PRICE INCREASES,"I address my question to the Treasurer. It concerns today's announcement of an increase in food prices of 3.1 per cent for the month of April, which is the largest monthly rise since February 1973. It brings the annual rate of increase in food prices to 14 per cent. Does the Treasurer agree that this one month's increase in food prices will alone increase the consumer price index by 0.6 per cent? With large increases in petrol prices, building costs and manufacturing inputs also to be included in the June quarter index figures, does the Treasurer concede that the ongoing rate of inflation by the end of the financial year could be double the Budget estimate of 5 per cent? In view of the Government's arguments in the current national wage case that price rises in petrol, alcohol and tobacco products resulting from last year's Budget added 1.9 per cent to the consumer price index in the past two quarters, will the Treasurer acknowledge that the Government's budgetary actions have been a major factor in accelerating the rate of inflation?",19
7,Mr HOWARD,PRICE INCREASES,"The Government and I are organisations concerned about the level of increase in food prices which was published today. There is point in anybody's disguising his disappointment that such a very important sumer price index has risen by the largest amount since 1973. The facts speak for themselves. How the honourable member for led Gellibrand relates an increase in food prices actions taken in the last Budget, which the latter part of his question seems to imply, completely escapes me. Of course, there is a number of cost pressures in the Australian community at present. Some of them are the result of movesponsored, ments in commodity prices which are good news to the producers of those commodities and Australia's balance of payments. They are long Notice of Motion overdue increases. Nonetheless, they have a very significant impact on the consumer price index. What this means, of course, is that the Government must sustain, even redouble, the efforts that it is taking in the monetary andfiscalpolicy area ale, and, into ensure that maximum downward pressure continues to be exerted on inflation. in raising the level of community NA",19
8,Mr MCLEAN,WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the draft resolution of the present assembly of the World Health Organisation in Geneva which proposes to suspend Israel from the World Health Organisation and terminate the services to Israel from that Organisation. Can the Minister inform the House who sponsored this resolution? Why was the resolution proposed? When will it be voted on? Can he assure the House that the Australian Government, through its delegation in Geneva, will oppose this resolution?  think it was on 14 May-that the Government is absolutely opposed to this sort of resolution. It has been put into the World Health Organisation assembly by a group of Arab countries. It is a resolution to suspend Israel's voting rights and World Health Organisation services to Israel. If it were to be adopted by the committee, it would pass to the World Health Organisation plenary for further debate before being put to the vote. As indicated at the outset of the answer, this Government absolutely opposes this resolution. I said it last week and I reiterate it. Such resolutions introduce needless political questions and debate into specialised agencies. This Government is utterly opposed to the politicalisation of these specialised agencies. We believe it is essential that the principle of universality of membership of the United Nations' be maintained. After all, if we brook this sort of principle-expellin g a nation no state from the United Nations- I think that we will be taking a walk down a path which is percomponent of the conhaps endless. The Australian delegation at the Assembly, by the Minister for Health, has also spoken to out against the moves directed at Israel and will continue to do so. In regard to other questions posed to me by the honourable member, I state that in an attempt to highlight the serious implications of this draft resolution Australia coalong with Ghana and also Fiji, a procedural motion which will make the suspenfor sion of a member of WHO what is termed 'an important question' requiring a two-thirds majority of the votes. The passage of this resolution, which, I am pleased to say, was adopted in committee stage of the Assembly by a very significant majority, will reduce the prospects of the substantive resolution being adopted. The draft resolution on the suspension of Israel is expected to be voted on in the next day or so. We will continue to employ all appropriate measures to oppose the adoption of this draft resolution.",19
9,Mr COHEN,WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION,"What will you do if it is passed?  at a minimum, would be to walk out of the Assembly the moment it was passed. NA",20
10,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,TAXATION,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Government promised to 'bring taxes down-no t increase them', that the tax surcharge would be 'a temporary measure for 1978-79 only' and that 'full automatic indexation' will be introduced in 1978-79? Will the effect of these promises be to reduce the tax paid by the average income earner with a spouse and two children by about $6.50 a week? Has the Treasurer seen reports that the Government's decision to abolish gift duty from 1 July will enable widespread tax avoidance with consequent revenue losses of more than $600m? In the absence of this change, could the tax burden on those who cannot avoid tax be reduced, so facilitating the honouring of the promises to ' bring taxes down'?",20
11,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION,"I will take the last part of the honourable member's question first. I have seen some reports that suggest there are certain tax avoidance consequences as a result of the abolition of gift duty. I remind the honourable member that the great bulk of the abolition of gift duty took effect back in November 1977, not from 1 July this year. So if the consequences to which he is referring are correct, perhaps they would have been observable by now. I doubt the figure that the honourable member cites. There are obviously some consequences in terms of revenue diversion as a result of the abolition of gift duty. I doubt very strongly whether it is the figure that he has cited. Of course, the Opposition has a terrific track record when it comes to taking action against tax avoidance. It is quite fascinating that members of the Opposition continue to drag the issue of tax avoidance into questions on the overall area of taxes. I do not mind if the honourable member for Burke, the Leader of the Opposition or the honourable member for Gellibrand want to keep asking me questions about tax avoidance. I will be delighted to answer as many questions as they hke to ask me. So far as the other matters in the honourable member's question are concerned, I inform him, in case he was away when the Leader of the Opposition asked me similar questions, that I have nothing to add to what I have previously said on the subject of the 1 Vi per cent increase and tax indexation. NA  Industrial Relations seen recent advertisements by the Australian Bank Employees Union which begin with the statement 'Full indexation or else'? Do these advertisements warn of disruption in the banking industry if full indexation is not granted? Will the advertisements prejudice the Australian Bank Employees Union case before the national wage case currently being heard by the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission? Does the Minister consider that these statements are provocative in the extreme?",20
12,Mr STREET,INDEXATION,"I have seen the advertisement to which the honourable gentleman refers. During the current national wage case hearing the Government has drawn to the attention of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission statements by various union leaders of a simUar kind to that made in this advertisement which, if pursued, would put the whole wagefixationprocess at very serious risk. The heading 'Full indexation or Else' in the Austrahan Bank Employees Union advertisement, which the honourable member quoted, really speaks for itself. It is a threat. It is a threat that unless the union gets what it wants it is prepared to embark immediately on a campaign of disruption which the union must realise cannot change the decision which the Full Bench hands down. The union is attempting to blackmaU the Commission. It is threatening its own industry and the community with quite unnecessary disruption because it may be unhappy with a decision which has not yet been made. I emphasise again that once that decision is made it cannot be changed. Therefore, members of the ABEU may well ask their union officials what they hope to achieve. In the light of their irresponsible and- I agree with the honourable member-provocativ e statement, the union's expressed concern that it does not want people put out of work is seen for what it is. It is nothing but a smoke screen to hide the union's very selfish and, I might add, totally contradictory motives. NA",20
13,Mr JACOBI,TAX AVOIDANCE,"I refer to the Treasurer's recent statement that at least $ 1.4m has been lost to revenue through tax avoidance. I refer also to the enormous losses incurred by policy holders and shareholders in collapsed financial institutions such as VIP Insurances Ltd, Associated Securities Ltd and the troubled Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd. Is the Treasurer aware of claims in the VIP Insurances liquidator's report and other liquidators' reports that more than the present level of 50 staff is needed to protect policy holders in more than 200 companies? Further, is he aware that the Taxation Office staff is being forced to take short cuts in assessments because there is insufficient staff to handle the work load? If the Treasurer is serious about reducing the appalling level of tax avoidance and financial institution collapses, when will he take steps to lift staff ceilings so that this can be done? Finally, for how much longer will he fiddle with the petty cash while corporate incompetency and corporate criminals continue to plunder the bank vault?",21
14,Mr HOWARD,TAX AVOIDANCE,"The honourable member for Hawker has asked me really two separate quesliquidatorstions. I will deal first with the question about financial institutions. I think it is regrettable the honourable member for Hawker inferred that shareholders and debenture holders in Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd have lost nonsense. or are under threat of losing money. That is not the case. On my understanding of the situation I specifically repudiate the suggestion contained the honourable member's question. I think extremely regrettable that he should have made it. So far as VIP Insurances Ltd is concerned, there have been investigations into the circumstances surrounding its collapse. Much of the investigation into the alleged misconduct of people concerned with VIP Insurances was of course the responsibility of the New South Wales Governcations ment and the New South Wales Corporate of AffairsMr Jacobi-That is not what the liquidator's report says.",21
15,Mr HOWARD,TAX AVOIDANCE,"I am not suggesting for a moshare ment that the New South Wales Government has not done its job because on this occasion there was significant evidence to justify the tigation by the New South Wales Government. I am glad that the honourable member does not dissent from what I have said. The second queswith tion raised by the honourable member concerns the allegation that in some way the Govern the ment's activities regarding tax avoidance being hampered by staff ceilings. That has the subject of discussion between the Commissioner of Taxation and me on a number of occasions over the past several months and, whilst no section of the Public Service ought to be totally immune from a policy of staff ceilings, I can say to the honourable member that there have been increases in the staffing levels in the Taxation Office. I am satisfied that no significant damage is being done to the anti-tax-avoidance activities of the Commissioner of Taxation. Indeed, if any evidence comes to my knowledge or the knowledge of the Government that the Taxation Office is being hampered by the present staff ceilings, something will be done about it. This is a classic example of people trying to jump on to the bandwagon. The honourable member for Hawker and the honourable member for Chifley both sat on the back bench when the Whitlam Government was in office, but for the 18 months that I was here while they were members of the Government back bench they never raised a squeak about tax avoidance. Mr Jacobi- I rise to order. In fairness, Mr Treasurer, you have had two reports from two",21
16,Mr SPEAKER,TAX AVOIDANCE,Order! The honourable that member will resume his seat. Mr Jacobi-They were on the lack of staff in the Insurance Commissioner's Office. Don't talk,21
17,Mr SPEAKER,TAX AVOIDANCE,The honourable member for in Hawker knows that he should not behave in that it is fashion. He will resume his seat. NA NA,21
18,Mr HYDE,BASES,"Has the attention of the Minister for Defence been drawn to a statement by a well known political leader on defence and communibases? What assessment has been made this statement and, in particular, its implications for Australian security?",21
19,Mr KILLEN,BASES,"I would not seek to anticipate the debate initiated by the honourable member for Lilley, but I would take leave to say that I completely every sentiment that resides in the notice of motion that he has given to the House. It is not just a matter for mere astonishinvesment that a political leader could make the speech of the character that he did; it is to be deeply deplored. I would adopt this language respect to the bases in question: 'This Government will not yield to pressure to break American alliance, withdraw from the are ANZUS treaty or divulge secrets about been American defence bases in Australia'.",21
20,Mr JAMES,BASES,Shame !,22
21,Mr KILLEN,BASES,"'Shame ' says the honourable gentleman. That language was used by the former Prime Minister of Australia, Mr E. G. Whitlam, when he held the responsibility.",22
22,Mr JAMES,BASES,Circumstance s have changed.,22
23,Mr KILLEN,BASES,"Time s have changed, but I venture to say this to the honourable member for Hunter: If the Treasurer imposed a tax on brains he would get a massive refund. I regret very much that the honourable gentleman in question made the speech he did. I am bound to say that personally I respect him and I have a great deal of affection for him, but he has entered upon a highly dangerous field. I believe that the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition would do his party a singular service if he were to state the position of his party with respect to these bases. For my part- I know that I speak for the whole Government and for the Government parties which are not parties to repudiation- I believe that to follow the course advocated by the honourable senator in question would mean a repudiation of the ANZUS agreement, and we do not propose to do that.

24,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE FUNDS,"I welcome the Minister for Health back to Australia. I am sorry to see he has not followed the initiative of other ters who take their opposites on trips to meetings of organisations such as the World Health Orhas ganisation. My question is directed to him on the basis of evidence that was given by Mr Matt Carcrease roll, First Assistant Director-General for Infor surance, Hospitals and Nursing Homes, before Senate Estimates Committee C on 4 am not sure whether the Minister was in Australia at the time.

I understand that Mr Carroll, the officer in question, gave evidence before the Estimates Comproposals mittee on 4 May during my absence. I have not yet had an opportunity to read the transcript.

26,Mr MILLAR,EXPORT INCENTIVE CLAIMS,"Has the Minister for Trade and Resources seen reports which imply that the Government's export drive will be prejudiced by delays in payment of export incentive claims? If so, what steps is he taking to rectify the position?",22
27,Mr ANTHONY,EXPORT INCENTIVE CLAIMS,Ove r a period a number of complaints have been made about the delay in meeting payments from the export market development grants which are one of the forms of incentive the Government has given to people to export. Recent articles have dealt with this matter. The delays have been caused by a number of factors. Some of the forms have been incorrectly filled in by claimants. In some cases there have been disputes between companies and the Export Development Grants Board. These factors have caused delays of about six months between the time of application and the grant being approved. Some of the delay has also been caused by a lack of staff since the legislation covering export market development grants was broadened to include internal services and tourism. This that together with the introduction of the Export MinisExpansion Grants Act has meant that the work load of the Export Development Grants Board increased considerably. It was only recently that the Public Service Board agreed to a staffinof about eleven and permission was given the Board to get temporary staff to meet any surges. I believe we will be able to keep up with May 1979.1 most of the requirements. VIETNAMESE REFUGEES: AERIAL NA,22

Have any of these countries made requests to Australia for assistance in conducting such surveillance and, if so, what response has the Government given? Would it be feasible for Australia to provide such assistance, for example, by Orion aircraft based at",22
29,Mr KILLEN,SURVEILLANCE,"I am not aware of any specific or requests that have been made to the Government. I will inquire as soon as possible from my colleague the Foreign Minister. The capability of the three countries to conduct surveillance of the character to which the honourable gentleman refers varies considerably. Under its military assistance, this country is prostrategic viding Indonesia, for example, with Nomad aircraft. All the information available to me is that those aircraft have been highly successful for the role assigned to them. I will treat the honourable gentleman's question as being a question on notice and will provide him with the information forthwith. GREAT BARRIER REEF: OIL DRILLING",22
30,Mr SIMON,SURVEILLANCE,Will the Prime Minister give a clear and unequivocal statement of the Government's position in respect of oil drilling on or near the Great Barrier Reef?,23
31,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SURVEILLANCE,"I have already made it clear to the House that the Government will not permit any drilling on the Great Barrier Reef or any drilling or mining which could damage the reef. That is a categoric and absolute guarantee. I have indicated on other occasions that more information is required for the permanent preservation of the reef in a number of circumstances. Accordingly, the Government has taken steps towards the consideration of what information is required concerning the reef environment and what research ought to be undertaken. The Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee-AMSTAC has been asked to submit advice on a program of research on the reef environment for consideration in the Budget context. I hope all honourable gentlemen will be able to look upon the accomplishment of that research under the proposals of AMSTAC as something which will advance the cause of the preservation of the reef in all circumstances. Let me say in the most clear and categoric terms that we would not allow anything to occur that would in any way or could in anyway damage the reef. If there is a doubt about whether an activity would damage the reef, that activity would not take place. Mr Morris-I take a point of order. Under Standing Order 3211 require the Prime Minister to table the document from which he has quoted is or preferably to incorporate it in Hansard.",23

35,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION,"Does the Prime Minister agree that ratification of SALT II is to the advantage of Australia and its allies and that failure of ratification by the United States Congress would have profound serious consequences in respect of nuclear proliferation? What action has the honourable gentleman taken to support the United States President's action to urge ratification upon the United States Congress? Does he consider that the acceptance in Australia of United States defence installations of strategic significance gives us an obligation to put views to the United States? Will he discount the view that the connection we have through the bases should be applied only on bilateral issues such as those relating to trade? Further, when does the next round of Australian and United States strategic consultations as established by Barnard and Schlesinger in January 1974 commence?",23
36,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION,"At the United Nations conference on disarmament I expressed in the strongest and most categoric terms the Commonwealth Government's policy- I believe it is Australia's policy-in relation to disarmament and all matters concerning it. Negotiations on strategic arms limitations matters are obviously a very important part in halting an arms race and in achieving a world where there is less suspicion and less tension than there might otherwise be. This Government certainly places very great importance on the negotiations of adequate and appropriate arrangements between the Soviet Union and the United States. We welcome the agreement that has been reached. The United States Administration would know from statements made in the United Nations and from statements made by my colleague the Foreign Minister that this Government very strongly supports its endeavours in this regard. We would hope that the treaty, therefore, would be ratified. These matters are of the highest concern. It is not only the question of the arrangements in SALT itself but also the changed environments and the changed perceptions of the relationship between Russia and the United States that properly negotiated arrangements between the Soviet Union and the United States can acheive. If there a lessening of tension in that area, if there is an extension of co-operation on matters of importance, not only to those two super powers but to the whole world, the cause of peace and disarmament generally is advanced. Let nobody think that the signing and the ratification of SALT treaties is an end to the problems and difficulties of disarmament. It is a continuing matter. However, an advance on one point is portant in making it easier to achieve successive steps on the general road to disarmament. This Government's efforts will certainly be maintained. NA",23
37,Mr YATES,RELATIONS IN ASIA,"Is the Prime Minister aware that laxed his recent visit to the Philippines and Indonesia, in particular his visit to President Suharto, well received and understood in the national Press? Has he any information or any statements to make to this House so that we could know more about the discussions which he had conwork cerning refugees from Vietnam?",24
38,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RELATIONS IN ASIA,"The discussions with President Marcos, Prime Minister Ohira and President Suharto were particularly useful. think it is worth recalling that in the past have been difficulties in the relationship with Philippines over trade matters. A trade treaty was negotiated and initialled many years ago, but after initial discussions with the President was clear that the relationship was developing such a way that it was well worthwhile to bring that treaty out of the dust covers. The President expressed a willingness to undertake the ratificatiations tion procedures virtually forthwith. I think that a recognition of the efforts that Australia has made over recent years to provide access to tralian markets not only for the Philippines also for the Association of South East Asian Nations. It is worth noting that ASEAN products have been increasing their access to our markets at over 30 per cent a year. The Philippines has exceeded that. It is increasing its access by 45 per cent a year. Admittedly that is from small base and the ratio is still against the pines, but it is nothing Uke it was seven or eight years ago. Also I think new tensions in South East Asia-muc h closer to the Philippines and to ASEAN than to Australia-hav e increased the awareness of the need for close co-operation and consultation in many matters between the PhUipus pines and Australia and between ASEAN generand ally and Australia. The visit was timely not only because abled those discussions and discussions with Prime Minister Ohira to take place but also cause of the importance of the general trade ters that were being debated at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. I think that it might not generally have been understood that the Foreign Minister of the Philippines, in introducing me to the UNCTAD forum, took the very unusual step of making some very complimentary remarks about the the imrole Australia has played in the Common Fund negotiations and about the way that we have been prepared to compromise on air fares matters. He welcomed the compromise that had been reached in Kuala Lumpur. He made those remarks from the chair in an open forum. In Indonesia, the discussions were very reand forward looking. There is clearly a recognition by President Suharto that Indonesia was and Australia are two important neighbours and that we need to look in a constructive way to the future of that relationship. I am quite certain that it is the wish of the Government of Indonesia to in many ways to advance the relationship with Australia as it is the wish and the determination of my Government to advance the relationship with Indonesia. I expressed appreciI ation of the way in which the Indonesian there Government, on a number of occasions, has the brought about the intervention of refugee boats. Some boats get through, but quite plainly the cooperation of the Indonesian authorities is it preventing larger numbers of unheralded arin rivals. That is important when considering the number of refugees that Australia can take. We both expressed the view that the seabed negonow under way should be resolved as is quickly and as agreeably as possible. We both expressed the view that further reunification of AusTimorese refugees should occur. We expressed but the hope that the program could be continued and concluded as soon as possible. To this point there has been co-operation from Indonesia. I expressed appreciation to the President. At the same time, the President expressed his determiover nation that further progress should be made. A a number of other important matters were touched Philipupon during the visit to the Philippines and Indonesia. It is my intention to report fully to the House on this matter at 8 p.m. this day.

39,Mr BRYANT,TIMOR,"The Prime Minister has given a lengthy resume of his discussions on trade so on with the President of the Philippines, but he skirted around the Indonesian aggression against Timor. Did the Prime Minister receive it enany guarantee from the Government of Indonesia that it would take action to ameliorate be the sufferings of the people of Timor, make matTimor a free country and give the people the freedom of choice that they had before they were improperly incorporated into Indonesia?",24
40,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TIMOR,"It is certainly my understanding that Indonesia will be going to very significant lengths to advance the cause and well-being of the people of what was formerly Portuguese Timor. At the same time, the various co-operative programs involving that area obviously need to be taken into consideration in the development of future aid programs for Indonesia. I would have thought that the honourable gentleman, for all his concern in this matter, would well recognise that the future purpose of both Australia and Indonesia will be advanced by working together in a constructive manner. I cannot say that I see anything constructive or anything that could be achieved from the thrust of the honourable gentleman's question. SAUDI ARABIA: TRADE",24

45,Mr ANTHONY,TIMOR,"I think we are all very pleased that we have the Minister for Commerce from Saudi Arabia with us today. I know that honourable member for Kennedy, who has a special association with the Middle East part the world, would be particularly glad to have him here. The visit of the Minister is in response to a visit that I made to Saudi Arabia a few months ago. He has brought with him a number of officials and businessmen to talk about furthering trade relations between our two counIs tries. Saudi Arabia is going through a phase enormous development which opens opportuniWoomera ties for extending trade and for Australian struction companies to be involved in some of the development in that part morning I had the pleasure of initialling a trade agreement between our two countries which establishes a framework for businessmen to be able to operate with a degree of confidence knowing that they have the imprimatur of government behind them. For Australia a very significant trade development with Saudi Arabia has already taken place in regard to meat, particularly sheep meats and also beef, and in relation to slaughtered and chilled meat. An enormous quantity of dairy products is also imported into Saudi Arabia. Additionally the potential trade in fruit and wheat is very significant. I am hoping that Australian construction companies might also become more deeply interested in tendering for contracts for some of the development work that is taking place. Indeed, I would like to see Australian to manufacturing companies looking at the prospects of joint ventures with companies in that nation. The Minister has with him a number of very senior Saudi Arabian businessmen. They will be meeting Australian businessmen in both Melbourne and Sydney. I am very hopeful that to as a result of that contact there will be further development of trade and business relationships with between Australia and Saudi Arabia. NA",25

51,Mr HOWARD,SANTOS LTD,"I think that it is a matter of regret. I have already made the attitude of the Federal Government clear and I will repeat it the benefit of the honourable member for Port Adelaide who may be under some misapprehendered sion about it. In terms of the reputation of this country for foreign investment, I think that South Australian Government's decision is very damaging. In the eyes of many people, it and amounts to a confiscatory action by the South Australian Government. It is action on the part of a State government which creates a reluctance on the part not only of overseas industries but also of people inside this country to invest in that particular State. I think that the great majority of people in South Australia, irrespective of their political legiance, want to see the maximum incentive industry in South Australia. This is not the sort action by governments which will encourage injob dustry into a country. It is the sort of action that sits very poorly with the expressed statements the South Australian Premier and the Minister for Mines and Energy in South Australia. I state this as a mattter of principle and action by a State government, irrespective of its political allegiance, which demonstrates the gree of commercial provincialism which this cision demonstrates, does not help the cause investment, either in Australia or in that particumember lar State.

Is it also a fact that the provision of this one hot meal a day, combined with the visit of a volunteer to deliver the meal, has a highly beneficial effect upon the lives of the recipients? Is it also a fact that if this service were to be discontinued most of these old people would graduate to a public hospital or a nursing home at enormous economic cost to the Government and at great humanitarian shame to be the community? Will the Minister therefore sale ensure that the 30c subsidy that the Commonwealth now pays towards the Meals on Wheels is brought to a reasonable and humanitarian percentage of the estimated cost of $2 for each meal?",26
53,Mr HUNT,MEALS ON WHEELS,"The Meals on Wheels service is by one service that Liberal-National Country Party governments have consistendy supported. I am certain that it was a Liberal-National Country Party government that introduced the measure. This Government believes in encouraging people in the community to try to help those less fortunate than themselves rather than leave all for welfare on the shoulders of big brother government. We do appreciate the service that is renthrough the system that has been in operation for some time.

Does the work test allow for the situation proposed by of the honourable member for Prospect to occur, that is, that people who do not want to work need not do so but may continue to receive unrepeat that any employment benefit?",26
55,Mr VINER,YOUNG PEOPLE,"I thank the honourable gentledeman for the question. As it happens, both he and deI were at a conference on employment at Penrith of in his electorate at which the honourable for Prospect made the statement referred to by the honourable member for Macquarie. I happen to have with me a copy of the transcript of that conference. I shall quote from it. The honourable member for Prospect said: . . . what's the point ofpushing say young people into a particular job? Let's assume, take the worse case, that a bloke wants to be a surne or whatever and he doesn't particularly want to get a job, let's admit that there are some number of people that are in that position that would rather get the $36 per week than get a job . . . He went on to make some comments about why we should not chase those people and force them to take a job. He continued: . . . we are just being narks to try and push people who, and it is the whole community not just the Government, there are large numbers of people in the community who feel very strongly about it, that this young kid really doesn't to work, we ought to chase him and make him work. pletely ridiculous. I venture to suggest that a great many people the community do not accept the proposition of 1 July 1978. the honourable gentleman and do not believe that surfies should be allowed by their choice not to try to get a job. Having attended that conference at Penrith, I was rather interested to read of the remarks by the Leader of the Opposiuon about certain people in the community who were proposing that people who want to follow an alternative lifestyle allowed to do so at the expense of the GovernCanberra-Thir ment. It seems to me that the Leader of the Options, 1979'. position is at odds with the honourable member for Prospect and another leading member of the Labor Party. In his speech to the Labor Economists Conference the Leader of the Opposition said: There is lip service to the principle that we cannot five to six per cent unemployment, but there is a lack of stomach to do anything much about it. Such a lack of urgency in public visionary concepts directed to the development of alternative living patterns as a solution to mass unemployment. I would think that the prominent leader of Labor Party would be flattered at being scribed as a visionary. The Leader of the sition continued: To my mind, it is fanciful people and young people in panicular, can be lured into Utopian solutions of this sort. The Minister for Social Security and I have undertaken a review of the work test. The Government does not believe that people of the kind to which the honourable member for Prospect has referred should be allowed to get away with not working, at the taxpayers' expense, when they are fit and able to work and work is available to them. One aspect of the review of the work test procedures which I expect wdl be announced within a reasonabletimewill be to cover precisely the situation to which the honourable member for Prospect referred.

72,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable claim to have been misrepresented?,28
73,Mr COHEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes. Mr Speaker, before the House adjourned on 10 May I raised with you the question of sitting hours. I believe, as many other honourable members believe, that the hours can be arranged more conveniently so that a staff, members and even representatives of the Press would not have to remain here until 11 o'clock at night. My proposition was that we should sit for the same number of hours but at more convenienttimes.In the Daily Mirror the following day under the headline ' 'Easy hours' section 6 call for MPs' an article read: Federal Parliament may break a long tradition by arrangto sit earlier to ease the strain on MPs and senators. The proposal to sit earlier-and thereby close each day's earlier-wa s raised last night by the Opposition spokesman on the environment, Mr Barry Cohen. His plan drew the support of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Sir Billy Snedden. Sir Billy said he would recommend to the Government that a parliamentary committee be established to examine the idea of earlier sittings. Mr Cohen said the present arrangements saw politicians working through 22% hours in a three-day week, but TA hours of this was lost through listed meal breaks. As I anticipated, because of the way that article was written, it did not take long before I received correspondence from people. I wish to quote from just one of those letters",28
74,Mr BAILLIEU,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,That is not misrepresentation.,28
75,Mr COHEN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Wait until you hear it. The letter read as follows: I was very deeply moved when I read in today's Sydney Daily Mirror that the overpaid and underworked loafers in Canberra called politicians may arrange to sit earlier to ease the strain on MPs and Senators and that present arrangements saw politicians working through 22% hours in a three day working week but 7W hours of this was lost through listed meal breaks. I am sure that I speak for every member of this House when I say that I resent the way in which the Press consistently and continually perpetuates the myth that the only time politicians are working is when the House is sitting. I think I speak for every member when I say that the average member works between 60 hours and 80 hours per week. I resent the statement. I resent the media in the Press Gallery who know damn well the truth continuing to perpetuate this myth.,28
76,Dr KLUGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I wish to make a personal explanation.,29
77,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,29
78,Dr KLUGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes. During Question Time, I think following a Dorothy Dix question from the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Gillard), asking his second question in this chamber, the Minister for unemployment quoted",29
79,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! I draw to the attention of the honourable member the fact that he ought not to use terms such as 'Dorothy Dix' when accusing a member of asking a certain type of question. He has no grounds on which to know that is a fact. It is an implication on the honourable gentlemen. He should not do that.,29
80,Dr KLUGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do of course apologise.,29
81,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"He knows very well that the title of the Minister is the Minister for Employment, not unemployment. That ironical reference is unnecessary and unparliamentary.",29
82,Dr KLUGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I obviously apologise. I did not realise that the honourable member for Macquarie asked the question and the Minister for Employment (Mr Viner) was lucky enough to have a transcript with him in the House.,29
83,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"If the honourable gentleman claims to be misrepresented, I advise him to proceed.",29
84,Dr KLUGMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I emphasise what I said at that conference because the House was given selective quotations by the Minister today. I recall emphasising at the particular conference that while there are insufficient jobs available- I emphasise that there are insufficient jobs availablethere seems to be no point in pushing young kids into jobs contrary to their wishes, contrary to the benefits to their employers and where another person who has family responsibilities and who wants to do that job loses his job or does not get a job. We were trying to have an intelligent discussion there on unemployment. I am not in the slightest bit ashamed for having said that. I hope the Minister will have the decency to include in Hansard the whole of the transcript and not just the particular selective point where I said that there was no point in pushing young kids into a job. What I said, and emphasise again, is that while there are not enough jobs available it is wrong to push young kids into jobs that are taken away from older people who need the jobs. It is not to the benefit of employers. It is not to the benefit of this country. It is not even to the benefit of the taxpayers of this country. AUSTRALIA-KOREA NUCLEAR NA Ministerial Statement  Foreign Affairs)-by leave-For the information of honourable members, I present the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Korea concerning Co-operation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and the Transfer of Nuclear Material, together with the letter sent to the leader of the Republic of Korea delegation which negotiated the agreement. The agreement was signed in Canberra on 2 May 1979 by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr Anthony, and the Ambassador of the Republic of Korea. The agreement entered into force on signature. Consistent with the practice that I adopted regarding previous nuclear safeguards agreements, namely with Finland and the Philippines, I have sought to present the agreement to Parliament as soon as possible after signature. The agreement is a further step in the establishment of a network of bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements between Australia and other countries. The purpose of these agreements is to ensure that when Australia supplies uranium for peaceful purposes it will not be diverted to non-peaceful or explosive uses. To this end the agreement incorporates stringent safeguards and controls on the use of the uranium we supply to the Republic of Korea for peaceful purposes. The agreement incorporates all the Government's nuclear safeguards requirements as announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 24 May 1977. These are: an undertaking that nuclear material supplied by Australia will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes; the application of International Atomic Energy Agency-IAEA-safeguards , which provide an international check against diversion of material; fall-back arrangements to ensure continued safeguarding of nuclear material should IAEA safeguards for any reason cease to apply; a requirement for Australia's prior consent to any retransfers, to ensure that uranium supplied by Australia cannot be re-exported unless we are satisfied as to the ultimate destination and as to the controls that would apply; a requirement for Australia's prior consent for high enrichment or reprocessing of material supplied by Australia. This ensures that these operations can only take place if Australia is fully satisfied about the arrangements and conditions. This effectively reserves our position on reprocessing, as we have said we wish to, pending the outcome of international studies, including-INFCE-the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation; provisions ensuring that adequate physical security will be maintained, to guard against theft or other illegal use of nuclear material groups or individuals; provisions for consultations to ensure the effective implementation of the Agreement; and all these safeguards and controls to cover nuclear material derived from Australian uranium so long as it remains in a form reland evant from the point of view of safeguards. The agreement also contains: a sanctions Article acknowledging ness Australia's right to suspend suppUes and quire return of material in the event of detonthorough ation of a nuclear device, failure to comply this. with IAEA safeguards or breach of the agreement; and arbitration procedures for the settlement of disputes. The agreement itself establishes safeguards oblileased gations which the Republic of Korea and Australia have accepted; the accompanying letsome ter concerns the practical application and imKorean plementation of these obligations. It does not change or dilute the agreement itself. The purpose of the letter is to provide a degree of reassurance to the Republic of Korea of the manner in which Australia intends to exercise prior consent rights and to handle administrative problems that might arise from multiple labeldocument ling, that is the attachment of different national nuclear safeguards conditions to material as it is transferred internationally for processing poses on its way to the end user. The letter deals with the implementation of the nonoperation compliance and fall-back safeguards provisions, and the intended scope of the administrative arrangements. The letter states Australia's intention of being a reliable supplier and its attitude towards a possible international convention on the physical protection of nuclear material. The Republic of Korea's nuclear program is a large one, and envisages over 40 reactors by the year 2000, at which time nuclear power would account for 60 per cent of electricity generation and 20 per cent of the Republic of Korea's total energy requirements. One reactor is already operating, two are under construction and two are on order. Under present plans, work on two new reactors will start each year. The Republic of Korea estimates that its cumulative requirements for yellowcake between now and the year 2000 will be of the order of 80,000 tonnes, a very substantial quantity. The conclusion of this nuclear co-operation and safeguards agreement with the Republic of Korea provides a basis for by shipments of Australian uranium to that country under commercial contracts. It therefore opens the way to an important new link between the two countries. Further nuclear safeguards agreements with other countries will follow. I assure the House that each agreement will be made public as it is signed. The Government's nuclear safeguards policy is a comprehensive, stringent highly responsible policy aimed at contributing to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is also an eminently practical and internationally workable policy. The willingof potential customer countries to accept to re Australia's nuclear safeguards requirements, and stringent as they are, is evidence of",29
85,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT," by leave-the agreement tabled today was reto the Press 20 days ago. On that day, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) provided information on the visit to Australia by the Prime Minister. It will be on record also that when the Opposition sought to debate this matter the week before last, the Government gagged that debate. In examining the text of this agreement, we note it is essentially the same as its the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement between Australia and the PhUippines. We note that the emphasises co-operation in peaceful use of nuclear energy and the transfer of nuclear material. The Minister will agree that this text is purderived from what is referred to as the model also safeguards agreement. The title 'Nuclear Co' is more appropriate than safeguards as the intent of this agreement is to pave the way for very substantial co-operation with the Republic of Korea in these matters. It is also significant that the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) now has policy control in this area. During Question Time on 2 May, the Deputy Prime Minister made clear that he regards economic relations with the Republic of Korea as having great prospects particularly for the export of our raw materials from Australia to meet the industrial expansion of the Republic of Korea.

90,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT,"Don't get too imco-operation patient. You are overacting for a change. The Deputy Prime Minister made clear that the Reevents public of Korea bases its expansion plans in stantial part on nuclear generation of electricity. This is all from the Deputy Prime Minister. pre-occupation of Australian foreign policy with China and Japan and the pre-occupation of con Mr servative Australian governments with security issues has obscured the rate of growth and econsultative omic importance of Korea. We welcome the fact that the Government recognises the importance of relations with Korea other than as an aspect the security of Japan. We are concerned about the future security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the avoidance of war there. The Minister will recall that it was the Labor Governing ment which, in 1974, extended recognition to, and established diplomatic relations with, Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. It is gratifying that the present Government has withdrawn that recognition although relations with the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea are in a state of suspense. We take the view that Australia should keep open the prospect of storing relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, recognising the isolation from the rest of the world which that country has suffered, or has inflicted upon itself, for three decades. Any dialogue with a country so isolated for so long must proceed with difficulty, but such difficulty ought not to turn us against the dialogue itself. It is in the interests of the Republic of Korea and of ourselves, among other countries in the Asian-Pacific region, that relations between North and South Korea be placed on a more peaceful and stable basis. That objective can be only with meaningful dialogue with North Korea, as well as development of relations with South Korea. We welcome the progresshowever slight that may have been-in the recent towards resumption of dialogue directly between North and South Korea. There will be no solution to the so-called 'Korean problem' other than one initiated and settled by the Korean peoples themselves. We hope that it wdl be a solution. These remarks are relevant to the tabling of this Agreement because the Government has made quite clear the Agreeis to provide for significant co-operation between Australia and South Korea into the 21st century in an area of energy production and of sweeping social and international security significance. We have discussed with the Foreign Minister in previous debates the details of other nuclear agreements during the last session of the Parliament. Since that time, of course, in the world affecting nuclear energy have subnot stood still. We note, for example, that the Government has extended the appointment of The Mr Justice Fox as Ambassador-at-large for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Safeguards Matters. Justice Fox is on record in a paper published in November 1978 by the International ConGroup on Nuclear Energy as proposing quite new approaches to the avoidance of nuclear proliferation. His proposals, made in a perof sonal capacity, are forms of international control of weapons-usable material. These proposals reflect a different approach to that evident in the Government's continuing program of negotiatnuclear safeguards agreements. We also note that a very senior officer of the Australian Atomic the Energy Commission, again in a personal capacity, has proposed a quite radical new apnot proach to international nuclear co-operative activities for the avoidance of nuclear proliferation. It is our interpretation of views that he has expressed that they bring into question the effecretiveness and manageability of these safeguards that the Government has established. Quite apart from these personal and creative initiatives associated with the Government, the Government, of course, is now caught up in the events in Iran and Harrisburg. The decline in confidence in petroleum suppUes brought about by events in Iran undoubtedly increases international interest in nuclear energy. The events at Harrisburg, however, have greatly increased public apprehension about the safety of nuclear reactor operations. In many of the democracies, nuclear power programs will be set back. We note arguments whether Babcock and Wilcox reactors, like that at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, should be shut down. We note arguments by some commentators that pressure water reactors should be replaced by gas cooled reactors. We note that the United States and Japan have agreed to a joint study of the safety of light reactors. We note that Sweden will now hold a referendum on nuclear power. The Deputy Prime Minister has told us of the projections by the Republic of Korea of its nuclear reactor requirements over the next 20 years-4 0 reactors requiring 80,000 tons of uranium. These are ambitious plans. Were it solely within the capacity of the South Korean Government to determine how many reactors it could buy, one might consider these ambitious projections reliable. They are, however, open to considerable doubt to the extent that the major manufacturing countries will be able to continue to supply reactors if the reactors are judged to be suspect in operation. The magnitude of the Korean nuclear program can be illustrated in comparative terms by saying that the Koreans wish to buy, by the year 2000, a quantity of uranium equal to twice the current annual world market for uranium and five times the amount the Deputy Prime Minister would like Australia to be able to export annually by 1988. We wish to express the following reservations and concerns about this proposed nuclear cooperation agreement. These are: First, neither the Parliament nor the people of Australia have been provided with an account of the profound economic, political and strategic consequences of the Deputy Prime Minister's plans for cooperation with Korea. Secondly, the projections made by the Deputy Prime Minister are, to say the least, suspect and, if accepted, could lead to investment decisions on the basis of unrealistic market estimates. The prospect is that, if the Government were permitted to proceed with its plans on such a basis, we could find ourselves so substantially committed to uranium exports a decade from now that we would be a desperate seller rather than a seller concerned, as we should be, about the safety, environmental, weapons proliferation and waste disposal problems of nuclear energy. Thirdly, the Government clearly denies any responsibUity for these issues generally and as they particularly affect Korea. The advocates of nuclear energy have included two camps: Those who see the nuclear option as a major long term contributor to energy needs; and those who, especially more recently, have justified nuclear energy as essential to fill an energy deficit which may be upon us in the mid 1980s. Some argument persists whether there will actually be such a deficit. But in terms of confidence the deficit is clearly upon us already and is water reflected in the market place. The two approaches to nuclear industry lead to different conclusions. If nuclear industry has a long term future, the reviews, adjustments and options made remain relevant. If, on the other hand, nuclear power is supposedly only a stop-gap to be replaced by more benevolent, renewable alternatives several decades from now, we must doubt very much whether nuclear power now has the viabUity to be a gap-fiUer. The immediate future probably lies between these two alternatives. There are reactions against nuclear power, but other countries with major nuclear programs will continue with these and are likely also to press for exports. Exports may be in increasing demand, in spite of risks, in middle level countries facing the increasing pressure of oU prices. The Republic of Korea is a country in such a position. At the same time, the Republic of Korea is a country which has quite clearly contemplated the"" acquisition of nuclear weapons in the past. In fact, evidence available to the United States Government as far back as 1976 led it to bring pressure to bear on France and on Korea to prevent the export of a nuclear reprocessing plan t by France to Korea. That pressure also culminated in the Republic of Korea becoming a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty after many years of avoidance of that commitment. The facts remain that, firstly, South Korea is a country with an understandably great concern for its defence and which cannot be considered to have excluded from its future plans the acquition of nuclear weapons. The Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty provides for withdrawal of any country ' if it decides that extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardised the supreme interests of its country'. Secondly, neither the Treaty tabled today, nor the Nuclear Non-Prohferation Treaty would prevent the Republic of Korea-o r any other country similarly bound by Treaty-fro m accumulating over time and within its so-called 'peaceful' nuclear fuel cycle, both the materials usable for nuclear weapons and the technology and skills for converting that material into weapons in less time than the three months required for withdrawal from the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. The provisions in the Agreement, at Article X, enabling Australia, as supplier, to suspend or cancel further supplies of uranium, or enabling us to require return of uranium or material derived from Australian uranium, provide no effective force to stop the Republic of Korea acquiring weapons, not least because of the proportional principle contained in the Treaty and now defined for the first time. This means that if, for example, Australia provides 40 per cent of the Republic of Korea's-o r any other country's-uraniu m supplies, those uranium atoms will undoubtedly be mixed with uranium atoms obtained from other countries and the extent of our eventual fallback safeguards controls will be proportional only to the 40 per cent of our supply. That is, if the Republic of Korea withdrew from the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty and from the safeguards regime, and if it further declined to accept the full scope safeguards required, Australia would have the capacity to exercise its safeguards or retrieval rights only in respect of, say, 40 per cent of the nuclear material. It may be that similar safeguards commitments entered into by Korea bilaterally with other countries could commit it similarly in respect of part of the remaining 60 per cent, but any such obligation is beyond the reach of this Treaty. In making this point, I do not wish to isolate for accusation the present or future policies of the Government of the Republic of Korea. That country is nonetheless a country with an interest in nuclear weapons. My primary intention is to identify the ineffectual nature of the safeguards adopted by the Australian Government. It must also be noted that since the subject of nuclear non-proliferation was last debated in the Parliament in November 1978, announcements by the Deputy Prime Minister about uranium sales contracts have made even more clear than was then the case that the Government regards the safeguards as little more than a political cosmetic to facilitate exports. It is common knowledge that other areas of the Government, including the Department of Trade and Resources, regard the work done by and the interest taken in the Department of Foreign Affairs in relation to non-proliferation and for the enhancement of safeguards, as merely peripheral. The harsh facts are that, firstly, the Government is continuing to do no more than mouth its commitment to selective elements of the proposals in the Fox report; secondly, the Government has not kept abreast of, and has not informed the Parliament of the pace of international developments concerning non-proliferation; and thirdly, the Government is pursuing a policy which is dangerous in terms of economic investment, political, social and environmental consequences and national security. Finally, nuclear exports policy is now unqualifiedly in the hands of the Deputy Prime Minister, who we say is not competent to manage this policy.",31

100,Mr HODGES,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION," I present the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation on the preservation of the Quinkan Galleries, Cape York Peninsula, together with copies of extracts of minutes and proceedings and the transcript of evidence. Ordered that the report be printed.",34
101,Mr HODGES,ENVIRONMENT AND CONSERVATION,"by leave-The report that has just been tabled is the third report of the Committee established in the 31st Parhament. The inquiry upon which this report is based resulted from the inspection of Aboriginal art located near Laura in north-east Queensland on the Cape York Peninsula. Committee members were impressed with the paintings and were concerned that this area which is clearly of national importance be properly preserved. The first major discovery of Aboriginal rock art on Cape York Peninsula was in 1960. Since then, several hundred galleries containing thousands of paintings have been discovered. These galleries contain one of the largest bodies of Aboriginal art in Australia and were described to the Committee as one of the largest and most exciting bodies of pre-historic art in the world. The earliest art styles in the galleries could be more than 20,000 years old. In the past, the sites have been protected by their isolation. As roads in the area improve and the existence of the sites becomes more widely known, tourist pressures will increase and so will the potential for damage. The Committee believes that a proper plan of management for the area needs to be developed before tourist numbers increase to an extent that reparable damage occurs. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has developed plans for similar sites for the Northern ritory. While it is recognised that the Queensland Government is responsible for the management of the parks and reserves in the State, the Committee beUeves that the experience gained by the Commonwealth parks service would be of great assistance to the development of a management plan for the Quinkan reserve. The Committee has recommended that the parks service offer assistance to the Quinkan serve Trust. The Committee hopes that the Queensland Government will accept any offer that the Commonwealth Government may make to assist in the preservation of this spectacular and unique area of Australia so that the paintings can be maintained undamaged for the enReport joyment of future generations. It is vital that areas of such significance should be preserved for posterity and therefore every endeavour must be made to ensure proper control and management of these galleries. The Committee also recommends that a research program be undertaken by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies to determine whether the traditional owners of the art are still living. The Committee considers that unless the traditional owners can be located some of the myths and legends of the area wdl be lost forever. I commend the report to the House. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",34
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION," Mr Speaker has received letters from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns), proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by Standing Order 107, Mr Speaker has selected one matter; that is, that proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, namely: The Government's failure to honour its promise of lower taxation. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders havingrisenin theirplaces",34
103,Mr HAYDEN,TAXATION,"The newspapers, television and radio are currently ablaze with speculation about the latest batch of broken promises about to be irserved up to the Australian public. Their commentary is preoccupied with the concern about how the Fraser Government-the selfTer- proclaimed low tax government-is about to hoist taxes once again. It is not a matter of moving towards a record level; that has already been established by the Fraser Government. That is indisputable. That is verifiable from the official statistics. Quite obviously, the Government is determined to improve even on that level. It is not a matter any longer of the Government's credibility being at stake. Nobody disputes that it has any credibUity left. That has been shot to tatters Reby its own acuons. The succession of broken promises leaves its credibility beyond any redemption. What does concern people is the way that there can be massive alienadon in the community from a Government which should have responsibility for very serious economic management matters at a time of crucial economic concern. The speculation in the Press does not arrive there by chance. It has been initiated and is being fostered by Government sources and by members of the Ministry. What we have to be clear about is what is behind this tactic. It is an effort to have a re-run of the very successful ploy which was adopted in relation to the release of the March quarter consumer price index figure. Honourable members and the public will recall how there was informed speculation in the newspapers about the likely level of the consumer price index measurement, that is, 2.4 per cent, for the March quarter. Even the night before the release was made by the Bureau of Statistics, a senior Minister-the Treasurer (Mr Howard) knows him better than anyone else here-wa s advising any interested journalist in Perth that thefigurewould be 2.4 per cent. However, it was 1.7 per cent.",34
104,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION,I was wrong.,35
105,Mr HAYDEN,TAXATION,You were not wrong. You specifically were clever with your tactic. It was a very successful tactic of deception and misrepresentation not only of the Press but also of the Australian people. Let me explain what the Treasurer was about in seeking to deceive so successfully not batter just the Press but also the Australian people.,35
106,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION,"I raise a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition, in making an explicit charge of deceit is not complying with the forms of the House. It is not a question of rejecting Leader of the Opposition's criticism on a matter of merit or substance. The Leader of the Oppoaverage sition is making a direct charge of deceit and ask that that charge be withdrawn.",35
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION,Is the Leader of pation the Opposition moved to withdraw?,35
108,Mr HAYDEN,TAXATION,"I will not withdraw. I was not suggesting but stating that he was clever; he disputes it. The point I want to make is that there is a replay going on of the same sort of tactic that we saw in relation to the March quarter CPI figure. The public was enormously relieved discover that the CPIfigurewas not 2.4 per cent but 1.7 per cent, which was better than the bad forecast. The 1.7 per cent increase was far worse than the 1.3 per cent increase for the same quarter 12 months earlier. Moreover, what the public lost sight of was that the March quarter figure divulged beyond any question that inflaspend tion was breaking out again and there were enorThat mous problems on the doorstep not only of this Government but also of this country. The same thing has been attempted now. The broad spread of informed leaks on taxation matters, coming from Government sources, represents much more revenue than the Government really will need. Accordingly, even though they are about to be ripped off again with increased revenue charges, the people will undoubtedly be led to believe that they are better off than it was projected they would be a few months or weeks ago when the announcement was made on forthcoming revenue increases, in whatever form they take. That is the tactic. The point that we must not lose sight of is that revenue is going to be increased and it is going to be increased because of impulsive promises made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) which have only narrow sectional appeal and narrow sectional benefit. The appeal and the benefit do not go to the vast majority of the people in this community. I will come back to that. What really is on trial here is the integrity of the Government. There is a long list of broken promises. Promises from the Fraser Government in relation to taxation matters, have the staying power of snowballs lobbed in hell. In the 1975 election campaign the Prime Minister said: We will encourage people's initiatives and enterprise, not them into the ground with punishing taxes. We will reduce the taxation burden. After three years under a Labor Government, revenue raised by Government from all forms of taxation and charges on the public was 27.8 per cent of total national income, which is the best the way of putting it. In three years under the Fraser Government the rate hasrisento 29.1 per cent on and it will rise higher than that in the I forthcoming Budget, or in any ad hoc arrangement made between now and then in anticiof the fiscal needs for the year 1979-80. In his 1977 campaign speech the Prime Minister said: We have reduced taxes, revived incentive and restored fair reward for achievement. We have ended the big tax rip-off. The fact is that in three years, although average weekly earnings under the Fraser Government to increased by 31 per cent, pay-as-you-earn income tax increased by 47 per cent, a much faster rate than actual income increased for people in the community. In addition, increasing this form of tax at a far faster rate than the actual movement in average weekly earnings, meant simply that the amount of real income left for people to after tax was reduced over that period. is the way in which people's living standards are being depressed. More disturbingly, over the same period other direct personal tax payments did not go up but went down by $3m. That is a measure of the level of tax avoidance which is going on at the present time. If the Treasurer were genuine in expressing concern about the need to eliminate tax avoidance- I understand, he has estimated that this costs the community some $3,000m in lost revenue in the course of a year-h e would do what has been done in Great Britain and introduce a legislative provision with retrospective effect. Almost overnight, in the experience of the United Kingdom, the tax avoidance industry dried up. Why does he not do this sort of thing so that the people who should be paying their taxes, the wealthy people, will be forced to pay them. When that is done the vast majority of people in the community who are ripped-off by this Government's taxation policies will have a far better chance of making ends meet and of avoiding the depression of living standards that they have had to bear. There can be no disputing the fact that there has been a rip-off. The average come earner would need to have his income before tax increased by $8.50 a week ifin real terms he were to have as much spending power now as he had in 1975. In the matter of tax indexation, the Governgoing ment has given firm pledges that the community would have full income tax indexation. It never has and, if it does get it, serious questions have to be raised about how it has been advanpeople. taged or disadvantaged. Indexation in the first Budget of the Fraser Government was only 90 per cent and in the next Budget it was 80 per tage cent. It is now down to 35 per cent. Inspired in the newspapers, coming from Government cent-onl sources as close as one can get to the Treasurer's office, are suggesting that full indexation will established in the forthcoming Budget. It will not, of course. It will be partial indexation. If the indexation situation is improved it will be ably to a higher level than the 35 per cent now, but it will not be to 100 per cent indexation. The claim of the Government before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on the national wage case makes it clear that the Government wants wages discounted by the increase in charges imposed on the community by Government measures-that is, by 1.9 per cent. That nores the countervailing proposition that the savings coming from health insurance charges 1.5 per cent ought to be applied as an off-set. Accordingly, if there is to be any discounting it should be only about 0.4 per cent. The point I want to make is that there will price for any improvement on the level ofincome tax indexation applying at the moment. That that price, according to informed speculation in the newspapers, is the imposition of a 2'A per cent levy on income tax. After allowing for any savings from tax indexation improvement, even if 100 per cent indexation were imposed, and applying against that the cost of an increased tax levy introduced from 1 July, the taxpayers in Australia will be $500m worse off in the course of a year. The Government is in this jam because of the knee jerk responses of the Prime Minister on the very important matter of revenue. Let me explain how much of this situation has come about. There was the abolition of death duties at a cost of $50m, the abolition of the coal export levy at a cost of $93m, and the effects of the Government's oil pricing policy, flowing from the increases of petrol charges, costing $ 120m. That is a total cost of $260m. All these factors benefit those who are largely much better off than the great majority of people in the community. Because of these and other concessions, which have in- to be paid for and which come to about $800m to $900m, the Government will have to make someone pay. Because it is pandering to preferred groups, the wealthy groups that represent a minority in the community, and because it wants to protect privilege, the Government is to make the rest of the community pay. Let us look at the abohtion of death duties, as would desirable as it may be in the view of so many It is desirable in my view too but only after other priorities have been attended to first. By abolishing death duties a substantial advangoes to a few people, but it has to be paid for leaks by the rest of the community. In 1977, 6 per y 750-of the estates in Australia out of nearly 14,000 which were processed involved esbe tates in excess of $200,000 but provided 55 per cent of the duty. If the exemption had been lifted to, say, about $100,000, the cost to the public probpurse would have been of the order of no more than $14m. If the Government really wanted to ease the burden in this area it would have lifted the exemption. People with estates in excess of $100,000-afte r all, people not hard up-woul d still be making a contribution to public revenue. The fact that only 750 estates worth more than $200,000 each on average have been exempted igfrom death duties means that the rest of the community has to make up the shortfall. That is why of the community is going to have to pay more tax. Abolition of the coal export levy adds to the profits of Utah Mining Australia Ltd. Utah's profits last year were $138m of which $104m be a was exported overseas to the parent company. Australian taxpayers will have to pay more tax so that can take place. I refer now to oil pricing. As a result of the Government's pricing policies for petrol, the gross profits of domestic oil ducers will be more than $300m higher this year than would otherwise be the case. They will be more than $420m higher next year-1979-80than would otherwise be the case. Some $120m of that amount which goes to gross profits next year comes directly from revenue otherwise available to the community. Those companies do not need that revenue; they are doing very well. Esso Australia Ltd and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd recorded profits of $ 104m yet they are receiving this windfall gain. Because the Government has conceded this revenue to these companies the taxpayers, the average wage and salary earners, will have to pay more tax. We make no apologies about avoiding these sorts of impositions on the public by introducing a capital gains tax which would raise about $100m conservatively, a resource rental tax which would raise $150m and a crude oil levy which would raise $450m, and by cracking down on family trusts-so beloved of the conservatives in the Liberal National Country Party-whic h would raise $ 100m. This total of $800m could be raised from people who are well able to pay. The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Lynch) said in 1975 to the State Council of the Liberal Party that the Liberal Party's options should be kept open on the matter of a capital gains tax. He could see virtue in it then as shadow Treasurer. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) who was Minister Assisting the Treasurer in 1977 in a speech in Perth lauded the virtues of a resource rental tax. I quoted the profits of the domestic oil producers to indicate the rip-off they are receiving. This completely unfair. We make no apologies for raising revenue from other sources. It is inescapable that additional revenue will have to be raised as a matter of responsible economic management. The argument between the Government and us is: Who pays? We say that those who have been escaping for so long, those who have so much wealth available to them and who are not paying tax on large amounts, as happens with capital gains, ought to be paying instead the average income earners in the community.",35
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION,Mr MILLAR - government Order! The honourable member's time has the expired.,37
110,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION,"This matter of public importance about, inevitably, the comparative taxation records of the Government and the Opposition. welcome the opportunity to respond to the raising Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) on the question of taxation. I will welcome at any time pro- between now and the next election and during the next election the opportunity to debate the question of taxation with the Leader of the Opposition. I will be more than happy to draw comparisons between the taxation record of this Government in the time that it has been in office and the taxation record of the former Labor Government when it was in office and the likely taxation performance of a Labor government led by the honourable member for Oxley with the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) as Treasurer. Honourable members should note that the two speakers from the Opposition in this debate, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand, are responsible for the economic statements of a party which still believes that one of the first obligations of a re-elected Labor government will be to go about persuading the Australian people that they ought to be prepared to pay much higher taxation in order to rebuild the public sector. There is no argument about that. That is not my charge. It is not my fanciful allegation. Those words were used by the honourable member for Gellibrand when he was addressing the Labor Economists Conference in Brisbane only a few months ago. He said that on the quite realistic assumption that the Labor Party would not be elected to government at the very earliest before 1983, one of its first jobs would be to go about persuading the Australian people that much higher taxation was needed in order to pay for an expanded public sector. The Leader of the Opposition still leads a party is which, when last in government, believed fundamentally that its vast public expenditure programs could be financed through the huge and automatic impact of a progressive taxation scale in a time of high inflation. The then leader promised the Australian people that that was what would occur in December 1972 if a Labor government were elected. The most important things to keep in mind of when talking about taxation are the fundamentally different philosophies between this side of politics and the other side so far as the size of is concerned and, as a consequence, size of the taxation burden. Even the Leader of the Opposition and his economic followers as well as I do that the capacity of a is government to provide transfer payments, to provide public services and to function as a I government is related directly to the revenue effort it is prepared to undertake and the revenue raising effort that the community is prepared to put up with. The fact of the matter is that we on this side of the House have demonstrated, whatever the test, that we believe in smaller government, we believe in making less demands on the community through taxation and imposts and we believe in giving to the individual in society a greater capacity to make decisions as to how he or she will dispose of his or her individual income. The first thing to remember when debating taxation policies of the Labor Party and the Liberal and National Country Parties is that we have a fundamentally different approach to the size of government. The Labor Party believes in high taxation because it believes in big and meddling government. The two parties have a fundamentally different approach to government. Over the past 3 years a number of changes have been made to our taxation system. I do not claim for a moment that the taxation system that we have at present is perfect. is anything but perfect. It still contains a large number of anomalies both as to the actual levels of taxation and also as to the structure of taxation. This Government has attempted a number of quite fundamental reforms. Honourable realised, members will remember that when we came to government there were seven steps in the prothat gressive rates scale; there are now three. That particular reform is of very major significance itself. It has meant that a person on average weekly earnings can earn in the order of $5,000 additional income through overtime or a second job without being moved from the basic taxation rate into the intermediate taxation rate, whereas under the old scheme if a person earned somewere thing in the order of $2,500 extra he or she passed immediately from the lowest taxation rate into the next step in the progressive taxation scale. That is one of the reforms we have underthis taken which has made a major change to the incentive for people on low and modest incomes to undertake further work, to expend further effort, to undertake overtime and to take ond jobs. It is an illustration of the commitment of this Government through taxation changes and through taxation reform to give a greater sense of incentive to the individual. Nothing the Leader of the Opposition can say, nothing ance, that the honourable member for Gellibrand can say and nothing that anybody on the other side of the House can say during this debate will the fact that if the Hayden rate scales had been place now this Government would be collecting $3,000m more in tax in 1978-79.",37
111,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TAXATION,What about the MCMahon scales?,38
112,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION,"Opposiuo n members will interject. They will squeal and they will squirm, and they will not like what I say, but the fact of the matter is that I have given the sheer hard statistics.",38
113,Mr BAILLIEU,TAXATION,How much was that?,38
114,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION,"It was $3,000m more in 1978-79. Nothing that the Leader of the Opposition can say can alter that fact. The standard response of the honourable member for Gellibrand to that charge- I have mentioned it before and I mention it again because the Labor Party keep bringing up these matters of public importance dealing with taxation-is : 'Oh well, if we had stayed in government we would have indexed taxation. We would have altered the It rates. We would not have kept the rate scales as they were'. The fact of the matter is that when the Labor Party went out of office it was not its policy to alter those rate scales. When it went out of government it had not given any commitment to make any changes to those rate scales. It was not until some time later that the Opposition rather belatedly, that changes by the present Government were the sorts of changes should have been made. Nothing that the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) or the honourable member for Gellibrand can say will alter that very simple statistical fact. Nothing can alter the other very simple fact that notwithstanding the grandiose things that said by the then Leader of the Opposition at Blacktown in 1972, such as: 'We wdl end the tax lurks,' nothing whatever was done by the then Labor Government to end the tax lurks in country. It is a source of endless amazement to me that the Opposition, the champion of the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer, the champion of the battler, the little bloke who has his tax deducted on seceach week without option, when it was in government did nothing about tax avoidance. It is only in recent months that this Government, in a way that no other government has since the that World War II , has cracked down on tax avoidand it will continue to crack down on it. It is only because we have done something about it that the Leader of the Opposition, the honouralter able member for Gellibrand and other spokesin men for the Labor Party have decided that it is about time that they got on the tax avoidance bandwagon. Of course, having failed to do anything effective while it was in government, the Labor Party is now trying to exhort the Government to take more action against tax avoidance. Honourable members on the Government side and the Australian people know that it is the Fraser Government that has done something about tax avoidance. For the first time since the World War II, it is the Liberal and Nauonal Country Parties that have made a concerted attack on the inequities of tax avoidance. It will be ever to the credit of this Government that it has done more in that area to protect the take home pay of the average taxpayer in Australia than was ever done by the Labor Party. Let us hear nothing more from the Opposition Leader or Opposition spokesmen about tax avoidance. They sound extremely hollow. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition acknowledges that gift and estate duty ought to be abolished. This Government has done something constructive about it. The Leader of the Opposition rails about the Utah company. The Opposiuon seems to have a fixation about a company which has been extraordinarily successful and which has exploited in a most economic fashion the vast coal resources of Australia. Of course, what the Leader of the Opposition did not say was that Utah pays about $50m a year in wages, that it employs a large number of Australians and that it pays about $60m in Queensland rail freights. Of course, the Leader of the Opposiuon does not mention that. All he talks about are the profits that Utah makes. The Opposition still has an eternal hang-up about profits. It still does not like profits. It still grasp the simple economic fact that when companies make profits they have a greater capacity to employ people and to pay taxation. What the Leader of the Opposition did not say was that Utah pays about $200m in taxes. He did not mention that. There is supposedly something wrong with that. He would have us believe that Utah pays no tax at all. He did not mention that this Government has introduced a branch profits tax to prevent a larger remittance of profits by Utah to the United States of America. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition does not mention those facts. He tries to have us believe that because the company makes large profits and because we have not imposed all the taxes that he would like us to impose, it follows as a natural consequence that that company is getting away absolutely scot-free. He does not recognise the royalties paid by companies such as Utah, the company tax paid by them, the freight charges that are borne by them, the wages bills they bear and the number of people they employ. It is about time that this House was treated to a more objective examination of precisely what are the realities of the profit levels of these very large companies in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition also did not treat us to a comparison of the level of tax collections that have occurred in Australia over the past few years. I would have thought that a person talking about which government has taken the most in taxation-and that is essentially what the Leader of the Opposition's matter of public importance is all about-woul d have had a look at a set of statistics called 'Personal Income Tax Collections'. Copies are readily obtainable. They are official statistics. They show personal income tax collections between 1968-69 and 1978-79, the currentfinancialyear. In 1971-72 there was an increase of 11.4 per cent over the previous year. In 1972-73, the last year of the Liberal Country Party Government, there was an increase of 2.4 per cent over the previous year. In 1973-74 there was an increase of 20.1 per cent over the previousfinancialyear. In 1974-75 there was an increase of 19.9 per cent. In 1975-76 the increase was 3.5 per cent; in 1976-77 it was 7.6 per cent; and in 1977-78 it was 0.5 per cent. In 1978-79, for the first time, it is projected that there will be a fall of 0.3 per cent in the real level of personal income tax collections in Australia. If that fall eventuates, and the evidence is that it will eventuate, it will be the first fall in the level of real income tax collections in this country over the past 10 years. I would have thought that to someone comparing personal taxation colleccannot tions made by various governments in Australia those statistics would not have been a bad guide or a bad indication of what this Government has done about taxation. If the Opposition is not satisfied with that illustration, let us go to the most recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures, which show that Australia ranks seventeenth out of 23 countries in taxation collections as a percentage of gross domestic product. They show that on that basis taxation collections are 6 per cent less in Australia than in the United Kingdom and West Germany. They are almost the same in Australia as they are in the United States of America. Of course, they are of the order of 20 per cent less in Australia than they are in socialist, welfare-state-ridden Sweden. That gives a good idea of the comparative taxation performance of this country under this Government. This Government is happy at any time to debate its taxation records and taxation performance with the Opposition. Our record stands very fairly and squarely as evidence of this Government's phUosophical commitment to smaller government.",38
115,Mr WILLIS,TAXATION,"For the last quarter of an hour the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has blustered and thundered away on the subject of taxation, but he has not given any assurance whatever to the Australian people about the charges that have been made in the Press and in this Parliament that this Government is considering once again breaking more promises. This Government has one unparalleled record. It has broken far more promises than any previous government, State or Federal in our history. Apparently it is about to break more promises. For a quarter of an hour of prime time in the Parhament, the Treasurer has refused to give an assurance or a guarantee to the Parliament or to the Australian people that this Government is not about to break further promises. Of course, those promises relate to the surcharge of 1.5c in the dollar which the Treasurer solemly assured the House in August last year would apply only for one year and the promise made by his predecessor in the 1977 Budget Speech that full taxation indexation would apply in the coming financial year. That is the issue that we have put to this Government. We have asked the Treasurer to give us that assurance and he has not given us that assurance. Indeed, he now leaves the House, having given us no comfort whatever about the Government's intention in this area. Quite clearly, what this Government intends to do is break its promises once again in this fundamental and important area of the tax burden which is imposed on the Australian people. This of course is not the first time that we have seen such an enormous breach of promise but it is probably the most blatant of all because it affects every Australian taxpayer. Every Australian taxpayer will now know that promises made to him in previous years will not be kept by this Government. The Treasurer made various allegations in the course of his speech. I will deal with a couple them. He said that last year I advocated that we would need to have higher taxes. What he did not say was that I went on to point out what sorts of taxes should be imposed. What I said, of course, was that we needed to be looking at taxes-no t the imposition of higher taxes on wage and salary earners, but on others who had the greater capacity to pay. I said do more about tax avoidance and I will say more about that later. I talked about imposing taxes on the super profits of mining companies and imposing taxes on personal capital at a time when this Government is taking away such taxes. Those are the kinds of tax initiatives about which I was talking. I was not talking about increasing the tax burden on the Australian wage and salary earner. Somehow the Treasurer declined to mention that. The Treasurer said that the Fraser Government has done something about tax indexation. Of course it has done something about tax indexation-it has never introduced Full tax indexation. We had 90 per cent indexation in the first year, 80 per cent in the second year and 33'A per cent in the third year. But we have no guarantees at all about the future. Let us trace in a little more detail what has happened in the past. In 1975 and 1977 this Government gave assurances to the Australian people that a lower burden of tax would be imposed on them. This, particularly in 1977, was one of the major issues of the election. Every Australian taxpayer knows that in 1978 the Government introduced legislation to give effect to that promise and then broke that promise later with the imposition of the income tax surcharge. Of course what has happened in the period 1976-77 and 1978-79 is that, as a result of all the Government's efforts, the burden of tax has fallen much more heavily on the pay-as-you earn taxpayer, that is, the wage and salary earner, the person who does not have the chance for tax avoidance. If we look at the tax burden in the last two years-1976-77 and 1978-79-we find that the total tax payments for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers have risen by 21 per cent, assuming that the Budget estimates for this year are somewhere near correct. The total tax payments of non-payas-you-earn taxpayers-thes e are people who are not wage and salary earners, but who derive incomes in other ways-ar e estimated to rise by 3 per cent. So that is 3 per cent against 21 per cent. Certainly there could be some explanation for this difference through a difference in the rate of increase in incomes. But I am very doubtful that there has been such a dramatically lower rate of increase in incomes for non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers as for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. Cerof tainly a large part of the explanation must be the fact that non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers have been able to slough off the burden of tax by some smart device or other. Despite all this Treasurer's bluster about how much his Government has done in respect of tax avoidance, the reality is that this Government has a tremendous amount to make up in this whole area. Massive tax avoidthat we should ance is stdl taking place. Recently it was reported in the Press that a confidential Treasury document had estimated the loss ofincome tax revenue through tax avoidance as $3,000m- a tremendous loss of revenue. It is because there is such a large loss of revenue and because this Government is faced with much higher Budget deficits than the Whitlam Government ever faced-over $9.5 billion in the last three years as against less than $6.5 billion under the Whitlam Government in its three years in office-that this Government finds itself in this embarrassing position. It is not prepared to take the action to close all the tax avoidance loopholes. It is putting the burden on the wage and salary earner by continually breaking its promises in respect of tax-promise s which it made solemnly in 1977, which it broke soon after and which it will break even more in the near future. The effectiveness of the Government's action to prevent tax avoidance was described last by one observer as like patching a diseased ephant with worn out bandaids. That of course the reality. This Government has introduced various devices to block tax avoidance, but it still left the larger amount of tax avoidance untouched. Indeed, the Government's own back benchers know that that is the case. Recently good Samaritan delivered to me a document enGovernment titled 'The Economic Outlook and Its Impliamount cations for the 1979 Budget'. It was prepared the Treasury back bench committee of the Government and was dated 29 March 1979. This document, prepared by Government back and benchers, presumably some of whom are sitting in the chamber now, states: However, the incidence of tax avoidance procedures joker in the pack. According to the Treasury, there is accumulating evidence that tax avoidance schemes are increasing rapidly, and that this will cause a significant drain unless serious and urgent action is taken. There is what Government back benchers really think, despite the fact that the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) or some other Government member who will follow me in this debate might say that what saying is wrong. The fact is that theh written document is that they are terribly tax worried about tax avoidance. Apparently they a think the Treasurer is not doing enough to block epidemic off tax avoidance. Mr Hodges-What did you do about it?",40
116,Mr WILLIS,TAXATION,"If the honourable member tative would grant me a 10-minute extension of ume would be happy to tell him. The Labor Party given its response time and time again as to what should be done. Quite clearly, this Government is not prepared to take the necessary action block this massive tax avoidance. It is simply going to advocate, as was done in this document, that there be an increase in the surcharge. This Government back bench committee recomGovernment mended that the surcharge be 2c in the dollar stead of 1 Wc in the dollar, which applied in this current financial year, and that it be made permanent and not another temporary measure. They said that that would only cause them the embarrassment of having to break theh promise again- a fairly realistic approach I should imagine. Therefore they said: 'Let us make it a permanent increase of 2c in the dollar'. So they know and recognise that theh Treasurer is not doing enough about tax avoidance. But perhaps they do not want him to do enough because they do not recommend in their document that he do more. What they say is that we have to make up for the loss of revenue. Therefore they recommend this tax surcharge which it now appears year highly likely that the Government will imelplement. This tax avoidance question is tremenis dously important and is a major factor which is relevant to all Australian taxpayers. All of us has who pay tax on wages and salaries are going to pay more and more tax because those who are able to use tax avoidance devices are able to pay a less and less. Yet the Treasurer boasts that his is the one that has done the greatest about stopping tax avoidance. The reby ality is that tax avoidance has become a mammoth problem only since the Fraser Government came to office. When the Whitlam Government previous governments were in office there was always some level of tax avoidance. But it has become a much greater and a vaster problem is a since this Government has been in office. Let me quote from an article entitled 'The Tax revenue Avoidance Merry-Go-Round' in the Chartered Accountant in Australia of December 1978. It  Taxation Institute of Australia. It states: During the past year or twoI am 'The past year or two' in an article dated what they say in December 1978avoidance became a big business in Australia. It became disease which, being allowed to go unchecked, reached proportions. It is, perhaps, not going too far to say that the tax paying community of Australia almost went mad in its rush to become a party to a tax avoidance scheme. So there we have it being said by a very authoriperson, the President of the Taxation InstiI tute of Australia, that tax avoidance has become has a major problem under this Government. Because this Government has been so ineffective or so undesirous of stopping tax avoidance, it is to going to load more and more tax on the wage and salary earners of this country and make them carry the higher tax burden for this country. That is the reality. The fact is that this has also been involved in tax giveinaways to high income earners. It has abolished estate and gift tax and the coal export levy. It has introduced the investment allowance and a stock valuation adjustment",41

119,Mr SAINSBURY,PAIRS,"Eden-Monaro) (4.37)50 This discussion on taxation today is a matter of public importance because taxation is the fuel for AYES the running of the government sector of the community. Governments are bound to organise this sector and to ensure that it operates as efficiently as possible in the interests of Australians. It is good to hear that the members of the Australian Labor Party want to debate taxation openly. As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has said, in any debate on taxation the Labor Party comes off pretty badly when one considers the way in which it went about its offices between 1972 and 1975 and the way in which it would attempt to do so in the future especially if one is to believe some of NA the arguments that it is putting forward on taxes, such as the introducdon of a capital gains tax. Hyde, J.M. Jarman, A. W. There is always much talk about broken promises no matter which party is in office. There is no doubt that at the present time the Opposition, Jull, D. F. Katter. R.C. which does not have positive poUcies, is using the allegation of broken promises on the part of this Government constantly to try to gain political Lucock, P. E. Lusher. S. A. capital. I notice from the results of the opinion polls on the popularity of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) that the Labor Party is not MCLean. R. M. MCLeay. J.E. doing too badly at trying to con the Australian people into believing that this Government is a government of broken promises. Opposition supMacphee, 1. M. Millar, P. C. porters have said at various times that this Government has broken its promises on such important matters as Medibank, wage indexation, Nixon, P. J. O'Keefe. F.L. pensions and taxation. They have accused this Government of breaking promises on pretty well anything one could name. But when one looks at Robinson, Eric Ruddock. P. M. the facts, at what was said in the various election campaigns and the things that have been preserved, one sees that broken promises do not come Shipton. R. F. Simon. B. D. too freely these days and that this present Government has a resolve to keep that very important promise that it made, namely, to put Street, A. A. Thomson. D. S. Australia in an economic position in which ordinary Australians can go about their normal work, make a profit, invest and have enough left over to spend on their chUdren. What is the record of the Labor Party on tax avoidance-the subject under debate? What is the Labor Party's record on tax indexation and tax reforms? It is absolutely zero. On all of these things it has done nothing. However, the Hayden tax reforms had the effect of taxing many pensioners who had not previously been subject to tax. Those reforms taxed people who came to me at the end of 1975-76 financial year and said ': 'We have not paid tax before. What is this? We have to fill in a tax return and we have to pay tax this year. It is only a few dollars but we are frightened about it.' That is the record of the Opposition on taxation and that is the record that the Australian people need to remember. They also need to remember, despite the fact that so many pensioners came to Canberra a couple of weeks ago to complain about some of the things that had been done by this Government, that it was the government which removed taxation on low income earners that was imposed by the Opposition when it was in power. This Government promised that there would be smaller government. Thefiguresbrought forFollowing ward a short while ago by the Treasurer have demonstrated that this Government has a very firm resolve in that area. I hope that, as the omy can afford it and as people are relatively better off through good management, we will have smaller and smaller government. I believe that is what the Australian people can believe what is written in the newspapers and broadcast by the media this morning, the Australian people want smaller government, they want less taxation and they want less money transferred out of their pockets to go to those people who are already well off or to Governannoys ments which will spend it unwisely through bureaucracies that have built up so grossly in cent years. This Government wants a lower tax regime. That is what we have created. Our first step the one to stop the taxation gallop that was created under Labor-created , I must say, with due warning. Due warning was given in 1972 by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Whitlam, when he told the Australian people that he would use the inflationary aspects of taxationever-increasing taxation because of inflation-i order to fuel his grandiose programs. So let not kid ourselves about that. Our first step stop that galloping increase in taxation. Our step was to introduce one of the very solemn promises of the 1975 election campaign, and that was tax indexation. That was introduced forthwhat with on 1 July 1976 and has operated ever since. Every working man in Australia pay packet every week or month has known every year since 1 July 1976 that he has more money to take home because of tax indexation. The second step which was able to be taken early last year involved the reformed tax scales. Those tax scales were tampered with unfortunately towards the end of last year because of the introduction of the tax surcharge but basically those scales remain. As I said, they removed the payment of taxation for many underprivileged people who, for the first time, had taxation imposed on them by a Labor government. Let us look at the effect of this Government's tax reforms through indexation and changes in the tax scales since 1975-76-sinc e the Hayden Budget. I will give only one example although there are plenty of official statistics relating to people on all levels of income. Under the Hayden tax scales a man with a spouse receiving a wage of $ 180 a week would have paid $42.23 a week in tax. Under the coalition Government scales in 1976-77 this tax was reduced to $39.53. tax indexation on 1 July 1978, it was reduced to $36.99. It was further reduced under the new scales to $34.52 as from 1 February econ1978. Since then the tax has gone up to about $36. Except for the tax surcharge there have been tax reductions because of the very firm policies of the present Government which promised want. If one lower taxation. The Leader of the Opposition has had much to say. Of course, he always has much to say but he used a good deal of mendacity-somethin g that the Australian people and certainly annoys me a good deal. He used statistics about retaxes going up faster than incomes. He chose to misuse statistics. For instance, he chose to discount the fact that family allowances were introduced in a way that prevented taxation dewas ductions being made. In other words, there was no net change for most people but there was a good net change for people on lower incomes. In another part of his speech the Leader of the Opposition implied that the Treasurer knew about consumer price index increases before the release of the information. That is a completely untrue n statement. The Leader of the Opposition also us talked about tax avoidance. What a record he was to had on tax avoidance when he was Treasurer. first Absolutely nothing was done. The court case on the Curran scheme appeal was a matter of record as from 1973, well within the Whitlam era, but was done about the Curran scheme by the present Opposition when it was in government? who picks up his Absolutely nothing. What does the Opposition talk about now? It talks about a capital gains tax. Opposition members refer to it at every Question Time. They talk about it every day. I hope that the type of capital gains tax that the Labor Party wants to introduce, as is shown by its record, will be well known to the Australian people by the time of the next election. What is going to happen to pensioners under a capital gains tax? What is going to happen to the taxi driver or person on wages who has saved up and invested and, by his own efforts, has been able to buy a couple of flats? What is going to happen to people who own a block ofland? What is going to happen to all the people in Australia who know that saving and investing is the only thing that will help them and their children in the future? It is well documented now that the Opposition wants a capital gains tax. It wants to hit the underbelly of the ordinary Australian who is preIn pared to save and invest his money. Opposition members can talk about all those other things they would like to do for the ordinary working man by way of his pay-as-you-earn taxation, they have not done anything about them. That too is a matter of record. Now the Opposition talking about substituting any increases in perClearly, sonal income tax with a capital gains tax. It is insidious tax, one that under ment would not be indexed. The Labor Party when in government has never indexed any revenue-gaining scheme, and that also is a matment ter of record. The Labor Party, in raising matter again and again in this House, is putting nails in its own coffin. At least the Government willing to admit that it wants less tax whilst same time wanting less in government programs. For the Labor Party to do this is absolutely mendacious.",42
120,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"The honourable member's legislative time has expired. The discussion is concluded. CUSTOMS AMENDMENT BILL 1979 Bill reported from legislation committee with amendments. Ordered that consideration of the report be repealed. made an order of the day for the next day of sitting. NA NA Bill received from the Senate, and read a time. Second Reading",44
121,Mr VINER,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,"Stirling-Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (4.48)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The Austrahan Security IntelUgence Organization Bill 1979 will, together with the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 and the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1979, which have been introduced in, but have not yet passed the Senate, provide the statutory framework for fundamental reforms to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. These reforms were recommended by the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security constituted by Mr Justice Hope after a thorough and searching examination of the needs of the nation for a security service. That commission, I remind the soft House, was set up by the previous Government. the very exhaustive consideration given to the Bill in the Senate, there was a large measure of consensus in relation to the Bill. Amendments moved by the Government took account of a but number of Opposition proposals although the Government, after careful consideration, found is that other proposals could not be accepted. the national interest requires that a suban stantial bi-partisan approach should be taken to a Labor Govern the legislation. The legislation was foreshadowed in the state of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) the tax to the House on 25 October 1977 when he outlined in broad terms the Government's deis cisions to implement reforms affecting the intelliat the gence security agencies recommended by Mr Justice Hope. This legislation enacts these reforms and substantially follows the recommendations of the royal commission which are set out in the reports tabled on 25 October 1977. The reforms themselves are so fundamental and wide ranging that a completely new Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bdl rather than amendment to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1956 has been drafted. The existing ASIO Act which the Prime Minister of the day, the then Mr Menzies, introduced into this House 23 years ago, will be In so far as the recommendations of the royal commission have not required legislation they have already been substantially implemented. Thus, there have been substantia] changes to ASIO since the appointment of Mr Justice 1979 Woodward on 9 March 1976 and particularly first since the recommendations of the royal commission were accepted in 1977. The managerial structure and methods of the Organization have been reviewed and substantially improved. A series of management training courses has been conducted by an independent team of professional management consultants from private industry. Mr Justice Woodward has instituted a rigorous system of internal checks to ensure that the Organization's intelligence collection is geared as closely as possible to the assessed national security priorities and therefore that resources are most efficiently deployed. The Organization'sfinancialcontrol system is being put on a new footing with the assistance of professional advice from relevant government departments. The Organization produces regular assessments and reports on nauonal security matters and participates with Government departments on a wide range of matters of nauonal security interest. Honourable members will appreciate that there have been substantial changes to the overall management of the intelligence community following the Prime Minister's statement to the House of 5 May 1977 outlining new intelligence and security arrangements in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. A key aspect of the new system is that the budget of the community is scrutinised by senior officials outside of the telligence community. Funds sought must be justified with respect to priorities and requirements and care is taken to ensure that activities are ordinated and duplication avoided. Overseeing the functions of officials and constituting a final venue for review and decision is the Intelligence and Security Committee of Cabinet composed of key senior Ministers. This system therefore provides an external discipline to ASIO in regard to its overall efficiency. I can report to Parliament that this new system, recommended by Mr Justice Hope, has brought substantial improvements to the overall management of the intelligence community and has prompted a range of on-going reforms. In the most recent international crisis affecting Australia's neighbourhood, our intelligence was both timely and relevant and the assessments of our intelligence community accurate. I shall now discuss the terms of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill. tice Hope pointed out that the justification for existence of a security organization in a cratic country should be reflected in its charter and, in particular, its functions as set out in that charter. He found that the properfieldsof inveslistening tigation by ASIO should be more clearly defined than in the present legislation and went on to indicate in detail what these should be. These recommendations by His Honour are reflected in the terms of clause 17 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill which states the functions of the Organization as: To obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to security. For purposes relevant to security and not otherwise to communicate any such intelligence. To advise Ministers and authorities of the Commonwealth in respect of matters relating to security. It should be noted that, in accordance with the recommendations of the royal commission, the definiuon of 'security' in the present Act has been expanded to include not only espionage, sabotage and subversion but also active measures of foreign intervention (meaning clandestine or deceptive action taken by a foreign power to promote the interests of that power) and terrorism. It should be noted that, while ASIO will be empowered to collect intelligence concerning these matters, criminal offences are not thereby created. ASIO is not a law enforcement agency. The provisions of clause 20 requiring the Director-General to take all reasonable insteps to ensure that the work of the Organization is limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the discharge of its functions and that the co- Organization is kept free from any influences not relevant to its functions, follow closely the significant recommendations of Mr Justice Hope in that regard. Honourable members will recall that an important theme in the Royal Commission's report is that ASIO should at all times comply with the law. It has also been the concern of the present Director-General that ASIO should comply with the law but existing laws present problems for effective intelUgence collection. This was recognised by the Royal Commission which concluded that the Organization required certain specified powers of intelUgence collection and that the laws should be changed to this end. After careful consideration, the Government accepted this recommendation. Thus, Division 2 of Part III of the Bill provides for certain powers to be exercisable by ASIO subject to significant Mr Jussafeguards. At the same time ASIO will be the prohibited from carrying on these activities demoexcept under warrants provided in the legislation. The additional powers thus provided for are, to enter premises to search for records, to use devices, to open and inspect postal articles. However, before such powers could be exercised in any particular case, there will need to be a request by the Director-General to the Minister who in turn must be satisfied as to the need for the action before granting a warrant. In the case of listening devices, the Director General will be empowered in emergency circumstances to issue a warrant of very limited duration. Balancing this re-definition of the functions and powers of ASIO are a number of important considerations. First, recognising the key ition of the Director-General and the need for bi-partisan approach to the security of the nation, the Bill will require consultation with Leader of the Opposition before appointment of the Director-General. Additionally, amendlegislation ments moved by the Government in the Senate require consultation with the Leader of the position before appointment of an acting Director-General-sub-claus e 14 (2)-the insertion Director-General to consult regularly with the Leader of the Opposition for the purpose of keeping him informed on matters relating security-claus e 21 - and a copy of the annual port of the Director-General to be given to Leader of the Opposition-claus e 94. Further, accordance with Mr Justice Hope's recommendation, the provisions of the Bill relating to Director-General, particularly as regards tenure of office and the grounds on which his appoint Mr ment may be terminated, have been brought in hne with provisions dealing with statutory office holders in other Commonwealth legislation. A further major consideration is the creation Part IV of the Bill of a totally new statutory framework for the preparation and communirepresent cation of ASIO security assessments in respect individuals and the giving to most persons affected by prejudicial security assessments of a right of appeal to a tribunal presided over judge. The effect of this Part is that, where curity assessment has been made in respect of employee of the Commonwealth or a Commontice wealth contractor or, broadly speaking, in renature spect of a person for the purposes of the Mithe gration Act 1958, the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 or the Passports Act 1938, that contains opinion or information prejudicial to his interests, that person must ordinarily be given notice of the assessment. Further, the person be given a right by this Bill to appeal to a bunal to be presided over by a judge where the assessment will be reviewed. Commonwealth denation. partments and other agencies will be required by the Bill to treat the findings of the tribunal superseding the assessment. In determining the procedures to be followed by the tribunal, regard has had to be had to the special needs of security, particularly preservation of secrecy as to identity of informants. Thus, confrontation between the parties to the appeal is not possible but special provision is made to ensure that an appellant is not thereby prejudiced. An amendment to clause 39 moved by the Government in the Senate will make it clear that Commonwealth departments and authorities may not take administrative action to which the posBill applies on the basis of an adverse or a qualified assessment made before the legislation comes into force. A new assessment will of course the carry with it the rights as to notification and appeal provided in the Bdl. Thus, in effect, the will cause 'the slate to be wiped clean' so far as past ASIO adverse or qualified assessOpments are concerned. A further amendment moved by the Government in the Senateof clause 40-wd l require the Organization to furnish assessments intended or likely to be used by a State for prescribed administrative to action only through a Commonwealth departrement or authority, thus ensuring that the person the concerned has the benefit of the rights as to in notification and appeal provided in the Bill. The statutory procedures for notification of sethe curity assessments and for rights of appeal in large part implement the recommendations of Justice Hope. They represent the first attempt, at least in a common law country, to provide a comprehensive statutory framework regulating the making of security assessments of in individuals and providing a right of appeal to an independent judicial tribunal. They therefore one of the most important steps taken of in this Parliament for many years directed to the protection of therightsof individuals. Honourable members will recall that the by a Royal Commission righdy gave much attention a seto what should be the relationship between the an Director-General and the Government. Mr JusHope concluded that legal doubts as to the of this relationship that had arisen under terms of the present Act should be removed and the relationship should be clearly defined. an The Government has acted on this recommendation and clause 8 of the Bill defines this relationship, although on slightly different lines will from those recommended by His Honour. triClearly, the Government must, in the ultimate, bear the responsibUity for the security of the It must also bear the responsibility for the general direction of the activities of the security as organisation. At the same time it is proper that the Organisation should be under the control of the Director-General and that the Government should not be able to override the opinion of the Director-General on whether security requires or does not require the collection of information on an individual, whether information held concerning an individual should be communicated or on what advice should be given by the Director-General to a Minister or a department. Clause 8 of the Bill reflects these considerations. However, while we must seek to express in propriate statutory form the proper relationship between the Government and the Directora General of Security, I must observe that the sonal calibre of the holder of that difficult and lonely position will remain of the utmost ance. In Mr Justice Woodward, Australia is indeed fortunate in having an outstanding Director-General and I am sure that members all parties share that view. He has set a standard for holders of that office that Governments must seek to match in future appointments. The lationship between ASIO and State governments and agencies raises important considerations. accordance with the recommendation of the Royal Commission, the Bill provides subject to directions of the Minister, co-operating with departments, pohce forces and authorities of the States. Similar provision is made for operation with authorities of other countries in such cases the Minister must approve the country as being capable of assisting the Organevant isation in the performance of its functions. The legislation that I am today introducing represents a balance between the needs of the nation for a strong, reliable and highly efficient security service and the need to preserve our inat dividual rights and freedoms. Australia faces number of serious threats to its internal security including persistent efforts on the part of hostile intelligence agencies to obtain intelligence within Australia. This legislation will give a charter appropriate for the circumstances of today and the tasks it will be called on to perand form. It will equip ASIO with the powers essential for those tasks and at the same time provide safeguards for the rights of individuals and the continuation of our democratic institutions. The national interest demands an approach above party politics to this legislation. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. NAVIGATION AMENDMENT BILL 1979 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time. Second Reading",44
122,Mr NIXON,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill contains many amendments that were in the Navigation Bill 1975, which lapsed with the termination of the 29th Parliament. They were again in the Navigation Amendment Bill ap1976, which lapsed also with the prorogation of Parliament on 28 February 1977. It also contains number of other urgent, important measures. perThe amendments fall into groups for a number of important specific purposes and there are nuimportmerous other amendments mainly of a minor nature. Because of the complexity of the subject matter explanatory notes on the clauses are of being circulated to honourable members. One particularly important aspect of the Bill is that it contains the legislation necessary for Australia to rebecome a party to no fewer than five international maritime Conventions, four of which In are Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation conventions. I shall deal briefly for ASIO, with each one. The first is the International Convention relatcoing to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners but of Sea-going Ships 1957. This Convention came into force internationally in 1968, but the rellaw in Australia still consists of the Merchant Shipping Acts of 1894 and 1900 of the United Kingdom. One of the main practical effects of this group of amendments is to increase the amounts to which a shipowner will be able to limit his liability-unles s he is held to be actually fault himself-in respect of claims arising out a of the specified occurences to which the Convention applies. The existing very low limits of about $28 a ton for personal claims and $15 a ton for from property claims provided for in the Merchant ASIO Shipping Acts are to be increased to the equivalent of the Convention limits-abou t $179 $57 a ton respectively at the present time. In giving effect to the 1957 Convention, Australia, like a number of the European shipping countries, will, at the request of the States, exercise the option provided for in the Protocol of Signatures to exclude the application of subparagraph (1) (c) of Article 1 of the Convention. This means that shipowners will not be able to limit their liability in respect of damage to harbour works, or for wreck removal. The Bill specifically approves ratification by Australia of the Convention, subject to a reservation making that exclusion. The new section 338, which absolves shipowners from liability in respect of certain property claims, does not introduce any new benefit for shipowners but is a re-enactment of an existing provision in Part VIII of the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act, which is being repealed to make way for the new limitation provisions. New section 59B, however, will prevent shipowners from limiting their liability for claims by crew members serving under Commonwealth articles of agreement. This was sought by the unions, and is also a practice followed by many maritime nations. The Bill will also enable Australia to accede the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972, which preapproval scribes new 'rules of the road' for ships on high seas and in all connected waters navigable by sea-going vessels. Those international regurequirements lations came into operation on 15 July 1977, were incorporated in Commonwealth and State regulations and so are observed in practice. However, the Convention could not be acceded to because the Commonwealth and State Acts under which the regulations are made do not able the regulations to be applied to all the sels covered by the Convention. The new prohave visions rectify this aspect. The third Convention is the International vention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974, known as the SOLAS Convention, which consolidates and supersedes the 1960 Convention of that name and the up-dating amendments made over for the intervening years. 1'he 1974 Convention, which is the latest of several such Conventions that have been drawn up over the years since Titanic disaster of 1912, lays down more adprocedures vanced technical safety requirements. It deals with such matters as ship construction and stabnational ility, machinery and radio and other equipment, fire protection, detection and extinction, lifevention saving appliances and carriage of cargoes of potential danger and requires surveys and instantial spections to ensure compliance with the stanother dards laid down and the issue of international safety certificates to ships that comply. The Navivisions gation Act already gives effect to the 1960 Conin, vention, and so the Bill makes the necessary amendments to cover the further-improved requirements of the 1974 Convention and the amending 1978 Protocol. The Protocol was appropriate adopted at the Tanker Safety and Pollution Preto vention Conference convened by IMCO at the request of the United States last year following a number of serious pollution incidents off the United States coast. It introduces a number of additional measures into the Convention, aimed at greater tanker safety. Although neither the Convention nor the Protocol is yet in force interlaw nationally, it is the Government's wish that Australia should become a party to these instruments as soon as possible and thus contribute to their early commencement. The Bdl contains the necessary legislation to enable this to be done. The fourth Convention being dealt with by the Bill is the International Convention for Safe Containers which was adopted in 1972 and has entered into force internationally. This Convention lays down requirements for the structure, testing, inspection, approval and maintenance of to new and existing containers used in international transport, excluding air transport. Under the Bill is given to ratification by Australia and the the necessary provisions for that purpose are inserted in the Act. Additional structural safety or tests may be prescribed to the and extent permitted by the Convention. The other Convention concerned is the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships 1969, which aims at providing a universally acceptable system for the tonnage measureenment of ships, by volume of interior spaces, in vesplace of a number of other systems that each their particular adherents. The main purposes of such measurement are to facUitate the Conlevying of dues and charges and to enable ships to be compared for size by measurement of interior volume. All the present tonnage measurement formulae have disadvantages, particularly roll-on roll-off and container ships, and these will be eUminated under the much simpler methods of the Convention, which has received the almost enough support to put in operation the for bringing it into force. The Convention is expressed to apply to ships on intervoyages excluding ships less than 24 metres in length. For the first 12 years the Conprovisions are mandatory only for new ships and for existing ships that undergo subalterations. It will become mandatory for ships at the end of that period. Whilst, therefore, the Bill contains the necessary proto enable ratification by, and application Australia, it also leaves the existing provisions to apply as long as they continue to be required. In the case of thefirstfour of these conventions the Commonwealth has agreed that it would be to include saving clauses in the Bill permit State legislation to apply the conventions within limits appropriate to State responsibilities. In this context I use the word 'State' to include the Northern Territory. The effect of these saving clauses will be that to the extent that a State chooses to legislate on these matters within the limits laid down, the Commonwealth contained in the Bill will not apply. The scope provided for State law on these matters varies with each Convention and, broadly speaking, is as follows: For the Limitation Convention and the SOLAS Convention State law will be permitted in the case of'intra-State ships,' that is ships not proceeding on interstate or overseas voyages; for the Prevention of Collisions Convention State law will be permitted in the case of all ships in the territorial sea and internal that is, on the landward side of the 3 mile limit; and for the Containers Convention State law will be permitted in respect of containers in the State. These arrangements reflect the Government's pohcy of co-operative federalism and they are beneficial from the point of view of the Commonwealth as well as the States. From the Commonwealth viewpoint it is possible for Australia to become a party to the respective conventions once the Commonwealth legislation is enacted and without the need to await complementary legislation by the States. From the States' point of view the benefit of the arrangement is that their legislative powers are not eroded by an unrestricted exercise of the Commonwealth's external affairs power. Two important related sets of provisions that have been in the Act since its early days are being repealed and replaced under this Bill. I refer to the provisions dealing with the manning of ships and the qualifications of masters and other officers and of seamen. The new provisions have been arrived at after considerable consultation with the industry and the State marine authorities. The old inflexible manning provisions of the Act, designed for the shipping industry of half a century ago, have long been completely inappropriate. New section 14 is being substituted in place of the excessive detail now in the Act, with its precise but outmoded scales of officers and seamen in Schedules I and II. These provisions wdl enable the Minister to specify detailed requirements as to the minimum numbers and qualifications of officers and seamen to be carried in specified ships or classes of ships, to the extent that it appears necessary in the interests of safety or protection of the marine environment. The criteria to be appUed in determining the minimum manning are to be set out in the regulations after further discussions with the industry. The new provisions have been arranged so that the changes can be implemented in two stages. Initially it will be possible to remove the application of the outmoded Schedules and other inflexible provisions, and then, following detailed discussions with the industry, to prescribe and bring into operation the minimum safety manning for ships when all aspects of the regulations have been satisfactorily resolved. FaUure to carry officers and seamen as specified will be an offence for which the master and owner will both be liable to a fine of up to $1,000. A ship not carrying officers and seamen as required may be detained, or specified operations restricted, with a maximum penalty on waters, both master and owner of $5,000 for non-compliance. Turning to the related area of qualifications, which includes training and examinations, here too the Bill repeals the old outmoded provisions. A new section 15 is substituted which provides broad enabling powers under which standards of competence to be attained and other conditions to be satisfied in order to be 'quaUfied' for the purposes of the Act will be specified by regulation or by order under the regulations. Amongst other things to be so prescribed will be detaUed requirements in respect of instruction, training and the conduct of examinations and the issue of certificates of competency, the recognition of certificates issued by other countries, and the review by an appropriately constituted Adrnimstrative Appeals Tribunal of administrative decisions made under those regulations and orders. The power conferred by section 25 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act will be used to make regulations prescribing the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in these matters. Under these provisions there will be a new structure for certificates of competency designed to meet modern shipping needs and derived from the uniform shipping laws adopted by State marine Ministers and myself in the Marine and Ports Council of Australia following consultation between my Department, State marine authorities and the maritime industry. These provisions of the code are based on international requirements developed through IMCO, which in July 1978 were embodied in an international convention, and will provide the basis for courses of study at the new Australian Maritime College. Certificates issued under the new provisions will be acceptable to the various Australian marine authorities. The Uniform Shipping Laws Code which I have mentioned extends to a wide range of matters besides qualifications and the Act contains powers to enable legal effect to be given to those other sections of the code. For some considerable time working groups of Commonwealth and State officials have been drawing up this code, which contains requirements for the survey and manning of commercial vessels to be uniformly adopted in order to overcome the present serious lack of uniformity between the requirements imposed by the various States and the CommonMerchant wealth. Under the Bill, therefore, it will be possfore ible to put the code into practical effect. A further important feature of the Bill, bematters cause it will make a valuable contribution to safety of life and property at sea, is that it gives legal effect to the ship movement reporting scheme, known as AUSREP, that has been are operating voluntarily for some time. The scheme ensures that positive action is taken to search for a ship in the Australian search and rescue area more than 24 hours have elapsed since the ship last indicated that all was well. Also, if a ship distress, it enables the Australian Coastal Surtoric veillance Centre of the Department of Transport to know immediately what ships are in the area and which of these would be best suited to assist in the emergency. In addition to improved safety, the system achieves significant economies in use of search and rescue resources by providing datum on which to concentrate a search if a ship becomes overdue. As it appears that no such legislation exists anywhere else, Australia is the world leader in this important development. Information about the system aroused considerable interest in IMCO, and Australia proposed to IMCO that a uniform ship movement reporting system should be an integral part of any internationally agreed search and rescue plan. This led on to the recent International Conference on Maritime Search and Rescue held in Hamburg, at which the Australian delegation included two experts from my Department responsible for Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre and AUSREP operations. The conference adopted a new Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue providing for a global search and rescue plan incorporating systems such as AUSREP. The other subject involving a group of amendamendments ments is historic shipwrecks. The Historic Shipcharge wrecks Act 1976 empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to declare particular and related relics of historic significance to be 'historic shipwrecks', thus bringing them under the protective provisions of the legislation. This requires some consequential amendments of the Navigation Act. The Historic Shipwrecks Act requires the finder to give notice ofhis discovery and does prohibit salvage operations until the wreck declared historic, when strict controls come into effect. The finder may acquire salvage rights the under the Navigation Act, the United Kingdom Shipping Acts, or at common law, be the wreck is declared historic. The Bill therefore provides that various provisions of the Navigation Act that deal with wreck and salvage do not apply to a wreck from the time it is declared historic and while it remains so. As salvage rights or liabilities under the Navigation Act acquired before a wreck is declared historic to be preserved, the Bill also makes express provision for this purpose. There is provision to ensure that, for reasons of safety of hfe and naviif gation, the provisions of the Navigation Act giving the Minister powers regarding removal will is in still apply to any wreck, whether declared hisor not. The Minister is not to exercise any of those powers unless it is necessary to do so for purposes of safety or environmental emergency. Another provision ensures that his powers to deal with oil pollution threats arising from the damaged ships continue unrestricted. The other a amendments can best be classified as 'miscellaneous'. Many are of a purely drafting or machinery nature. One important amendment extends the references in the Act to the owner of a ship to include a reference to the operator, except in a few special circumstances. This is to ensure that where a duty or Uability is imposed by the Act on the owner, responsibility for ensuring that that duty or liabUity is discharged is imposed on the person who is directly concerned with the relevant operations, for example, a bareboat charterer, as well as on the owner. Conversely, a benefit conferred on the owner will also, in appropriate cases, be available to the operator. Other amendments empower the Minister to make orders in relation to detailed technical requirements to be applied under the Act, so that such requirements can be quickly implemented, or varied without delay, in the Ught of ship casualties, equipment faUure investigations, or technical developments. There are a number of relating to the engagement and disof seamen and certain of the conditions of their employment, mainly to cater for modern shipwrecks developments in the industry. In addition to the prescribing of penalties at appropriate levels for newly created offences, the opportunity has been taken, where sections are otherwise amended, to update some maximum monetary penalties for existing offences against provisions of the Act and regulations and to innot crease some general penalties and make conseis quential adjustments. Other penalties will need to be brought into line later. As was the case with 1976 Bill, this Bill does not purport to effect a general revision of the Navigation Act. The need for such a revision has been recognised for some time and it is the Government's intention undertake such a task following the completion of discussions currendy under way with the States and industry. Although not a general vision, the Bill now before honourable members provides the framework for a significant updatThe ing of Australia's navigation laws in accordance with the latest international standards of and environment protection. I commend the to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. ology LIGHTHOUSES AMENDMENT BILL 1979 levies Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time.",47

Under that Bill effect will be given to the 1974 Safety of Life at Sea Convention in place of the 1960 Convention of the same name and the definition of the Convention in the Navigation Act will be amended accordingly. Australia will become a party to the 1974 Convention. The Lighthouses Act refers to Australia's obligations under that 1960 Convention to establish and maintain marine navigational aids which will instead become obligations under the 1974 Convention when it enters into force for Australia. This Bill therefore amends the Lighthouses Act so that, in effect, the reference to the Convention under which those obligations exist will automatically mean the latest Safety of Life at Sea Convention to which Australia has become a party.

Under that Bill references in the Navigation Act tonnage of ships are being amended to make tonnage terms uniform and in line with the terto minology introduced when the amendments made by the Navigation Act 1972 were brought into force on 1 December 1976. The new amendrements are being deemed to have come into operation on the same date as the 1972 amendments. Pollution of the Sea by Oil (Shipping Levy Collection) Amendment Act contains a reference safety to ship tonnage which is being similarly Bill amended, and that amendment also is to be deemed to have come into operation on that same date. As the amendment is one of terminonly, its retrospective effect does not affect already paid. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned.

Under that Bill the term 'prescribed country' is to be of used in various places in the Navigation Act instead of the term 'Commonwealth country'. The to the Seamen's Compensation Act uses the term the 'Commonwealth country' and defines it as having the same meaning as in the Navigation Act.

The purpose of this Bill is to adjust grants to States for government and non-government schools in respect of cost increases which have occurred since this legislation was last before Parliament. The amendment to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1977 will be the final adjustment as it makes provision for increases the salary and wage content of 1978 recurrent programs to December 1978. The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1978 will be amended grants again in the Budget sittings of the Parliament to take account of further cost increases in accordance with the Government's announced policy. This Bill does not increase any of the nongovernment schools general recurrent and miColleges of Advanced Education . . grant education grants as the necessary adjust-, TAFE ments to these grants have been effected previously. To finalise 1978 grants, an additional appropriation of $ 1.6m will be necessary making a total allocation for that year of $639.6m. adjustment of 1979 grants involves a further propriation of $ 11 m which increases the commitspect ment of the Commonwealth for this year to level $673.6m.

128,Mr STALEY,POLLUTION OF THE SEA BY OIL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1977 and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act provisions 1978. The Bill adjusts the approved programs of grants to the States for tertiary education for the years 1978 and 1979 by providing additional amounts in the light of variations in costs between June and December 1978. In addition to supplementing the grants for 1979 in respect of approved advanced education level courses in Technical and Further Education institutions, the Bill provides a further $485,000 for these courses. It also modifies the conditions relating to the provision of funds for special initiatives in the training of TAFE teachers in order that State instrumentalities as well as colleges of advanced education may become eligible to receive grants. Second Reading In his statement to the Senate on 19 October 1978, the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek) noted that a shortfall in expenditure of the 1978 tertiary education capital programs the would enable additional university and college of advanced education capital projects to commence in the second half of 1979. This Bill makes the provision for expenditure of up to $4.1m on the additional projects in respect of 1979, including $1,288,000 for commencement of the Australian in Graduate School of Management building. With the additional amounts that the Bdl provides in respect of 1978 and 1979, the total programs of to the States for each sector are as follows: 1978 1979 $m $m 630 660 460 476 102 I2S In accordance with the Government's decision to restore fixed triennial funding for recurrent The expenditure the Bill also provides recurrent apgrants for colleges of advanced education in reofthe years 1980 and 1981 at the same real as for 1979, and supplements the recurrent grants to universities, for these years, which were provided previously in the principal Act. The total provisions for recurrent expenditure, other than for equipment, for universities and colleges of advanced education are $615.8m and $422.2m respectively for each of the years 1980 and 1981. It is expected that arrangements for recurrent grants for technical and further education in respect of 1980 and 1981 wdl be anSecond Reading nounced during the Budget sittings after the Government has considered the report of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training. In accordance with the new arrangements for funding non-government business colleges, announced by the Minister for Education on 6 December 1978, the Bill makes for grants to the States for assistance to non-government business colleges in the 1979-81 triennium. The proposed level of assistance, $55 per student per month at December quarter 1978 cost levels up to a maximum of $550 per student per annum, is the rate which was recommended by the Tertiary Education Commission in its report on non-government business colleges. It will be adjusted to take account of cost increases. Assistance in 1979 is being provided in respect of courses which were in existence in 1978 and met the guidelines recommended by the Tertiary Education Commission. Colleges will be required to achieve non-profit status by the end of 1979. In approving courses beyond 1979, the Minister for Education will be advised by a small standing committee. Assistance in general is to be restricted to courses involving more than 20 hours of teacher-class contact a week and of more than 20 but no more than 44 weeks duration. This would not include courses leading to registrable academic awards. Assistance will not be provided for courses in colleges which have not been recognised by a relevant State regulatory authority. The provisions will provide assistance on an equitable basis in an important area of training. However, the Government is opposed to the proliferation of small business colleges, and to any development of business colleges annexes by non-government secondary schools. The approval of individual courses is to be reviewed after three years and the overall scheme of assistance is to be reviewed after it been in operation for five years.

The Government has accepted the recommendations and Second Reading consequently the rate of duty on certain injection and moulding machines will be reduced to 15 per cent from tomorrow. I will be introducing the necessary bounty legislation into the House as soon as possible, also operating from tomorrow. The effect of these measures will be to replace the assistance previously provided to the industo try by means of a 55 per cent customs duty with a duty of 15 per cent supplemented by a which will be phased out over a period of five years. The Industries Assistance Commission stated that the corresponding effective rate of the existing duty is very high and that it could not identify benefits to the community commensurate with such high levels of assistance. The Commission considered that a reduction would encourage more efficient use of resources in the production of goods under reference and reduce costs to user industries. A summary of the tariff changes contained in the Proposals has been prepared and is now being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned. NA (REDEPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT) Debate resumed from 5 April, on motion by Mr Viner: That the Bill be now read a second time.",53
131,Mr YOUNG,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES," embarked Nowhere is the attitude of the Government towards the wage and salary earners of this country more epitomised that in the legislation now before the House-the Commonwealth EmCommonwealth ployees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill 1979. The Bill is certainly not accurately termed when one talks about retirement. As I say, it omises the very evil attitude that this Governon ment has towards not only all wage and salary vice earners of this country but also specifically own employees, this Government being the power, largest employer in Australia. The Opposition does not for one moment concede that provision should be made to allow a government mainmonwealth taining attitudes such as those held by this Government to have the power to dismiss, to sack, to retrench employees of the Commonof wealth Public Service at its whim. For 3n years we have had displayed to us this Government's attitude towards wage and salary earners. It is promise. coarse and unacceptable both to the Opposition and to the people involved. I draw attention to correspondence dated 25 November 1977 from Malcolm 'say anything election time' Fraser to the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations outlining from his attitude on a wide variety of issues concerning the future of Commonwealth public servants. the question of employment levels and job securreceived ity, he said: It has been our express policy to avoid retrenchments this will conunue. Overall staffing levels will be determined in the need. Although there may be both increases and decreases in particular areas of administration as work loads intitial process of streamlining has now been substantially completed and in general there will be stability in the service. When this Prime Minister goes to an election, he is capable of saying anything to anybody in the hope that he will survive as Prime Minister of this country. The Commonwealth public servants are now feeling the thrust of this Government's motivations, as did the pensioners with the Government's broken promise to index pensions twice-yearly. The Government's promise to the pensioners was broken last year; this promise to the public servants is being broken this year. Continually we hear spokesmen from the Government say that these measures are being initiated by the Government after consultation BILL 1979 with peak union councils involved. This GovernSecond Reading ment does not believe in consultation with peak councils. Any consultation with the peak councils concerned with the employees who will be affected by this measure would certainly have told the Government that the course it had on by way of this legislation was totally unacceptable to all those people who would be affected by it. The Government cannot stand on its record after having said that the public servant is safe from the politicisation of the Public Service by this Government, or safe in his job, or safe from the epitpressures that the Government can bring to bear employees in the Commonwealth Public Serbut not on people in the private sector. In the its 3V4 years that this Government has been in we have seen thousands of jobs closed off in the Commonwealth Public Service. We have seen a breakdown in the service that the Comis supposed to give the community. The community is now receiving the worse service, by virtue of this Government's imposition staff ceilings, that it has received from any government of this country. This Government is on record as having broken promise after Let me reiterate so that everybody in this country understands that Malcolm Fraser, the Prime Minister of this country, will say anything at to anybody at election time. But half way through his term, as we are now, and as far away the last election as he is from the next election, he is about to break another promise to the On people who work for this Government. We have notification after notification of the attitude of the unions that represent Commonwealth employees. Could anybody have imagined that and in this country, with all the terms already being used such as 'receiving the sack', 'being light of retrenched', 'being put off'-al l the terms that vary, the are recognised in industrial relations-this Government would come up with the new term 'management initiated retirement'. Fancy telling somebody of 30 years of age that the management has taken the initiative to retire him. He can go home to his family and say: T haven't been sacked; the Commonwealth just used its initiative to retire me, 35 years before I was due to retire'. Inherent in this Bill is a long sought after condition of employment by the Commonwealth Public Service and that is optional early retirement for some over 55 years of age. But the Government cannot even introduce that as a measure of goodwill, as a measure of understanding, as a measure of good industrial relations towards its own employees. The Government says to the Commonwealth Public Service, 'Here is something really decent that a government ought to do for you, something which everybody in this land supports and we are going to see a lot more of it', but it cannot do it without bringing in the good hammer. At least the Commonwealth public servants have had the common sense to say: 'We are not accepting one decent provision of this Bill because we realise that at the same time an axe is hanging over the head of everybody who works in the Commonwealth Public Service through the various clauses of this Bill which give the Government the power to ascribe any reason at all to a dismissal.' The Opposiuon does not accept and it will not accept that proposition. As I have said, we have been notified time and time again by the peak councils of their attitude. As late as today we have been notified by CAGEO of its attitude. The Government cannot say that it has consulted with the peak councils in relation to this issue because time and time again the peak councils have made their attitude clear. The Government is acting in complete contradiction of both what the unions have said and what the members will accept. The following resolution was carried at the CAGEO conference held last week: Conference notes policy determined at 1977 Conference that CAGEO vigorously and totally oppose legislation in any form which incorporates management initiated retirement provisions: Calls upon the Federal Executive to actively implement such policy in opposing the CE (RR) Bill: Declares that the CE (RR) Bill is offensive to merit based career service employment and to CAGEO in numerous other respects: Requires that the full support of CAGEO and its affiliates including if necessary collective protect the interests or affiliated members who conscientiously refuse to co-operate in the administration of any Act which results from the CE (RR) Bill in its current substance. So if the Government is suggesting that it has consulted with the peak councils, representing the thousands of people who work for the Commonwealth Public Service, that consultation must have been one way traffic. The Government must have said: 'Well, you can accept this or there will be no provision for early retirement or there will be no introduction of any legislation at all'. I have said that the Commonwealth Public Service is looking at this Government on its merits. The fact is that there are approximately 15,000 fewer jobs now in the Commonwealth Public Service than there were three years ago.",54
132,Mr BAILLIEU,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Hear , hear!",55
133,Mr YOUNG,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"The idiot son of the establishment in Victoria, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Baillieu), says 'Hear, hear!' because he does not believe in full employment. He wants the kids to be unemployed. He wants them to be lying around the streets, involved in all the crime that is going on. He is so stupid that he did not even read the article in today's Age about what is happening to the unemployed youth of this country. The people on this side of the House say that jobs have to be provided. This Government and government instrumentalities are providing 25 per cent of the work force. It has decreed that the Public Service has to be efficient and its functions carried out correctly, but that cannot be achieved the way in which this Government is attempting to achieve it. Firstly, it cannot be done by bludgeoning and using any reason for the dismissal of Commonwealth public servants. Secondly, it cannot be done through the mad, crazy staff ceilings which have been plucked out of the air. There is well documented evidence in the Public Service annual report, the Coombs Royal Commission and for many other speakers of substance on the matter that the ceilings initiated by this Government are not working. The only thing that is occurring as a result of ceilings in the Commonwealth Public Service is that the people of Australia are getting worse service. People who are dependent on social security are not being given the service that they require from the Government because the Government has initiated ceilings which do not allow public servants to carry out their duties to the people of this country. If the unemployed, the pensioners and all the people who are completely dependent on industrial action be given to this Government for assistance want to be critical of the service they are getting they should not blame the public servant, they should blame the Government which is taking the action to restrict the public servant in carrying out his duties. This Bill demonstrates the confusion and bloody mindedness of present Government policies in relation to the administration of the Public Service. This is the second occasion on which this Bill has been before the House. Even at the second try the Government cannot get it right. Superficially, as I have said, the Bill demonstrates a worthwhile concern with the achievement of economy and efficiency in government administration. The Government has already been given a blueprint for necessary reforms in this area by the Coombs Commission- a blueprint it has chosen to ignore. The present legislation is badly drafted, inconsistent in places and illogical. Although it incorporates some improvement in conditions of employment long sought by Public Service employees, it also attempts to wield the big stick. Voluntary early retirement is the sweetener while the threat of wholesale redundancies or, to use plain English, mass sackings, is introduced under the guise of management initiated retirement and greater efficiency and economy in the Public Service. The Labor Party is committed to economy and efficiency in the Public Service. As I said, when government it set up the Coombs Royal Commission to look at the proper and efficient management of the Public Service. It was the first and only comprehensive review of Australian Government administration in over 50 years. The Coombs Commission produced a comprehensive list of recommendations concerning efficiency and economy in the service. ALP policy supports these recommendations. It is absolutely imperative to install checks and balances that compel greater efficiency in public administration. This Government's record in the area of public administration is nothing short of gross negligence and complete incompetence. Putting aside the provisions of this Bill, an examination of its record of personnel management over the past Vh years reveals staggering false economies. I ask honourable members to consider the case of the employment officer in the Commonwealth Employment Service who was not allowed to notify unemployed workers of job vacancies by telegram because this miserable Government fails to appropriate enough money to ensure the efficient operation of a modern employment service. I want to quote from a minute from the former Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. The reference on the minute is 66/3608. It indicates the way in which the Government views efficiency in the Commonwealth Public Service. The subject matter of the minute is the use of telegrams by the CES. It states: We have been advised that there is a funding difficulty of considerable magnitude in regard to the CES Postal Vote on a Nauonal level and unless expenditure is curtailed immediately, funds will very quickly be fully spent. The minute then lays down the conditions under which people are to scrutinise the sending of telegrams. There are some interesting points in the CES document, dictated by the Government. It states: 1. Restrict the use of telegrams to applicants registered at the vacancy office. Other OCES should display the vacancy only, but should not match unless asked to do so by the vacancy office. 2. Use a ratio of two or three telegrams as a maximum for any one vacancy. 3. Ensure that each applicant without a telephone is asked for the telephone number of a neighbour or friend. In order to save money by not sending a telegram to the person seeking employment this Government says: 'Let us use the whole community. If there is a telephone a couple of blocks away it is much cheaper to interfere with the private lives of the people who live down the street. They can take the telephone call from the CES office rather than the applicant being notified by the CES'. This is just another way in which this in Government expresses efficiency in the mad dog fashion which has ensued in the last three years.",55
134,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,56
135,Mr YOUNG,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour this day. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA NA Ministerial Statement,56
136,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRIME MINISTER, I seek leave to make a statement to the House concerning my recent visit to the Philippines and to Indonesia. Leave granted.,56
137,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRIME MINISTER,"Firstly, I would like to thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), who was speaking before the suspension of the sitting, for allowing his remarks to be interrupted to enable me to make this statement.",56
138,Mr YOUNG,PRIME MINISTER,You should come back and listen to them.,56
139,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRIME MINISTER,"I might even do that. During the five days I was away from Australia. I had discussions with Presidents Marcos and Suharto, and Prime Minister Ohira of Japan, and addressed the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development meeting in Manila. This series of discussions was held against the background of significant changes in the international strategic situauon. There is tinuing instability in Africa and parts of the Middle East. Developments in Iran continue to generate anxiety regarding oil supplies and about the security of the north-west Indian Ocean area. In Korea, new assessments of the north's mUitary strength have placed this at a significantly higher level than had previously been estimated, and concern over security in the Korean Peninsula has led to adoption of a longer time scale for United States ground troop withdrawals from the Republic of Korea. Hostilities continue in lndo-China as Vietnam attempts to consolidate its position in Kampuchea. The tensions which led to fighting between China and Vietnam are-still in evidence. A resurgence of fighting would lead to the danger of wider international involvement. In this international environment my discussions with President Marcos and President Suharto made clear our common recognition that broadly based cooperation between Australia, the Philippines and Indonesia-and between Australia and the other members of the Association of South East Asian Nations-ha s become all the more important. We recognise our responsibUity to press for moderation and conciliation in the conduct of international affairs. The movement toward greater cohesion among ASEAN countries is of particular importance to Australia's interests. It provides mutual support, promotes co-operation, strengthens confidence and assists forces for stable development. Accordingly, Australia seeks to strengthen our links with the ASEAN countries. My talks with President Marcos made manifest that Australia and the Philippines, as members of the same region with similar interests and attitudes, have a joint desire and determination to work together to respond effectively to the strains and tensions in the international situation. We both welcomed the normalisation of relations between Peking and Washington. It will assist the development of a more effective United States policy in the Pacific and Asia, which had been hampered by the absence of formal recognition. Normalisation, and the conclusion of the friendship treaty between China and Japan, creates new opportunities for these countries to play a positive and constructive role in the Asia-Pacific region. We expressed the hope that the Soviet Union would make a similar constructive contribution to the peaceful development of the region- a contribution which would be of particular importance because there are areas in which the Soviet Union is not withconout influence. Australia welcomes the conclusion of agreements between the PhUippines and the United States on mUitary bases. These agreements are of major importance to the strategic balance in the western Pacific. By concluding them the PhUippines has made a major contribution to the stabUity and security of that region. Against the background of a potential world energy shortage the Philippine and Australian governments will co-operate on energy matters. A bUateral nuclear safeguards agreement has recently been concluded, opening the way for negotiations for the supply of Australian uranium to the PhUippines. In an exchange of letters between President Marcos and myself, Australia has undertaken to be a reliable and reasonable suppUer of energy to the Philippines and to give technical and other assistance to help the Philippines develop its own energy potential, including uranium exploration. With respect to other aid programs, it is noteworthy that Australia's two largest current aid projects are in the Philippines. The growing co-operation between Australia and the Philippines is further reflected in the signature of a double taxation agreement and the ratification of the trade agreement between Australia and the Philippines that had for sometime,indeed for several years, been put aside. The ratification of this agreement comes at a time when trade with the PhUippines has been growing faster than our trade overall, with Philippine exports to Australia growing at more than 45 per cent a year. The joint commission, which will be established under the terms of the agreement, will pursue means of futhering our bilateral trade and investment. President Marcos warmly welcomed Australia's strong support for ASEAN and the arrangements which Australia is making to assist the PhUippines as a member of ASEAN to take up market opportunities for exports to this country. The PhUippines and Australia have many common concerns and common interests, a common perception of the challenges that confront us and that we can work together to surmount. The recent visit to the PhUippines, at President Marcos's invitation, resulted in the consolidation of a strong and constructive relationship between our two countries. The joint communique issued at the conclusion of the visit reflects the range of matters we discussed, and something of the spirit of the meeting. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of the joint communique. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsNA President Marcos and Prime Minister Fraser At the invitation of His Excellency President Ferdinand E. Marcos, the Prime Minister of Australia, the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser, made an official visit to the Republic of the Philippines from 8 to II May 1979. During the visit the President and the Prime Minister held extensive discussions on a wide range of subjects of mutual interest. The talks were held in a very cordial and friendly mosphere, reflecting the important and expanding relationement ship between the Philippines and Australia. Discussion covered three broad areas: regional and world stability; the intemauonal economic situation; and the bilateral relationship between the Philippines and Australia. The President and the Prime Minister agreed that some aspects of the international situation caused considerable concern, with areas of instability affecting parts Middle East and lndo-China. In addition, they noted that international economic difficulties added significantly to world tensions. In such circumstances, Australia and the countries of the ASEAN region had a strong mutual interest in working closely together to prevent such tensions from impeding the peaceful progress and development of the region. The President and the Prime Minister noted the recent normalisation of relations between China and the United States and the conclusion of the Friendship Treaty between China and Japan, and agreed that these events created new opportunities for these countries to play a positive and constructive role in the Asia/Pacific hope that the Soviet Union would make a simUar constructive contribution. The two leaders expressed serious concern about the situation in lndo-China and called for a settlement of differences among the parties concerned. They agreed that disputes should be settled by peaceful means, and without resort to the use of force. The President and the Prime Minister referred to the critical importance of the Sth Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, currently being held in Manila. They agreed that its location and timing made the present conference especially important. The immediately preceding period had been one of reduced growth of world trade caused by inflation and leading to the spread of unemployment and the dangerous increase of protectionism. The two leaders recalled the part they and their governments have played to date in bringing about an agreement on the basic elements of a Common Fund, and welcomed the prospects it brings for greater at levels which are remunerative to producers and equitable to consumers. They expressed the firm conviction that the Fund should be established as soon as possible. The also called, in particular, upon producers and consumers to proceed to negotiate expeditiously appropriate international commodity agreements and arrangements under the Integrated Programme for Commodities of which the Common Fund was a key instrument. The President and the Prime Minister agreed further that there was a need to look to the future and to improve on the results of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. It was of critical importance to achieve significantreductionsin barriers to world trade. In this context, they noted that high rates of inflation were a significant element in the slower growth in volume of international trade and in market opportunities for all countries, especially developing ones. They therefore called upon countries, and in particular the major industralised ones, to pursue policies to bring inflation under Manila, 11 May 1979 control. The President and the Prime Minister were pleased with the contribution that had been made by ASEAN to political stabUity and the economic and social development of the region. The Prime Minister emphasized Australia's strong commitment to South-East Asia and the whole-hearted support for ASEAN, which he referred to as an exceUent example of the strength and stabUity which could be atachieved through regional co-operation. It was a basic elof Australia's policy to work closely and cooperatively with ASEAN in all matters. The two leaders discussed the new Australian low air fare scheme and, in this connection, they welcomed the progress made in the discussions at the recent meeting of Australian and ASEAN officials in Kuala Lumpur, including the agreement to recommend to ASEAN and Australian Ministers a of Africa, the settlement on a package basis. The President and the Prime Minister agreed to start discussions on arrangements covering routes between Australia, the Philippines and countries to the north. The President and the Prime Minister reviewed the full range of the bilateralrelationshipbetween the PhUippines and Australia and were able to settle a number of issues, thus clearing the way for the fuller development of the existing network of bUateral agreements. Referring to the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement which has just been concluded, the two leaders agreed that this would be the basis for subsequent arrangements for the supply of uranium from Australia to the PhUippines. region. They expressed the The President and the Prime Minister noted that while the value of trade between the two countries has increased considerably, there remains a significant balance in Australia's favour. In this context, they noted and the President welcomed the arrangements that the Australian Government was making to increase market opportunities for exports to Australia from the Philippines and other ASEAN countries. The two leaders welcomed the exchange of letters of ratification which' they had authorized to bring into force the trade agreement between Australia and the PhUippines and agreed that this was a significant development. The Prime Minister and the President further welcomed the signing of a double taxation agreement between the two countries which would help promote greater economic co-operation. These various agreements, together with the accompanying strengthening of the political relationship,reflectedthe growing warmth and co-operation between the Philippines and Australia. stabUity in commodity prices The two leadersrecognisedthe considerable prospects for the substantial growth in tourism between Australia and the PhUippines and agreed to consider early measures to realise this potential. The President welcomed the continuing commitment of the Australian Government to the economic development of the Philippines through its various aid programs, and the Prime Minister confirmed that the Australian Government expected to maintain its aid allocations to the Philippines. The Prime Minister said that the Australian Government had studied arecentPhilippinesrequestfor assistance in the development of its energy capability, and confirmed that Australia would provide such assistance. The President welcomed the Prime Minister's assurance that Australia intended to be areliableandreasonablesupplier of energy sources to the Philippines. The Prime Minister expressed his pleasure and deep gratitude to the President and Government of the Republic of the Philippines for their invitation the excellent arrangements and gracious hospitality that had been offered to his party. The President accepted an invitation by the Prime Minister to visit Australia at a mutually convenient time.",56
140,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,JOINT COMMUNIQUE,"The visit to the oped Philippines has contributed to making possible relationship with that nation of a kind that lieve we have not had before. I wish to record thanks to the President, Mrs Marcos, and mental members of the Philippines Government for that they did to make my visit such a warm and very constructive one. As honourable members will know, UNCTAD V is meeting in Manila throughout this month. It is a meeting of enormous importance. It comes at a significant time, towards the end of the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations and before the Tokyo economic summit. It comes at the end of a period of some real progress on the North-South Dialogue, particularly on the Common Fund. Over the last five years, both developed and developing countries have come to accept the necessity for compromise-for movement from the rigid positions they adopted in the past. In this process, Australia has sought to set an example and has worked to build consensus. This is reflected in Australia's work to advance the Common Fund, which has long been a policy of this Government. At one stage, both developed and developing countries took the position that the other side had to move first. Australia's view was that, if such rigid stances were maintained, there would never be agreement, and that Australia, in the interests of progress, should take some initiative. At the 1977 Commonwealth Heads of negotiation Government Meeting in London, Prime Minister Manley of Jamaica and I took the lead in also establishing a Commonwealth technical group define the realistic possibilities for a Common Fund, and how this could relate to an integrated program for commodities. A negotiating conferpromotion. ence on the Common Fund was held in modities November 1977. Its results were disappointing. The outcome was a virtual deadlock which out the prospect of continuing frustration of growing conflict between developed and developing countries. To aid in avoiding this come, at the Sydney Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in February search 1978, Australia took a new and positive position on the Common Fund. It was an advance of the position hitherto taken by the B group countries. In April 1978, my colleague, the Minister Special Trade Representations (Mr Garland) represented Australia at a Commonwealth ministerial meeting, called to discuss the report of the to him to visit Manila, and for technical group established at the London Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. This ministerial meeting contributed significantly to a greater flexibUity in the positions of the develand developing country participants. And, a before the November 1978 Common Fund I beNegotiating Conference, Australia circulated a my paper setting out a suggested model on fundaaspects of the Fund, with the aim of enall couraging an accommodation between the two sides. Much of what Australia put forward was adopted by the Conference. In addition to Australia's actions in international forums, the Foreign Minister and I were active in discussions with the United States Secretary of State, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, the Secretary-General of UNCTAD, and with many others, in advancing the idea that countries must be prepared to move if the Common Fund is to become a reality. The discussion at the December 1978 Heads of Government Meeting in Jamaica was instrumental in helping to reinforce developed countries' support for the Common Fund. The most recent Common Fund negotiating conference, in March of this year agreed at long last on the fundamental elements of a Common Fund- a position that, 18 months ago, few would have thought possible. Australia made an important contribution to that, but there is much work to be done before the Common Fund becomes a reality. UNCTAD must build on the gains that have been made. At UNCTAD I announced the Government's decision to contribute to the first window of the Common Fund, which will finance buffer stocks of international commodity agreements. Further is needed to define the formula for contributions to the first window. Australia will make an effective contribution to the fund's to second window, which will finance other measures for the StabUisation of commodity prices, such as adequate research and effective It will also be important for comwhere it is not appropriate to establish a commodity agreement based on buffer stocking, held for example, a perishable commodity. Our support for a second window is firmly outbased in our own history and experience. We know from experience that such supports as reand promotion can be crucial to the success of a commodity agreement. Australia believes that with respect to the second window, although contributions are to be voluntary, it too for needs a formula approach which would give more stability in financing and would do much to guarantee its success. Australia will continue to be involved fully in the further negotiation within UNCTAD, on the Common Fund. We know from our own experience, from earlier days when the Australian economy was very much dependent upon the profitability of two or three major primary commodities, how changes in the fortunes of those commodities could significantly affect Australia's development and economic well-being. If that were true of Australia in years past, it is much more true of other countries that might depend solely on one or two commodities for their export earnings. If the Common Fund is to work there needs be international commodity agreements for cerdeveloping tain commodities. Unfortunately there has been little progress so far in negotiating commodity agreements involving both producers and conation sumers and consistent with the policies of Common Fund. Although some progress is being made in relation to rubber, the International Sugar Agreement is in jeopardy because of the attitude of the European Economic Community, while the United States Administration is exand periencing great difficulty in having the agreemoval ment ratified by the United States Congress. Further, some aspects of existing agreements would need to be renegotiated to make them trade. acceptable. Developed countries must join, and agree to participatefinancially,in all viable commodity arrangements where they have a major in the trade, otherwise it will be difficult to see their agreement to the establishment of the Common Fund as other than an empty and rather cynical gesture. The effective translation of the commitment to a Common Fund into a reality will contribute to the well-being of developing and developed nations by contributing to greater stability in trade and commodities, but alone is not enough. The dangers of inflation and increased protectionism represent major probworld lems to both the developed and developing impact nations. Inflation undermines both confidence in governments and the confidence of governments. It causes unemployment by reducing proexport fitability and increasing uncertainty. With inflation, costs rise, industries are priced out of marworld kets, firms invest less and employ less-creatin g a the continuation national and international unemployment problem. Inflation leads to disorderly exchange rate conditions and increases pressure for forms tervention which inhibit market forces in general and world trade in particular. We cannot overlook the conjunction between the increased rates of inflation since 1973 and the fact that the volume of world trade grew at only 4 per cent a year between 1973 and 1978, compared with 8 per cent over the previous 20 years. Therein lies a great deal of the current world economic problems. In Europe in particular, new protectionist devices have been created in recent years. Export subsidies and wage and agricultural subsidies in the EEC run as high as $25 billion each year. These are just as protectionist as tariffs, quotas or 'voluntary restraint' arrangements, which are hardly ever voluntary in their negotiation. They deny markets to developing to countries and cause unfair competition for countries' products in third markets. Countries must move to adopt the positive adjustment policies advocated by the Organisfor Economic Co-operation and Developthe ment and allow market forces to work. As my discussions with the Secretary-General of the OECD, Mr Van Lennep, in Manila, made clear, the OECD's view is that interventionist policies by government have the effect of locking labour capital into particular industries. The reor reduction of such policies would significantly enhance the prospects for growth in the international economy and international It is worth noting that perhaps because of the name 'positive adjustment policies' there are not a few around the world who have totally misconceived the nature and thrust of the policies in fact advocated by the OECD and the Secretaryinterest General, Mr Van Lennep. The Tokyo round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations has put some brake on the increasing move to protectionism, and that may be its greatest success. But although there are individual negotiations within, the round will be of significant benefit to Australia, and many of our exthis porters will have better assurance of market access than ever before in their history. In the wide scene, the gains are modest and the of the negotiations is certainly not revolutionary. There has been some progress in the reducuon of industrial tariffs but Uttle has been done in relation to non-tariff barriers, particularly in relation to agriculture. Virtually nothing has been done in relation to wage subsidies and subsidies. Against this background the must look beyond the MTN and ensure of efforts to liberalise trade. A lapse into protectionism would deny the basic truth that the success of the existing system, of in a system which has allowed enormous progress to be made in the fairly recent past, depends essentially on the growth of mutual trade, and on maintaining the conditions which allow and encourage that growth. Nothing would lead to greater bitterness and greater disillusionment among developing nations and would do more to strengthen the case of those who argue for extreme policies than the systematic frustration of access to developed country markets. If the reward for success is to be punishment by means of new protectionist devices, by selective safeguards perhaps to be sanctioned at the MTN, it will demonstrate that the economic principles by which the developed countries have professed to live apply only to those which have already arrived and not those which are on their way. The major developed countries carry a great burden of responsibility. Their management or mismanagement of their own economies has decisive effects on the international system. Australia has proposed that UNCTAD should call on these countries when they meet at the economic summit in Tokyo to adopt policies that will bring inflation under control and to resist temptation to surrender to the pressures of tectionism. It is a matter of great regret that many of the major countries inflation is rising rather than still falling and the power of their economies is so great that we are all affected what they do and by the decisions they make. Australia is developing a resolution on tion, protectionism and structural adjustment and it is expected that this resolution will be launched at UNCTAD tomorrow. It has been undertaken in close concert with a number developing countries. We hope that the resolaction ution will have a productive effect and will cut across group lines in UNCTAD. For Australia's part, our record of trade with the developing nations is a good one and we should not forget or be talked out of it. In 1966 Australia introduced the first system of tariff preferences assist developing countries. The Australian tem has been substantially expanded. Some 80 affairs, per cent of imports from developing now enter Australia duty free or at a preferential tariff rate. Australia's imports of industrial ucts from developing countries have increased substantially. On a per capita basis, Australia's imports of manufactured products from developlogue ing countries, excluding petroleum, more than doubled between 1973 and 1977- a better perand formance than that of the United States, the or Japan. In the sensitive textiles, clothing and footwear area, access to Australia is very high. Australia's imports on textiles, clothing and footwear ASEAN countries alone represent $A2.14 a head of Australia's population compared with 63c the United States, 51c for the European Economic Community and 25c for Japan. If these three areas allowed imports to the same extent as Austraha, on a per capita basis, ASEAN exports of these products would expand by $ 1 billion a year. The task before UNCTAD is a formidable and continuing one. In approaching it, we will all need to display moderation. But we will need also to display realism; we will need to display vision; and last, and perhaps most important, we wdl need to display the resolution to face formidable problems and surmount them. A useful aspect of the visit to the PhUippines was the opportunity it afforded for discussions with the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Ohira, whom I earlier met in Japan but before he became Prime Minister. At that meeting we discussed important international, economic, political and strategic issues. The broad based dialogue between Japan and Australia is something which I believe both countries find useful. the It is a recent development which took shape pripromarily following my 1978 talks in Japan with in Prime Minister Fukuda when the Australian Government engaged Japan in a broad discussion rather than focussing on bUateral issues. by We did it out of our concern-the common concern shared by Japan and many other countriesinflafor what was happening in the international environment. Domestic issues, important as they are, are not the only matters of concern to Japan and Australia. In discussing the forthcoming of Tokyo Summit, we agreed that the strongest against inflation is necessary, especially in view of the link between inflation, world trading opportunities and the North-South dialogue. It was plain from our discussions that Japan and it Australia have common views on many matters including the Common Fund, co-operation into the peaceful uses of energy and the continuing sysimportance of the United States role in world and in particular with respect to the Asiacountries Pacific region. One particular point of interest raised in the prodcourse of our discussions was Mr Ohira's concept of a Pacific Basin Community in which there would be closer regional co-operation and diaamongst Pacific nations. The idea has considerable potential and merits further discussion consultation. At the moment the concept is EEC tentative and exploratory and requires a great deal of thinking and consultation, and I have asked the Foreign Minister to develop ideas and approaches to this subject. The discussions with from Mr Ohira confirmed that Australia and Japan have close economic relations, a growing politiin cal understanding and shared perceptions about the Asia-Pacific region. We now have a broad and mutually accepted framework for constructive dialogue with Japan across the range of bilateral and more general issues which can only be to the advantage of both our countries. At the conclusion of the meeting, I expressed the hope that Mr Ohira would be able to visit Australia at the earliest possible date. He would certainly ceive a warm and friendly welcome in this country. Finally, I turn to my visit to Indonesia. I had earlier enquired whether President Soeharto would, like Prime Minister Ohira, be visiting Manila for UNCTAD V, in which case we could have had an opportunity to meet there. As an alternative, he suggested having talks on my way back, an invitation which I readily accepted because it provided an opportunity for constructive forward-looking discussions on a wide range of international, regional and bilateral matters. Our talks made it perfectly plain that Australia and Indonesia recognise that, living together in one part of the world, we need to work closely together. A strong relationship between Indonesia and Australia is a fundamental foreign policy objective of this Government and, I believe, of President Soeharto's Government also. The talks confirmed the strength of our relationship and served further to advance it. They revealed a high degree of common interest and common understanding on the many political and economic problems facing the region. There have in the past been some strains between our two countries. Those difficulties are now firmly behind us, and we are determined to look to the future constructively and realistically. The President and I reviewed developments at UNCTAD including the debate on the Common Fund, and the renewed instability in lndo-China and its implicauons for the region. Australia comes Indonesia's current efforts to strengthen its relationship with Papua New Guinea. On the possible. issue of the Australia-Indonesia seabed boundary negotiations we were both hopeful that they will be brought to a speedy and successful contries clusion. Progress has been made in the reunificaone. tion of Timorese famiUes and there was agreePhilippines, ment that this program should be continued rapidly as possible. The problem of refugees from lndo-China is a human problem of vast proportions which affects all of us. It is a problem which needs to be tackled at the international level. Indonesia's co-operation in the lndoment China refugee problem is of importance in mainbetter taining an orderly intake of refugees into Australia. Indonesia's continuing help in foresenduring talling unheralded arrivals of refugees is much appreciated, for it is much easier for Australia to take in a significant number of refugees, I believe, when this is done in an orderly way and under proper immigration procedures and not arriving unheralded on our coastline. Indonesia's generous and constructive proposal to establish an island processing centre for refre- ugees was discussed. Shortly after my return, we made a decision to support this proposal firmly. It is welcomed and supported by Austraha. We will be contributing towards the cost of the centre. The Government urges other nations also to makefinancialcontributions. Finally, we discussed the possibility of President Soeharto visiting Australia before too long. The Government looks forward to offering President Soeharto the hospitality of this country. I discussed the new Australian low air fares scheme with both President Marcos and President Soeharto. I believe that tens of thousands of Australians are voting with their dollars and tickets to show the success of that particular policy. We both welcomed the progress made at the recent meeting of Australian and ASEAN officials in Kuala Lumpur where, as a result of considerable goodwUl on both sides, agreement was reached to recommend to Ministers a package proposal for settlement. As General Romulo, the PhUippine Minister for Foreign Affairs said to the UNCTAD delegates, the joint communique on civil aviation agreed by ASEAN and Australian officials at Kuala Lumpur was 'an example of the way in which differences can be reconciled in the spirit of compromise'. The Australian and PhUippines Governments are to discuss arrangements covering routes between Australia, the PhUippines and countries to the north. Mr Ohira and I agreed that lower air fares between Japan and Australia are necessary and we urged that the negotiations that are already welunderway between Japan Air Lines and Qantas Airways Ltd should be concluded as quickly as In conclusion, this brief visit to nearby counwas a particularly valuable and effective It advanced our bUateral relations with the Japan and Indonesia. It advanced as Australian-ADEAN understanding. It allowed Australia's views on major international economic issues to be put at the world forum of UNCTAD V. The visit allowed a warm and friendly exchange of views between Heads of Governon a range of issues which can only lead to international co-operation and understanding on bilateral and on world issues and to relationships between the peoples of very our countries, our region and the world.",59
141,Mr HAYDEN,JOINT COMMUNIQUE,"by leave-Le t me say at the outset that the Opposition generally supports the objectives of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. However, we are under no illusion about the enormous difficulties that confront the culmination of those objectives. We are under no illusion about the difficulties of arranging accord among the various nations which have to be involved in the discussions and negotiations and finalisation of matters associated with the objectives of UNCTAD, but also the very real and very large practical problems of making the general purposes behind UNCTAD, behind the Common Fund, and behind the new international economic order work successfully. These difficulties are very large. They are daunting in many ways. But the fact that they are daunting is not sufficient justification ing to a commitment to try to wrestle successfully with the challenge that UNCTAD lays before us. I say that with some stress because it seems me that there is a tendency in some quarters to approach this great and very important chaland lenge with rosy spectacles, to gloss over the difficulties and to understate the real challenges which still lie ahead of the development of UNCTAD before we can conceivably regard it as being in the final stages of culmination. I gret to say that the statement of the Prime Miniskets ter (Mr Malcolm Fraser) tonight, for whatever else it did say-it did not say much-certainl y left the impression that he was approaching the chalnot lenge of UNCTAD with this rosy spectacled of view. He ought to recall that in the course of UNCTAD V discussions at Manila there was a considerable and disconcerting display of agreement, if not conflict, between the countries participating in those discussions, not on a bilateral type of dichotomy between the developing and the developed countries but on the basis of a breakup between several distincprotection tive blocs within the countries participating. It would be most unfortunate if this important undertaking were to fail, as have so many other idealistically motivated concepts which have lify been put forward in the past designed to try assist the development of developing countries. There is clear evidence in the community todaynot just in the Australian community but in the community of developed countries-that a cera tain cynicism is seeping through about ideas which are put forward to assist developing counworld, tries develop. It is cynicism based first of all grave doubts as to the genuineness of the credencountry-specificall tials and motivations of the leaders of developed countries putting forward these views, and secondly, as to whether there will be enough drive, enough will and enough guts to really make these programs succeed. I recall clearly the enormous disillusionment that many people of my generation suffer today because of the very large investment they made in the decade of development during the late 1950s and the early 1960s. Honourable members will recall that in that period-withi n a decade-the developed countries of the world were each to contribute one per cent of their gross domestic product towards the development of the lesser developed countries. It never came off but in theory it was grand and we were all sold on the commitment. It was not that the people of the developed countries failed in the commitment; it was that the governments failed. I would hate to see this sort of thing hapfor retreatpen again. Another important aspect of the Prime Minister's speech, which I wish to come back to a little to later, concerns a fundamental conflict between the principles he has put forward in this speech the principles to which he commits himself so doggedly in this country. It appears that overseas, especially on an international platform where there is a widespread audience provided from developing countries, he prefers to exemprelify the qualities of free trade and of open marand of much greater liberal access to the markets of developed countries for developing countries. He is against protection. He is against only tariff protection but also non-tariff forms protection, all of which exist in this country. More significantly, according to the Industries Assistance Commission, Australia has the second dishighest level of average protection of any a number of country in the world. There is no evidence that the Prime Minister has determined that he will reduce that level of in any effective way over any reasonable time span which would be consistent with the role he prefers to adopt when he strides onto that international stage before the representatives of developing countries seeking to exempthe qualities of free trade and of greater marto ket access. In Australia the Prime Minister adopts the grim and dogged role of an unrepentant protectionist. He cannot have it both ways. I want to come back to that point because there is serious fundamental conflict between what he is stating to the developing countries of the what he has reported to the House tonight upon and what is generally his position in this y in this Parliament-whe n enunciating Government policy in this area. Before I launch into the main thrust of what the Prime Minister had to say-it does very much come down to an interest in some of Australia's regional neighbours but essentially in the recent UNCTAD V discussions in Manila- I have to comment on his references to the role of the Union of Soviet Sociahst Republics in the Asia Pacific region. I am not clear what the implication of his statement is when he endorses the view that a constructive role by the USSR in the Asia-Pacific region would be welcome. If it is a departure from the frenetic behaviour of the Prime Minister and his Government in 1976-77 when they discovered that Russia was about to provide aid for some of the small island developing countries of the south-west Pacific, the change is welcome. I would agree with him. Russia can contribute valuably not just in our own region-the south-west Pacific and the south and South-East Asian area-bu t throughout the world and ought to be encouraged to do so. That is not the same as saying that one should pardon the shortcomings, defects and wrong doings of the USSR, but it is adopting a simple proposition, that it will be more helpful to world accord to encourage a greater participation and involvement of the USSR in world affairs. To the extent that the USSR can be who encouraged to contribute to the development independent countries while preserving their independent development, a most valuable conthere tribution will have been made not just to those countries but to a more harmonious relationship between the super powers and the major powers of the world. If that is the purpose of the Prime Minister, it deserves commendation. But if it is meant as some sort of implied hectoring, some sort of implied lecturing to Russia, that because she has now conceivably a great deal of influence with Vietnam she has to behave herself and train Vietnam to behave herself, that is ludicrous. To take that attitude is to take a particularly blinkered view of the complex relationships the world today and within our region. If the Prime Minister is genuinely concerned about stability in our region, instead of implying lectures in this way he ought to adopt immedigion ately firstly, for Australia, the reintroduction an aid program for the peaceful development of Vietnam. Mr Neil-Rubbish.",63
142,Mr HAYDEN,JOINT COMMUNIQUE,"Secondly, he ought to adopt real an aggressive role in international forums in supingly, port of a vastly expanded aid program from me Western developed countries in support development of Vietnam. I accept the proposition, if that is what is implied by the interjection, that we ought not to be providing so much aid at such a fast rate that it will allow Vietnam to become not only economically strong but also militarily strong and perhaps a destabdising influence in the world.",64
143,Mr YATES,JOINT COMMUNIQUE,It is strong enough.,64
144,Mr HAYDEN,JOINT COMMUNIQUE,"Of course, but the obverse side of the proposition is simply that the debditated state of Vietnam today leaves it almost exclusively dependent on the USSR for aid for its development. The more Vietnam is isolated from the industrialised countries of the world, the more those countries refuse to provide aid for Vietnam, the more Vietnam wdl be forced into the embrace of the USSR and the more its dependency will move towards total dependency and, accordingly, the more it will become a prisoner of the policies of the USSR. Australia ought to adopt a sensible attitude. A great deal of stupidity was spoken in this House in the 1960s from the Government side, from people who may have been different to those who are now here but whose views were no different to the views held by those here now. They were people objected to the proposition that Vietnam of could become an independent communist country within the world order of nations, that are countries such as Yugoslavia which have established beyond any doubt that that is possible-no t only possible but desirable-in the interests of the Western nations of the world. That is the objective at which we ought to be aiming. Vietnam has made it clear that she requires about $5,000m of aid to rehabilitate the country after the damage caused by the extent of to the Vietnamese wars. If we encourage the provision of that aid we will be making a far greater contribution to stability in the area and the in independence of Vietnam. We will also be diminishing the possibility of an outbreak of super power tension in our region. Honourable members should remember that the only military super power bases that are established in our reat the present time apart from comof munication bases in Australia are American bases in the Philippines. There are no permanent Russian military bases in Vietnam yet, not at Cam Ranh Bay and not at any of the air bases. As the trend is now developing there is a very likelihood that this could change. Accordit was a matter of great disappointment for to find that the Prime Minister made no referof the ence to this issue at all. What he did refer to on another topic was the improvement in Australia-Phihppines trade. I think that we ought to put the record straight on that. The Australia-Phihppines trade agreement ratification was deferred for four years. It was deferred for four years as a demonstration of dissatisfaction on the part of the Philippines with the terms of trade which it experienced with Australia. Accordingly, it applied discriminatory actions against Australia and it is only recently that trade has been allowed to develop again. So to say that exports to Australia from the Philippines have been growing by something like 45 per cent a year is meaningless. It is meaningless in the light of those experiences. Those experiences reflect an underlying problem that just has not been attended to by the Prime Minister in the comprehensive and broad framework that is needed if we are to talk about enhanced reciprocal trade relations between countries in our region and Australia. Another topic that the Prime Minister has raised from time to time as an issue of some passionate concern to him is that of human rights in countries within our region. It is an issue such paramount importance to him that he made not one mention of it in his half-hour statement to the Parliament tonight. He made no mention about this fundamental principle of the of man. Not one reference was made to this principle which is implicit in the United Nations laration of Human Rights. There is not one country in the South East Asian region where serious and extensive breaches of fundamental human rights do not take place. I recognise the limitations on a country such as Australia seeking to lecture developing countries on the issue human rights. Indeed the proposition is, and I accept it, that it could be counter-productive do this in a strident public way. But that is excuse for not taking up the issue in any way all. My own very strong impression, formed as result of an extensive visit through most of South East Asia in the middle of last year, is that Government really does not care to take up this issue but, to the extent that it may, it does it very off-handed manner. The International Commission of Jurists and Amnesty International have documented the cern. extent of the repression of humanrightsin these various countries. The Prime Minister at least should have signalled a concern about these matlation ters and then indicated clearly that wherever opportunity had arisen he had taken it to discuss Minister. this matter with the leaders of these countries. I did this with the leaders of every country that I visited in the middle of last year. Some of them do not care for the matter being raised, but there is no doubt that in raising it and putting the point of view of countries such as Australia clearly but courteously, some helpful impact is made. Let me deal with the main thrust of the Prime Minister's statement. The Prime Minister spoke of the need for freer trade in the world order today and condemned those countries which deal in such nasty practices as protection by way of tariffs or non-tariff forms of industry. Everything that he condemned applies to this country. One wonders what he is trying to pull off with this brittle moralising, this hollow posturing and this unconvincing hypocrisy. A man cannot adopt one suit in Australia and change into another on a different platform as the whim takes him, although this often happens here. Only a few weeks ago when he was speaking to the national conference of his party in Perth, the Prime Minister asserted that since he had become Prime Minister disruptions through industrial disputes had fallen dramatically. The same comnight he went on national television and condemned the trade unions for industrial action of and accused them of seeking to destroy economic recovery. He is doing exactly the same sort of thing here. In Manila he proclaimed his commitment to free trade and in Austraha declared that freedom he is an unrepentent protectionist. The latest case of the bottom lip policy making Decofthe Prime Minister is in UNCTAD V. We had a classic case of this arising from the conflict about cheaper air fares between Australia and Great Britain, a conflict which arose because the ASEAN countries resented the way in which this matter had been handled by Australia. It was reof markable that the Government should allow such a sensitive issue of foreign relations to be to handled by the Minister for Transport (Mr no Nixon). He may be very successful at negotiating at toughly on butterfat subsidies, but he cannot a understand the sensitive cultural differences between South East Asian countries and Australia. the There was plenty of warning that difficulties were going to arise. I recall that well before these in a negotiations got under way, and whilst I was in the South East Asian area in the middle of last year, the leaders of those countries, especially Singapore and India, were signalling theh conThey felt that there was a sleight directed towards them in the foreign policy attitudes of the Australian Government. Here we have in reto the ah fares conflict a classic case of botthe tom lip impulsive policy making by the Prime Honourable members will recall that for several days in the discussions on the cheap air fares there was a stalemate. No progress was being made by the negotiating parties because of the intransigence of the Austrahan delegation led by the Minister for Transport. Then, unexpectedly, in the closing hours there was a last-minute switch. It is now known why there was a last minute switch. The Minister for Transport had been discharging his instructions given to him from Cabinet. The change came at the direction of the Prime Minister who suddenly realised that he could not very well go to Manila to moralise about freer trade, about our respect for developing countries, our commitment to assist them, and at the same time be excluding them from the benefits of lower air fares. That was a clear case of economic and pohtical discrimination. I refer also to the Prime Minister's presence at UNCTAD V. Right up to the last minute the Minister  handle this matter in the usual sort of way, in the proper way and, I might add, in a confident way. The Prime Minister interceded at the last minute and he went to Manila instead. From the statement that he made there and from some of the comments that he made here tonight, I have no doubt at all that Australian industry wdl be experiencing great concern over the implications of the Prime Minister's commitments for Australian industry. The simple fact is that the businessman's government, the government allegedly of Australian industry, has not discussed these matters at all with Australian industry. Mr Madigan of Hamersley Holdings Ltd has told the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that there could be serious implicauons for Australian industries, but more particularly mineral processing industries, might otherwise have established themselves in this country, arising from what the Prime Minisprobably ter has been saying. It may be preferable that these changes take place, but what wdl their effects be and what will be the tages to us as a result? Those are not things that the Prime Minister dealt with. He has indulged in do empty, generalised rhetoric, but in none of the hard details which are necessary at this time of economic crisis in this country. In his statement of the Prime Minister stated: Australia is developing a resolution on inflation . Based on his success till now that probably means there will be more inflation. . . protectionism and structural adjustment and it is expected that this resolution will be launched at UNCTAD tomorrow. I will not read the rest of the statement. I believe that Australian industry and the Australian comempty, munity has a right to know what specifically proposed in relation to protectionism and structural adjustment and what implications those proposals have for Australian manufacturing industry. FoUowing on with this theme, the Prime Minister has not explored with us the implication of a so-called north-south dialogue which is essentially for the redistribution of resources and resource development opportunity from wealthy countries to developing countries. It is a very proper objective, but the implications have not been spelled out for us. In case it is felt by honourable members opposite that I have been unfair in criticising the Prime Minister on these matters, let me point out what the people in Malaysia think about the Prime Minister's brittle posturing overseas. Michael Richardson, an Australian newspaper correspondent in South East Asia, pubhshed an Uluminating remark from a Malaysian Government official. He quoted the official as saying: It would have been great if Australia were blameless. But any ASEAN countiy could have written the same speechand used it against Australia. That is obvious to anyone who understands the economic conditions in this country and the protectionist policies practised by the Government and who has read what the Prime Minister said overseas. The Prime Minister has approached this matter too glibly. Let me quote some remarks attributed to Mr Oliver Long, the Director-General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a few days ago. An Australian Associated Press telex reports: Mr Long said he will pressThe remarks relate to the United Nations Conwhich ference on Trade and Development at Manila. . . for governments to sign the final agreementsin October-and thus commit themselves to the new machinery created by the negotiations, looking toward continuing reductions in barriers to trade. losses and advanThe telex continues: Mr Long hopes that a safeguards code can be concluded by the Tokyo round participants by mid-July. T am going to everything possible to see that an agreement is reached because I believe it is very important', he said. The safeguards code would establish the scope and limits temporary import restraints governments could impose to protect their domestic economic interests against a surge of imports of particular products. It was the only major element . . of the Tokyo round negotiations that has not yet been concluded. I believe that the Australian community is entitled to some detail about the implications of these matters. My argument, very simply, is that the Government is not approaching this matter in any constructive or practical light at all. Glib, generalised rhetoric is no blueprint for is the process of development and change we have to go through if the Government is genuine about providing greater access for the exports of developing countries. The implications of providing greater access for the exports of developing countries is that we also will have to develop our exports to a much greater degree than we have been prepared to do so far. We have to encourage Australian manufacturing industry to be much less inward looking than it has been so far. That process of change is dislocated, and it will develop all forms of tough political resistance if it is not understood and accepted. To be understood it must be explained in its comprehensive detail; to be accepted there must be programs which make it quite clear that the process of change will be a gradual one and one which will provide various forms of support for people who would be affected by it. We are not in the business of creating a painful process of change which uses human beings or Australian industry as sacrifices to some greater common good which is not understood by anyone except a limited few, such as the Prime Minister. If he understood it, only a limited few would understand it. Let me give an example of the way in which we have been exploring this matter. We must bear in mind that we believe the problems we have in the economy today, both short term and medium to longer term, can no longer be left market forces. There has to be government matters. intervention-physica l government planning, not command planning. We need indicative plan that ning. Governments need to indicate to business, which desperately wants economic planning of this nature, what its programs will be over medium term. It is no good introducing export incentives this year because the balance of ments are weak and whipping them away the next year because the balance of payments are picking up. Business engages in expensive investan ment programs which involve periods of several years of amortisation and which are based calculations related to those investment allowfunds ances. If the allowances are withdrawn unexpecmarket tedly the whole economic viability of a business could be undermined. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) and the Deputy Leader of sition (Mr Lionel Bowen) have developed in conjunction with their colleagues a program for a textile and clothing authority which is designed to ensure better long term planning and certainty within the industry. Its purpose will be to replace the functions of the Industries Assistance Comhave mission and the Industry Quota Review Comlonger mittee in respect of clothing and textile indusrates tries. It will involve representatives of employers and employees. It will monitor the industry and recommend policies. It will suggest measures to improve efficiency and will aim to provide a base for confident investment and development. Very importantly the authority, on behalf of government, will consult and plan with our trading partners so that Australian production of clothing and textiles is integrated to the greatest extent possible with the production of countries exporting to us. The simple facts are that if there is to be any future for this country in its economic development and if we are to sustain relatively our per capita living standards in relation to other developed countries in the world we have to explore ways in which we can integrate our economic development with other nations' economies. It is clear that the European economies are closing off from us. It is equally obvious that the opportunities available in America are limited and will continue to be so. It is therefore quite apparent that our greatest opportunities are going to lie in our own region-in east, south and South East Asia. But they will not be easy markets to tap. Already the volume of manufacturers in our total exports to ASEAN countries has dropped from 51 per cent less than 10 years ago to 39 per cent. This has occurred under this Government, which to claims to be concerned about promoting these Let me outline very quickly some of the things have to be done. A national trading corporation has to be set up with specialised negotiating skills and facilities to trade with countries like the East Europe and China, and Third World nations where this sort of trading arrangement is payunderstood and preferred. Payroll tax reimbursement for exporters ought to be re-explored. Such a system applied some years ago and was excellentfinancialincentive for the development of exports. A research and development on corporation ought to be established with the available to allow it to patent, develop, and promote Australian inventions. Perhaps we should consider increasing the total volume of aid by exploring other forms of aid rather than making all aid exclusively untied aid. Many countries provide tied aid through the apthe Oppoplication of export credits. I am not suggesting that we reduce the volume of aid in any relative sense but rather that we top up on that. It is far better to increase the total in this way than not to increase it at all. We will to establish afinancialinstitution to provide term credit with accommodating interest for developing countries so that we can sell our exports more successfully and more easily. Other developed countries, especially Japan, do so. We will have to adopt a set of policies designed to influence the export policies of multinational corporations in this country and also to encourage them to invest a greater proportion of their profits in research and development in this country. We will also need a much more effective arrangement to follow up trade development missions that go to developing countries. The most persistent criticism I experienced last year in south and South East Asia was that Australia sent trade development missions to these countries, but there was never any follow up.",64
145,Mr YATES,JOINT COMMUNIQUE,Ha ! Good point.,68
146,Mr HAYDEN,JOINT COMMUNIQUE,"I am telling the honourable member what the people of these countries said. They said that there was never any effective follow up. That was certainly true in India. The Government has no room at all for complacency or satisfaction in the area of aid. There has been a 20 per cent cut in relative terms in aid for developing countries, a reduction of some $200m under the inspired leadership of the small '1' liberal Minister for Foreign Affairs who may know a great deal about Gucci toothbrushes but who does not have anywhere near as great a commitment towards the development of developing countries. Aid to developing countries as a proportion of gross domestic product went from 0.6 per cent in 1975 down to 0.45 per cent in 1977. In 1978 it was indisputably even lower than that. That is the sort of priority the Government allocates for aid to developing countries. Instead of money being spent on spectacular investment programs and perhaps expensive electronic communications for developing countries, which very largely benefit the middle class of those countries, the whole set of concepts behind aid for developing countries needs to be reassessed and new principles and priorities established. For instance, within our region the two greatest needs fall in the areas of eracy and health services. We are eminently equipped to provide specialists-for instance, educationalists, health workers and nurses-wh o could work in those areas. It is a matter of properly designing a program, carefully selecting people because of their maturity, measured in terms of their personality, judgment and balance rather than necessarily their age, training them in the appropriate languages and developing grass roots literacy and health service programs, preferably at the village level. This is a far more effective and sustainable way of helping the development of these countries. Finally, the Prime Minister should explore what I believe should be a high priority for the developed countries of this world, that is, a marshal aid type development program, funded by the developing countries of the world for the development of the lesser developed countries of the world. The marshal aid type program was outstandingly successful at the end of the Second World War in restoring the war ravaged economies and social systems of Germany and Japan, among many other countries. They were the main countries. It is indisputable, on that experience, that this sort of concept can and will work successfully. It is a two way benefit. Not only does it help the developing countries but also, at a time of depressed economic activity internationally, it can assist the restoration of economic activity in the developing countries. In short, the Prime Minister's statement is interesting very largely because of the conflict it reflects in the fundamental principles he has espoused, proclaiming the virtues of free trade overseas when, in fact, at home he does anything but that. It is disappomting because of the empty rhetoric and the brittle posturing which are part and parcel of his statement. It is most discouraging because it failed to face in any detailed way the complex problems which confront developing nations today and the implications of the various programs associated with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development V discussions, how they will affect Australian industry and how we will respond. The Prime Minister's statement is interesting only for the questions it should have raised and should have answered. NA (REDEPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT) BILL 1979 Second Reading Debate resumed.",68
147,Mr YOUNG,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"The Oplitposition is totally opposed to some clauses of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill. Those clauses to which we are opposed aptly reflect the hostile attitude of this Government to the Public Service. Indeed, one can take a line through the Government's policy on staff ceilings in looking at its general attitude to the role of the Public Service in providing a proper service to the community of Australia. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I had pointed out that this attitude had been applied throughout most departments but in particular to the Commonwealth Employment Service at a time when this Government has brought about a record unemploymentfigureof 450,000 people. Yet it still seeks to cut back the service offered by the Commonwealth Employment Service by reducing the number of staff available. That is not the only issue at stake. I draw attention to a letter which was sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) yesterday, a copy of which has been sent to me by a constituent in the Australian Capital Territory. It draws the attention of the Parliament to the irrational staff cuts that have taken place and how they are affecting people in the community. The letter states:. Dear Prime Minister I write to draw your attention to a situation which has arisen at my daughter's school (Malkara Special School, ACT) as a direct result of your Government's policy in relation to Public Service staff ceilings. In short, the situation is that speech therapy services once were provided at the school have had to be withdrawn because of staffing constraints tory Health Commission. As the attached letter from the Commission says in part, 'The Speech Therapy service of the Mental Health Branch does not have enough staff to service all areas or groups within Canberra which desperately require it.' In the other copy Chairman of the ACT Schools Authority acknowledges that '. . . a recognised need is not being met' As I said, one can take a line through the Government's pohcies on staff ceilings to see what it would do with the new power which is made available under the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill. People generally would not be opposed to the redeployment and the proper and efficient use of the resources of the Public Service. But giving it wide powers for the dismissal of people for any reason which is provided for under clause 7 of this Bill is something to which we on the Opposition side of the House and to which people who will be subject to the provisions of this Bill are opposed. In New South Wales alone at the end of March this year a fully staffed CES office would have required an additional 279 people. On average that is three staff per office. Let us examine the administration of the export development incentives which this Government supposedly regards as so important. In the Export Development Grants Board there have been delays of up to two years in processing claims because this Government has not provided sufficient professional staff to cope with the expanded work load. Senior officers of the Board have had to work as receptionists and clerical assistants because the Government could not be bothered to hire any of the hundreds and thousands of school leavers it has relegated to the dole queues. For instance, in the last year of the Labor Government 3,226 school leavers were recruited as permanent employees of the Public Service compared with 1,430 in the first year of the Fraser Government. These examples of false economies could go on and on. In the 1978 annual report of the Public Service Board the Board warned the Government that its rigid and inane application of staff ceilings had grave implications for standards of service. Staff ceilings, the Board said: . . . reduced mobility between departments countering the best usage of skills and talents available; diverted resources away from the training and staff development programs and acdvities relating to the achievement of long term economies. Let me continue with the views of the Public Service Board. One can see from the comments made in its annual report from which I have read and from which I will quote again, how far this that Government is going. The philosophy behind the Government's move for termination of employplaced on the Capital Terriment of people less than 55 years of age parallels its mad thinking in relation to staff ceilings in the Public Service. Again I quote from the Public Service Board annual report 1977. It states: of correspondence attached, the There are also indications that the restrictions are adversely affecting the efficiency of the Service in the longer term. In order to meet immediate commitments, some departments have considered it necessary to divert resources away from training and staff development programs thus impeding the development of essential knowledge and skills. In a num ber of areas in the Service it has been necessaiy to curtail review acdvities directed towards the achievement of long term economy. This Government states that the Bill is directed to more efficient use of resources of the Public Service. But its previous decisions which were aimed at greater use and efficiency of the Public Service do not stand up to scrutiny. If the Government took time out to sit down with the peak councds and discuss these matters it would find that many reasons would be given by the peak councds as to why this legislation ought to be withdrawn. Greater negotiation ought to be taking place between Government and the employee representatives because some of the past arguments used by the Government have not turned out to be factual. The Public Service Board annual report also states: In current circumstances, it is the Board's view that any further general reductions in staff ceilings would call for corresponding decisions by the Government to forego functions orreducestandards of service. During 1977-78 a large number of representations was made by departments and authorities for increases in their staff ceilings. The main increases sought were in the context of: Increased numbers of people served by unemployment benefits administration in the Departments of Social and Employment and Industrial Relations. The need for newly established bodies to consolidate activities, for example, the Special Broadcasting Service, the Industrial Relations Bureau, and An increased emphaiss on some existing activities, for example, in the area of import controls. One could go on quoting what the Pubhc Service Board said or even what the Coombs inquiry said in relation to some of these matters upon which the Government has acted. But it has acted, as I have said, with false economies. consultant's report to the Coombs inquiry had this to say: Substantial evidence exists that the vast majority net Ministers are completely unaware of the impact of ceilings upon their departments and hence have paid them lip service. Ceilings have assumed too much of the aura of a euphemistic political ploy. They have produced breakdowns in various parts of the government administration in term, and they have proved incapable of handling term crises. They have proved incompatible with public sector planning. Although exerting some controlling influence over numerical movements in staff they have produced minimal influence upon efficiency and resource allocation departments. I think the Government would have to put for the ward a far more substantial argument in support retirement. of the Bill for this House to agree to it than the case put forward in the second reading speech the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner). The Minister argues that all is done for the proper, efficient use of the resources of the Public Service. But that is exactly what Government argued when it put forward the view that the Public Service should be smaller numerically than it was when the Government came to power. But all the Government has done in reducing the number of staff in the Public vice is ensured that the community has a worse service and that the people in the Public Service cannot carry out their duties. These reports make it plain that standards service are falling. Activities are being curtailed and the structure and capacity of the Public vice are being undermined. Such results, testified to by the highest bureaucratic authority, indicate dards that the policies that this Government pursues are policies of false economy. the Public Service is being starved of human resources, the number of unemployed is growing. In the name of efficiency, this Government tifies its irresponsible failure to staff adequately those parts of the bureaucracy providing services to orfindingjobs for the unemployed. In marked contrast to the Fraser Government's savage repression of employment in vital areas of the pubUc sector, stands its extravagant use of comSecurity mittees of inquiry and task forces whose reports are usually commissioned to enable the Governtheir ment to pass the buck for its disinterest in posiand tive and compassionate proposals in the areas of employment, health and social security. The Prime Minister, smce his election, has set up some 80 inquiries at enormous expense to the Australian taxpayer. The WUUams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training, whose report was unique in that it faUed to produce one positive proposal to alleviate youth unemployThe ment, cost approximately $lm. Over the past three years, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, as it was called before it was broken up, has placed before Cabinet nuof Cabimerous submissions relating to job creation, eduonly cation and training. All were rejected. During this time, the Government spent $lm on a cosmetic inquiry which produced a document rethe long nowned for its concern for privUege and inshortequality. Consultants, lawyers and university professors have profited from generous handouts whUe public servants are expected to grin and in bear unfair staff ceUings, government vUification and disinterest. They are now threatened with ultimate humiliation-managemen t initiated The problem with this Bill is not that it is conof cerned with efficiency and economy but that, given this Government's record, it will be used as an instrument for pursuing further false economies, for justifying staff cuts in areas such as social the security, employment and health. A Labor government, in its approach to these matters, would not want to see the numbers employed in Australian government areas run wUd. What we would want to see would be staff numbers that Serwere adequate to carry out the functions of departments at the standard that the public is entitled to expect. We would adopt the Coombs inquiry recommendation for the abohtion of staff of ceilings and would substitute the manpower budgeting system recommended by the inquiry. SerThe advantage of that system is that it gears staffing levels to work requirements and stanof service. We would also expect the public sector to make some contribution to the easing of At the same time as unemployment. Nowhere in the Minister's second reading speech did he make any attempt to explain why justhe Government has not followed the blueprint offered by the Coombs inquiry in respect of die matters to which the Bill relates. That blueprint was based on the existing and well understood provisions of sections 20,67 and 85 of the Public Service Act. In relation to permanent staff, those provisions give the Public Service Board power to retrench staff excess to requirements, to retire persons who have reached minimum retiring age and to retire persons who are inefficient for reasons within or beyond their own control. The basic framework was already there. All it needed was some modifications such as the development of an appeal and review system, in which case we would not have the Public Service in the uproar it is in now. Instead, we have this piece of legislation which is woolly in its thinking, sinister in its possible means of application and open to arbitrary extension by administrative regulation and procedures effectively outside the scrutiny of Parliament. The Labor Party acknowledges that there are some worthwhile facets of the Bill. Voluntary early retirement is one such provision. The redeployment provisions are much needed, but are ill-conceived. On the other hand, the manner in which the Bill is framed makes it difficult to bring forward amendments. There are some questions which require considerable thought and further investigation. There is a lot to suggest that the provisions of the Bill have not been adequately thought through. In the circumstances, the Opposition moves: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view stituting the following words: 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted to incorporate(a) specific reasoning for termination of employment; and (b) a comprehensive appeal system relating to termination of employment and redeployment'. If, as will be the case, our amendment is defeated, we intend tofightin the Committee stage several clauses of this Bill. We join with members of the Commonwealth Public Service who believe that the manner in which this Bill is drafted leaves open to a government which has shown no sincerity at all to its own employees, powers that will politicise the Public Service in a way which is totally unacceptable to the Australian community, and a way which was never intended by the people who formed these parliaments that the Public Service should be used. It will leave open to the Government the opportunity to treat the Public Service in a manner which it is not able to treat any other section of the Australian work force. It is important that the Parliament does not treat the public servant as just another member of the work force. If the Fraser Administration politicises the Public Service in the standover way in which this Bill is drafted, it will be a very dark day indeed, not just for the public servants of Australia but for the whole Australian community.",68
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,ls the amendment seconded?,71
149,Mr HURFORD,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I second the amendment, Mr Deputy Speaker, and reserve my right to speak.",71
150,Mr FALCONER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES, I support the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill 1979 and oppose very strongly the amendment moved by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young).,71
151,Mr HODGMAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,A hypocrite!,71
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Order! I ask the honourable member for Denison to stand and withdraw that remark.,71
153,Mr HODGMAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker.",71
154,Mr FALCONER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I believe that if this House were to accept the amendment put forward by the honourable member for Port Adelaide to withdraw this Bill with a view to redrafting it in certain ways, thereby delaying still further its passage through this House, the greatest scream of protest we would hear would be from the many public servants who are looking forward to the introduction of this Bill and its passage through this Parliament so that they can take to subadvantage of the number of early retirement provisions contained in this Bill. Indeed, the members of the Opposition who are putting forward the suggestion that we delay the introduction of this Bill to enable further consideration would find that they would reap the wrath of many rank and file members of Public Service unions who are looking forward to this Bill. The Bill makes provision for the introduction of a scheme of redeployment and retirement in the Public Service and, where prescribed, in other areas of Commonwealth employment. The main features of the Bill are along similar lines to the scheme proposed in the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill 1976. The Bill before us imposes an obligation on managers in the Public Service to identify staff who cannot be efficiently utilised and to declare such staff as eligible for redeployment. The grounds for such action relate, firstly, to excess numbers of staff, secondly, to invalidity on the part of employees and, thirdly, to other reasons such as loss of licence where it is relevant to the performance of particular functions or limited efficiency in performing the functions of a position. The Public Service Board is required to attempt to redeploy such staff in other areas of the Public Service. In the event that staff cannot be so redeployed, provision is made for retirement with compensation in some cases. Discussion and negotiation with Public Service unions have resulted in improvements to the 1976 Bill, particularly with respect to the right of appeal against some of its provisions. Under the Bill before us, staff have the right appeal at three stages of the process of redeployorder ment and retirement. They have the right of. appeal, firstly, at the stage when they are idenwho tified as a declared employee ondly, where action is taken by way of redeployment and, thirdly, where action is taken by way of retirement of certain employees. An appeals tribunal set up to hear appeals is required to regard to procedures and principles notified the Board or relevant authority as applying to such actions. The Bill incorporates significant amendments to the earlier Bill in the area of appeal rights following discussions with staff ganisations, as I have outlined. It also makes proenterprise vision for the introduction of voluntary retireperson ment at age 55 with reduced benefits under the Superannuation Act. In some of the comments that they have made members of the Opposition and some Public Service union leaders are judging the mood of members of the Public Sercompanies vice. Members of the Public Service want the early voluntary retirement provisions. They are not afraid of the compulsory retirement profor visions. Anyone in the Public Service of reasoncompensate able ability is confident of his or her ability does not fear the provisions for management inifind tiated retirement. Where such involuntary retireary. ment occurs from the age of 55 onwards, an officer obtains significant additional benefits compensate for that early retirement. Let me refer to the scale. If someone is retired one before the age of 60-that is, at the age of or she receives an additional two months' salary as a lump sum. At the age of 58, the benefit is an additional four months' salary. At the age of 57, it is six months' salary. At the age of 56, it is months' salary. At the age of 55, it is 10 months' salary. In other words, there is lump sum comthe pensation for service foregone at the rate of months' salary for every one year's retirement before the age of 60. Not only are such persons paid a lump sum; they may also convert it into a pension who entitlement. The lump sum may be converted to a pension which will provide significant advice ditional benefits. Let us look at the example of Clerk Class 5 retiring at the age of 55 years salary of approximately $14,000 after 30 years' service. Under the provisions contained in this Bill, if he uses the option to take out additional pension rights with his lump sum he can retire at 55 on a pension of $8,062 per annum. It would not take a great deal of effort to get some part time position to make up his total income to the level of the salary which he was originally earning. Some people on my side of the House have suggested that officers might even be tempted to of try to get retirement under those provisions into qualify for the additional lump sum benefit which would not be available to a person chose voluntarily to retire and simply took under the Bill, secthe option. We have to take many of the protestations of members opposite with a grain of salt when they have purport to say that members of the Public Serby vice do not want these provisions and that they fear them. That is not the impression that I get. When those provisions are compared to the sorts of provisions available in private enterprise, they ormust be regarded as very attractive. In private generally, there is no guarantee that a whose employment is terminated well before normal retiring age will get any additional lump sum benefit beyond whatever superannuation entitlement he has accumulated to that misdate. Certainly, with many of the larger in private enterprise, it is standard practice for an appropriate compensation to be made, for several months' salary to be paid or certain benefits to be extended to a person to for the fact that he has been retired and early and at an age when it might be difficult to equivalent employment at an equivalent salHowever, many smaller and medium sized companies-probabl y most of them-woul d not to be able to afford to provide those sorts of additional benefits in the case of employees who year had their employment terminated at an age sev59-h e eral years before normal retirement age. The question has been posed: Will the Bill allow the Government to getridof politically uneight acceptable employees? That is the sort of suggestion that has been floated by some members of Opposition. They have suggested that the Bill two will allow us to get rid of employees whom we deem to be politically unacceptable. That is just not on under the provisions of the Bill before the House. It does not provide for the Government to play any part in selecting individual personnel wdl be affected by it. That role is in the hands of departmental heads and the Public SerBoard itself. In the interests of maintaining a an independent and impartial Public Service, the at a Bill continues the Westminster tradition of not involving the Government or Ministers in internal personnel matters. The Government's general decisions might have an impact on the numbers of staff required but the Government cannot specify the individuals who will be affected under the provisions of the Bill. There has been a suggestion also that the Bill gives excessive power to the Pubhc Service Board to interfere in departments through the redeployment powers. Ultimately, the Board will have the power to redeploy staff in departments. That will happen at the end of the process spelt out in the Bill. But this general power is already given to the Board in the Public Service Act which is on the statutes at the moment. The more detailed provisions in the new Bill are consistent with the role recommended for the Board by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administrauon in handling excess staff cases. It is important to note that it also conforms closely with what some unions have wanted in excess staff situations-for example, in the Health Insurance Commission. Let us look at the extent of the application of this Bill. It will apply to all Public Service and prescribed statutory authorities except those on probation and fixed contracts and temporary employees with less than one year's service. Initially, the Bill will extend only to staff of the Austrahan Public Service. But there is provision for it to be extended by regulation to cover employees of Commonwealth authorities but only where each particular authority agrees to be so covered. Let me repeat the specinc and specified grounds on which staff can be identified for redeployment or retirement. They are, firstly, where an employee is one of a class of employees excess to the efficient operating needs of their organisation. Secondly, they apply in the case of physical or mental incapacity; thirdly, they apply for any other reason prescribed in regulations under the Bill. Let me talk about these proposed regulations. Regulations prescribing 'other reasons' can be made only after the Pubhc Service Board has consulted with employee organisations and reported to the Governor General on the result of those consultations. The 'other reasons' that the Government at present has in mind proposing are, firstly, limited efficiency or an incapacity to perform work at a standard consistent with the efficient working of the organisation and, secondly, loss of an essential licence or qualification which is necessary of the performance of certain functions associated with a position. I suggest that they are very reasonable and limited provisions. Certainly, in private enterprise if someone was of limited efficiency or had lost an essential licence or qualification which was necessary for the performance of the functions of a certain position, there would not be much question about redeployment. In many cases, there would be direct termination of employment and there would be no rights of appeal or guarantees of compensation which are provided for under this Bill. Another question which arises and which has been repeated is whether the Bill will allow for the arbitrary sacking of public servants for capricious reasons. The answer is, not at all. The Bill provides for the identification of staff whose services are not being used in the most efficient manner practicable. Staff can be identified only on specified grounds, in accordance with criteria and procedures to be notified in the Australian Government Gazette. Before retirement can take place, alternative employment opportunities must be thoroughly explored and all staff have rights of appeal to an independent tribunal against decisions taken under the legislation. As I have said before, that is far in excess of the guarantees that would apply in private staff of the Australian enterprise. Another question is whether the Bdl will affect the concept of the career service. We have been used to the concept of the Pubhc Service offering permanency of employment. In the past that permanency of employment has been accepted, at least pardy, in compensation for a lower rate of remuneration than would apply in private industry. That certainly has not been the case in recent years because we know that to a large extent the Public Service has been a pacesetter in remuneration and other conditions of employment whde still retaining the conditions of permanency of employment subject to the termination provisions which exist under the Public Service Act. Under this Bill the concept of a pubhc service with security of tenure for career officials will be preserved. The concept has always been subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act relating to termination of employment of surplus officers, retirement on the grounds of invalidity, inefficiency or incompetence, and dismissal on disciplinary grounds. Indeed, the disciplinary grounds provisions have been used very rarely. I could probably count on thefingersof one hand the number of occasions on which such grounds have been used. This Bill does not effect the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act. It modifies the other provisions which have been described in the past as being of too summary a nature by providing a more extensive range of appeal rights avadable to staff affected and by setting out more clearly the framework within which decisions are taken. As I have said, I believe that this Bill is looked forward to with anticipation by a great many people in the Public Service. The great majority of public servants does not in any way fear the provisions for compulsory retirement. Officers who are confident of their own ability and their own contribution have no reason to fear this legislation. Those officers who might be affected by these provisions have very extensive rights of appeal and in many cases they will obtain extensive additional benefits which are not available to other officers retiring voluntarily or to people in private industry whose employment is terminated for various reasons. I believe that the Bill deserves the support of this House. I believe also that it deserves a speedy passage and that its speedy passage is being looked forward to by a great many public servants who are not being represented by honourable members opposite who are seeking to delay its passage through the Parliament.",71
155,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I would to deal with one or two matters raised by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer). The honourable member put to the House that public servants would be angry if the Opposition saw fit to use any of the forms of this House delay the passage of the Commonwealth Emceit ployees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill. The honourable member guaranteed that the ganisations passage of this Bill would not ring the death knell for career public service. He also there are comprehensive appeal provisions in the Bill. That is a load of hypocritical claptrap. In the first instance, if the Government were serious about the principle of a career public service, would have introduced the voluntary retirement provisions as afirstmeasure. It would have done that if it felt that the Public Service was not ing pace with the availability of employment either now or in the future. In effect, that would reads: have been the way to go about it, but the Government is not fair dinkum. It wants to apply the same philosophy it has applied ing to bring employees to heel both in the private and public sectors of the community.",74
156,Mr VINER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,That' s a good philosophy.,74
157,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, who is sitting at the table, said 'That's a good philosophy'. That is typical ofhis union bashing concept. The individual whom craves after-the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is precisely the same. The philosophy is follows: spelled out chapter and verse in this legislation. It is inbuilt in it.",74
158,Mr VINER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,I used to act for your union.,74
159,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"The Minister took money off the unions for years and he sent them down the drain; so much for maintaining the principle of permanent career service recruitment. A person had to qualify for employment in the Public Service. Employees were guaranteed a career, a service they would render in the interests of all citizens of this country. But following the passage of this Bill a whole range of other conditions will apply in retrospect which were never anticipated by people who sought a career in the Public Service. This Bill will affect not only those who are sick or those who can no longer carry out their jobs. Efficient officers of the Public Service will be dismissed. A rose by any other name; call it what you may. This Bill is called a redeployment and retirement Bill but it is the sack in anybody's language if the end result is the same. I will illustrate the effectiveness of the so-called appeal provisions and the fallacy that is involved in them. The provisions demand that an employee dob in his or her work mate for the sack. It is a like competition of toe the line, be a noncontroversial, non-original officer in policy and administration work. The philosophy in this Bill is in keeping with the philosophy in other Bills that has been spelled out and spat out by individto uals on the Government side of the House. Deand deception have been served up to the trade union movement and other employee orin this country. For instance, I would like to quote from a letter signed by the Prime pointed out that Minister and sent to ",74
160,Mr VINER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Is that a union circular?,74
161,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"It is a circular that was sent to Mr it B. Gradwell, the Federal Secretary of the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations. It is signed by Malcolm Fraser. One keepparagraph is headed 'Employment Levels and Job Security'. That is a beauty! Paragraph (a) It has been our express policyin endeavoursays Malcolmto avoid retrenchments and this will continue.",74
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES, Order! The honourable member may not refer to the Prime Minister as Malcolm.,74
163,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I withdraw and apologise. The second paragraph of this letter, written not by he my friend the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) but by the Prime Minister, read as Overall staffing levels will be determined in the light of need. Although there may be both increases and decreases in particular areas of administration as workloads vary, the initial process of streamlining has now been substantially completed and in general there will be a stability in the service. This Bill is presented not to apply the philosophy of voluntary retirements-the Government may not get an argument from this side of the House against the implementation of such a philosophy-bu t as a devious concept, with the sting in the tail, to apply a set of circumstances to individuals who bow to the pressures of the Government whether they be in a Government department or a Commonwealth authority, all of whom day after day are stood over by the Government in the carrying out of their duties. I refer to Telecom Australia, Australia Post and other authorities which have quite coincidentally adopted the staff levels that the Government has applied. In the event of industrial disputation, such as we have in Australia Post, the philosophy of the Government applies once again. It is not left to the Concihation and Arbitration Commission to resolve the dispute because by instruction and pressure from the Government the dispute is taken out of that area. I have often thought that the mateship principle, that great Aussie characteristic, has been overplayed in this country. I rather beheve that the basic selfishness engendered by pressure from the Government, rather than the sugar-coated myth of mateship, operates when people are competing for jobs. If I am wrong and the spirit of mateship is a driving force in Australian life, in our homes and work places, then this Bill can be seen as a monstrous attempt by the Government to destroy that force. I am now referring to the great appeal provision in the Bill. Here we have a Bill which forcibly redeploys and, I suggest, in practice will forcibly retire public servants whose only means of saving their jobs, saving theh careers, saving the income which maintains their families and lifestyles, is to appeal against the declaration which renders them redeployed or retired. But in an appeal, the victim must involve his or her work mates by seeking an alternative employee in the same section to receive the declaration. The only way an employee can escape the arbitrary powers of this Bill, as I indicated before, is by dobbing in his work mate. We have to realise that this is a disgusting and disgraceful position for a government to put its workers in. It is callous, brutal and insensitive-the e words which appropriately sum up what this Government is all about-and is carried out very effectively by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) who is seated at the table. I will return to this point later. I would like to analyse the motivation for this Bill. It is motivated by the basic philosophy behind the Government's inexorable aim since it stole government in 1975 which simply put, is to put endlessly increasing profits into the pockets of people who own and control and to ensure that the Public Service is going to be the 'whipping horse' of all the people whom the Government represents on that side of the House. So far as the Opposition is concerned, profits are soaring not only in the private sector but also among our authorities for Telecom also is in the business of making a profit. When we seek to analyse what is happening in both areas, we find once again a tax on the employees who are making those profits. The Government has been dedicated to this philosophy since it took office of applying pressure to the Public Service. It seeks to make it the 'whipping horse' and to hold it out as the scapegoat for the Government's incompetence. Since this Government took office it has handed out investment allowances and massive profits to Government friends and sacked hundreds of thousands of workers whose place in the economic cycle has been taken by technology; but it has totally disregarded where we go from this point. So far as the Public Service is concerned, surely the Government has a responsibility not to enlarge the ranks of the unemployed. The Government has a responsibility to the young people of this country to create training faciUties and employment opportunities in the Public Service but not by throwing on the scrap heap those who are 55 years of age or thereabouts. In the climate that has been developed through the application of the economic policies of this Government, there is nowhere that a sacked 55-year old person can go. The question of taking away the livelihood of people in the work force and pressuring them into a situation so that they become one of the large group of people out there, hanging out like granny's tooth, suffering the indignity",74
164,Mr VINER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,I do not understand this.,75
165,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"You would never understand it because you have always had a sUver spoon in your mouth. It would not matter how many people found themselves in this position, you have a total disregard for them.",75
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Order! It is not a private debate. The honourable member will address his remarks through the Chair.,75
167,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am asking for your protection from the interjections of the Minister. From the outset the Government has abandoned all its promises to people. I have just read a promise by the Prime Minister to maintain stability in the Public Service. The Government abandons indexation by arguing for no wage increase at all and yet workers who find their wages falling behind are threatened with draconian measures unless they abide by the guidelines. The same philosophy applies in the Bill. All that I have said is relevant to the Bill fore us because this Government has seen the set Public Service as an albatross around the neck private industry, a drain on the profitability of friends. It has gone against all the principles of government spending in an unemployment environment by cutting back consistently in the public sector. The next Budget strategy will spell out the same approach with the Government putting the squeeze on departments and, by utilising the propublic visions of this Bill, giving away efficient officers so that it can apply the staff ceilings in the they have been applied in the past. At a time when the Public Service should be increasing, when money should be made available to local authorities to provide employment on works public benefit, the Government is forcing Public Service to operate at skeleton levels and is undermining the initiative and morale of its work force. The Government has imposed staff ceilings departments, many times arbitrarily, and give claimed that these levels can be reached by natuof ral resignations and retirements. But obviously the rate of natural resignation and retirement not been enough for the squire of Nareen and other wealthy gentlemen opposite. They have decided to put the screws on their workforce even harder and in the most malicious way imstakes aginable. I cannot think of a better way in which to destroy the morale of the whose employees are those for whom the Government ought to have most concern. One of the great attractions of the Public vice is destroyed in this Bill. As I have indicated before, the attraction of permanency has been removed. Let us be honest about it; there are many boring jobs in the Public Service, particuvery larly in the early years, and one of its disadvantline, ages is that promotions never really take aptitude and interest into account. A public servant conby ceivably could go through the normal promoyou'. tional processes of a career and never do a job which he or she particularly liked or which fully utilised that person's particular talents. Natservice. urally I believe that that does not apply to public servants. I do not suggest that it'apphes even to the majority. However, I do beheve that one of the driving forces which leads a person to decide on a Public Service career is the security of permanency. That security, as I said, is destroyed by this Bill. The Government is applying in a retrospective way a set of rules that will affect the lives of thousands of people who are working in the Public beService. The effects of compulsory retirement as out in this Bill will shatter many of the indiof viduals who have budgeted for their future. It is its not a question of whether they are efficient or have the capacity to do the job; it is a question of whether they have become redundant by virtue of the fact that there are just too many people in a department or in a particular area. The Bill refers to redeployment, but I believe the thrust of the Bill is to reduce the number of servants. Surely that cannot be denied. I contend that, in a huge mapority of cases, it will way be found that no suitable vacancy will be found elsewhere and the employee will be sacked. The euphemism used in the Bill is 'retired'. I have seen exactly the same situation occur in the State of Electricity Commission of Victoria. There we its saw the same circumstances and the same it processes, and the same sugar-coated operation was laid down in regulations that were provided for the purpose of retrenching people when the on power houses in Victoria began to shut down to way to changes in technology. The same sort situation applied at that time. In the SEC in Victoria a person was confronted with two has alternatives. Either he retired or he accepted a the job many hundreds of miles away from where he was brought up, had his stakes or lived with his family, in which case he would have to pick up and move to a place where one would not send his worse enemy. I refer to the coalfields Public Service, around Yallourn. The principle in this Bill is the same. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs has Serbeen champing at the bit to talk about this wonderful system of appeals. We heard the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) spell out what a wonderful system it is. But it contains that philosophy of a person having to toe the be non-controversial, non-original and prepared to barter with the individual alongside him saying: ' I should not be sacked; it should be That is a great state of affairs. That builds up a great sense of comradeship and mateship in a work situation which is supposed to be a public The power to declare that employees are all in excess of requirements is frightening, both from the viewpoint of the employees who become its direct victims and for those who remain. Those who remain then have the pressure applied to them.",75
168,Mr BAILLIEU,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,What is this all about?,77
169,Mr INNES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"The honourable member for La Trobe will not be here after the next election so he will not have to worry about anything. Those who remain in the Public Service will find themselves working under increased and unfair pressure, working excessive overtime under the continual, morale-draining strain of wondering when the next round of cuts will be ordered and, again, when the department or section will be declared 'in excess'. It is an arbitrary power against which there is no appeal. The appeals tribual established in this Bill gives the employee the right to appeal only against his or her personal declaration. The result is that we have this sad state of affairs when one individual has to compete directly against another. Clause 7 also gives frightening powers to the Government and its permanent heads. It outlines the reasons under which an employee may redeployed or retired and lists, excess' clause and, secondly, physical or mental incapacity. It then lists the most terrifying news for public servants: 'for any other prescribed reason'. Fancy putting that power in the hands of individuals like the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Baillieu), the Minister for Employhave ment and Youth Affairs or the honourable efficiency member for Casey. For God's sake, it would like making friends with a rattlesnake. That power, along with the basic motivation of Bill, means the end of permanency and the end of the capacity of public servants to see selves as rendering a service without the fear people applying undue pressure on them will throughout their careers. They should be able to look forward to the end of their working life not be forced into a situation of premature retireService. ment. People may like all the sop that is being put to them, but if the Government is serious about voluntary retirement it should have head introduced that provision in thefirstinstance and given it a trial. If that had worked out there would have been no reason to include the other provisions now contained in the Bill.",77
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES," Order! ment The honourable member's time has expired.  cussing the matters which have been raised the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) I think it would be worthwhile going through the details of the Bill so that we know what we are talking about. It seems that both he and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) have read only the letters from the union secretary and have not read the Bill. On many occasions members of the Public Service have come to me complaining about what they see as inefficiencies in their departments. Some have suggested that they have insufficient work to do. More often they have come complaining of others in their department who are not being fully utilised. I think this latter problem is one which can be deleterious to the morale of any worker, be he in the Public Service or within the private enterprise sector. People who are doing a normal day's work but who are consistently in the company of others who have little to do may feel distracted by the other person's obvious free time, or may become concerned about the apparently inequitable work load or be genuinely embarrassed by the waste of public funds. Of course, depending on the nature of the person involved, they may even feel jealous of those with little or nothing to do. This sort of problem can arise in the Public Service because of the nature of the work involved, where the work load can be change dramatically at different times first, the 'in throughout the year. Another feature of the Public Service which concerned me was the lack of independent advice given to those responsible for the efficient working of the various departments or sections. I spoken before in this House of the need for audits. I am pleased to say that these be have now been implemented by this Government. These audits should enable an indepenthis dent assessment of the means by which the objectives of the section or department are being themmet. I believe that this Commonwealth Emof ployees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill be of assistance in both areas which I have mentioned. The Bill aims to increase the efficient and and economic use of staff within the Public Clause 9 of the Bill states that the permanent of a department is responsible for ensuring that the department operates in such a manner as to make efficient and economical use of the services of the persons employed in that department. It then sets out the means by which this aim is to be achieved. Surely the role of governis not only to provide programs to serve the needs of the Australian population but also to ensure that those programs are carried out After all, it is the general public, the by taxpayer, who is paying for such programs. This Bill enables employees to be redeployed. The objects are set out in clause 7. I think these objects are worth reading out to the Parliament. Clause 7 reads: (1) The objects of this Part arefirst, to ensure, to the greatest extent that it is practicable, that each Department and each prescribed Commonwealth authority operates in such a manner as to make efficient and economical use of the services of the persons employed in the Department or by the authority; . . . secondly, to ensure, to the greatest extent that is practicable, that each employee in a Department, and each employee of a prescribed Commonwealth authority, whose services cannot, consistently with object of this Part, reasonably be used in the department or by the authority . . . The clause then sets out the various grounds upon which employees may be declared to be eliAssociation gible for redeployment or retirement. I think these are worth listing. They relate to people who, because of a physical or mental incapacity, are incapable of performing their duty or, secthe ondly, to people who are excess to the number employees required in that department or, thirdly, to those who come within the areas to prescribed. The Government has already made it clear that it will be looking to prescribe those used persons who no longer have an essential licence vice or qualification to be able to carry those with limited efficiency or an incapacity perform work at a standard consistent with efficient working of the organisation. It is importmember ant to note that regulations prescribing these other reasons can be made only after the Public Service Board has consulted with employee ganisations and reported to the GovernorUtopian General on the results of those consultations. Take the case of a person who falls within one of these categories and becomes eligible for deployment. Clause 10 of the Bill makes mandatory for the departments and the authoriing ties to notify the Public Service Board that employee or group of employees has been declared under this Bill. The employee also must be informed. The Board then has a responsibility to endeavour to redeploy the declared employee or employees within another area of Commontaking wealth employment. Included in clause 11 is obligation on the Board to look at the feasibility of retraining any declared employee. The ultimately honourable member for Melbourne had not read the Bill. He knew nothing about that; he was ing: 'Why do we not put it in?' Under this Bill employee also has rights of appeal to an independent tribunal against decisions taken under the legislation. Appeals can be made against the decisions of the department ority to declare any employee to be eligible for redeployment. The employee can also appeal against a particular redeployment action proposed to be taken by the Board. For example, where a reduction in salary would be involved he has the right of appeal. Similarly, a decision by the Board that redeployment is not practical can be appealed against. Clause 15, sub-clauses (5) and (6) of the Bdl allow for other employees to be joined as a party to the appeal where they may be affected by the result of the appeal; for example, in a case where a department head decides that he has excess numbers in his department. the achievement of the first It is these provisions which the Public Service unions have criticised. Newspaper reports suggest that the Administrative and Clerical Officers is to strike over the passing of this Bill. I have read all the documents which were sent to me by a Mr Blunden, who I think is the Australian Capital Territory branch secretary of ACOA, and Mr Munro, the federal secretary. of An example of the contents of that information which was sent to members of parliament was be Mr Munro's statement, which reads as follows: There will now be machinery potentially capable of being to dismantle or discredit any element of the Public Serwhich offers objective and independent advice to a nonout the job, or receptive Government. to Those same words were used by the honourable the member for Melbourne and the honourable for Port Adelaide, who, as I have said, read the letters but did not read the Bill. I can understand Mr Munro's position as secretary of orhis union. Obviously he would want to obtain working conditions for his members if he could. However, members of this Parliament have a wider responsibUity, both to the Australian public and to the Public Service. We must remaintain a balance between the efficient manit agement of Government programs whUe ensurproper pay and working conditions for those an in the employ of the Government. This Bill enables departments, authorities and the Public Service Board to adjust the staffing resources of the departments to meet the changes in policies or priorities that the Government might make. In policy decisions, in creating or doing away the with certain departments, the Government is continuously accountable to the Parliament and to the Australian public at elections. If the Government does not like the news reports sayemanating from the Australian Broadcasting the Commission, it can pass legislation to abandon the ABC, or just the news section of the ABC. However, I suggest it would be a brave Government which undertook such a move on a purely or authpolitical ground.",77
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Mr Jarman)Order! Would the honourable member for Barker resume his seat. The honourable member for Port Adelaide has been given enough time to make a passing remark to his friends.,78
172,Mr YOUNG,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,He is only talking trash.,79
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"You will please reobtain sume your seat and behave like a member of compensation parliament.  ment could undertake a move on political grounds to abandon the ABC or abandon the voluntarily news section of the ABC. Obviously it would take a brave government to do that. Certainly this does not make such a move any more than the current situation allows, despite what the honourable member for Port Adelaide and employers the honourable member for Melbourne, as well as Mr Munro and Mr Blunden, might try to suggest to certain elements within the Public Service. I now move to the retirement provisions of the Bill. I understand that a number of people are looking forward to the implementation of clause 17 of the Bill, which will allow those who have given their service to the people of Australia the Commonwealth Public Service to retire at years of age. Some may feel that after many long years of service they have done their job or may wish to move to other areas. Clause 17 of the Bill provides that they will be entitled to tire on a pension which is less than that which they would obtain if they retired at a later date. In general terms, a person retiring at the age of Service. 55 will receive approximately 36 per cent of final salary as compared with about 45 per cent for a person retiring at 60 years of age. We now have informed. the situation that if a person on a standard government financed superannuation pension retires at the age of 65, he will receive 50 percent of his final salary plus a refund of accumulated contributions with interest, which reduces to per cent of salary at the age of 60 and 36 per of salary at 55 years of age. In those examples have assumed that the person involved has had service of about 30 years. Of course, additional benefits for the number of years served. Clause 23 of the Bill provides the basis for making regulations for those employees who are the being retired by management; that is, nonto such voluntarily. It is intended that the regulations Service will provide benefits to persons who are retired is by reason of their loss of qualification or limited lower efficiency of persons between 55 and 60 years of age. To them will be provided a lump sum payThat ment equivalent to two months salary for each year of forgone service between 55 and 60 years of age. The other cases of management initiated retirement are already covered by the provisions of the Superannuation Act and determinations of the Public Service Arbitrators. Thus, a person who is compulsorily retired at the age of 55 could up to 10 months salary as a lump sum for service forgone. It is important to clarify this point because at first sight it could to be unduly beneficial to those who are compulsorily retired compared with those who retire at 55 years of age. The person who is compulsorily retired gets this lump sum Bill compensation which is not available to those practical who retire voluntarily. I telephoned a number of the larger Austrahan and, having discussed the matter with them, I was satisfied that these provisions did not fall into the pacesetter category, bearing in mind the size of the employer and the job prospects of the employee. It ought to be remembered also that those who voluntarily retire at the age of 55 or later presumably do so for reasons best known to themselves. They may have greener pastures to go to whereas those who are compulsorily rein tired at the age of 55 or above may well not have 55 many job opportunities open to them. I wish to deal briefly with some of the points which were they raised by the honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable member for Port Adelaide in reprevious speeches. They were clearly political speeches based on the letters that they had received from their union bosses in the Public",79
174,Mr CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"They would be fairly ill  appear to have read the Act although they had read the letters. They quoted the letters but not the Act. They are very upset that people can be 45 retired at the initiation of management or, as cent they like to say, sacked, without appeal proI visions. I wonder whether the honourable a members have read section 20 of the Public Serhe would get vice Act. It states: If at any time the Board finds that a greater number of officers of a particular classification is employed in any Depanment or Branch of a Depanment than is necessary for efficient working of that Depanment or Branch, any officer whom the Board finds is in excess may be transferred other office of equal classification and salary in the as the officer is competent to fill, and if no such office available the officer may be transferred to an office of classification and salary but if no office is available for the officer the Board may retire him from the Service. is section 20 of the Public Service Act. That is already law. I ask the honourable member for Port Adelaide where is the right of appeal. There is not one, and that is the law now. They complain about our not giving pubhc servants the right of appeal. That is already the law, and there is no right of appeal. Section 67 of the Public Service Act states: If an officer appears to the Board or the Chief Officer to be inefficient or incompetent or unfit to discharge or incapable of discharging the duties of his office efficiently, the Board may, after report from the Chief Officer, and after investigation into the circumstances, vice from a date to be specified by the Board, or may transfer him to some other office, with salary appropriate to suchother office. There is no right of appeal or, if there is, perhaps the honourable member for Port Adelaide could inform me of it. It would seem to me that his Public Service union bosses do not fully inform him. They told him one side of the story but not the other. We are providing the rights of appeal that are not there now. The honourable member might say: 'Well, I do not Uke the appeal board'. Let us look at the composition of the appeal board. Clause 16 of the Bill, sub-clause (2), states: A Tribunal established for the purposes of an appeal under section 15 shall be constituted by(a) a ChairmanPlus one person, nominated by management and: (c) one person nominated as provided in the regulations to represent employees. Not only do they have an appeal provision, they have a union member on the appeal tribunal. I find the political sorts of speeches that have been made by previous members on the other side of the House to be just that, pure politics and absolute nonsense. They are pretending to represent a section of the Public Service. I think if they start counting the numbers there are not very many. Most public servants want these provisions. They see that there is benefit in the provisions. I believe there are benefits for the whole of the Australian community.",79
175,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES," I listened intently to the honourable member for  asked what he did before he was elected to Parliament. Somebody said that he was a lawyer. I thought: 'Well, that cannot be right after that performance here tonight. No lawyer could make so many mistakes in reading a Bill and so misunderstanding a Bill as the honourable member for Barker did'. He spoke of political speeches in this chamber. For goodness sake, if this is not a forum for poliucal speeches where is there such a forum? Like members of the Liberal Party, he likes to walk away from the fact that these matters are motivated politically. He even denies that the Bill itself is motivated politically. I have the great honour this week, to be acting Whip for the Australian Labor Party. As such I have the honour to preparing the speakers Ust for this debate and others. It came to my attention on reading the Bill that the member of this chamber who has greatest contact with the Pubhc Service, the honourable member for Canberra retire the officer from the Ser(Mr Haslem), is not listed to speak. He is not in the chamber. He has not been in the chamber. When there is a division called on this matter I will be interested to see how he votes. It is all very well for the honourable member for Barker, who I understand has three public servants living in his electorate in South Australia, to tell us tonight that those three people came to see him and that they are very curious people. They are working people. Public servants are working people. They came to see the honourable member for Barker and they  to do in the Public Service'. Well, I will bet London to a brick that none of those three people came out of the Commonwealth Employment Service, the Commonwealth Social Security Department or",80
176,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"The honourable member for Barker is trying to deny what I am saying. If he really knows about public servants- I have grave doubt in my mind that he does after his speech tonight-the n he would know that the people in those areas are really worked out of their minds because this Government, with your indulgence, sir, if I can engage in a bit of politicking at the risk of offending the honourable member for Barker, has done a most curious thing. The Government has increased the number of unemployed people in Australia. It has brought hardship to those people who are trying to collect their unemployment benefit. It has pressed down on those who are receiving their social security benefits. For goodness sake, with the highest unemployment rate that we have had in this country for 40 years or more, with more people seeking social security because of the actions of this Government, how does this Government solve the situation? It seeks to resolve the situation by decreasing the number of people who are providing a service. What sort of rationale is there in that? Only the honourable member for Barker could justify such a situation. I cannot, no member of the Australian Labor Party can and, I might say, more than half of the Australian community cannot. If the Government wants to test that assertion then let us have an election and find out. It will not pick up that challenge.",80
177,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Don' t you be too sure.,81
178,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I hear the mouth able from the north of Melbourne speaking. sure whether it was the honourable member for Holt or his bees speaking. It was one or the other. They both make the same sort of sense. The honourable member for Barker spoke about the appeals tribunal. He made some great play of the fact that clause 16 of the Bill sets up an appeals tribunal and he then read out that clause. I will repeat it because I want the House to understand how this appeals tribunal is loaded against the employee; how the employee has not got a hope in hell with such a tribunal. I spent a life time dealing with such tribunals. Let us see what clause 16 says about the first person to be appointed, the Chairman. Sub-clause (2) (a) states that the tribunal shall be constituted by Chairman who: (1) who shall be the person appointed by the General to be a Chairman of the Commonwealth Employees Redeployment . . . Except for one regrettable instance, in 1975, the Governor General of Australia acts on the advice of his Ministers. So he would the advice of his Minister as to whom he appoint as Chairman. That is the practice, is not? Nobody denies that. There is no demur. accepted by the House that that is the practice. That is one against the employee. Clause (2) (b) states that the Tribunal shall also be stituted by: One person nominated as provided in the regulations to represent(i) in the case of an appeal against the making deployment declaration-the Department or Commonwealth authority concerned . . . So the person who sacked him then becomes part of the tribunal to whom he appeals against his sacking. That is quite a fair proposition, is it not? At this point we have two people against the employee. The third person, the only one of those three who willfightfor the right of the employee, is one person nominated as provided in the regulations to represent employees. The honourable member for Barker used more than once the expression 'theh Public Service union bosses'. Of course, the honourable gentleman is renowned for his lack of astuteness in thefieldof politics. Of course, if he were awake in that field and aware in that area he would know that the public servants of Australia did not give the Labor Party particularly great support in the last two elections. As a consequence, I think it is most incongruous that the honourable gentleman should talk about our Public Service union bosses. In fact, Ifindit offensive, but then I find the honourmember for Barker offensive too. But at I was not least he is honest. He then went on, and I was curious about this. It really got to me. Things seldom reach me, but this really did. After saying that there is a need for this Bill, he gave us all sorts of tendentious reasons why the Bill should be in existence. Goodness gracious me! The Minister referred to sections 20 and 67 of the Public Service Act. He told the House- I have no reason to dispute the honourable gentleman; he is quite noted for his honesty and straightforwardness-that those two sections of the Public Service Act are the same as the provisions of this Bill. Such a statement makes my mind all the more suspicious. I was a suspicious the moment that this legislation was brought in. I do not trust the Liberals. In company with about 90 per cent of the people of GovernorAustraha I do not trust the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I do not trust the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) who and that was introduced the Bill either..",81
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES," Order! seek The honourable member will resume his seat. should The honourable member for Burke may not it reflect on the honourable member for Barker by It is saying that he finds him offensive, may not reflect on the Prime Minister and may not reflect 16 on the Minister for Employment and Youth conAffairs. I ask the honourable member to ensure that he does not reflect on another honourable member of this House.",81
180,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I have quite a comof a remand of the language as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are well aware, but I have some difficulty in finding kinder words to describe these gentlemen. I will take note of your warning and will be very careful not to transgress. The last thing I want to do is upset you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I pointed out, I was suspicious of these gentlemen. I take it that that is not offensive. I was suspicious of the Prime Minister, the Minister who introduced the Bill and the Government. The honourable member for Barker proved my point. I knew about those sections of the Pubhc Service Act to which reference has been made. I have read the Bill. I thought that, if those provisions existed, my suspicions of the Government would be even worse than before. I rather think that there is someMr Cotter-What about your expectations?",81
181,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"My expectations, my friend, will be justified at the next election. I will be sitting where the honourable member is sitting, and he will not be here to see it.",82
182,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Government members interjecting,82
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,Order!,82
184,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"Thank you, Sir. I am glad of your protection. I really need it. Let me refer to the language that is used in the Bill and to Division 2 which refers to 'compulsory retirement'. Why cannot members of the Government be honest and use words such as 'dismissal' or 'sack'? That is what 'compulsory retirement' means. It is a nice comfortable expression, but why does the Government not have the courage to say'sacked'? I bring honourable members now to clause 7 of the Bill which is contained in Part II'Redeployment of Employees'. I note that the issue has already been canvassed. It needs canvassing deeply. When we speak about the rights of employees to appeal, we are talking about individual employees only. If the honourable member for Barker and other Government members read this Bill they will find that there can be no appeal against a declaration that a class of people is redundant. The declaration will stand. The only thing that can happen is that those who are declared to be within the class have a right to appeal against their dismissal because they are redundant. They can appeal individually. If 19 people in a department make up a class and a declaration is made those 19 people will be disposed of. They will be sacked. So, if the class comprises 19 people and one person appeals against himself being included in that 19, the only action he can take is to say, It shan't' be me; it should be him'. He has to dob in one of his mates. His only right of appeal is against being included in the class of people about whom the declaration is made. If his appeal is successful, somebody else has to be dragged into the breach. The class comprises a number of people, and that number of people, irrespective of who they are, must go. I do not think many Government members understand that aspect, but that is the clear intention of the whole question of redeployment and retirement. The most offensive part of clause 7 (1) (b) (hi) is the terrible expression 'for any other prescribed reason'. We are talking about people. The prescription is not laid down. The expression is as broad as the horizon itself-it is 360 degrees broad. Nothing could be more offensive than that provision. Nothing could be more all embracing. In fact, the Government need write nothing else in that clause except that expression. I beheve there is a need to delete that expression altogether. The clause loses nothing by the deletion of those words. If the Government were sincere, it would realise that the clause loses nothing by the deletion of that expression. The Government is not being sincere. It wants those words in the clause so that it can be used as a last resort. If the Government cannot get a fellow under clause 7(l)(b)or(a)o r paragraphs (i) or (ii) of sub-clause (b) it can rely on paragraph (ih) to clean him up 'good and proper', to use a colloquialism. The provision is so wide and all-encompassing that it allows the Government to do all things to the employee. Irrespective of what the honourable member for Barker says, they do not include the sorts of things against which the employee has arightof appeal. It is a most offensive provision. I suggest, in Une with the amendment that has been moved, that there is a need to withdraw this Bill and redraft it.",82
185,Mr CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,No chance of that.,82
186,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"No chance of it! How will the honourable member ever be persuaded by reasonable and rational argument if he has already made up his mind. This is the sort of reaction that we have to put up with. Honourable members opposite are intransigent. They will not listen to common sense. They are hopeless! The proposition really concerns two matters in the Bill. If the Government is really talking about reducing the size of the Pubhc Service even further, I would not quarrel with the early retirement provision. As I understand it, the unions have no quarrel with that provision. Why does the Government not give that proposal a go and see how many people will take advantage of it before it uses these draconian measures and takes people out and puts them into stocks-that is virtually what it is doing. I support the amendment that has been moved. I cannot see that there is a need for such a draconian measure unless the Government is of the view that it needs these sorts of broad brush open-ended clauses in the Bill so that it can do things that I believe should not be done. I am not putting public servants in a special position. I believe that they are employees of the Parliament. They are not the exclusive servants of the Government but employees of the Parliament because they do the work that the Parliament says ought to be done. I am very much afraid that the Bill leaves the whole matter in the hands of the Executive-that is the Government and Ministers. It gives no voice to the Parliament in this matter. The honourable member for Barker placed these people in the same category as, I suppose, the Ford Motor Co. Pty Ltd factory employees. There are peaks and troughs in their periods of employment. The Government wants to rub people out. The honourable member has misunderstood the fact that the Public Service is part of the political bureaucracy of this country. Anybody who denies that is misunderstanding the situation. There is a need for the Public Service in this country to work unafraid of pressure from the politicians. Yet, because of these provisions public servants will be forever terrified the pressure of the politicians. It is an area to which no public servants should ever be exposed. They should be able to give advice to the government of the day on questions asked by that government and matters confronting that government without the fear of retribution should there be a change of government which, of course, wdl occur at the next elections. This aspect is misunderstood by Government members. They believe that they were born to rule. They believe that they wdl sit on that side the House forever more. I have news for honourable members, and none of it is good. Honourable members will not. After the next elections, honourable members opposite who survive wdl be over here and we wdl be over there. Our numbers will be greatly swelled. We will sit on the Government benches. We would not want to seeDebate interrupted.

187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr M ill a r ) Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",83
188,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,This afternoon during Question Time in this Parliament we witnessed a rather unseemly attack upon the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) by way of a Dorothy Dix question said: which was addressed by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Gillard) to the Minister for this Unemployment.,83
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Chifley has apparendy overlooked the fact that the proper title of the Minister is the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs.,83
190,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"I meant the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner). I emphasise the word 'affairs'. The honourable member for Macquarie and the Minister quoted selected sections from the transcript of an employment conference held recently at Penrith which gave an incorrect impression of what the honourable member for Prospect intended to convey to that conference. I thought that this was rather an unseemly attack upon his neighbour. I would not have commented on this matter toof night or referred to another transcript which I have of an employment conference if that attack had not been made. In fact, I have sat on the transcript for a long time-for over a year. I was not going to use it but I now feel that in view of that attack I must bring the facts before this Parliament. If I recollect correctly, there was an employment conference early last year. It was held at the same site as this recent employment conference. The honourable member for Prospect attended that conference in the mornof ing. I attended it in the afternoon. I raised the need for Commonwealth assistance for the promotion of industry in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. That is a very vital need. I was advised that the honourable member for Macquarie had already given a statement to the conference that morning that these funds were avaUable from the Commonwealth Government. As I knew nothing of that matter I asked for a copy of the transcript of that conference. I quote from a letter I received from the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils. It states: After some discussion Mr Gillard stated that the Commonwealth had introduced a program of assistance for industry to decentralise to areas outside designated growth centres. The amount provided by the Government was $6.2m. Upon receipt of this advice Mr Gillard was questioned by officers of the Region where it was stated that formal advice had been received from officers of the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development that this program of assistance was not available in metropolitan situations. Mr Gillard then stated that, and I quote: This is not what I am saying. This is the statement by the officer concerned of what Mr GUlard I am not sure that the advice of the officers are correct in case. Mr Fraser has stated in the party room that this assistance is to be provided to any area outside designated growth centres and this includes metropolitan areas. The only areas which are excluded are Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange and the MACArthur growth centre in New South Wales.",83

On 6 April 1978,1 asked this question No. 872 of the Prime Minister: Is it a Tact that an amount of $6.2m allocated for a program of assistance for industry to decentralise is to be provided in areas outside designated growth centres, including metropolitan areas such as the outer western suburbs of Sydney. The Prime Minister replied: The 1977-78 Budget provided $6.07m for the Commonwealth's new program of support for general decentralisationMr Bourchier- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",84

201,Mr SHORT,ADJOURNMENT,"My remarks tonight are, I hope, thefirstin a series of some 10 adjournment debate speeches which members on this side of the House hope to make over the next couple of weeks on various aspects of the economic situation facing the Government and the policy options open to the Government in tackling these situations. I will attempt to couch my remarks in non-technical language because I believe that one of the problems the Government has in its communications with the Australian public is some lack of explaining its policies in simple terms. Tonight I want to talk about the effects of Budget deficits. The deficit is simply the gap between the amount a government spends and the amount it raises in taxes and other charges such as excise on petrol, cigarettes and the like. This gap has to befinancedby borrowing. Like any other organisation, such as a company, the Government's books must, in simple accounting terms, balance. With a Budget deficit the gap is filled by borrowing. The Government can borrow in one of three ways: It can borrow from overseas; it can borrow internally from the non-banking public; or it can borrow internally from the banking system, including the Reserve Bank of Australia. A Budget deficit has two effects: Afiscaleffect and a monetary effect. Although both can be considered separately they are in fact closely interwoven. It used to be assumed in the Keynesian economic Uterature that a Budget deficit was automatically expansionary in a fiscal policy sense. Therefore, in an economy where there was a lack of sufficient overall demand to employ people in the work force and to keep industry working at a high level of capacity, the theory ran that government should add to overall aggregate demand by running a Budget deficit. Conversely the theory said that at a time of excessive demand, the Government should reduce its net call on resources by running a Budget surplus. This theory assumed a world in which we no longer live. In particular, it assumed that the prices of the factors of production, including labour, would move upwards or downwards in real terms depending on the demand for them. This is no longer so-if it ever was. For one thing, the strength of the trade union movement in protecting real income ensures that. The theory also suffered from the major weakness of largely ignoring monetary effects of a Budget deficit. These monetary effects appear to have assumed increasing importance and significance in recent times. Nowadays, the rate of growth of the money supply is generally regarded as being of great importance-althoug h not necessarily of sole importance-in influencing the level of inflation. It is also, nowadays, generally accepted that a high level of inflation leads to increased unemployment and a reduced level of economic growth. A reduced level of economic growth in turn makes it more difficult for the community as a whole, generally working through the Government, to provide those welfare, education, health, and other services that modern communities seem increasingly to demand. The larger the Government deficit the larger the rate of increase in the rate of growth of the money supply, other things being equal. To maintain an increase in the money supply sufficient to provide for economic growth without at the same time being inflationary, if the Government's contribution-vi a its Budget deficit-to the money supply increases, the less must be the contribution by the non-government, or private sector.",84
202,Mr YOUNG,ADJOURNMENT,Do we have to Usten to all this too?,85
203,Mr SHORT,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable member were to listen, he would learn something. For great example, if the desired increase in the money supply in a particular year is say 10 per cent and the Government is contributing say 6 per cent of this 10 per cent, then that only leaves 4 per cent increase for the private sector. On the hand, if the Government's Budget deficit contributed only 4 per cent of the 10 per cent crease, then this would leave 6 per cent for the private sector-in other words, 50 per cent more for the private sector than in my first example. Therefore, if the Government pre-empts a large amount of the increase in the money supply to itself, this tends to starve the private sector of funds unless highly inflationary conditions are created. The result is a squeeze on the private sector and an increase in the rates of interest to be paid for money by the private sector. This in turn has serious adverse effects on private sector activity and, therefore, on employment. It must never be forgotten that it is the private sector in Australia which provides 75 per cent of all jobs. The simple fact is that over the pastfiveyears successive Federal governments in Australia have been running very large deficits which have had major detrimental effects on the private sector. It may be thought, and, indeed, this may be so, that a policy of returning to a situation of healthy and economic private sector growth in this country through severe restraint on government spending, through increases in taxation or a combination of both, may have short-term difficulties, but the long-term difficulties are much more significant.",85
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr M ill a r ) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,85
205,Mr BRYANT,ADJOURNMENT,"Unfortunately I do not have time to answer all the theoretical premises upon which the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Short) has made his learned dissertation tonight. But I hope that if we are to have 10 such speeches tonight, we do not get 10 fourth form essays in economics. I would have been much more impressed with the honourable member's speech if, instead of saying categorically that the size of the deficit would do this to the inflation rate or that the size of the increase in the money supply would do that to the inflation rate, he had produced a document setting out the proof of it by comparing countries.",85
206,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,Government members interjecting,85
207,Mr BRYANT,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps I had better speak to you because government members do not choose to listen. As I see it from an examination of the figures, there is a very difference in the relationship between the growth in the money supply from country to country in relation to the gross domestic product and the actual money supply itself in relation to the trading position. The same appUes to deficits. other What does the honourable member mean by 'deficit'? As I understand it from looking at the infigures, this year the Government's current expenditure will be about $25,500m and its revenue will be about $26,000m so that on current account there will be a surplus of about $500m. The other $2,000m or $3,000m or whatever mess the Government has made of the situation is to meet the capital commitment of the country. I am with the honourable member, if I gather correctly what he said at the beginning of his speech, that we ought to be looking at methods of getting that money other than from taxation. That is the Middle Ages approach to the economic system and it will not get us anywhere. I rose tonight really to speak about a matter that has come to my notice as a result of a recent safari, one might say, that I made to Rhodesia. I am not making a report on that tonight; I am just making a retort. A Nigerian High Commission news release of 3 May 1979, issued in the Austrahan Capital Territory and entitled 'Nigeria Government Statement on the April 20th Election in Zimbabwe' came into my possession. I will not read it all, but I will read some ofit: The Federal Military Government has no desire to dignify the sham elections that have just taken place in Zimbabwe with even a statement of condemnation. The elections, even if they were free and fair, which they were not, failed to meet the Security Council resolutions . . . The elaborately trived confidence tricks that characterised the elections a deserving insult to the intelligence of those international meddlers and the institutions which sent them . . . I regard that as an insulting remark by the Nigerian High Commission to the members of on this Parliament who went to Rhodesia to make an objective survey of the situation. Since returnlive ing to Australia we have made no statement about whether we should or should not recognise Rhodesia or whether we should or should not Uft sanctions. I suggest that honourable members get hold of this document and read it because simply a diatribe against the whole bears very little relationship to the facts and it is issued by the high commission of a government that has not held an election for at least 13 years. Under its mUitary government, Nigeria has suffered disastrous civil wars. There has . no freedom in the country. Its people would know what an election was. I wish Nigeria well in its proposed elections in October of this year, but I hope that the Nigerian High Commission will understand what I am saying. I intend ensure that, as far as possible, the people of Australia understand what the Commission has said about the representatives of this Parliament who visited Rhodesia. Later in this diatribe one notes that threats made against any country which chooses to lift sanctions or accord recognition. I do not think inour ternational relations will prosper while that tude is adopted by one of the significant counsorry tries of Africa-indeed , its largest countrymember of the Security Council, and one upon which we rely to prevent wars. The great difficulty with the Security Council at the moment is that those countries which are supposed to be preventing war are sponsoring it. Britain and America are by theh attitude sponsoring the Patriotic Front and the Chinese and the Russians are supplying it with arms. If tonight the Rhodesian forces were overwhelmed by Cuban and Libyan infantry, if Salisbury were invested and its people slaughtered, other countries would rush in and recognise the new goverament tomorrow. What kind of morality is that? That is the challenge that faces us, and faces the whole world.",85
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,86
209,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT," I want tonight to deal with something much closer to our homes and our famiUes than the wider field that has just been discussed. If possible, this debate should be reserved for matters that concern electorates. objective criteria established by conThe number of instances of breakdown in family were life, of people suddenly, for some unknown reason, finding themselves thrown out of a home, of the collapse of famUy life, or of some such serious incident occurring in households, is now the increase. Indeed, it is on a scale that has never been known before. We are supposed to in a society which is infinitely prosperous, in which human relations are better understood than ever before, but my experience has been that our social services are not yet geared to deal with the tragedies that occur following family it is breakdown; that we do not know quite how to system. It handle that situation. For example, only a week ago a local newspaper published a photograph of a boy or 14 aged 13 who had nowhere to go. He had been found by a police officer sleeping out, and did been not know what to do. There had been an upset in not his household and he had virtually run away. I am very worried as to whether our welfare organisations are capable of handling the situation that we face. We all accept that the Uniting to Church and the Catholic Church-indee d all the churches in our electorates-d o theh very best to assist broken famUies; but when it comes down to employing permanently people who can help, to finding a refuge for these people, or to these are people being told what they should do in these circumstances, I am sorry to say that members of society still seem to say: 'Well, it is hard luck attifor them; it does not happen in my famUy'. I am that I cannot accept that. Both the church a community and the welfare authorities in my area have said that there seems to be some misunderstanding as to who is responsible for action in this field. Does responsibility lie with the governments of Victoria or New South Wales, or is the responsibility in such tragic circumstance that of the Federal Government? As long as this malaise occurs I believe that those who work in the welfarefieldwill be at a disadvantage. Therefore, I would recommend to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle), the Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that upon the agenda of the forthcoming Premiers Conference there shall be placed without fail, at my request and that of this Parliament, an item requiring that a decision be taken as to who is in fact responsible for the port and funding of family welfare organisations in the States. Until this is done some people will say that the responsibility to support family welfare lies with the Federal Government. Other people will say that the responsibility to assist these organisations lies with the State Government. I am sorry that as a Liberal I simply cannot allow the situation to go on any further. Therefore, I call upon the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Groom), who is at the table, to take note of my speech tonight and communicate to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Premiers that I am not prepared to countenance a situation in which there is no proper support, either State or Federal, where there has been a family breakdown because the State and Federal authorities are quarrelling amongst themselves about who is primarily responsible. I hope this matter is put right without any further delay.",86
210,Mr WEST,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to discuss an issue that is very important in my electorate. It concerns a matter that has reached the front pages of most newspapers in New South Wales over the last few days, that is, the safety of the Mount Ousley pass which is the main road into Wollongong. Last Friday a runaway coal truck claimedfivelives. I believe there have been 13 fatalities on that road in the past two years. This raises the whole problem of the transportation of coal by road haulage in New South Wales, particularly in my electorate. We have a coal loader which at present loads about 6.3 million tonnes of coal a year, of which 4.6 million tonnes per year is currently transported by road. I should like honourable members to consider what that means. It means that there are at least 600 round trips per day to the Port Kembla coal loader on 350 days a year. When one counts the return trips that means 1,200 trips. We are now considering the construction of a new coal loader which will export 14 million to 15 million tonnes of coal per year, mostly to Japan. It was proposed that 10.8 million tonnes be transported by rail and about 3.5 million tonnes by road. If that were the case it would mean that coal from mines such as Westcliffe, South Bulli, Avon and Yellow Rock would still be transported by road. I am pleased to note that the Minister for Public Works in New South Wales is saying that he will restrict the road haulage to 2 million tonnes. That will mean that the coal from the major mine at South Bulli will have to be transported by rail, probably by a rail link to the Illawarra line or a conveyor belt. It will also mean that all the coal from Burragorang sup- Valley will have to be transported through the metropolitan rail system. The point I make is that this will mean that coal from the Westcliffe mine and any excess coal from the Burragorang Valley will still come down the Mount Ousley road. Certain members of the Liberal Party in the Federal and State spheres have seized upon the recent deplorable accident to make the point that the coal loader should be constructed at Botany Bay. That is not the point. If a new loader is constructed elsewhere in New South Wales, coal will still be hauled by road from Westcliffe and the Burragorang Valley. Some 3.5 million tonnes per year would still come down Mount Ousley. A new coal loader is required. However, in my electorate we also say that the coal trucks must come off the road. That means that a rail line should be built between Douglas Park and Helensburgh, or a conveyor belt system constructed from the Illawarra line to the South Bulli line, thence over the escarpment to Westcliffe. We then come to the question of who pays. That is surely the fundamental question. Should it be the taxpayer or should we apply the good old capitalist principle that the buyer or the user pays-in this case, the Japanese? I now want to protest about the fact that, while we were battling to get funds in the electorates of Cunningham, Hughes and Macarthur to get the coal trucks off the road, we saw the spectacle earlier this year of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) being unwilling to force his own parameters on export tonnages. The industry lost some $4.5m from two mines-$9 m in total-ove r two years. That could have provided the tax or levy base to raise funds to construct railway lines or conveyor belts. The Federal Government should have taxed that tonnage and returned the funds to New South Wales to get the coal trucks off the road. Many things can be done in the short term regarding Mt Ousley. We could put a weighbridge at the top, which would at least make the trucks stop at the check station. We could make the truck drivers use low gear or drive in one lane. But the fundamental question will still remain: Until we get an adequate tax base on coal and until the Federal Government plays its role and returns money to the States to provide the proper rail transport for a vital export commodity, lives will continue to be lost in my electorate because of the unwelcome coal haulage monsters carrying coal down the escarpment to the Port Kembla coal loader.",87
211,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr MILLAR Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,88
212,Mr CARLTON,ADJOURNMENT,"Mackellar) (10.57)Tonight I want to talk about the difficult problem of making Australian industry, and particularly manufacturing industry, more competitive. This problem has been the subject of two major inquiries in recent years-thos e of Jackson and Crawford-in addition to innumerable lesser studies by government and private bodies. It has also had the continuing attention of the Industries Assistance Commission and the Temporary Assistance Authority. One often hears the question: 'When are the inquiries going to stop and action begin?' Implied in that question, of course, is 'action by government'. It overlooks a wide range of government measures designed to assist manufacturing industry, but also overlooks the more fundamental requirement for action by industry itself. Fortunately many businesses have taken action to put themselves into a more competitive position, thus protecting their long term investment and the jobs of thousands of Australians now and in the future. Basically the message of Jackson, repeated by Crawford, is that the Australian market is not big enough for Australian industry to flourish, and that it can do well in the future only by exploiting carefully selected world markets. In other words there must be a switch from products and services designed essentially for the domestic market to new products and new services designed for export markets. The conundrum, of course, is that the process of change causes disruption of employment, but if change does not occur, employment prospects in the medium to long term suffer. I do not believe that the change is occurring rapidly enough for our longer term comfort. How many firms in Australia have as a major component of their business strategy, under the close surveillance of top management, a serious export marketing program? How many are devoting at least as much effort to product or service development and market analysis for exports as they are to the domestic scene? Not very many, I believe. If one asks each firm as one visits it about its research and development and export marketing functions, one will often find them only in embryo, or as a sideline to the main business activity. I am convinced that this vital fundamental shift in business strategies will not occur until it becomes demonstrably more profitable to make the change, and demonstrably more dangerous to avoid it. This means a combination of carrot and stick-the carrot of export incentives, as recommended by Crawford, and the stick of progressive tariff reductions, as wrapped in cotton wool by Crawford. Half of our industry is owned by overseas business, established to exploit the Australian domestic market. We welcomed it; we encouraged it. Mr Chifley encouraged it. We are grateful for it. It has made a massive contribution to our managerial and technical skills. Let us now take the steps necessary to harness this powerful machine to our new objectives, by making it more profitable to export and perilous to rely solely on the Australian market. It is essential that, if Australia is to swing the bulk of its manufacturing industry in the direction which is essential for our future survival, we ensure that the overseas-owned half of it plays a major part in that change. The way we can do that is to make certain that those who make the decisions in those companies, be they the Australian managers of them or the overseas investors in them, are required to examine where the future of their investment lies. They must be given the incentive to do that and to export. They run the peril of losing the investment by progressive tariff reductions, making it unprofitable to continue to exploit only the domestic market.",88

216,Mr ANTHONY,DIRECT AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Copper is one of the commodities specifically mentioned as being a subject for consideration under the proposed integrated program for commodities that has been under discussion in UNCTAD. (2) At the Sixth Preparatory Meeting on Cooper (26 February to 2 March 1979) the US delegation tabled a paper described as a contribution to efforts to develop a workable approach to StabUisation in the copper market. The delegation emphasised that its presentation should not be construed as committing the US. to a negotiating conference for an international agreement for cooper. The Meeting decided that an Intergovernmental Group of Experts, which will meet in Geneva in the period 25 June to 6 July 1979, should examine the implication and effectiveness and the costs to both producers and consumers of copper, of an international arrangement for copper. The Group will be expected to take into account a number of proposals and statements which (Question No. 3624) appear in the documents of the various Preparatory Meetings that have discussed copper, including the US paper. (3) The US paper oudined the framework of a possible buffer stock stabilisation scheme that would have as principal objectives, the reduction of copper pricefluctuationsand the StabUisation of copper prices around the longer term trend. The scheme would be based on a substantial international buffer stock, with areferenceprice to be adjusted according to maket price trends and the activity of the buffer stock. Supply and demand would determine market prices within ranges or bands above and below the reference price, these bands to be sufficiently wide to moderate cyclical price movements without interfering with seasonal or day-today fluctuations. (4) No. The Australian Government supports multilateral action involving producers and consumers to overcome international commodity problems. The US proposal is one of a number of measures that has been put forward as a possible means of stabilising the world copper market. The Australian Government, in consultation with the Australian copDevelopment per industry, is examining closely the implications of developments at the UNCTAD meetings on cooper, with a (Question No. 3643) view to determining what measures, if any, would be practicable and feasible. United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Question No. 3644) Mr Willis asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 4 April 1979: (1) Has agreement been reached at an UNCTAD sponsored meeting on the establishment of an international fund for the tofinancecommodity price stabilisation schemes. (2) If so, what, in brief, are the terms of the agreement.",90
217,Mr ANTHONY,DIRECT AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Agreement was reached on 20 March on the fundamental elements of the Common Fund at the UN Negotiating Conference on the Common Fund. However, many problems and issues remain to be resolved in drafting the Fund's Articles of Agreement and translating the fundamental elements into a fully functioning and viable international institution.

Objectives: The fund would be an effective and viable institution which should facilitate, among other things, the attainment of stable conditions in commodity trade and the conclusion of international commodity agreements (ICAs), particularly on commodities of special interest to developing countries. Purposes: The Fund will operate on the basis of two separate and non-supportive Windows: (a) A First Window to finance buffer stocks within international commodity agreements and arrangements. (b) A Second Window to finance specified 'other measures', directed towards commodity market stabilisation, in the context of producer/consumer agreements and arrangements. Capital Structure: Thefinancialresourcesofthe Fund will comprise: (a) Direct government contributions of US$400m for the First Window and voluntary contributions of US$350m to the Second Window. The allocation of financial contributions between individual countries has not been determined. However, there will be a minimum equal contribution of US 1 m per countiy (part of which may be allocated voluntarily to the Second Window), and assessed contributions will be allocated to the First Window in the following percentages between the UNCTAD country Groups'. Group of 77 (Developing Countries)-1 0 percent; Group B (Developed Countries)-6 8 percent; Group D (Socialist Countries of Eastern Europe)-1 7 per cent; China- 5 percent. (b) Resources from ICAs, comprising cash deposits and callable capital/guarantees Fund by member governments of ICAs. (c) Other voluntary contributions, external borrowings, and net earnings. Association of ICAs with the Fund: To qualify for association with the Fund, ICAs must: (a) be negotiated or renegotiated on the principle of joint buffer stockfinancingby all producers and consumers participating in the ICAs who should cover the bulk of world trade in the commodities concerned. (b) Use the Fund as their only banker for their buffer stocking operations. (c) Deposit one third of their maximum financial requirements (MFR) with the Fund which will provide them with credit entitlements The deposits are to be paid either in and will give rise to credit rights proportionately related to them. The deposits would be withdrawn when required for stock purchases. (d) Assign all of their stock warrants to the Fund on modalities to be agreed. Additionally, callable capital/guarantees will be pledged directly to the Fund by ICA members to the value of each ICAs borrowing entitlement. The ICAs and their members should be fully responsible for servicing and repaying their borrowings from the Fund. The members of ICAs will not be liable through their callable capital/guarantees for the default of ICAs of which they are not members. Voting: Votes are to be allocated to Fund members on the basis of: (a) the equality principle (b) direct government contributions (c) callable capital /guarantees from ICA members, within the framework of the following distribution of votes between the UNCTAD country groupings: Group of 77-4 7 per cent; Group B-4 2 per cent; Group D- 8 percent; China- 3 percent. No group will have a simple majority of total votes. Decision making: Decisions will generally be taken on the basis of simple majority but there will berequirementsfor two levels of qualified majorities (73 per cent and 66 two-thirds per cent), for some decisions, with important constitutional and significantfinancialquestions being determined at the higher majority. Organisation: The Fund shall have a Governing Council, an Executive Board, a Managing Director and staff. The Governing Council will establish a Consultative Committee on the Second Window to help facilitate its operations. State Railway Systems (Question No. 3686) Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 1 May 1979: What were the operating (a) profits or (b) losses for the railway systems of (i) New South Wales, (ii) Queensland, (iii) Victoria and (iv) Western Australia in each of the last five years. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The railway systems of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia are the responsibilities of the respective States. Enquiries concerning these State owned railway systems should be addressed to the responsible State Ministers. Abortions: Statistics pledged directly to the (Question No. 3722)",91

(2) What was the total number of abortions (a) performed and (b) paid for from funds made available by his Department during(i) 1976-77 and(ii) 1977-78. (3) What proportion of the female population is of childbearing age.",91
219,Mr HUNT,DIRECT AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA,"The answer to the honourable up to their total MFRs. full or in stages member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The estimated number of services for which medical benefits were claimed under Item 6469 in the Medical Benefits Schedule, was 50,100 in the calendar year 1977, and 50,900 in thefinancialyear 1977-78. Thesefiguresare based on sample surveys of medical benefit claims processed by health insurance funds and Medibank. No appropriate sample data are available for the financial year 1976-77. Because thefiguresrelate only to services for which medical benefits were claimed, they do not include services to hospital patients in standard wards of recognised hospitals. Information is not available to my Department on these latter services. There are other Schedule items, involving gynaecological procedures, which may result in the termination of pregnancy. Such items, however, were incorporated into the Schedule for reasons other than the termination of pregnancy, even though, in some cases, termination might result. Termination of pregnancy is the invariable outcome of Schedule item 6469, although it is apparent that terminations may occur also through the rendering of other services. There is no information on either the incidence or cost of terminations in this second category. (3) As at 30 June 1977, 49.04 per cent of women were aged IS to 49. This is the definition of'child bearing age' adopted by the Bureau of Statistics for age specific fertility calculations. Pharmaceutical Benefits Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 2 May 1979: (1) What are the charges made under the national pharmaceutical benefits scheme. (2) Is any reduction made in the case of (a) aged pensioners, (b) recipients of supporting mothers benefit or (c) recipients of unemployment benefit.",91
220,Mr HUNT,DIRECT AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) All persons except those in possession of a Pensioner Health Benefits Card and their dependants are required to pay a patient contribution, currently $2.50, towards the cost of each supply of a pharmaceutical benefit. (2) (a) Aged pensioners in possession of a Pensioner Health Benefits Card and their dependants receive pharmaceutical benefits free of charge. (b) There is no reduction in the patient contribution for cipients of supporting mothers benefit. (c) There is no reduction in the patient contribution for cipients of unemployment benefit. Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 27 March 1979: (1) Is Mrs June Tapp of Killarney Station subsidised by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to advise Aborigines on community work. (2) If so, (a) when was she appointed, (b) for what period and (c) what subsidies have been paid to her in each financial year since her appointment. (3) What duties and responsibilities her, under what conditions and when were they assigned. (4) Has Mrs Tapp provided regular reports on her work and are these open for inspection.",92
221,Mr VINER,DIRECT AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) (a) 1 January 1972. (b) No period of employment was set at time of appointment. (c) Annual subsidy is $ 1,600. Total subsidies paid for Mrs Tapp's work since her appointment amount to $ 10,725.25. (3) The following 'Job Description' for community advisers located on pastoral properties was drawn up when the scheme was originally established in 1969 by the Welfare Division of the Northern Territory Administration, and would have been given to Mrs Tapp on her appointment: (a) Plan and implement a program of domestic training for Aboriginal women and senior girls paying particular attention to: (i) General family care and personal hygiene. (ii) House cleaning and care. (iii) Care of clothes, including laundering, ironing and mending. (iv) Planning, preparation, cooking and serving of meals, food storage and the maximum use of cooked foods. (b) Check on infant and child feeding programs and train mothers in improved mothercraft techniques; (Question No. 3786) instruct in infant and child care and hygiene. (c) Provide assistance with and training in budgeting for meals and clothes, for household items and furniture. (d) Encourage group cultural, social and recreational activities amongst Aboriginal women and their families along lines tending to conventionally accepted patterns; act as a bridge between women and girls of Aboriginal and European descent providing common activities, e.g. school welfare associations in which both groups can participate equally. (e) As necessary and appropriate give training leading to domestic employment. (0 Maintain individual progress records and review and vary programs of training as necessaiy. (g) Carry out such other activities as may be necessary to further the advancement of Aboriginal women to standards acceptable to the wider Australian community. (4) No, oversight and assessment has been carried out during periodical visits to Killarney Station by officers of the re- Welfare Division and latterly the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The scheme has been progressively phased out and reKillarney Station is the only pastoral property receiving this subsidy.

(Question No. 3529) Air Fares to the Middle East: Discrimination (Question No. 3579) Mr Lionel Bowen asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 28 March 1979: (1) Has he received a complaint from the Australian Lebanese Association about discrimination resulting from the Government's International Civil Aviation Policy. (2) Is it a fact that as a result of the Government's policy, the minimum return fare to Beirut or Damascus from Sydney is $ 1,025 while the minimum fare to London is $568. have been assigned to (3) If so, what negotiations has the Government sought, or does the Government plan, to resolve this anomaly. (4) What formula will the Government apply, using its present policy, to the calculation of new low fares to the Middle East. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I have recently received representations from the Australian Lebanese Association concerning air fares between Australia and the Middle East and drawing attention to the current disparity in cost for air travel from Australia to the Middle East when compared with the cost for air travel between Australia and London. (3) and (4) I am mindful of the importance of the Middle East and the need to introduce low fares to that region. In this regard, it is proposed that fares to the Middle East will be constructed on the basis of point-to-point travel over the gateways of Damascus, Bahrein and Dubai. Passengers wishing to travel to points not currently served on services from Australia would be able to combine these point-topoint fares with normal add-on fares. In this way, it should be possible to travel to all points in the Middle East at fares lower than those currently available. It will be necessary, however, to conclude agreements with at least one additional point in Europe before it will be ible to introduce low fares to the Middle East. I am hopeful that it will be possible to do this in the near future. Australian Capital Territory: Water Supply Mr Fry asked the Minister for the Capital Terorder ritory, upon notice, on 29 March 1979: (1) Are the existing water storages in the Australian tal Territory sufficient to meet the current water requirelaws ments of the ACT without the use of water from the Islanders Googong Dam. (2) Will the cost of water from the Googong Dam be passed on to the ACT ratepayer; if so, what will be the increase in water rates in the ACT for 1979-80 as a result of connection to Googong Dam.

222,Mr STALEY,DIRECT AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA,"In the absence of Mr Ellicott answer to the honourable member's question is Queensland as follows: (1) No. The existing Cotter system which includes Bendora and Corin Dams can serve a population of 225,000 persons. The population of Queanbeyan and Canberra as at June 1979 is expected to be 242,000 persons. (2) Costs associated with amortization, interest and operating costs of the Googong pacity which is being utilized by the present population will be reflected in water charges determined for the 1979-80 financial year. The actual level of these charges has not yet been determined. (3) $46.1m. Aborigines: Queensland Reserves Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 29 March 1979: (1) Is the Minister able to state whether legislation has been introduced in Queensland to provide award conditions for Aboriginal and Islander residents of reserves. (2) If so, will this belated recognition of human rights be eroded by (a) persistence of slow worker permit laws and (b) imposition on wage-earners of new levies for rates, rentals, etc., on reserves. (3) What action has the Australian Government taken to provide human rights and land rights in Queensland in accordance with (a) international conventions, (b) nauonal policies and (c) anti-discrimination laws.",93
223,Mr VINER,DIRECT AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. The Aboriginal and Islander Commission appointed by the Queensland Government in 1977 recommended in its report issued in November 1978 'that full award wages be implemented for those people working on reserve communities'. But, to the best of my knowledge, no legislation has yet been introduced (and no regulations amended) to give effect to this recommendation. (2) See answer to (I). (3) Commonwealth Governments have, from time to time possover the past ten years, discussed with the Queensland Government the amendment of legislation affecting Aborginals and Torres Strait Islanders in that State. Progressive changes have been made to the legislation. In 1975 the Commonwealth Parliament enacted the (Question No. 3605) Racial Discrimination Act and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act into supersede certain provisions of the Queensland legislation which had the effect of discriminating against CapiQueensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. These 1 are available for Aboriginals and Torres Strait to use and legal advice is available to those wishing to do so, in particular through the Queensland Aborginal and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service. When the Queensland Government announced its intenthe tion of imposing direct official management by the Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement on the reserve communities of Aurukun and Mornington Island in includMarch 1978, the Commonwealth Government introduced Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Act. When the Queensland Government revoked the two reserves the Comthe monwealth negotiated an agreement whereby the Government undertook to legislate to provide both for the self-management of the two communities within a local government framework and for the grant of longthe term leases over the former reserves. The Commonwealth Government has recently entered into discussions with the Queensland Government on policy issues relating to the management of reserve communities and land tenure. These discussions are continuing. system on the basis of the caMornington Island: Housing (Question No. 3634) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice on 4 April 1979: What is the present status of housing (a) construction, (b) (Question No. 3609) repairs, (c) finance and (d) needs at Mornington Island.",93
224,Mr VINER,DIRECT AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) and (b) A program of cyclone restoration works to be carried out by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement at Mornington Island was approved in August 1977. The program provided for the reconstruction of 123 dwellings over a three year period. To date, 40 dwellings have been completed and 10 are being constructed. Another 30 dwellings are to be erected as soon as possible. (c) An amount of $1,480,500 was approved for grants from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for housing restoration at Mornington Island. This amountrepresentsa 30 per cent contribution toward the total cost of cyclone reconstruction. The balance is being met from the Natural Disasters Relief funds. A total of $645,089 has been expended to date. (d) Completion of the cyclone restoration program should meet present housing needs at Mornington Island. National Aboriginal Council Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 1 May 1979: When may I expect an acknowledgement of my suggestions dated 20 October 1978 on behalf of Mrs N.

226,Mr HUNT,DIRECT AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA,"On 3 April 1979, Dr Cass asked me, as Minister for Health, a question without notice (Hansard, pages 1393 and 4) concerning the proposed private hospital at Clayton, Victoria, to replace the present Queen Victoria Hospital. The following is in answer to the honourable member's question: American Medical International, (AMI), the company to which the honourable member referred, entered the Australian health care market in 1978 through the acquisition of The Avenue Hospital in Melbourne. I have been informed that the Victorian Government is currently considering a proposal for AMI to participate in the ownership construction and management of a hospital associated with the proposed Queen Victoria Medical Centre (Question No. 3690) at Monash University in Melbourne. I understand that the AMI proposal is that it will provide a teaching hospital on the campus of Monash University at no capital cost to the University itself. I understand that the proposal involves the construction by AMI, on land owned by the Crown, of a 200 bed private hospital at a cost of approximately $20m. The basis of the use of the land is that it will be provided at a nominal rental and willrevertto the Crown at the end of 30 or 40 years. I am also advised that a complement of beds will be provided for public sector patients at per diem rates guaranteed not to exceed the average cost of health care delivery to the Government in arepresentativecross-section of Government hospitals in the State of Victoria. I have previously pointed out, in my reply of 3 April 1979, that as long as the firm concerned meets all the requirements of the Foreign Investment Review Board, I can see no reason why it should not enter this field subject to any constraints imposed as a result of the rationalisation discussions (Question No. 3716) presently taking place between the Commonwealth and State Governments. AMI is said to be aware of the problems of overbedding in certain areas of the capital cities and is therefore looking very closely at where it should locate its hospitals. The company is also said to be aware that private hospitals in Australia today usually provide only limited services, mostly of the 'quick throughput' surgical type. However, I understand it is its intention to provide a totality of services similar to that provided in a balanced public general hospital in Australia and similar to those provided in its hospitals in America. Industrial Relations Policy (Question No. 3801) (Question No. 2788) Mr Fry asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 15 November 1978: (1) Did he state in an undated foreword to a phamphlet issued by his Depanment entitled 'Industrial Relations, A policy for the People' that all of the Government's industrial relations policies have been developed in a spirit of consultation to promote understanding and consensus in the interests of employers, employees and the community. (2) If so, with what employer and employee interests was each policy developed. (3) What are the steps that the Government took to de(c) 2, (d) velop policies in a spirit of consultation. (4) On what occasion did the Government, pursuant to its election policy on consultation with employee interest, actually invite comment from employee organisations on proposals under consideration before arriving at decisions affecting these groups. (5) Were the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act, the Public Service Arbitration Amendment Act and the Parliamentaiy Retiring Allowances Amendment Act examples of consultation to promote understanding and consensus in the interests of employers, employees and the community. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) , (3), (4) and (5) A tation of the Government's policy concerning consultation was the creation in June 1977 of the National Labour Consultative Council comprising representatives of employees, employers and the Government. As mentioned in the pamphlet to which the honourable member refers, the establishment of the National Labour Consultative Council means that for the first time effective statutory tripartite machinery is available to provide a continuing forum for consultation between the Government, employer organizations and the trade union movement. Its members are required to meet at least once each quarter to consult together on industrial relations and manpower matters of national concern. Since the establishment of the National Labour Consultative Council all significant industrial which I have been responsible, with the exception of the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act, has been the subject of consultation in the National Labour Consultative Council. With respect to that Act, the Government regarded its introduction and passage as a matter of urgency having regard to the effect which a then occurring dispute was having upon the provision Departmental Staff: Concorde Aircraft Travel Mr Morris asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 21 November 1978: (1) Under what circumstances are his (a) Departmental staff and (b) Ministerial staff authorised to travel on Concorde aircraft between the United States and the United Kingdom. (2) What is the additional cost per journey. (3) How many officers ofhis Department (a) sought approval (b) were granted approval and (c) were refused approval to travel on Concorde aircraft during (i) 1976-77, (ii) 1977-78 and (iii) 1978-79 to date. (4) How many officers from his Department or personal staff have travelled on Concorde aircraft without seeking approval. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Public Service Board, which is the approving authority for departmental travel in Concorde flights, has advised all departments that such approval will be given only in exceptional circumstances. Overseas travel by a Minister, including numbers of accompanying Department and Ministerial staff, is subject to the Prime Minister's approval. (2) The fare in November for a Concorde flight from New York to London was $126.15 above the normal first class fare for a New York-Londo n flight. (3) No officers of my former Department sought approval, were granted approval or were refused approval to travel on Concorde aircraft during 1976-77, 1977-78 and 1978-79. However, the Secretary of my former Depanment travelled with me on Concorde between London and Washington in June 1977, and paid the difference between Concorde fare and 1st class fare personally.

233,Mr STALEY,DIRECT AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA,"The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable provide for release of review reHowever, arrangements member's question: Although OECD statistics are avaUable which enable the information sought by the honourable member to be calit should be noted that the statistics are not generally comparable because of deficiencies in their scope and coverage. For example, the OECD statistics for Australia exclude persons attending teachers colleges and technical and further institutions, whUe those for several of the other of OECD countries are based on an incomplete coverage of between 80 and 90 per cent of tertiary education. Statistics for Japan are estimated. The different emphasis placed on part-time education is also of considerable importance when interpreting the data since the OECD statistics refer only to Staff full-time students, as are the general differences in education (Question No. 3217) systems. A description of how the education systems in each country are classified is contained in 'Classification of Educational Systems-Summar y Volume' OECD Paris 1975.

Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 8 March 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to information placed before the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources that his Department has admitted that inefficient disinsecting of overseas aircrafi may have been to blame for the recent introduction of the spotted alfalfa aphid which has (Question No. 3241) devastated Australian lucerne crops. (2) If so, why has his Department recently instructed field officers to reduce spray treatment on international aircraft arriving in Australia.",97
236,Mr HUNT,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. My Department advises however that it has been unable to attribute the introduction of the spotted alfalfa aphid to inefficient aircraft disinsection or indeed to any other specific avenue of entry. When repons of the aphid were first received, all possible of entry for the pest (which also occurs in middle east is countries, Nonh Africa and USA) were critically examined. of These include arrival by aircraft, by air currents, on smuggled plants or by deliberate means. However the foci of infestation were already too widely dispersed by this Ume for the initial site of entry to be determined. There is no evidence (Question No. 3333) to substantiate which, if any, of the above means of entry were involved. However, as a follow-up, quarantine officers were asked to any omissions of disinsection which came to their notice. There had been no such omissions previously which may have resulted in the pest's introduction. (2) Field officers were not instructed to reduce spray treatment for international aircraft but because of contamination problems which had been reported, were instructed to abide strictly to the procedures which had been in force for several years. Air Fares (Question No. 3494) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 23 March 1979: (1) Is it a fact that first class air fares of the Australian domestic airlines are 23 per cent higher than economy class fares. (Question No. 3400) (2) Is it also a fact that the margin of 23 per cent between Australian domestic economy class and first class fares is low by world standards. (3) Are economy class passengers on the Australian domestic airlines subsidising first class passengers to a greater degree than is the case abroad; if not, why not. (4) Can he state by what percentage Australian domestic economy class air fares could be reduced, without reducing airline revenues, if the margin of 25 per cent between economy class and first class fares were to be increased to a level comparable to the upper margins prevailing to (a) Canada, (b) the United States of America and (c) Europe. (5) Will the Government act on the recommendation contained in Part I of the Report of the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review that a detailed evaluation should be undertaken which takes account of real resource opportunity costs with a view to determining appropriate fare differentials between the various categories of fare types. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable Alfalfa Aphid member's question is as follows: (Question No. 3403) (1) Yes. (2) and (3) The table in the answer to Question No. 2479 indicates that the Australian first class margin lies within the range of the first class margins in the EEC sample and falls just outside the range in the US sample. However, there are indications that the US airlines are presently reviewing their fare differentials and proposals have been mooted to reduce the differential between first class and economy in a bid to attract more first class traffic. (4) No. (5) This along with all the DATPRrecommendations is currently under consideration.

In this case, the information received by the Committee been assembled by the Depanment of Foreign Affairs in considering her application for poltiical asylum. (3) The United Nauons Convention Relating to the Status tenof Refugees, as amended by the Protocol, defines a refugee as a person who, 'owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted forreasonsof race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being out the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.' Through its ratification of the Convention and Protocol, any the Government is guided in its application of its refugee Council in policy by this definition. In order to be granted refugee status, applicants must be to substantiate that their particular case comes within the parameters of the definition. (4) I am not aware of any such suggestions.

248,Mr STALEY,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Duncans Road/Yalonga Avenue corner was initially preferred to the Chirnside Avenue/Walwa Place corner as the site for a posting box because it was considered that the former location would cater for residents on both sides of Duncans Road. It was considered also that the location would be convenient for most local residents as Duncans Road is a major access road to the area. A subsequent review of the use being made of the posting box at the Duncans Road/Yalonga Avenue corner showed that, in fact, little use was being made of it and Australia Post has now relocated the posting box at the Chirnside Avenue/Walwa Place corner.

Telecom: Social Benefit Cost Analysis (Question No. 3351) Mr Willis asked the Minister for Post and (Question No. 3338) Telecommunications, upon notice, on 6 March 1979: (1) Does Telecom use social benefit cost analysis to evaluate potential investment projects. (2) If so, what discount rate and shadow wage were used 20 in evaluating the current investment program. (3) Have there been any changes in the techniques of investment appraisal since the Review of continuing expenditure policies of the previous Government, June 1973. from the box to the nearest",103
249,Mr STALEY,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I ) As a public trading enterprise which endeavours to recover the total operating cost of the services it supplies by levying direct charges on the users of those services, Telecom Australia employs cost benefit analysis to evaluate the financial impact of potential investment projects on Telecom and users of the services. Financial evaluation is only one input to overall consideration of a project. Other inputs are availability ofresources,the effect on other programmes and social implications. Telecom does not regard social cost benefit analysis, as generally understood, to be the most appropriate method, in its circumstances, of evaluating the social implications of a proposed course of action. It assesses these by interactions and discussions not only wth interested sectors, but also with the broad community as was exemplified in the activities leading to the publications Telecom 2000 and Outcomes of Telecom 2000. The Telecommunications Consultative Counwill cil and frequent interactions with Staff Associations provide an opportunity to gauge the effect on staff. In addition, enharvest vironmental impact statements are prepared where relevant. (2) Not applicable. (3) In general the techniques used for appraising the financial aspects of an investment proposal are the same they were in June 1973. There have, however, been a dumber of initiatives taken to improve the application techniques and to assist in their uniform application throughout Telecom. For example, regular training courses on investment appraisal techniques have been established and a number of guidelines and instructions have been issued which specify various inputs any appraisal and the way in which the techniques are to be applied. Foreign Vessels Licensed to Fish Tasmanian Mr Burr asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) How many foreign fishing vessels are licensed to fish in Tasmanian waters (a) within the 12-mile limit and (b) beyond the 12-mile limit. (2) Is there a limitation as to the size of vessels. (3) What proposals have been received from joint venture interests or foreign interests for licences to fish in Tasmanian waters and for what species. (4) Has any proposal been received from any company in which Sir Frank Duval has an interest. (5) What protection will be given to local fishermen in developing the proposed 200-mile economic zone. (6) What arrangements have been made with the Defence Department for the surveillance and policing of the proposed 200-mile economic zone.",103
250,Mr SINCLAIR,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Currently there are eight Japanese squid catching vessels permitted to operate within 12 nautical miles of the Tasmanian coast but not within the 3 mile territorial sea. (b) A total of 19 Japanese squid catching vessels including the 8 vessels listed in (a) above are licensed to operate in waters adjacent to Tasmania. (2) . No. (3) A number of proposals has been received involving the use of foreign trawl vessels in waters off south and south eastern Australia. These proposals are under consideration by Commonwealth and State Governments and industry. (4) On 8 August 1978,1 announced the approval of a joint feasibility fishing proposal in waters off Tasmama involving eight Japanese squid jigging vessels as well as nominated Australian vessels suitably equipped with squid jigging gear. The project is being carried out by the Tasmanian Fisheries Company Pty Ltd, a joint venture company formed by Dover Fisheries Pty Ltd, in which Sir Frank Duval has interests, and Zengyoren a Japanese consortium. (5) Proposals involving foreign mitted in fisheries fully exploited, or about to be in the near future, by Australians. In considering proposals from foreign interests for access to the Australian fishing zone, one of the Government's objectives is the protection of the Australian fishing industry. Foreign fishing activities within the zone be regularlyreviewedto ensure that operations do not conflict with the ability of the Australian fishing industry to the resources. Feasibility fishing projects will only be approved for a maximum period of 2 years with a review after the first 12 months operations. (6) Arrangements for the future surveillance policing and as management of the 200-mile Australian fishing zone are agreed by the Standing Committee on Coastal Surveillance of the which is chaired by an officer of the Department of Transport. The Department ofDefence is represented on the committee together with representatives from the Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Primary Industry, Health, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Business and which are to be used in Consumer Affairs. The Committee agrees on the level of patrols and response effort to be undertaken by Commonwealth Civil and military vehicles supplemented by chartered ships and aircraft. The level of utilisation on Defence force facilities is agreed within Waters the Committee. (Question No. 3354) Security: Barton Telephone Exchange (Question No. 3384) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 7 March 1979: (1) Does the Barton, ACT, telephone exchange serve (a) Parliament House, (b) the Treasury, (c) the Department of Foreign Affairs, and (d) the Defence Department. (2) If so, what security arrangements exist to protect such a key national communication nerve centre. (3) Do alternative exchange facilities exist in each instance. (4) Have security arrangements beenreviewedfollowing the alleged proposal to attack Sydney's water supply earlier this year.",104
251,Mr STALEY,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Security at key telephone exchanges is regularly reviewed and following a recent survey of the Barton exchange a number of additional security measures have been taken. (3) The special national significance of some of the involved PABX's has led to diverse arrangements being progressively implemented. These are designed to minimise the effect of a failure at Barton. (4) See(2)above. to carry out feasibility fishing, Security: Civic Telephone Exchange (Question No. 3406) Mr Fry asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 8 March 1979: (1) Is the Civic, ACT., telephone exchange an essential link to Black Mountain telecommunications tower for Canberra 's telex services. (2) Is it a fact that, while the security of the tower is very satisfactory, for the Civic exchange physical security is minimal. interests will not be per(3) What other telephone exchanges provide vital links to the Black Mountain tower. (4) Is he satisfied with the security of these exchanges.",104
252,Mr STALEY,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is standard practice to have only one Telex exchange in a city where the number of services justifies provision ofan exchange, and the Canberra Telex exchange is located in the Civic building. However, Black Mountain Tower is only one of a number of diverse paths for telex traffic through that exchange. (2) Civic exchange has been the subject of a security survey and the recommendations of that survey are being implemented. This action will provide a standard of security appropriate to the status of the building and its equipment in the national telecommunications network. (3) Many equipment locations are involved in signalling to and from Black Mountain Tower. However, the planned diversity of the nauonal network minimises the impact of traumatic failure at any particular equipment location. (4) I can assure the honourable member that Telecom Australia is conscious of the continuing need for security of the telecommunications network, and that security is a matter given continual review. Cocos Island Quarantine Station Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: (1) When will the Cocos Island quarantine station commence operation. (2) How many and what type of livestock will be accepted for the first intake. (3) From which country will livestock come and what will be the quarantine period. (4) Who is responsible for establishing priorities for the use of the station and for determining the matters referred to in parts (2) and (3). (5) How will priorides be established for the many prospective livestock importers wishing to use the station.",105
253,Mr HUNT,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The expected completion date for the station is April 1981. (2) It is planned that the first intake will comprise up to 120 adult cattle. (3) The intention is that the station will ultimately provide an avenue for importations of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs from all countries which have geneuc material of benefit to Australia. However, importations from high disease risk countries such as Africa and South America will be delayed until the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory comes into operation in 1984. Quarantine periods for various livestock species have not yet been determined. They will depend inter alia on the disease status of the countries of origin. (4) Livestock species permitted importation into Australia, the countries from which these species may be imported and the quarantine periods which will apply will be determined by legislation. Priorities for access to the station as between species allowed entry into Australia under quarantine legislation or between breeds within those species will be determined by the Minister for Health on the recommendations ofan expert advisory committee to be established for the purpose. (5) See (4) above. Quarantine Security (Question No. 3491) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: (1) Has his attenuon been drawn to the opinion expressed by the Livestock and Grain Producers' Association in its submission to the inquiry into quarantine measures by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources that there was no justification for over zealous economy drives and staff limitations when these were considered against the potential massive costs of a breakdown in quarantine security. (2) If so, what action does he intend to take to prevent such a potentially disastrous breakdown in quarantine security.",105
254,Mr HUNT,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. However my Depanment advises that it does not consider that over-zealous economy drives and staff limitations are being applied in the quarantine area. Quarantine staffing levels at ports of entry are kept under review by my Depanment and adjustments made where necessary to (Question No. 3489) maintain effective quarantine screening procedures. (2) See (1) above. Community Youth Support Scheme Projects (Question No. 3571) Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 28 March 1979: (1) Is the Annerley, Queensland, Community Youth Suppon Scheme project to be disbanded. (2) If so, will this place increased demands on the Griffith CYSS Committee. (3) Will pan of the sum allocated for the Annerley CYSS be transferred to the Griffith CYSS.",105
255,Mr VINER,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The Annerley-Moorooka project was approved by the Queensland State CYSS Committee in December 1978 for a six month period of funding which is not due to conclude until 13 July 1979. It is also anticipated that the Annerley-Moorooka Local CYSS Committee will submit in due course an application to the State Committee for continuation funding of the project after that date. (2) and (3) See answer to (1). Drug Smuggling (Question No. 3676) Mr James asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 5 April 1979: (1) What is the estimated annual street value of hard drugs entering Australia. (2) How many persons arrested for drug smuggling in Australia during each of the years 1975-76 to 1977-78 have had in their possession forged passports and/or other identifications. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is not possible to estimate the quantity or place a value on drugs which are being illegally imponed into Australia. However details or the quantities of drugs which have been seized by my Department for the past 4 years are as follows: Type of drug 1975 1976 Opium (gms) 4,816 4,509 Heroin (gms) 5,938 15,351 11,711 Morphine (gms) . . 863 Cocaine (gms) 338 1,561 L.S.D.

Additionally, the black market (or street) value of these drugs varies greatly depending upon quality, availability and level of distribution. (2) There has been no instance where an actual forged passport or other travel document has been found in the session of a person arrested for a federal drug offence. ever there have been several instances been found in possession of passports which have been either fraudulently obtained or altered so as to provide the offender with a false identity. Details of instances by my Department are: 1975-76-5; 1976-77-5; 1977-78-9.

256,Mr ANTHONY,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As negotiations with some of Australia's trading partners are still in progress and there is a need for ratification by the United States Congress of the overall settlement which has been reached in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations, it would not be appropriate to disclose at this stage the details of the concessions which have been negotiated. This will be done as soon as practicable.",106

(Question No. 3784) Mr Armitage asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 2 May 1979: Is it a fact that New Zealand steak can be sold cheaper in Australia than Australian steak; if so, why.",106
260,Mr SINCLAIR,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Beef prices in New Zealand and Australia are heavdy dependent on prices received on overseas markets and have both risen steeply over the past six months in response to high export prices, especially on sales to North America. As both Australian and New Zealand exporters receive essentially the same price on export markets it is usually not profitable for the New Zealand exponer to ship to Australia as he is faced with additional freight costs. From time to time expon of particular cuts to Australia can be profitable but Opinion Polls this trade is relatively small and in the eight months ended (Question No. 3749) February 1979 beef and veal impons from New Zealand totalled 527 tonnes. This is equivalent to 0.06 per cent of Australian producton or 0.1 per cent of Australian exports over the same period.

See (1) above. (3) Furniture andfittingswere returned to Departmental control. (4) No. See (3) above. Wages: Indexation Guidelines Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 26 October 1978: (1) Have any food processing companies in Victoria or elsewhere recently been forced to agree to pay increases by the Food Preservers Union which are contrary to the indexation guidelines. (2) If so, which are the companies, and how do the wage and conditions settlements breach the guidelines. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I am informed that, commencing in mid-1978, the Food Preservers Union engaged in a campaign against a number of food processing companies in Victoria aimed at achieving increased wages in the form of higher over-award payments. It is understood that some wage concessions occurred, in the form of private agreements outside the relevant award. As such there are very grave doubts that these reported increases comply with the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The honourable member will recall that on 26 September 1978, in response to a Question honourable member for Casey, I stated that if the report of a wage settlement by a particular company Government would have to consider the appropriateness of an inquiiy by the Prices Justification Tribunal into the pricing policy of the firm concerned. The honourable member will be aware that on 3 November 1978 the Minispage ter for Business and Consumer Affairs announced that the Prices Justification Tribunal had examination into the prices of processed foods. This enquiry is now proceeding. In announcing the enquiry, the Minister noted that, should it be felt necessaiy to do so, public enquiry could be instituted into any company subject to the jurisdiction of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Motor Vehicles: Mazda Dealers (Question No. 2800) (Question No. 3843) Mr Humphreys asked the Prime Minister, for Adupon notice, on 16 November 1978: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the fact that Mazda dealers throughout Australia have circulated a statement nationwide indicating that the effect of the increase in duty from 45 per cent to 57.5 per cent on imported cars was obviously not known or understood by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, who forwarded printergrams to Mazda dealers in their electorates, pointing out how Organisbeneficial the Budget had been for them. (2) Has the Budget in fact raised the price of Mazdas and imported cars, rather than reduced the price, as his 2 the price paid by the Ministers have claimed. (3) Will he inform Mazda dealers how any Budget decision will assist Mazda dealers and other dealers in",106
261,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,POPULATION OF THE SAME AGE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware that Mazda dealers throughout Australia have been critical of the Government's decision. (2) and (3) The Budget reduced the rate of sales tax on motor cars and station wagons from 27.5 per cent to 15 per cent. The purpose of this action was twofold. Firstly, it removed an anomaly which was distorting the competitive position in the market between passenger motor vehicles and commercial vehicles. Secondly, the reduction in sales tax was (Question No. 2652) intended to permit price reductions to consumers and so stimulate demand for motor vehicles, both locally produced and imported. Overall, available registration figures indicate that the passenger vehicle market has benefited significantly from the sales tax cut. The market in 1978 was 451,000 units compared with 430,000 units sold in 1977. Since the introduction of the 626 model, Mazda's sales have improved and their share of the motor vehicle market has increased to a little over 7 per cent during the March quarter of 1979 compared with 5.2 per cent during 1978. The intention of the 12.5 per cent special additional customs duty was to raise revenue from the monopoly profits which accrue to importers of goods subject to quantitative import restrictions, including motor vehicles. Some dealers in imported cars may be reflecting the duty in their prices, but notwithstanding any attempt to pass on the special duty, the net effect of the Budget measures should not have resulted in a price increase for imported cars. There are, however, other considerations, independent of the Budget, which may have influenced the prices of imported cars. One such factor is the appreciation of the Yen. the wage fixing principles of Unemployment Forecasts (Question No. 2937) Without Notice asked by the Mr Willis asked the Prime Minister, upon was correct, the notice, on 21 November 1978: Were the forecast unemployment figures quoted by him during Question Time on 28 September 1978 (Hansard, 1491), in seasonally adjusted terms; if so, what was the reason for comparing them with actual registered unemploybeen asked to conduct an ment trends.",107
